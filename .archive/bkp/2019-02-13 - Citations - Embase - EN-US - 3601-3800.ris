N2  - The experience of pregnancy and motherhood is a complex event in which individual, social, and cultural factors interact to produce different levels of adaptation to the new role as a parent. In this study, we analyzed the narratives of 52 mothers with infants aged 2 months to identify the main sources of stress across the period of pregnancy, delivery, andpost-partum, and the emotional states remembered by the mothers in relation to these periods. A thematic analysis revealed that during pregnancy, mothers were especially concerned about prenatal screening, whereas delivery was considered as a relatively stressful, but natural event marked by mixed feelings, ranging from anxiety and fear to positive excitement and joy. For these mothers, the most critical phase was the post-partum period at home, during which they faced a number of adaptation tasks mainly related to the assumption of the parental role and the restructuring of daily routines. More specifically, reported problems included breast-feeding, painful aftereffects of delivery, lack of sleep, emotional instability, difficulties in managing the household and the family, and inexperience with babies, especially in primiparous mothers who could not rely on an effective social support. These results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications.

N2  - Evidence is accumulating for significant structural and functional changes within the central nervous system (CNS) following prenatal protein malnutrition. Included among the structures that are likely to be affected are the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) involved in the regulation of locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycle, and drinking behavior. To determine the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on the spontaneous activity rhythm, 24 h radiotelemetric measurements were recorded over an 8-day period. Male offspring of rats provided with protein-deficient (6% casein) or adequate (25% casein) diets for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were studied. Well nourished rats displayed a rise in activity level during the first hour of the 12 h light phase, whereas prenatally malnourished rats displayed this increase during the 12 h dark phase, approximately 50 min before lights on, reflecting a significant phase advance in this group. In addition, cosinor analysis revealed that the alpha/rho relationship was affected in the previously malnourished group, the activity phase being shorter than in the well-nourished animals. These findings suggest changes in the regulatory systems controlling the locomotor activity rhythm as a consequence of prenatal protein malnutrition. Alterations in entrainment to the light-dark cycle, and/or in the coupling force of the circadian oscillators are all candidate mechanisms. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

N2  - Eighty pregnant women were assessed for depression during mid-pregnancy (Mean gestational age = 25.9 weeks) and shortly after delivery in order to assess the effects of the onset and chronicity of maternal depression on neonatal behavior. The women were classified as reporting depressive symptoms: (1) only during the prepartum assessment; (2) only during the postpartum assessment; (3) during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments; or (4) reporting no depressive symptoms at either the prepartum or the postpartum assessment. Neonates born to mothers reporting symptoms of depression at any time point exhibited greater indeterminate sleep than neonates of non-depressed mothers. Neonates born to mothers reporting prenatal depression spent more time fussing and crying and exhibited more stress behaviors than neonates born to non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression only during the postpartum assessment. Finally, neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments exhibited less optimal Brazelton neurobehavioral assessment scores than neonates of non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers who exhibited symptoms of depression during only the prepartum or only during the postpartum assessments. Taken together these findings suggest that neonatal behavior is influenced not just by the presence but also by the timing and duration of maternal depression symptoms. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The initial diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the United States was made because of the facial features common to the first cohort of patients. This article reviews the development of an FAS mouse model whose craniofacial features are remarkably similar to those of affected humans. The model is based on short-term maternal treatment with a high dosage of ethanol at stages of pregnancy that are equivalent to Weeks 3 and 4 of human gestation. At these early stages of development, alcohol's insult to the developing face is concurrent with that to the brain, eyes, and inner ear. That facial and central nervous system defects consistent with FAS can be induced by more "realistic" alcohol dosages as illustrated with data from an oral alcohol intake mouse model in which maternal blood alcohol levels do not exceed 200 mg/dl. The ethanol-induced pathogenesis involves apoptosis that occurs within 12 hrs of alcohol exposure in selected cell populations of Day 7, 8, and 9 mouse embryos. Experimental evidence from other species also shows that apoptosis underlies ethanol-induced malformations. With knowledge of sensitive and resistant cell populations at specific developmental stages, studies designed to identify the basis for these differing cellular responses and, therefore, to determine the primary mechanisms of ethanol's teratogenesis are possible. For example, microarray comparisons of sensitive and resistant embryonic cell populations have been made, as have in situ studies of gene expression patterns in the populations of interest. Studies that illustrate agents that are effective in diminishing or exacerbating ethanol's teratogenesis have also been helpful in determining mechanisms. Among these agents are antioxidants, sonic hedgehog protein, retinoids, and the peptides SAL and NAP. Copyright © 2005 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

N2  - Background: The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been falling in Germany over the last decade. However, little is known about the prevalence and the importance of well-known risk factors in Germany since a local prevention campaign in 1992. Design: A 3-y, population-based, case-control study was conducted in half of Germany, consisting of 333 cases. All sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy, if they fitted the inclusion criteria, were included in the study. Parental interview was carried out soon after the death, and three living control infants, matched for age, gender, region and sleep time, were recruited. Results: The prevalence of placing infants prone to sleep was only 4% in the control group, but this was associated with a markedly increased risk of SIDS (adjusted odds ration, aOR = 6.08). Other modifiable risk factors for SIDS were: maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding for less than 2 wk (aOR = 1.71) and co-sleeping (aOR = 2.71), while using a pacifier during the last sleep reduced the risk (aOR = 0.39). Conclusions: Previously recognized risk factors for SIDS also occur in Germany. Despite knowledge about the major modifiable risk factors for SIDS, these factors are still present in Germany. To reduce the incidence of SIDS in Germany, a continued effort is needed to inform all parents about preventable risk factors for SIDS. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To examine how sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms of Japanese parents are related to their sleeping arrangements before and after the birth of their first child. Design: Prospective longitudinal, time-series methods. Setting: Participants' homes in four geographical areas of Japan. Participants: Convenience sample of 101 Japanese first-time parent couples who completed antepartum and postpartum questionnaires. Main outcome measures: 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm from 7-day logs at 32 to 36 weeks gestation and 4 to 5 weeks postpartum and daily social rhythm from Monk's Social Rhythm Metric. Results: Mothers' total sleep time and activity level decreased after birth. Social rhythms became less regular for mothers and more consistent and regular for fathers. Although sleeping arrangement had no effect on parents' daily social rhythms, it had a Significant effect on the 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm. Regularity of sleep-wake rhythms was more prominent for fathers sleeping with mother and baby than for fathers sleeping alone. Conclusions: Couples having their first child face great changes in their sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms. Nurses can counsel expectant parents to think about their sleeping habits and social activities and assist them in making informed decisions about the best sleeping arrangement during transition to parenthood.

N2  - A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine the associations of sleep quality and stage of illness with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected African-American women. Participants were recruited from 12 health clinics and AIDS service organizations (ASO) in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The sample consisted of 144 African-American women who ranged in age from 20 to 48 years (m=34.8, SD=6.8). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. Participants were categorized as good sleepers (PSQI global score <7) or poor sleepers (PSQI global score ≥ 7) using the median global sleep quality score. Differences in HRQOL between good and poor sleepers, as measured by the SF-36, were tested using MANOVA. Good sleepers scored significantly higher (p < 0.0001) for each SF-36 quality of life dimension and the mental and physical health summary scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep quality is associated with HRQOL, independent of the individual's stage of illness, more so with mental HRQOL than with physical HRQOL. The results suggest that treatment for poor sleep quality should be a primary concern for the treatment of HIV infection and a means for improving HRQOL. © Springer 2005.

N2  - Objective: Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is known to be elevated in serum of patients with preeclampsia, but there are no data available on the significance of urinary VCAM-1 excretion in preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to ascertain their relation to blood pressure. Study design: A total of 10 normotensive and 10 preeclamptic pregnant women were included in this study. Venous blood was collected hourly, and urine samples were taken every 2 h over a period of 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. We compared these results with the circadian blood pressure rhythm. Results: The median VCAM-1 plasma levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5 ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a typical circadian rhythm, with a higher excretion rate during daytime. Conclusion: For the first time we have demonstrated that urinary VCAM-1 excretion in pregnancy shows a circadian rhythm without correlation to plasma levels or the circadian blood pressure rhythm. In contrast, VCAM-1 serum levels did not show a diurnal rhythm. We assume that VCAM-1 serum levels do not correlate with systemic blood pressure or urinary excretion.

N2  - A review of the literature shows that maternal or paternal smoking during pregnancy has many effects on the newborn, the infant, and even the adult exposed during intrauterine life. In the newborn, measurements at birth are lower than those observed in non-exposed newborns and the risk of preterm birth is increased. There is also a slightly increased risk of cleft lip or palate. Newborns exposed to smoking also suffer from altered vascular and pulmonary function and have a different neurological behavior. They react less well to stress. The risk of sudden infant death is significantly increased among exposed infants, especially if they sleep with their parents. The overall mortality of exposed infants is higher. Mid- and long-term consequences are more difficult to evaluate due to the very large number of confounding factors. There is however an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and a slightly decreased cognitive level in childhood and adulthood. The risks of hyperactivity disorder with attentional deficit, behavioral disorders, delinquency, and childhood and adolescence smoking are increased as are the risks of obesity, respiratory disorders and infection. Conversely, there is no demonstrated link with childhood cancer. © MASSON, 2005.

N2  - Recent campaigns on having infants sleep on their back has decreased the rate of sudden infant death. Other risk factors have also been identified, including maternal smoking during pregnancy. While many studies have methodological biases, most demonstrate a two to three-fold increase in the risk of sudden infant death among mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The effect of smoking is basically caused by nicotine which is toxic for the brain. This compound has specific trophicity for the respiratory centers rich in nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Deficiencies which could result could lead to greater vulnerability of the infant to episodes of hypoxia. The risk would be dose dependent and more marked in women smoking more than nine cigarettes per day. After birth, certain factors would increase the risk, including passive smoking and sleeping in the mother's bed. © MASSON, 2005.

N2  - Withdrawal symptoms are encountered with both the classical antidepressants, i.e. the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamineoxidase inhibitors, the modern antidepressants, i.e. the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and the new antidepressants such as venlafaxine and mirtazapine. The symptoms that are reported following the withdrawal of these drugs can be classified into 8 groups: influenza-like symptoms, psychic symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disorders, equilibrium disorders, sensory disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms and other symptoms. It is characteristic of these symptoms that they appear 1-4 days after reduction of the dose or the last administration of the drug. They may also appear in the infants of mothers who used an antidepressant during the last phase of the pregnancy. It is important that the patient be informed accurately and carefully at the start and termination of any treatment with an antidepressant. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is advisable to reduce the dosage slowly if possible when the treatment is to be terminated.

N2  - Background and purpose: To examine whether snoring and sleepiness are linked in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Patients and methods: We recruit ed 167 healthy and 82 pre-eclamptic women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 160 non-pregnant women. Subjects and their partners completed a sleep questionnaire. Height, weight, neck circumferences and blood pressure were recorded for all. Results: Pregnant and pre-eclamptic women were (mean ±SD) 36±3.6 and 36±3 weeks pregnant, respectively. Age and height did not differ significantly between groups (P>0.2), but pre-eclamptic women were heavier than pregnant and non-pregnant women and had higher BMI than pregnant women before pregnancy (all P<0.05). Thirty-two percent of control, 55% of pregnant and 85% of pre-eclamptic women snored (P<0.001), but pre-pregnancy snoring rates (pre-eclamptic=36%, healthy pregnant women=27%) were similar to those in non-pregnant women (32%) (P>0.7). Sleepiness was reported by 12% of non-pregnant, 23% of pregnant and 15% of pre-eclamptic women (P<0.04), but non-pregnant women had lower mean Epworth Sleepiness scores than both pregnant and pre-eclamptic groups (P<0.001). Snoring was correlated with (P=0.002), but explained only <2%, of the variance in sleepiness. Conclusion: Snoring and sleepiness increased in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly in patients with pre-eclampsia. However, the study suggests that sleepiness in pregnancy is largely due to factors other than snoring or breathing pauses. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Obesity continues to plague our society in epidemic proportions. Surgery for morbid obesity is considered by many as the most effective therapy for this complex disorder. Today, multiple surgical procedures for the treatment of obesity are available. As with most procedures, there are benefits and risks associated with open and laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery, as well as with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and partial biliopancreatic bypass with a duodenal switch. The risks and complications associated with bariatric surgery may be serious and in some cases life threatening. However, surgery for obesity has shown remarkable results in helping patients to achieve significant long-term weight control. In addition, it is associated with improvement and often resolution of co-morbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, obesity hypoventilation, sleep apnea, venous stasis disease, pseudotumor cerebri, polycystic ovary syndrome, complications of pregnancy and delivery, gastroesophageal reflux disease, stress urinary incontinence, degenerative joint disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

N2  - The aim of this article is to study the psychological effects of antenatal diagnosis on increased nuchal translucency on a woman's pregnancy experience and early mother-child relationship. The study group was composed of pregnant women whose fetus presented increased nuchal translucency at first trimester ultrasound examinations. These women consulted a pedopsychiatrist during their pregnancy and, for some, during the first years of the life of the child. One of the main risks was disinterest in the fetus, with the possible corollary of therapeutic abortion or a difficult mother-child relationship. We observed cases of attachment disorders, significant separation distress, excessive fear about dealing with the baby's health, sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Postnatal depression was more frequent in these situations. Multidisciplinary work associating psychiatric, obstetric and pediatric units can help in dealing with such uncertainty.

N2  - Background: Major depression is a subtype of depression. Application of thymoleptics alone has bad effect. It has shown from relevant studies abroad that application of fluoxetine combined with atypical antipsychotic drugs maybe an effective treating strategy. Objective: To observe the curative effects of fluoxetine combined with olanzapine and the time of its taking effect. Design: Comparative study of open clinical test with completely random sampling for the first visit outpatients. Setting: A psychological consulting clinic in a hospital of a Military Medical College of Chinese PLA. Participants: Totally 140 patients visiting, psychological counseling outpatient clinic in the hospital were collected from January 2004 to August 2004. Inclusion criteria: According to the diagnostic criterion of depression of CCMD-3, patients with total scores of 17 items in Hamilton depression rating scale ≥ 28 and age ≥ 18 years old. Exclusion criteria: 1 slight to middle degree of depression (HAMD ≤ 27); 2 secondary depression; 3 convalescent period of schizophrenia and other affective disorder caused by psychosis; 4 severe or unstable body diseases, including diseases of liver, kidney, cardiac vessel, respiration, gastro-intestine, endocrine, nervous system, immune system or hematological system, etc. 5 drug or alcohol addict; 6 women in pregnancy and lactation. Totally 110 patients accorded with the inclusive criteria. Among them, there were 40 males and 70 females with the course of disease for 4 months to 5 years, aged 18 to 63 with the average (37 ± 12) years old. They all took part in the trial voluntarily. According to the date of admittance, they were divided into odd-numbered date alprazolam group in which there were 55 patients with 21 males and 34 females and double date olanzapine group in which there were 55 patients with 19 males and 36 females. Methods: The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the date of admittance. Odd-numbered date group was alprazolam group. 0.4 mg alprazolam was given every noon and before sleep and 20 mg fluoxetine was given at a draught after breakfast every day. Even-numbered date group was olanzapine group. 2.5 mg olanzapine was given before sleep every day and 20 mg fluoxetine was given at a draught after breakfast every day. The course of treatment was 6 weeks. HAMD and HAMA scores of taken were evaluated respectively before and at the end of 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th week. Reducing score rate was used to decide effective time. Lost rate was presented as percentage. And improvement of sleep factor and somatization factor in HAMD were observed before therapy and at every observing time period after therapy. Main outcome measures: Terminus index: Comparison of HAMD, HAMA score in the two groups before therapy and at the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th weekend after therapy. Scores of sleep factor and anxiety somatization factor of HAMD at every observing time period in the two groups. Substitution index: lost rate in the two groups. Reducing score rate at every observing time period in the two groups. Results: Lost rate in olanzapine group was significantly lower than that in alprazolam group(P < 0.05) and the effect was taken at 1 week after therapy (excellence rate 67%). But, scores of HAMD and HAMA at every observing time period in olanzapine group were significant lower than those in alprazolam group(P < 0.01) and sleep factor and somatization factor at every observing time period improved more significantly than those of alprazolam group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Small amount of olanzapine combined with fluoxetine used to treat major depression of the patients can improve sleep and anxiety body symptoms rapidly and then elevate their living quality significantly.

N2  - Pregnant women may sleep in the streets or find refuge in places not suited to their condition. These women often attend prenatal visits late, and rarely voluntarily. Appropriate maternity beds are not always available. After giving birth, these women must bring up their children in difficult conditions. There is a shortage of shelter structures. Clandestines are in an inextricable situation.

N2  - In mammals, the vast majority of dietary tryptophan is metabolized via the kynurenine pathway (KP), which is initiated by the oxidative opening of the indole ring and eventually produces the ubiquitous enzyme cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Several neuroactive intermediates are yielded with the degradation of triptophan by this pathway, including the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid, and the NMDA and α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. The kynurenine pathway may play a role in certain physiological functions such as behaviour, sleep, thermoregulation and pregnancy. Furthermore, the kynurenine pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cerebral diseases including the AIDS dementia complex, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer, epilepsy, Down syndrome, septicemia-related encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, malaria, and certain inflammatory brain diseases, as well as in traumatic brain injury. New pharmacological agents designed to manipulate concentrations of kynurenine pathway intermediates may prove to be new therapeutic vectors in the treatment of these disorders.

N2  - Background: Parental smoking and prone sleep positioning are recognized causal features of Sudden Infant Death. This study quantifies the relationship between prenatal smoking and infant death over the time period of the Back to Sleep campaign in the United States, which encouraged parents to use a supine sleeping position for infants. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized the Colorado Birth Registry. All singleton, normal birth weight infants born from 1989 to 1998 were identified and linked to the Colorado Infant Death registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between outcomes of interest and prenatal maternal cigarette use. Potential confounders analyzed included infant gender, gestational age, and birth year as well as maternal marital status, ethnicity, pregnancy interval, age, education, and alcohol use. Results: We analyzed 488,918 birth records after excluding 5835 records with missing smoking status. Smokers were more likely to be single, non-Hispanic, less educated, and to report alcohol use while pregnant (p <0.001). The study included 598 SIDS cases of which 172 occurred in smoke-exposed infants. Smoke exposed infants were 1.9 times (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) more likely to die of SIDS. The attributed risk associating smoking and SIDS increased during the study period from approximately 50% to 80%. During the entire study period 59% (101/172) of SIDS deaths in smoke-exposed infants were attributed to maternal smoking. Conclusions: Due to a decreased overall rate of SIDS likely due to changing infant sleep position, the attributed risk associating maternal smoking and SIDS has increased following the Back to Sleep campaign. Mothers should be informed of the 2-fold increased rate of SIDS associated with maternal cigarette consumption. © 2005 Anderson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - A huge amount of knowledge about sleep has accumulated during the last 5 decades following the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nevertheless, there are numerous areas of considerable ignorance. One of these concerns the particularities of sleep in women. Most basic and clinical studies have been performed in male subjects, and only very recently research groups around the world have addressed women's sleep in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on the influence of oestrogens on the brain and on the distinctive changes of sleep across the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause. In addition, studies in female rodents are reviewed as well as the knowledge on female peculiarities regarding the interactions between sleep regulation and age-related changes in circadian rhythms. We also address specific aspects of sleep loss and sleep disorders in women. Finally, very recent studies on the sociology of sleep are summarized and future directions in the field are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian (∼24-hour), circamensual (∼monthly), and circannual (∼yearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche, reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and non-prescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs. evening) of drug use. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background: In a new preparation of prenatal multivitamins, PregVit®, two tablets a day (a.m. and p.m.) are given. Folic acid is separated from iron and zinc and is given in the p.m. tablet to overcome problems due to folic acid interactions with iron or zinc, and frequent presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in the morning. The circadian variation of folate in humans has not been investigated. This is the first study attempting to determine whether circadian variation of folate pharmacokinetics exists in humans. Objectives: To determine whether circadian rhythm of folate pharmacokinetics exists in humans. Methods: In a crossover design, six healthy, non-pregnant women were randomized to receive 1 tablet of PregVit® p.m., containing 1.1 mg of folic acid, in the morning or evening. Serum folate levels were measured over 10 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was used to compare the extent of absorption between the two time periods. Results: The mean AUC values for serum folate after administration of PregVit® p.m. were 334.5 ± 119.6 nM*h and 283.1 ± 64.3 nM*h for morning and evening, respectively (P = 0.17). The morning and evening peak serum folate concentrations were also similar (135.3 ± 41.7 nM and 130.3 ± 14.2 nM, respectively) (P = 0.75). Similarly, the time to peak for the morning arm (1 ± 0.5 hour) was similar to evening administration (1 ± 0.4 hour). Conclusions: There is no evidence of circadian variation in folate pharmacokinetics. Thus, the introduction of folate in PregVit® p.m. will not affect its effectiveness as compared to its routine administration in the morning. © 2005 Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology.

N2  - Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI). However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3 ± 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578 ± 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms2) was calculated for the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036-0.146 Hz), high frequency domain (HF: 0.146-0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036-2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio and an increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals were observed at 1 month, consistent with expression of respiratory vagal activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand, the LF/HF ratio increased, indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic regulation, independent of the SAN.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor among pregnant women. Methods: Patients participating in research projects involving ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pregnancy (N = 110) were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to patient satisfaction on completion of the monitoring period. The first part of the questionnaire involved rating on a visual Likert scale (0- 10) whether they found the monitor heavy, noisy, cumbersome, disturbing, or embarrassing to wear. The second part of the questionnaire addressed whether cuff inflation caused significant sleep disturbance or physical discomfort. Outcome Measures: The mean (SD) and range of the Likert scores are reported. The number of patients reporting sleep disturbance or physical discomfort was calculated. Logistic regression was used to examine which factors were significant predictors of discontinuing monitoring. Results: The mean (SD) responses measured by the Liken scores were: finding the monitor heavy 3.2 (2.3); comfortable 4.8 (2.3); straightforward to use 8.8 (1.8); cumbersome 3.8 (2.3); disturbing 4.5 (2.7); noisy 1.6 (2.2); and embarrassing to wear 1.7 (2.1). Difficulty initiating sleep was reported by 28.8% of patients, and a further 56.3% reported difficulty maintaining sleep due to the monitor. Sleep disturbance was found to be the strongest predictor [r = 0.52; OR 1.68 (1.23, 2.27), p = 0.0009] for the 15% of patients discontinuing the monitoring. Conclusions: While pregnant women tolerate the noise, weight, inconvenience, and disturbance associated with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) well, sleep disturbance is a major cause of dissatisfaction and noncompliance. Future studies should evaluate critically the number of nocturnal blood pressure assessments required, and should allow for a withdrawal rate of approximately 15% when performing sample size calculations for ABPM studies in pregnancy.

We describe changes in sleep architecture and sleep pattern during pregnancy, discuss the impact of the physical and biochemical changes of pregnancy on sleep in pregnant women and examine whether maternal-fetal outcomes may be adversely affected in women with disordered sleep. The literature on common sleep disorders affecting pregnant women, including insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome, is reviewed and recommendations are made for the management of these disorders during pregnancy.

N2  - Retrospective (questionnaire) and prospective (5-day diary) self-reports of sleep were obtained from 209 women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. On average, the women slept for 465 min, took around 20 min to get to sleep, and were awake for just over 30 min after initial sleep onset having woke 2.6 times on average. Sleep efficiency was around 89%. Significant differences were found between retrospective and prospective reports only on the number of minutes awake after sleep onset and on sleep efficiency. However, these differences were small. Retrospective and prospective reports were only moderately correlated. These results were not markedly different from values reported in much smaller, previous studies of pregnant women using polysomnography, suggesting that the self-reports were valid. The findings suggest that sleep parameters are not as adversely affected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as is generally believed.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigue and sleep disturbance in late pregnancy are associated with labor duration and delivery type. In a prospective observational study of 131 women in their ninth month of pregnancy, objective (48-hour wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep logs and questionnaires) measures were used to predict labor outcomes using analysis of variance and logistic regression. Controlling for infant birth weight, women who slept less than 6 hours at night had longer labors and were 4.5 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Women with severely disrupted sleep had longer labors and were 5.2 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Fatigue was unrelated to labor outcomes. Health care providers should prescribe 8 hours of bed time during pregnancy to assure adequate sleep and should include sleep quantity and quality in prenatal assessments as potential predictors of labor duration and delivery type. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective. To assess whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with increased behavioral morbidity. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11 years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2 well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised:Long. Results. Forty (5%) children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per hour; interquartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains: externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive, internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems. Conclusions. Children with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.

N2  - Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. About 20% of the population consumes less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg. Women, particularly, have low intakes. For example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men have inadequate intakes. Mg deficiency during pregnancy can induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences that might last throughout life. Studies of gestational Mg deficiency in animals show that Mg deficiency may have marked effects on parturition and postuterine involution. It has interfered with fetal growth and development, and caused morbidity from hematological effects and disturbances in temperature regulation, to teratogenic effects. Emphasis, here, is on effects of chronic clinical gestational Mg deficiency as it affects the infant. Premature labor, contributed to by uterine hyperexcitability caused by chronic maternal Mg deficiency, that can be intensified by stress, gives rise to preterm birth. If the only cause of uterine overactivity is Mg deficiency, its supplementation constitutes nontoxic tocolytic treatment, as an adjuvant treatment, that is devoid of toxicity and enhances efficacy and safety of tocolytic drugs such as beta-2 mimetics. Evidence is considered that Mg deficiency or Mg depletion can contribute to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS may be a fetal consequence of maternal Mg deficiency through impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS can result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. Possibly, simple nutritional Mg supplements might be preventive. Various stresses in an infant can transform simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion. For example, lying prone can be stressful for the baby, as can parental smoking. The role of chronopathological stress appears to be often neglected, as it constitutes a clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (MT) and of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked to impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. Prophylaxis of this form of SIDS should include atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. Consequences of maternal primary Mg deficiency have been inadequately studied. To determine ultimate outcomes of gestational Mg deficiency in infants, a long-term multicenter placebo-controlled prospective study should undertaken on effects of maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality/morbidity in fetus, neonates, infants, children and adults, not only during pregnancy and the baby's first year, but throughout life.

N2  - Dopaminergic agents, particularly dopamine agonists, have been used with increasing frequency in the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999.1 These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or pregnant women with RLS or PLMD.

N2  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guidelines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.

N2  - Objectives: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. Design: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. Setting: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. Participants: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. Interventions: None. Results: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. Conclusions: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

N2  - Because of its multiple involvement in physiological processes, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, a key regulator of homeostatic control, demonstrates a progressive increase during pregnancy. The profile of its maturation, mainly in the parasympathetic arm, in premature or full term infants, may help us to better understand its pathophysiological role. We prospectively evaluated ANS maturity in a group of 23 premature (PREM) infants at their theoretical term age and in 8 full term (FT) newborns. All recordings were registered close to the theoretical full term period (from 38 to 41 weeks) for the PREM group and during the first week of life for the FT newborns. Polygraphic recordings, EEG monitoring associated with visual clinical control, and Holter ECG, were performed simultaneously. ANS indices were then calculated during quiet sleep periods, using Wavelet transform of RR (beat to beat) intervals. High frequency components were found to be significantly lower in the PREM than in the FT group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, at theoretical full term age, the greater the prematurity, the lower was parasympathetic activity. Because it is easy, monitoring of parasympathetic activity may help us to understand autonomic maturation and its clinical prognostic implications.

N2  - Background: Heart period variability provides a measure of balance between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the PNS develops during the final weeks of gestation, premature infants have an overriding SNS. Spectral power analysis of heart period variability reveals two main frequency regions, the low frequency region (LF) representing primarily SNS activity and the high frequency region (HF) representing PNS activity. Objectives: To identify the characteristics of heart period power in the LF and HF regions in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the neonatal intensive care unit across gestational age groups and between sleep and awake states. Methods: Data were collected from 16 intubated and mechanically ventilated VLBW infants with respiratory disease. Using spectral analysis techniques, heart period power in the two main frequency regions was extracted. Results: HF power did not improve with gestational age as expected. LF power did increase with age, albeit nonsignificantly. LF and HF power were not significantly different between awake and sleep states. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study suggest that PNS tone does not improve with gestational age in VLBW infants with respiratory disease. The intensive care environment may stimulate a sympathetic response in these infants and disrupt normal PNS development. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Ontogeny of arousal data constitute a vital supplement to the sparse literature on spontaneous neuronal activity. These data demonstrate that measurable infant spontaneous arousals (SAs) with an inherent oscillatory entrainment occur six times more in active sleep than in quiet sleep of the same duration and are identifiable as a human neurobiologic function. These SAs are not significantly associated with race or ethnicity, gender, total hours spent sleeping, percent time spent in active or quiet sleep, preterm status, history of a life-threatening event, having had a sibling who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or having had a mother who smoked during this pregnancy. As measurable neurophysiologic events, SAs establish parameters for research at molecular and molar levels focusing on several critical areas: (1) the neuronal control of SA related to neurotransmitters, (2) as a significant antecedent factor in clinical cardiorespiratory events occurring in infants at high epidemiologic risk for SIDS; (3) as a regulatory biologic factor underlying temperament and executive cognitive functioning, and (4) morbidity and mortality effects possibly related to therapeutic interventions that alter SA levels.

N2  - Sleep patterns and dream content may be affected by stressful life events such as pregnancy loss. Women who are pregnant subsequent to a prior pregnancy loss tend to have anxious and emotionally charged experiences during their pregnancies. Dreams can affect pregnancy outcomes, specifically premature birth. This qualitative study is the first investigation to explore sleep disturbances caused by dreams as experienced by a diverse group of women pregnant subsequent to a pregnancy loss. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 4 categories of dreams. We offer clinical assessment and intervention strategies to support these women prenatally and present suggestions for research to facilitate our understanding of their experiences.

N2  - This review, although not exhaustive, provides information on the potential impact of psychiatric illness on obstetric outcome. There is clear evidence that psychiatric illness poses a risk to pregnancy outcome. The reproductive safety data on many of the available treatments fail to demonstrate a clear risk from treatment. The medications with clear teratogenic, neonatal, and developmental risks are, not surprisingly, those used to treat some of the most severe and debilitating psychiatric illnesses. Even the amount of information available is inadequate without some straightforward clinical guidelines. A model of risk for illness and treatments of illnesses during pregnancy developed by the authors' group [237] reminds clinicians that nonexposure does not exist. Rather, the decision is which type of exposure is in the best interest of the patient and family-exposure to illness or exposure to treatment. Regardless of the choice, clinicians are encouraged to think in terms of reducing the total number of exposures; that is, if choosing to treat, patients should be kept well by adjusting and monitoring medications-partial treatment simply provides exposure to illness and treatment. Guidelines to accomplish the goal of minimizing exposures include: 1. Treating women of reproductive capacity from the first visit as if they are pregnant: choosing treatments with reproductive safety information (eg, new and improved = no data) and providing supplemental folic acid for all women (800 μg), with higher doses for those treated with anticonvulsants (3 to 4 mg). 2. For women who conceive while taking a medication, and if it was efficacious for them, then the majority of decisions for medication selection should be considered already made for pregnancy and lactation (eg, do not switch medications once pregnant or for breastfeeding, as that simply exposes the baby to a second medication and the data previously discussed do not apply). 3. Because the serum concentration of most medications decreases during pregnancy, establishing criteria a priori for increasing the maternal daily dose; as a general rule, sleep patterns are good markers of psychiatric illnesses. 4. Always preferring monotherapy to two medications. 5. Obtaining up-to-date information at www.emorywomensprogram.org (a website with links to many support groups, reproductive safety registries) or other women's health websites. These basic guidelines can help decrease the number of exposures and aid in conducting clinical care with at least some reproductive safety data.

N2  - During pregnancy, systemic inflammatory responses induce cytokines that may stress the fetus and contribute to cardiovascular and neuroendocrine dysfunction in adulthood. We evaluated the effects of early and late prenatal exposure to IL-6 on mean systolic arterial pressure (MSAP) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation in male and female rats at 5-24 wk of age. MSAP and ACTH and corticosterone levels were measured basally and in response to a novel environment, immobilization stress, and stimulation with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and ACTH. In addition, mRNA expression and protein levels of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, CRF receptor type 1, and CRF were estimated in brain areas thought to mediate central effects of corticosteroids on the HPA axis and on central neuroendocrine regulation of MSAP. Both early and late prenatal IL-6 exposure led to hypertension, which was evident in females at 5 wk of age. In adult rats, basal ACTH and corticosterone levels were elevated, the responses to stress and stimulation tests were of extended duration, and circadian rhythm during the light period was flattened and reversed. Mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression was reduced in the hippocampus, the CRF level was increased in the hypothalamus, and CRF receptor type 1 mRNA expression was increased in the pituitary. These findings suggest that fetal stress induced by prenatal exposure to IL-6 leads to hypertension and dysregulation of HPA axis activity during adulthood.

N2  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guidelines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents. © 2004 Excerpta Media Inc.

N2  - Purpose. The aim of the present study was to determine whether community pharmacists recommend appropriate medications and give valid information to pregnant women. Methods. A total of 163 community pharmacists randomly selected in the Midi-Pyrénées area were interviewed by means of an open questionnaire. Ten scenarios were proposed concerning back pain, headache, coughs and sore-throats, fever, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, 'venous insufficiency', allergic rhinitis and insomnia. Results. Out of the total, 130 pharmacists accepted to answer. Out of them 94.5% reported advising homeopathy, especially for coughs and allergy. They often advised medication for pain, fever, nose and oropharynx disorders, 'venous insufficiency', dyspepsia or constipation. By contrast, they referred the women to the general practitioner for nausea and vomiting or back pain. Advice without drug dispensation was given for gastrointestinal disorders or 'venous insufficiency'. Phytotherapy only concerned 0.5-2% of the answers except for anxiety and sleep disturbances (59%), 'venous disorders'(17%) and sore-throat (9%). Pharmacists' answers were sometimes inappropriate involving (1) pharmacologically illogical advice, (2) drugs for which neither clinical nor experimental data are available and (3) drugs potentially harmful in pregnancy. Conclusions. The present study shows that French community pharmacists do not always give appropriate advice to pregnant women. As primary health care providers, pharmacists have to improve counselling regarding drug use in pregnancy. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The power spectra of night sleep EEGs of 12 breast-feeding 9-13 week postpartum mothers were analyzed and compared with those of 12 non-pregnant women. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range during NREM sleep for breast-feeding mothers were significantly higher than those for non-pregnant women. In addition, the all-night sleep patterns of the mothers were classified into two groups - interrupted sleep due to taking care of their infants and non-interrupted sleep - in order to observe the influence of partial sleep deprivation. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range were not significantly different between them. This result suggests that increased delta and theta power spectra during postpartum sleep do not result from partial sleep deprivation. The role of prolactin in breast-feeding mothers' sleep is also discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: To review our management of infants discharged home receiving supplemental oxygen. Stable preterm infants receive low flow O2 by nasal cannulae aiming for SaO2 of ≥ 95%. Oxygen-dependent infants must pass an air test (ability to maintain SaO2 > 80% during 4 h disconnection from oxygen) before discharge home with supplemental oxygen. A sleep study is performed before nocturnal O2 is ceased. Methods: Infants less than 33 weeks gestational age (GA) who were admitted January 1999-June 2001 and discharged home with supplemental oxygen were identified through the databases and medical records of the King Edward Memorial/ Princess Margaret Hospitals. The data collected were compared with an audit performed a decade earlier. Results: Ninety-three infants were discharged home with supplemental oxygen between 1999 and 2001 (10% neonatal intensive care unit admissions less than 33 weeks GA; median GA 26 weeks (interquartile range 25-28). All infants had an air test before discharge: 63% failed the first air test and 30% at least two air tests. The median delay between the first air test and discharge was 2 weeks. The median postmenstrual age at discharge was 40 weeks gestation (interquartile range 38-41). Ninety infants had a sleep study before nocturnal oxygen was ceased and nine failed the first sleep study. Hospital readmission rate was 60%. More preterm infants (less than 33 weeks) were discharged with supplemental oxygen in 1999-2001 (10%, n = 96 in 1999-2001) than in 1987-1992 (2.5%, n = 53) and this was associated with an earlier discharge (40 vs 44 weeks postmenstrual age), lower oxygen requirements at discharge (60 vs 125 mL/min), earlier discontinuation of daytime and nocturnal oxygen (1 vs 4 months postmenstrual age and 2.5 vs 6 months postmenstrual age) and no increase in readmission rate (64% vs 60%). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for these infants has remained stable at 20%. Conclusion: Our home oxygen programme, based on an air test predischarge and a sleep study prediscontinuation of nocturnal oxygen, facilitates early discharge home. Our data suggest that over the last decade, bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with less impairment in lung function. Further evidence from randomized clinical trials is required to determine optimal target range for oxygen saturation in preterm infants.

N2  - Aim: To compare the breathing patterns of infants born by elective caesarean section to those infants delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour. Methods: Healthy term infants born by caesarean section were studied. The study group (n = 13) had no trial of labour, whereas infants in the control group (n = 13) failed a trial of labour. Polysomnographic study was performed at 36 h of age. Heart and respiratory rate, type and duration of apnoeas, arterial oxygen saturation and lower limb movements were analysed. Results: Term infants born by elective caesarean section had a shorter duration of pregnancy and weighed less. Their heart rate was faster, they had more mixed apnoeas, and during quiet sleep they had more central apnoeas of longer duration. Conclusion: Cardiorespiratory patterns in infants delivered by elective caesarean section are different from those delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour.

N2  - Aim: To determine whether high levels of maternal physical activity (dancing during pregnancy), influenced the offspring. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four women (32 of whom had continued to dance for at least 2 months after the beginning of pregnancy) filled in a questionnaire to assess the health and behavior of their offspring, now 11-15 years of age. Results: More children born from women who had continued to dance during pregnancy needed to be rocked to sleep during their first year (p < 0.05). More children in the study group played musical instruments (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding other parameters. Conclusions: The greater need to be rocked to fall asleep and the attitude to play musical instruments recorded in the children of dancers may be related to prenatal maternal movement. But they may also be due to other causes as discussed. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a condition that accompanies many seemingly unrelated diseases. It is commonly associated with various clinical conditions such as pregnancy, aging, pulmonary diseases, cancers, and other systemic illnesses. The condition has been attributed to various causes such as platelet abnormalities, hormonal disturbances, and cytokine dysfunction, but the exact underlying mechanism has been elusive. We propose a unifying hypothesis that activation of the adrenergic system is the common thread that links all of the disparate clinical associations of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. In diseased states, autonomic stimulation may occur as a result of chemoreceptor activation in response to acidosis, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. Examples include sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and tumor-induced hypoxia. In this setting, clinical signs of HOA may be a marker of underlying autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic stimulation may also occur as a normal part of pregnancy or as an abnormal component of aging. The exact pathway linking adrenergic excess to HOA remains to be clarified, but a plausible scenario based on current molecular evidence is offered. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Classic experiments have shown that ovulation and estrous cyclicity are under circadian control and that surgical ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) results in estrous acyclicity in rats [1-3]. Here, we characterized reproductive function in the circadian Clock mutant mouse [4, 5] and found that the circadian Clock mutation both disrupts estrous cyclicity and interferes with the maintenance of pregnancy. Clock mutant females have extended, irregular estrous cycles, lack a coordinated luteinizing hormone (LH) surge on the day of proestrus, exhibit increased fetal reabsorption during pregnancy, and have a high rate of full-term pregnancy failure. Clock mutants also show an unexpected decline in progesterone levels at midpregnancy and a shortened duration of pseudopregnancy, suggesting that maternal prolactin release may be abnormal. In a second set of experiments, we interrogated the function of each level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in order to determine how the Clock mutation disrupts estrous cyclicity. We report that Clock mutants fail to show an LH surge following estradiol priming in spite of the fact that hypothalamic levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), pituitary release of LH, and serum levels of estradiol and progesterone are all normal in Clock/Clock females. These data suggest that Clock mutants lack an appropriate circadian daily-timing signal required to coordinate hypothalamic hormone secretion. Defining the mechanisms by which the Clock mutation disrupts reproductive function offers a model for understanding how circadian genes affect complex physiological systems.

N2  - Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 μT above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 μT during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 μT during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.

N2  - Daily variation in niche use among vertebrates is attributed to a variety of factors, including thermoregulatory, reproductive, and nutritional requirements. Lemuriform primates exhibit many behavioral and physiological adaptations related to thermoregulation and sharp, seasonal reproduction, yet they have rarely been subjects of a quantitative analysis of circadian (or daily) rhythms in niche use. In this study, I document daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use over an annual cycle in two sympatric, frugivorous lemurs, Varecia rubra and Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Data on diet, forest site, and forest height were recorded at 5-min time points on focal animals and divided into three time blocks for analysis (06:00-10:00 hr, 10:00-14:00 hr, and 14:00-18:00 hr). I employed multivariate tests of independence to examine daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use according to sex, season, and reproductive stage. Throughout the day, V. rubra is frugivorous and dwells in the upper canopy, with notable departures (especially for females) during the hot seasons, gestation, and lactation. E. f albifrons has heterogeneous daily rhythms of food choice and microhabitat use, particularly across seasons, and both sexes are equally variable. These daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use appear related to thermoregulatory and nutritional requirements, seasonal food availability and circadian rhythms of plant (and possibly insect) palatability, predator avoidance tactics, and in the case of Varecia, to reproduction. Daily rhythms of food choice in V. rubra support two previously suggested hypotheses explaining why primates consume more nonfruit items late in the day, whereas those of E. f. albifrons are too variable to lend support to these hypotheses. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Study objective: Environmental-factor changes may largely be accountable for the dramatic increase of obesity prevalence in industrialized countries. This study investigated the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and various socioeconomic, clinical, behavioural and reproductive factors in a population from Southern France. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study, a sample of 3127 current and former salaried workers (1658 men and 1469 women) completed a questionnaire on personal and medical histories, and had a clinical examination including height and weight measurements. Age-adjusted and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. Results: The overall prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) was 9.8% and was higher in men than in women (11.1 versus 8.3%). Multivariate analyses showed that in both sexes, low educational level, television watching, low physical activity and ex-smoking habits, were independently associated with a higher BMI. Furthermore, in women, we found independent and positive associations between BMI and the number of naps per week, short sleep duration, daily alcohol consumption, the number of pregnancies, early age at menarche or the non-use of oral contraceptives. Conclusions: Our results reveal the complexity that exists between BMI and environmental factors and stress the need to analyse and to handle these factors simultaneously. © 2004 The European Society of Cardiology.

N2  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

N2  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Disparities in maternal and infant health have been observed among members of different racial and ethnic populations and persons of differing socioeconomic status. For the Healthy People 2010 objectives for maternal and child health to be achieved (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy People 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000), the nature and extent of disparities in maternal behaviors that affect maternal or infant health should be understood. Identifying these disparities can assist public health authorities in developing policies and programs targeting persons at greatest risk for adverse health outcomes. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2000-2001. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of different perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants in 31 states and New York City. This report summarizes data for 2000-2001 from eight states (Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, and North Carolina) on four behaviors (smoking during pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy, breastfeeding initiation, and use of the infant back sleep position) for which substantial health disparities have been identified previously. RESULTS: Although the prevalence of each behavior varied by state, consistent patterns were observed among the eight states by age, race, ethnicity, education, and income level. Overall, the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy ranged from 9.0% to 17.4%. Younger (aged <25 years) women, white women, American Indian women, non-Hispanic women (except in Hawaii), women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes consistently reported the highest rates of smoking. Overall, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy ranged from 3.4% to 9.9%. In seven states, women aged >35 years, non-Hispanic women, women with more than a high school education, and women with higher incomes reported the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. Overall, the prevalence of breastfeeding initiation ranged from 54.8% to 89.6%. Younger women, black women, women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes reported the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation. The size of the black-white disparity in breastfeeding varied among states. Overall, use of the back sleep position for infants ranged from 49.7% to 74.8%. Use of the back sleep position was lowest among younger women, black women, women with lower levels of education, and women with low incomes. Ethnic differences in sleep position varied substantially by state. INTERPRETATION: PRAMS data can be used to identify racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in critical maternal health-related behaviors. Although similar general patterns by age, education, and income were observed in at least seven states, certain racial and ethnic disparities varied by state. Prevalence of the four behaviors among each population often varied by state, indicating the potential impact of state-specific policies and programs. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: States can use PRAMS data to identify populations at greatest risk for maternal behaviors that have negative consequences for maternal and infant health and to develop policies and plan programs that target populations at high risk.sk. Although prevalence data cannot be used to identify causes or interventions to improve health outcomes, they do indicate the magnitude of disparities and identify populations that should be targeted for intervention. This report indicates a need for wider targeting than is often done. The results from this report can aid state and national agencies in creating more effective public health policies and programs. The data described in this report should serve as a baseline that states can use to measure the impact of policies and programs on eliminating these health disparities.

N2  - A 25-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, at 37 weeks gestation was evaluated and treated for preeclampsia. Overnight, the patient had a witnessed apneic episode with maternal oxygen desaturation and concurrent fetal heart rate deceleration. She subsequently delivered an infant that was small for gestational age. This is the first case described with confirmed obstructive sleep apnea by formal polysomnography and witnessed maternal desaturation with fetal heart rate decelerations. Recognizing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) early in gestation will help dictate treatment options and may prevent adverse maternal fetal outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) seems to be a safe treatment with minimal adverse effects. Questioning of patients at the first prenatal visit and monitoring for increased snoring during gestation may help detect early signs and symptoms of OSA. Treatment of OSA with CPAP might improve perinatal outcomes.

N2  - In the Jouvet's laboratory, as early as 1960 the study of the ontogenesis of paradoxical sleep (PS) named "sleep with jerks" began in the kitten and led to the first publication in 1961. Then, several species were studied, lamb, rat, human neonates, etc. These works showed that at birth sleep with jerks was preponderant in altricial (immature) species (cat, rat) and the first to appear during the second half of gestation in precocious species (guinea pig). For Jouvet, sleep with jerks is a immature form of PS. Why PS is so important at birth ? The maturation of the central nervous system, based on the myelinization, starts in the spinal cord then forwards to the brainstem and forebrain. So, PS mechanisms located in the brainstem are the first to mature and the only one to function. Then the slow wave sleep (SWS) and waking structures become mature. Phylogenetic studies showed that in mammals and birds PS was present even in marsupials and monotremes. Until now only the one exception is the dolphin with a voluntary breathing. To sleep and breath, dolphin has developed an unilateral sleep without classical PS. In other animals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, PS was not observed with the parameters used in mammals. The study at birth (not yet done) of reptiles would allow perhaps the observation of a temporary PS. Based on these findings, a schematic model of the sleep regulation can be elaborated. Haeckel's aphorism "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" seems true for PS which appears in birds and mammals i.e. at the end of evolution as it appears at the end of gestation when PS cerebral structures are present and mature.

N2  - Across the life cycle of women, the quality and quantity of sleep can be markedly impacted by internal (eg, hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms) and external (financial and child-care responsibilities; marital issue) factors. This paper will outline some of the major phases of the life cycle in women that have been associated with sleep problems. The main messages from this paper include 1) that very little systematic, large-scale research has been performed in virtually every area reviewed; and 2) once identified, the sleep problem is generally best addresed by the standard therapeutic approach, except in the case of preganant and lactating women in the concern for the fetus and child must be considered in the treatment decision. This paper is organized into sections that address sleep problems associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and perimenopause. Anecdotal reports treatment that address the specific physical discomfort experienced by the woman (eg, analgesics for premenstrual pain, pregnancy pillows for backache, and hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes). The importance of developing standard treatment recommendations is stressed because the develoment of chronic insomnia has been linked to precipitating events. In addtion, primary sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome) have been shown to increase during pregnancy and menopause, but treatment recommmendations may be contraindicated or are not specific for women.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the severity of the low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy, including prevalence, risk factors, impact on daily living, and health provider management. METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 36 questions was distributed to pregnant women participating in various prenatal care clinics and educational classes in New Haven County, Connecticut. A total of 950 surveys was returned from May 2002 through October 2003. At each site, a researcher was available each week to answer questions and gather surveys. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-five (68.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-72%) respondents reported experiencing LBP during their current pregnancy. The prevalence was not affected by gestational age (P = .56). Low back pain during the current pregnancy was predicted by age (younger women were more likely to develop it; P = .004), history of LBP without pregnancy (P = .002), during menstruation (P = .01), and during a previous pregnancy (P = .002). The majority of respondents reported that LBP during pregnancy caused sleep disturbances (58%; 95% CI 54-62%) and impaired daily living (57%; 95% CI 53-62%). Average pain was moderate in severity. Nearly 30% of respondents stopped performing at least one daily activity because of pain and reported that pain also impaired the performance of other routine tasks. Only 32% (95% CI 28-36%) of the respondents with LBP during pregnancy informed their prenatal care providers of this problem, and only 25% (95% CI 21-28%) of prenatal care providers recommended a treatment. CONCLUSION: Low back pain during pregnancy is a common problem that causes hardship in this population. Further studies are indicated in the areas of prevention and treatment. © 2004 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Sleep-related complaints are common in the general population. Prevalence rates are significantly higher among women and the older age groups. About 10% of those experiencing insomnia state that the complaint is chronic. Chronic primary insomnia results from the reaction to an emotional trigger or stressful event, which leads to the further development of sleep-preventing associations. Chronic secondary insomnia is that related to another mental disorder, a neurologic disease, another sleep disorder, a general medical condition, the effect of a drug of abuse or a medication. Sleep disturbances have also been described in pregnancy and during menopause. In patients with chronic primary insomnia nonpharmacological strategies and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics) are indicated. In patients with secondary insomnia the underlying disorder needs to be treated appropriately. Currently used hypnotics include benzodiazepine derivatives, the cyclopyrrolone zopiclone, the imidazopyridine zolpidem and the pyrazolopyrimidine zaleplon. In patients with chronic insomnia most hypnotics reduce sleep-onset latency, decrease the number of nocturnal awakenings and reduce the time spent awake. The increase in total sleep time is related to greater amounts of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep quality is also improved. Despite consistent effects on sleep-onset latency, zaleplon administration is not associated with significant changes in total sleep time and sleep quality. In contrast to the benzodiazepines and zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon do not suppress slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Sleep laboratory and clinical studies tend to indicate that benzodiazepines are only effective when administered for relatively short periods of time in patients with chronic primary insomnia. Furthermore, a rebound insomnia has been described for short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines. No evidence of tolerance or rebound insomnia has been observed in relation to zolpidem or zaleplon administration.

N2  - Context: The precise function of sleep in animals and human beings is still unknown, and any sort of physical, social or psychological variation may change the normal sleep-wake cycle. Purpose: This research aims is to determine the sleep disorders (SD) for each of the three trimesters of the pregnancy comparing them to the pre-pregnancy state (PG). Method: SD were investigated in three hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered for each trimester. Results: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased by 23% in the 2nd trimester (p < 0.005); the rate for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by 15% in the 1st trimester (p<0.003), 55% in the 2nd trimester (p<0.001) and by 14% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.002); the rate for mild sleepiness increased by 33% in the 2nd trimester (p<0.002) and by 48% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001); the rate for specific awakenings increased by 63% in the 1st trimester, by 80% in the 2nd trimester and by 84% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001). Conclusion: SD were more frequent during pregnancy comparatively to PG state, mostly at the expenses of EDS and specific awakenings.

N2  - Sleep and sleep disorders are different in several important ways between men and women. Because of pregnancy and menopause, women experience changes in sleep that may present as clinical problems. In clinical populations, women are more likely to present with insomnia than are men, although their sleep may be better preserved. The presentation of sleep apnea in women is distinct from that of men and is less likely to include a "classic" history of witnessed apnea or heavy snoring. More likely it presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue or mood disturbance. There are little data on the effects of different treatments for OSA between men and women. OHS is a syndrome that may be as common in women as in men. The role of hormones in its pathophysiology is not well-defined.

N2  - This review will focus on the development of behavioural states and breathing during early developmental stages prior to term gestation. Although these behavioural states are immature during early development, their cyclicity is clearly seen. Preterm infants characteristically have a large proportion of indeterminate sleep and small amount of wakefulness. Whereas oxygenation is relatively stable during active and quiet sleep in ventilated preterm infants, indeterminate sleep and arousals are associated with hypoxaemic episodes. Arousals have also been linked to apnoea in spontaneously breathing infants. Since well-defined sleep cycles are beneficial for the oxygenation of preterm infants, we should explore ways to promote their natural sleep while they are exposed to neonatal intensive care. Care practices such as clustering procedures, kangaroo care and optimal positioning have been shown to improve the integrity of sleep. Optimizing the sleep cycling might improve the long-term outcome of preterm infants. More studies in this area are clearly needed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. Around 20% of the population consumes less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg, in both genders and in women particularly: for example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men. Primary Mg deficiency may occur in fertile women. Gestational Mg deficiency is able to induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences which might last throughout life. - Experimental studies of gestational Mg deficiency show that Mg deficiency during pregnancy may have marked effects on the processes of parturition and of postuterine involution. It may interfere with fetal growth and development from teratogenic effects to morbidity: i.e. hematological effects and disturbances in temperature regulation. - Clinical studies on the consequences of maternal primary Mg deficiency in women have been insufficiently investigated. To check the validity of the role of this frequent gestational Mg deficiency, the protocol of a long term multicentric placebo controlled prospective study on the effects of maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality and morbidity in fetus, neonates, infants, children and adults should be carried out not only during pregnancy and the first year of life, but throughout life. - Two clinical forms of chronic gestational Mg deficiency in women have been stressed: • Premature labor when chronic maternal Mg deficiency is involved in uterine hyperexcitability, • Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when it is caused by either simple Mg deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion. - Nutritional Mg treatment of premature labor. If gestational Mg deficiency is the only cause for uterine overactivity, nutritional Mg supplementation constitutes the etiopathogenic atoxic tocolytic treatment. But although it is an adjuvant factor in premature labor, it is only a useful accessory treatment, devoid of toxicity but which increases the effectiveness and safety of the associated tocolytic drugs such as beta-2 mimetics. - SIDS due to gestational Mg deficit: Mg deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion. SIDS may be caused by the fetal consequences of maternal Mg deficiency through an impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation, mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS may result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. A possible prevention could rest on simple maternal nutritional Mg supplementation. Various stresses in pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion: stress in baby care such as bedding in prone position, environmental factors such as parental smoking, but the role of chronopathological stress particularly appears to be too often neglected as it constitutes a clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (↘MT) and of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (↘6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked to an impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. A preventive treatment of this form of SIDS should associate atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. The place of Mg therapy for the infant and of MT, L Tryptophan and taurine is uncertain for the moment.

N2  - Activity-rest behavior of 20 neonates born vaginally, 18 neonates born by medically planned Cesarean section (C-section), and 19 neonates born by medically required C-section after labor onset (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record and show time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small wristwatch-like Actiwatch® actometers. Nursing/feeding times were recorded by using the actometers' integrated event marker button. Recordings in both C-section groups were performed in the hospital; for neonates born vaginally and for some born by C-section, recordings were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation. Amount of sleep time during daytime, nighttime, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during the daytime and nighttime, were compared. The majority of vaginally born neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency in their spectra. In contrast, both groups of neonates born by C-section showed significantly less distinct circadian frequencies in their spectra. All three groups showed a significant difference in amount of nighttime sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at nighttime. There were no differences in the amount of nighttime sleep, daytime sleep, and sleep time during 24h between the groups born by different delivery modes.

N2  - A significant body of literature has endorsed the view that the sleep of women differs in many respects from that of men. Beyond gender differences, however, are questions about sleep within cohorts of women. For example, in adult women ages 20-45 years, there are women with regular menstrual cycles, women taking oral contraceptives, pregnant and lactating women, and women entering menopause. Given that each of these states is associated with a unique hormonal environment, it is important to determine whether there are clinically significant differences in the sleep of women in these phases of life.

N2  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is implicated in the control of circadian rhythms of gonadal function. Although several structures surrounding the SCN are sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 ml peanut oil) from E15 until parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor disorder characterized by discomfort of and urge to move the legs, primarily during rest or inactivity, partial or total relief with movement, with presence or worsening exclusively in the evening. It is a relatively common but frequently unrecognized disorder, with a prevalence ranging from 2.5 to 15% of the general population, increasing with age and with a female preponderance. The diagnosis is clinical but polysomnography is useful to determine its profound impact on sleep (difficulties in sleep onset, maintaining sleep during the night, and sleep fragmentation) and for the evidence of periodic legs movements during sleep and wake. RLS is generally idiopathic, with familial association in 40-60% of the cases, but may also be symptomatic of such associated conditions (secondary forms) as peripheral neuropathies, uremia, iron deficiency (with or without anemia), diabetes, Parkinson's disease and pregnancy. Response to dopaminergic drugs indicates that dopamine receptors are implicated, and although much progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment in the last decade, more is needed for complete elucidation of the etiology and pathophysiology of RLS. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - We report the cases of 2 women with epilepsy who suffered generalized postpartum seizures on the first day after giving birth. The first had a history of febrile convulsions in childhood and had a seizure in the 36th week of gestation due to sleep deprivation. She had received epidural analgesia for labor pain. The second patient had had her most recent crisis at the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy. Both patients had low serum levels of antiepileptic drugs. The pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs can change during pregnancy, making seizures more difficult to control. Serum levels of these drugs should therefore be monitored more often, given that a generalized maternal seizure can have devastating consequences for the fetus. More careful planning and management of pregnancy is necessary for epileptic patients to ensure successful outcomes for both mother and fetus.

N2  - Aims. In this work we review the major publications dealing with disorders that affect the digestive system and how they are related to sleep. Development. Sleep disorders occur in 12-25% of the general population and a large percentage of these pathologies are related to disorders of the digestive system. We review the different pathologies and symptoms linked to the digestive tract that give rise to sleep disorders. The study first examined the upper digestive tract, that is, the teeth and teeth grinding, and we then went on to look at gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal motility disorders, peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, gastric ulcer, irritable bowel, proctalgia, the extent to which the disorders are related to pregnancy, disorders at the paediatric age and eating disorders. Conclusions. Digestive pains during sleep form a heterogeneous clinical picture that disrupts patients' sleep and exerts an influence on their quality of daily living, which in turn may affect sleep and favour the appearance of pains. To date these symptoms have received relatively little attention, but in the few studies that have been carried out, it has not been possible to establish with any degree of accuracy whether sleep and the digestive system share common control mechanisms or not. Research into this type of disorders could help to prevent the appearance of the complications that appear in these clinical pictures.

N2  - Background. Back pain during late pregnancy is a frequent clinical problem. Very little is known about the impact of this symptom on the quality of life among pregnant women with back pain. Objectives. To study the influence of back pain and physical ability on quality of life in late pregnancy. Methods. One hundred and sixty women in the 34th-37th week of pregnancy and attending two different midwife receptions, were asked to fill out questionnaires including: general questions about background factors, the Disability Rating Index (DRI) to score the physical ability, and The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) for assessing health-related quality of life. Two groups were defined, with and without back pain. Results. One hundred and thirty-six (85%) out of 160 screened women returned the questionnaire for evaluation. The 69 (51%) women with back pain rated significantly (p < 0.05) higher on the DRI; on NHP part I, sub scales sleep, energy, pain, physical functioning and total score; and on NHP part II, aspects occupation, ability to perform jobs around the house, social life and hobbies compared with women without back pain. Conclusions. Irrespective of back pain the pregnant women studied featured lower quality of life (QOL) compared with published data on healthy women. Among the women with back problems, who had the most impaired QOL, the factors affecting QOL were mostly related to physical ability.

N2  - Objective: Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. Method: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. Results: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. Conclusions: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

N2  - It has been suggested that shift work, night work in particular, affects worker's psychophysical health. However, the effects of night work on the health of pregnant women are not physiologically well elucidated. The effects of night work on the biological function of pregnant women were studied in the present study. Three pregnant and six non-pregnant nurses that engaged in fast-rotating shift system cooperated for the study. The 24-h urine samples were collected in two time frames, daytime (07:00 to 23:00) and nighttime (23: 00 to 07:00) on the day shift, the night shift and the days off. Urinary concentrations of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and norepinephrine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and estriol by radioimmunoassay. The excretion profiles of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the pregnant and the non-pregnant women were altered on the night shift, which might relate the derangement of circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion. The urinary norepinephrine level during the night work was considerably higher in the pregnant women, which indicated the presence of higher physical burden in them due to the night work. The urinary estriol level was not significantly affected by shift, day/night and individual factors, and the effect of night work on urinary estriol level of the pregnant women remained uncertain. The results of the present study suggested that the night work of the pregnant shift workers should be much more relieved.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep patterns and fatigue of both mothers and fathers before and after childbirth. The authors used wrist actigraphy and questionnaires to estimate sleep and fatigue in 72 couples during their last month of pregnancy and 1st month postpartum. Both parents experienced more sleep disruption at night during the postpartum period as compared to the last month of pregnancy. Compared to fathers, with their stable 24-h sleep patterns over time, mothers had less sleep at night and more sleep during the day after the baby was born. Sleep patterns were also related to parents' work status and type of infant feeding. Both parents self-reported more sleep disturbance and fatigue during the 1st month postpartum than during pregnancy. Mothers reported more sleep disturbance than fathers, but there was no gender difference in ratings of fatigue. At both time points, fathers obtained less total sleep than mothers when sleep was objectively measured throughout the entire 24-h day. Further research is needed to determine the duration of sleep loss for both mothers and fathers, to evaluate the effect of disrupted sleep and sleep loss on psychosocial functioning and job performance, and to develop interventions for improving sleep patterns of new parents.

N2  - We assessed the correlation between the rhythm ofmelatonin concentration and circadian blood pressure patterns in normal and hypertensive pregnancy. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and blood samples every 4 h were monitored in 16 primigravidae who had shown an abnormal circadian blood pressure pattern (eight pre-eclamptic and eight normotensive) in pregnancy and 6-12 months after pregnancy. The circadian rhythm was analyzed by chronobiological measures. Eight normotensive women with maintained blood pressure rhythm served as controls. During pregnancy, melatonin concentration was significantly higher in pre-eclamptic than in normotensive women (pre-eclampsia, 29.4 ± 1.9 pg/ml, normotensin, altered rhythm, 15.6 ± 2.1; controls, 22.7 ± 1.8; p < 0.001) This difference faded after pregnancy, owing to the fall observed in pre-eclampsia (11.8 ± 3.2 pg/ml, 9.8 ± 2.1, and 11.1 ± 2.0, respectively; NS). The rhythm of melatonin concentration was lost in all pregnant women with loss of blood pressure rhythm. After pregnancy, normotensive women showed a reappearance of both melatonin and blood pressure rhythm, whereas pre-eclamptic women showed a reappearance of blood pressure but not melatonin rhythm. The loss of blood pressure rhythm in pregnancy is consistent with the loss of melatonin concentration rhythm. In pre-eclamptic women, the normalization of blood pressure rhythm, while melatonin rhythm remained altered, suggests a temporal or causal priority of circadian concentration of melatonin in the determination of blood pressure trend.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Bright light therapy was shown to be a promising treatment for depression during pregnancy in a recent open-label study. In an extension of this work, we report findings from a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. METHOD: Ten pregnant women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned from April 2000 to January 2002 to a 5-week clinical trial with either a 7000 lux (active) or 500 lux (placebo) light box. At the end of the randomized controlled trial, subjects had the option of continuing in a 5-week extension phase. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version was administered to assess changes in clinical status. Salivary melatonin was used to index circadian rhythm phase for comparison with antidepressant results. RESULTS: Although there was a small mean group advantage of active treatment throughout the randomized controlled trial, it was not statistically significant. However, in the longer 10-week trial, the presence of active versus placebo light produced a clear treatment effect (p =.001) with an effect size (0.43) similar to that seen in antidepressant drug trials. Successful treatment with bright light was associated with phase advances of the melatonin rhythm. CONCLUSION: These findings provide additional evidence for an active effect of bright light therapy for antepartum depression and underscore the need for an expanded randomized clinical trial.

N2  - Aims: To investigate the influence of analytical design on the variability of published results in studies of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Methods: The results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622 control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period. Results: As additional variables are added, previously published SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, ≥3 previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation, being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period caused ≥3 previous live births and a reduced birth weight to become significant. Conclusion: The variables found to be significant in a case-control study, depend on what is included in a multivariate model.

N2  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the term first proposed in 1969 for a distinctive subgroup of unexpected infant deaths occurring during the first months of life, with relatively consistent clinical, epidemiological and pathological features, which remain unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including a complete autopsy, examination of death scene and review of clinical history. Sudden infant death unnecessary means SIDS. According to definition, SIDS remains a diagnosis of exclusion, distinguished from others only by subjective and permissive variables. Despite the vague and permissive nature of the definition, epidemiological studies identified some risk factors as prematurity and social disadvantage. Nevertheless, the most interesting findings are those related to environmental and care features, as drug addiction and/or smoke exposition during pregnancy, sleep position of the infant, environmental temperature, parental bed sharing and breast feeding. Those factors play a variable role, but their correction reduced SIDS incidence. Sudden infant death is a diagnosis made by expert pathologists with pediatrician's and investigator's advice, based primarily on autopsy findings and death scene investigation performed through the severe application of investigative protocols.

N2  - Background. Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar difference for oxygen and, in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Objectives. Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 21 pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO 2) in the supine and sitting positions. Methods. We tested 21 healthy pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation. Arterial samples were taken in the sitting position. Complete polysomnography was performed in all of the pregnant women. Before the polysomnography arterial samples were taken in the supine and sitting positions and then every 2 h until termination of the study. Results. We did not find any correlation between SaO2/PaO 2 levels and apnea, hypopnea or percent of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during pregnancy (5.81 ± 2.1 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) than postpartum (12.1 ± 2.7 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) (p < 0.001), which may be due to the raised level of progesterone. The PaO 2 levels in the supine position were significantly lower than in the sitting position at 36 weeks of gestation (p < 0.001). No differences were found between PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine positions postpartum (p < 0.5). Conclusions. According to our results we conclude that 1) the frequency of apnea and hypopnea in pregnancy was significantly lower than postpartum, and 2) a significant difference in PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine positions was observed at 36 weeks of gestation.

N2  - In order to longitudinally analyze the diurnal variations in fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline, 24-h FHR recordings were made at 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36 weeks for a normal pregnant woman. Significant diurnal variations were found in all gestational weeks. The amplitude of diurnal variation increased with advancing gestation. The FHR baseline at 00:00-09:00 hours significantly decreased from 24 to 30 weeks, while that at 15:00-21:00 hours decreased after 27 weeks. These findings suggest that the changes in the diurnal variations of FHR baseline with advancing gestation reflect the process of development of the fetal nervous system. © 2004 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

N2  - Objective. This is a prospective study of the effects of maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy on newborn neurobehavioral integrity, including systematic measures of behavioral state, sleep organization, motor activity, heart rate variability (HRV), tremulousness, and startles. Methods. The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed, full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1 hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate. Results. SSRI-exposed infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state, fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state. SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant. Conclusions. Results provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.

N2  - We measured core body temperatures of three pregnant ewes and their fetuses by means of chronically implanted temperature-sensitive data loggers. In standard laboratory conditions (dry-bulb temperature 20-22°C) core body temperatures of pregnant sheep and their fetuses during the last trimester of pregnancy demonstrated a constant feto-maternal temperature gradient, and a daily thermal circadian rhythm for the mother and fetus with a small amplitude (<1°C). When the same pregnant ewes were transferred to a natural field habitat where dry-bulb temperature varied between 7°C and 27°C in a 24h period, there was a marked increase in the amplitude of ewe nychthemeral temperature rhythms (∼2°C). There was similarly an increase in fetal temperature rhythms, but the variations were smaller. Immediately after birth in the field, the core temperature of newborn lambs fell by up to 4.5°C. Thereafter, newborn lambs increased their core body temperatures and appeared to regulate core temperature and daily temperature rhythms at the same levels that they were as fetuses. Only in the second month post-birth do lamb core temperatures and temperature rhythms begin to resemble those of adult sheep. We have shown that fetal thermal protection, which is evident in ewes housed in in-door conditions, persists in natural field conditions also, where fetuses appear to be more protected from night-time falls- than daytime rises in maternal core temperature. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To determine the relationship between umbilical venous (UV) volume flow and fetal behavioral states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) in normal pregnancies at 36-40 weeks of gestation. Methods: Fetal behavioral states were established in 17 normal pregnancies by means of combined assessment of fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP), and fetal eye and body movements. UV vessel area (mm2) as obtained by tracing the inner vessel area using Labview and Imaq Vision software and UV time-averaged flow velocity (mm/s Doppler) were multiplied to calculate UV volume flow (mL/min) including flow/kg fetus. The pulsatility index (PI) in the umbilical artery was also determined. In each woman, all parameters were measured between three and five times in each behavioral state. Data are reported as mean ± 1 SD and analyzed by paired t-test. Results: No statistically significant behavioral-state-related changes were observed for UV time-averaged velocity and UV volume flow, resulting in UV volume flow/kg fetus of 69.1 ± 14.9 mL/min*kg at 1F and 71.6 ± 12.1 mL/min*kg at 2F (not significant). A statistically significant increase (P = 0.02) was established for UV cross-sectional area (46.4 ± 8.6 mm2 vs. 49.0 ± 10.1 mm2) and for fetal heart rate (FHR) from 134.2 ± 10.3 bpm in 1F to 144.2 ± 7 bpm in 2F. Umbilical artery PI was not significantly different between the two behavioral states. Conclusions: On the basis of high venous vessel wall compliance, the significant increase in UV cross-sectional area during fetal behavioral state 2F may be determined by a rise in mean venous pressure. The significant rise in FHR may reflect increased fetal cardiac output during state 2F while the resistance at the hepato-ductal pathway remains relatively constant with the purpose of meeting raised energy demands during the active sleep state. This is further supported by the observed trend towards an increase in UV volume flow. Copyright © 2004 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The effects of noise on health, especially that of children, were reviewed. (1) From the point of view of disturbance of daily living, subjective recognition of "noisiness" is an important issue in relation to the study of noise. Concerning the effects of airplane noise on school children, while no effects on the hearing level were detected, a significant increase in the complaint of "noisiness" was observed. (2) Exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with a decrease in the body weight of newborn babies. Moreover, the height of 3-year-old boys and girls was found to be significantly decreased in association with increase in the environmental noise. (3) Noise levels that seemed to have some influence on the sleep of adults did not affect the sleep of children. (4) In a group of children living in noisy districts exhibiting poor academic performance, the academic performance seemed to become progressively worse as the school grade advanced. (5) No consensus has been arrived at in regard to headphone-induced hearing impairment. Researches and studies effective enough to influence policy decisions must be continually conducted in the future, with appropriate control for related factors.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the tolerance, compliance and problems associated with usage of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by pregnant women with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Patients and method: Twelve pregnant women diagnosed with SDB received polysomnography (PSG) at entry, CPAP titration, repeat PSG at 6 months gestation (GA) and home monitoring of cardio-respiratory variables at 8 months GA. Compliance was verified by the pressure at the mask. Results from the Epworth sleepiness scale, fatigue scale and visual analogue scales (VAS) for sleepiness, fatigue, and snoring were compared over time. Results: All of the subjects had full term pregnancies and healthy infants. Nightly compliance was at least 4 h initially and 6.5 h at 6 months GA. Nasal CPAP significantly improved all scales compared to entry. VAS scores remained lower at 6 months GA compared to entry. Re-adjustment of CPAP pressure was needed in six subjects at 6 months GA. Conclusion: Nasal CPAP is a safe and effective treatment of SDB during pregnancy. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were addressed: (1) biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the toxic effects of alcohol; (2) alcohol and gene-environment interactions that affect the health of diverse groups; (3) alcohol pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans; (4) determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority populations; (5) consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6) interaction between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep, nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7) disparities of brain functional reserve capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8) alcohol and pregnancy disparities; (9) role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10) ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11) postmenopausal health disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1) Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. (2) These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3) Differences between and among population groups can be critically important for the design and interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. (4) Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for these differences. (5) The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found in white Hispanic men. (6) Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the protective alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 and a relatively high frequency of CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7) The incidence rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Summary. In Germany there are several commited self-help groups as well as numerous medical authorities and specialist associations which however haven't got together yet in order to set up a systematic health education campaign. So far the knowledge of other professional fields like that of graphic designers, specialists of communication and public health scientists hasn't been sufficiently used to familiarize nearly all pregnant women, parents, grandparents and babysitters with those known medical subject matters. Hopefully paediatricians, gynaecologists, children's nurses, midwives, breast-feeding consultants, paediatric preventive assistants, consultants for pregnant women who smoke and mothers in general will soon start to get going an effective lasting and possibly nationwide preventive campaign which will be supported by the competent social ministries and financing authorities, self-help groups, graphic designers, specialists for communication and public health scientists. The aim should be to reduce the amount of sudden infant death cases to or even below the level of The Netherlands (minimum figure in 2002: 0.11 SID cases per 1.000 live births). Already in 1972-15 years before the beginning of the Dutch preventive campaign - in former East Germany a ministerial instruction had advised mothers not to let infants sleep on prone position. Historically, the promotion of infants sleeping on prone position seems to have been a tragic break of tradition in the western world in between 1970 and 1990, as infants had been put to sleep almost only on their back during the past centuries. If we compare East and West Germany concerning the influence on the ways of looking after infants since the 1960th of the last century it has become clear that the advice of medical authorities mainly effects the way of nursing regardless of the political system. More and more, paediatricians, gynaecologists, midwives and children's nurses should become aware of this responsibility.

N2  - Interactions exist between progestins and the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subtype A where C21-steroids function as activators. Other interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH release from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen receptor. Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality of sleep. This effect seems most prominent for progesterone administered vaginally. Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit from cyclic progesterone administration. This may be because progesterone and allopregnenolone reduce meningeal release of substance P and inhibit the development of neurogenic oedema. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate. Progesterone, generated from pregnenolone by Schwann cells, also enhances myelin synthesis. Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. No reliable data exist with respect to the effects of other progestins on demyelinating disease. Progestins promote the growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma tissue. Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in these patients. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Thirty-eight 1st-time mothers were recruited from childbirth classes and were assessed at 4 different time periods: the last trimester of pregnancy, 2-4 weeks postpartum, 12-16 weeks postpartum, and 12-15 months postpartum. Measures included a daily sleep-wake diary and a depression scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). Results reveal significant differences in week-day night sleep schedules (rise time, time awake due to disruptions, and nap time) at 2-4 weeks postpartum in comparison to other times of measurement. Total sleep time and bedtime was not significantly different between times of measurement. More depressive symptoms were reported at 2-4 weeks postpartum than at later postpartum measurements. Mothers who developed clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D > or = 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum reported more total sleep time, later rise times, and more time napping at the end of pregnancy in comparison to those mothers that reported fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D < 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum.

N2  - Aim: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the sleeping environment of Irish infants. Methods: A five year population based case-control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203 SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994-98 were studied. Results: In a multivariate analysis, co-sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both as a usual practice (adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last sleep period (adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was dependent on maternal smoking (OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not significant for infants who were ≥20 weeks of age (OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 70.10) or placed back in their own cot/bed to sleep (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to 5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value ≥10 were not significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also significantly increased the SIDS risk (OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36). Conclusion: Co-sleeping should be avoided in infants who are <20 weeks of age, or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable requiring further study.

N2  - The role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in hypertension has been recently emphasized in relation to target organ damage. This review shows the importance of ABPM in a special group of patients in order to better select some pathological states. According to the European Society of Hypertension recommendations and not only, we identify the patients who can benefit from ABPM, what the most useful parameters to measure and what goals in terms of ABPM should be achieved. We focus on patients with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, sleep apnea syndrome, after heart transplantation, pregnancy and children. Evidence presented in this article demonstrates the high prevalence of a blunted circadian blood pressure profile, its clinical relevance in these patients, and the need to achieve the lowest blood pressure throughout 24-hour in order to prevent both cardiovascular and renal risk. In these special states ABPM can be used because of its prognostic value, as a predictor of complications and also serves as a marker of treatment efficacy.

N2  - Adipose tissue is essential for the normal development of female reproductive function, however, obesity causes menstrual disturbances and subfertility. The severity of obesity and the distribution of fat tissue are important factors that influence the female reproductive system. Obesity results from combined genetic and environmental factors and is one of the most frequent diseases and is encountered all over the world. A body mass index (BMI) that is either high or low is associated with reduced probability of achieving pregnancy in women. Body mass affects reproduction by causing menstrual disturbance and anovulation. During the last decades the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms of this relationship were gradually elucidated. The obesity influences the reproductive cycle by impaired estrogen metabolism, changes in the concentration of sex hormone binding (SHBG) globulin, hyperinsulinaemia, and probably also leptin levels. The role of leptin still remains unclear in human reproduction, though there is growing evidence that it seems to play an important role. This increased BMI is also associated with the risk of several diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular diseases, sleep apnoea syndrome, breast cancer, cancer of the uterus and besides impairment of reproductive functions. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - In a wide sense, a palliative agent is a remedy that attenuates some symptoms associated with a disease, whereas a therapeutic agent is the one capable of curing a disease. Marihuana (Cannabis sativa) is a plant from Central Asia and its main active components (cannabinoids) are three: tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol and cannabidiol. They possess psychotropic and vegetative effects and, empirically, are reputed to exert some supposedly therapeutic actions involving the control of pain, vomiting, intraocular pressure and many other ailments. In agreement with official data from the "Consejo Nacional contra las Adicciones" (CONADIC, Mexico), during 1998-2000, the most extensively abused substances were marihuana, cocaine and industrial solvents. The consumption of marihuana in Mexico has increased with time. The average prevalence of the use of cannabis among the urban population from 12 to 65 years of age is 5.3%. The cities with the highest consumption of marihuana are Tijuana (14.7%), Ciudad Juárez (9.2%), Guadalajara (7.5%), Mexico City (7.3%), Monterrey (4.1%) and Matamoros (3.6%), a fact that indicates that the north-central region of Mexico is the most affected. Marihuana is the main drug consumed by almost all age groups without any distinction of gender. The consumption is predominantly higher in males (13.9%) than in females (6.9%), and among children from 12 to 17 years old who do not live with their families. The percentage of adolescents consuming marihuana is larger among youths who are not students (4.2%) than in the student population (1.3%). Thus, marihuana consumption is a real problem of public health in Mexico. The existence of at least two receptors to cannabinoids is well known, as well as a group of substances synthesized by the organism itself, denominated endocannabinoids, whose pharmacological properties resemble those of the plant. These observations have caused some parliamentary discussions that have led some countries to approve the use of the synthetic cannabinoid-related substances for therapeutic purposes. In the present review, recent literature was analyzed in order to offer an objective scientific perspective about the use of marihuana. Five relevant observations are pointed out: 1) Studies with positive findings, lack adequate controls. 2) The standards of comparison used, are not the most suitable, for example, the supposed analgesic property of cannabinoids is commonly compared with codeine, and the possible antiemetic capability of cannabinoids is not compared with well-known commercial and safe drugs with verified potency, such as the 5HT 3 receptor subtype agonist, odansetron. 3) Some authors claim that the plant may acts as a whole, and therefore some of the synthetic cannabinoids approved in other countries for therapeutic uses might not produce notable effects. 4) Only a few patients experience some improvement in their symptoms; however most of them experience the psychotropic actions of cannabinoids. And, 5) there are ethical aspects to reconsider in the case of patients who never before had consumed cannabinoids. The following aspects of the clinical use of cannabinoids are discussed in this review. For example, diverse reports suggest that marihuana increases food intake through CB1 receptor-stimulation producing hyperphage by itself, as well as anorexia related to immunodeficiency syndrome and cancer treatment. However, these patients also experience the psychotropic side-effects of marihuana and which lead them to leave the treatment. Regarding pain, cannabinoids produce spinal analgesia in experimental animals, which might be mediated by suppression of neuronal nocyceptive activity and the activation of opioid receptors. Nevertheless, most researchers who are exploring the efficacy of cannabinoids in pain treatment employ codeine as a reference, although codeine is in disuse due to its vegetative effects and poor potency, and do not compare it with other powerful analgesics such as opioids or prostaglandin inhibitors. In the immunologic system, cannabinoids act on CB2 receptors, decreasing the function of immune T and B cells, killer cells and macrophages. Therefore, infection processes might be increased in debilitated patients. By contrast, the immunosuppressant action of cannabinoids could be useful in hyperactivity of the immunologic system, as in the case of multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, recent findings suggest that a lipid imbalance (mainly with arachidonic acid) is a primary factor in the etiology of cystic fibrosis. Since the endocannabinoids are fatty acid derivatives, it has been hypothesized that the patients who suffer cystic fibrosis can receive benefits by the administration of cannabinoids (i.e. restoring the balance between fatty acids, reducing the symptoms and increasing life expectancies). Regardind reproduction research, prenatal cannabinoid exposure has been associated with a high perinatal morbidity but the possible long-term consequences are still poorly understood. Therefore, animal models of perinatal cannabinoid exposure have provided a useful tool for examining the developmental effects of the offspring. Results show alteration in the ontogeny of spontaneous locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. Adult animals exposed during pregnancy and lactation exhibited persistent alterations of the behavioral response to novelty, social interactions and sexual behavior. However, available data regarding the long-term behavioral and cognitive effects in humans are scarce to be compared with animal results. In other studies, some endocannabinoids generated in monocytes and platelets show that they are potent vasodilators and related to hypotension following hemorrhagic shock. Thus, animals treated with anandamide reduce their survival rate. In contrast, administration of the CB1 antagonist (SR141716A) increases the arterial pressure, the respiratory frequency and the survival rate in a dose-response manner. Thus, inhibition of the endogenous cannabinoids reverts the hemorrhagic shock with notorious efficacy, similar to endogenous opioids. In this sense, some other reports suggest that cannabinoids are useful to treat glaucoma, because cannabis reduces intraocular pressure in 60% of the users, although there are other drugs lacking psychotropic effects with proved and accepted efficacy in the treatment of glaucoma. Marihuana may also have certain anticonvulsivant properties; however delta-9THC alters sleep patterns in humans and could not be recommendable. In spite of some positive reports on the treatment of partial or tonic-clonic seizures, there is a lack of controlled studies.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a circadian clock, is present by mid-gestation in human and non-human primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone secretion generally developing after two months of age. Showing the importance of photic regulation of circadian phase in infants, exposure of premature infants to low-intensity cycled lighting results in the early establishment of rest-activity patterns that are in phase with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. With the continued elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will become an increasingly important component of neonatal care.

N2  - Investigations on using of index possibilities of L-arginin/NO system in evaluation of sanatorium-resort treatment effectiveness of pregnant with cardiovascular disorders were conducted. It was analyzed the dynamics of twenty four hour cycle rhythm of L-arginin and total nitrites and nitrates constance in saliva of 58 pregnant, 20 of which were suffering from metabolic cardiomyopathy, 23-from neurocirculatory dystonia and 15 were healthy pregnant. As the result of examination there were found out considerable changes of parameter values of biological rhythms: duration of rhythm, average twenty four hour cycle range of activity, amount of difference between max index per twenty hour cycle and average index per twenty hour cycle, period of max and min activity. Analysis of tendencies of twenty four hour cycles rhythms concerning dynamics of sanatorium-resort treatment will give possibility to define characteristic features of recovering values of this parameter.

N2  - Purpose of review: Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy. The spectrum of association between pregnancy and sleep disturbances ranges from an increased incidence of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and parasomnias (especially restless legs syndrome) to snoring and excessive sleepiness. These disturbances occur as a result of physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes associated with pregnancy. Although the timing and occurrence of different sleep disorders varies, they are most prevalent during the third trimester. Despite reports of the various sleep problems, the exact nature and incidence of sleep disorders in pregnancy is not known. Given that limitation, we are presenting an up-to-date review of the current understanding of the relation between sleep and pregnancy. Recent findings: Studies suggest that pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways. There are hormonal changes, physiologic changes, physical factors, and behavioral changes in a pregnant woman-all of which may affect her sleep. They may affect the duration and quality of sleep and lead to a variety of sleep disorders. Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Particular attention may be given to obese pregnant women who would gain more weight during pregnancy or those who develop hypertensive conditions (eg, preeclampsia). Snoring may be more common in women with preeclampsia and the pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep may be enhanced in preeclamptic women when compared with those with obstructive sleep apnea alone. Several investigators have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be common in pregnant women despite the presence of intrinsic mechanisms that seem to be geared towards preventing sleep apnea. However, the exact incidence and prevalence of sleep apnea in pregnant women is uncertain. In addition, it is unclear if criteria that are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to pregnant women. Further investigations are needed to determine if lower thresholds for management of OSA should be used in pregnant women to prevent harm to the fetus. Summary: In conclusion, sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy though the full extent of this relation remains undefined. Large, multi-center, prospective studies are needed for better understanding.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing can occur during pregnancy due to the development of hormonal changes and respiratory function abnormalities that perturb patency of the upper airways. Habitual snoring has been described in 25 p. 100 of the women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The incidence of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome is unknown due to the lack of longitudinal epidemiological data, and results of the main studies are in favor of upper airway resistance syndrome. However, these sleep-related breathing disorders are more frequently associated with maternal and fotal complications such as maternal hypertension, pre eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. This article points out the importance of such associations because of the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure on the regression of these nocturnal respiratory and vascular complications.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To understand prevalence of sleep problems and presence of improper sleep habit of children aged one to 23 months in Shanghai, and to identify their related factors. METHODS: Totally, 1 252 normal children, without severe illness and abnormal delivery history, aged one to 23 months were randomly selected from five districts of Shanghai. Under strict quality control system, their parents were interviewed with questionnaire to look into their familial and social environment, as well as sleep-related factors. RESULTS: Fully-completed information was obtained in 1 129 of 1 252 children, with a response rate of 90.18%. Prevalence of sleep problems in children was 65.90% in Shanghai, remarkably higher than in the other areas. Prevalence of nightmare, level of fright at night, snore and sleep apnea in boys were significantly higher than those in girls. Prevalence of improper sleep habit in children was also higher, including sleeping with their parents, parental presence at sleep onset and irregular sleep time. Main risk factors related to children's sleep problems were maternal anxiety, children's irregular sleep time, parental presence at sleep onset, difficulty-type temperament and maternal poor sleep during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: In Shanghai, prevalence of sleep problems in children aged one to 23 months was relatively higher and main risk factors for them were social, cultural and familial environment, especially negligence of cultivating proper sleep habit and parental improper response to children's poor sleep behavior.

N2  - Severe maternal neurologic injury during pregnancy has the potential for fetal demise without advanced critical care support to the mother. Brain death is the unequivocal and irreversible loss of total brain function, whereas patients in a vegetative state, by contrast, have preserved brain stem function but lack cerebral function. They can appear to be awake, have sleep-wake cycles, be capable of swallowing, and have normal respiratory control, but there are no purposeful interactions. These conditions have different maternal prognoses, but both have resulted in near-normal neonatal outcomes with long latencies from maternal injury to delivery in previously published cases. This article compares and contrasts the 11 cases of brain death with 15 cases of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy. We found that the mean latency between maternal brain injury and delivery was significantly shorter in the brain-dead patients as compared with those in a vegetative state (46 days vs. 124 days, P≤.001). Correspondingly, the gestational ages at delivery (29.7 weeks vs. 33.2 weeks, P≤.01) and the birth weights (1380 g vs. 2145 g, P≤.01) were shorter in duration and smaller in size in the brain-dead group. We also present a case of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy at our institution with both maternal and neonatal death in the context of previously published literature with a focus on obstetric and ethical management. We hope this information will help elucidate the issues for providers confronted with these unique and challenging cases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct, in a randomized placebo-controlled manner, social behavior testing on mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam. STUDY DESIGN: A previously described, clinically relevant dose of 0.32 mg/kg of alprazolam (n = 8 mice) or a placebo (n = 9 mice) was given to gravid C57BL/6 mice by gavage on gestational day 18. Social play, sleep/ wake patterns, and male aggression of the exposed offspring were assessed during prejuvenile, juvenile, and adult periods. RESULTS: Alprazolam did not produce treatment differences in pregnancy outcomes or in dam-pup interactions. Compared with the placebo group, alprazolam-exposed offspring demonstrated less desire to escape (P<.01), more desire to remain alone (P<.02), and shorter periods of being awake (P<.03) on PND 17. Alprazolam-exposed male offspring exhibited more aggression on food restriction (P<.01) and on cage changing (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam demonstrated more individual rather than group activities, avoidance of open areas, and aggression in males. Correlation of these findings in humans is encouraged.

N2  - The rate of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among American Indian infants in the Northern Plains is almost 6 times higher than in U.S. white infants. In a study of infant mortality among Northern Plains Indians, we tested the hypothesis that receptor binding abnormalities to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in SIDS cases, compared with autopsied controls, occur in regions of the medulla oblongata that contain 5-HT neurons and that are critical for the regulation of cardiorespiration and central chemosensitivity during sleep, i.e. the medullary 5-HT system. Tritiated-lysergic acid diethylamide binding to 5-HT1A-D and 5-HT2 receptors was measured in 19 brainstem nuclei in 23 SIDS and 6 control infants using tissue receptor autoradiography. Binding in the arcuate nucleus, a part of the medullary 5-HT system along the ventral surface, in the SIDS infants (mean age-adjusted binding 7.1 ± 0.8 fmol/mg tissue, n = 23) was significantly lower than in controls (mean age-adjusted binding 13.1 ± 1.6 fmol/mg tissue, n = 5) (p = 0.003). Binding also demonstrated significant diagnosis X age interactions (p < 0.04) in 4 other nuclei that are components of the 5-HT system. These data suggest that medullary 5-HT dysfunction can lead to sleep-related, sudden death in affected SIDS infants, and confirm the same binding abnormalities reported by us in a larger dataset of non-American Indian SIDS and control infants. This study also links 5-HT abnormalities in the arcuate nucleus with exposure to adverse prenatal exposures, i.e. cigarette smoking (p = 0.011) and alcohol (p = 0.075), during the periconceptional period or throughout pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke and/or alcohol may contribute to abnormal fetal medullary 5-HT development in SIDS infants.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine health problems of citizens of the city of Obihiro with reference to the Healthy Japan 21 plan. METHOD: The subjects were a total of 2,000 men and women (6-74 years old) who were selected at random from the resident ledger of Obihiro. The questionnaire included the 6 fields (nutrient intake/dietary habits, physical activity/exercise, rest/mental health, tobacco, alcohol, dental health) of Healthy Japan 21. The path-analysis model was used by sex, in order to examine the relationship between lifestyle factors (dietary habits, restful sleep, stress, smoking habits, alcohol intake) and subjective health. RESULTS: A total of 979 subjects (49.0%) responded. The items that showed a higher proportion than for all Japan were as follows: the proportions of persons who felt stress, required a drug or alcohol to sleep, drank heavily, and were female smokers. In questions about the harm caused to health by smoking, the following items showed lower awareness than deserved: bronchitis, gastric ulcer, problems with regard to pregnancy, and periodontitis. The following characteristics were found in the path-analysis: 1) If sleep rest is sufficient, subjective health is unaffected by stress in men and women; 2) Smoking affects dietary habits in men and women, especially in the latter; 3) Heavy smoking affects subjective health in men and women independent of whether dietary habits are good; 4) There is a positive relation between drinking and subjective health in women. CONCLUSION: This study showed that stress and smoking are problems for the health of citizens of the city of Obihiro, and suggested that the best measure to counter stress is sufficient sleep, while to counter smoking spread of knowledge about the harm to health caused by smoking is best.

N2  - The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides, Canidae, Carnivora) is a middle-sized omnivore with excessive autumnal fattening and winter sleep. We studied adaptations of the species to boreal climate and photoperiod by following the plasma reproductive and thyroid hormone concentrations of farm-bred raccoon dogs (n=32) for 12 months. On August 16, 2000, and February 8, 2001, half of the raccoon dogs received continuous-release melatonin implants (the MEL group). The other half was sham-operated (the SHAM group). Between November 27, 2000, and January 25, 2001, half of the animals of both groups were fasted. The plasma testosterone concentrations of the MEL males peaked in February, a month earlier than in the SHAM males. Autumnal melatonin treatment also advanced the gestation period reflected by the plasma progesterone concentrations by seven weeks. Food deprivation in winter seems to accentuate the sex steroid response during the mating as the fasted males had higher testosterone concentrations than the fed males in February and March. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a circadian clock, are present by mid-gestation in human and non-human primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone secretion generally developing after two months of age. With the continued elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will become an increasingly important component of neonatal care.

N2  - Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one) influence central nervous system (CNS) excitability by increasing GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) inhibitory activity. Allopregnanolone concentrations are higher in the fetal compared to the adult ovine brain, suggesting that this neurosteroid may have a role in regulating fetal CNS activity during gestation. We examined the localisation of allopregnanolone-sensitive GABAA receptors in the fetal brain to determine if their sensitivity to allopregnanolone changed during late gestation. The binding of [35S] tert-butylbicyclophosothionate (TBPS) was used to identify the GABA-chloride ion receptor complex in fetal sheep brains at 90-95, 115-120 and 140-145 days gestational age (GA; term ∼147 days), by autoradiography. Allopregnanolone (200 nM) reduced [35S]TBPS binding by 70-100% throughout the brain at all fetal ages examined. The levels of [35S]TBPS binding increased with advancing gestation in all regions examined except some areas of the medulla. Functionally related nuclei and brain areas associated with regulating somato/viscerosensory functions displayed high levels of [35S]TBPS binding from mid-gestation. These results indicate that allopregnanolone may interact with GABAA receptors to inhibit fetal CNS activity from mid-gestation. This inhibition may contribute to maintaining the sleep-like behaviour and low incidence of arousal-type activity typical of fetal life, and may be neuroprotective by limiting excitatory neurotransmission. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation. Peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), related to activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), prevent alcohol-induced damage in a mouse model of FAS. Our objective was to characterize ADNP in this model to relate this protein to the mechanisms of damage and peptide neuroprotection. STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57BI6/J mice were treated on day 8. Groups were control, alcohol, peptide pretreatment, or peptide alone. Embryo and decidua were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days. To evaluate ADNP expression, real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed with results presented as the ratio of ADNP-to-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) concentration. Analysis of variance was performed for overall comparisons with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: At 6 hours, there was no difference in ADNP between alcohol-exposed embryos compared with control embryos. At 24 hours, there was an increase in ADNP in alcohol-exposed embryos compared with controls (P < .001); these findings persisted at 10 days (P < .001). In the decidua at 6 hours, there was no difference between alcohol and control. At 24 hours, there was greater ADNP in alcohol-exposed decidua compared with controls (P < .001), which did not persist at 10 days (P = .97). Peptide pretreatment did not prevent the alcohol-induced increase in ADNP in embryo or decidua. CONCLUSION: Alcohol increased embryonic and decidual ADNP expression at 24 hours and it persisted in the embryo for 10 days. Because ADNP is a known neuroprotectant, these findings suggest that it may be released as a protective mechanism in FAS. Changes in the embryo were persistent suggesting that the embryo is more vulnerable to alcohol-induced damage than the mother.

N2  - Pregnancy is associated with significant alterations in respiratory function. Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen (A-αPO2) and in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related apneas or hypopneas, these could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because of the conflicting data from sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2, every 2h. The frequency of apneas and hypopneas was significantly lower during pregnancy compared with that on the postpartum control night. PaO2 levels in the supine position, during sleep, were also significantly lower during pregnancy compared to the postpartum period. No correlation was observed between PaO2 levels and apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The origin of sleep and circadian rhythms development is found during the fetal period. Both quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep are distinguishable during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Comparable to fetuses, low risk preterm infants recorded at 30-40 weeks postconceptional age, had a similar development of sleep i.e. an increase in quiet sleep and a decrease in indeterminate sleep. A further development in sleep organization characterized by increased slow wave and spindle activity during quiet sleep and coupling with circadian rhythm takes place during the first 6 months of life in both term and preterm infants. Circadian rhythm of fetal heart rate synchronized with maternal rest-activity, heart rate, cortisol, melatonin, and body temperature rhythms is present during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Although maternally influenced, circadian rhythm antenatally becomes ultradian at birth. Both preterm and term infants show a significant increase in circadian body temperature rhythm amplitude during the first 3 months of life. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Little is known about sex differences in human fetal heart and behaviour. Patients and methods: One hundred twenty-three nulliparous healthy women carrying a male (n=56) or female (n=67) fetus participated in this study. All pregnancies remained uncomplicated and delivery was uneventful. Ultrasound observation of fetal general movements (GM) was performed for 1 h at 15-17 (T1) and 27-28 (T2) weeks of gestation and for 2 h at 37-39 weeks (T3). Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring occurred simultaneously with fetal ultrasound observations at T2 and T3. The incidence of GM (percentage of time), FHR and its variability, and the incidences of fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) A-D and behavioural states 1F-4F were compared between boys and girls. Results: There were no significant differences between males and females in the distribution of HRP A-D, overall behavioural state distribution, and basal FHR, FHR variability or the presence of GM during quiet and active sleep (or during HRP A and HRP B, respectively). A Time×Sex interaction effect for GM assessed for total record length and a higher %GM in male fetuses at term age were the only significant findings. However, these observations lost statistical significance after adjustment for the effects of fetal wakefulness, which occurred to a higher extent in male than in female fetuses. Conclusion: Our data do not provide evidence for a difference in fetal functional development or maturation between the two sexes. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Thirty-four experts and a literature supervisor got together in order to reach a 'consensus' regarding the definition, diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of insomnia. Insomnia is a subjective perception of dissatisfaction with the amount and/or quality of sleep. It includes difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or early awakening with inability to fall asleep again. It is associated with complaints of non-restorative sleep and dysfunction of diurnal alertness, energy, cognitive function, behaviour or emotional state, with a decrease in quality of life. The diagnosis is based on clinical and sleep history, physical examination and additional tests, although polysomnography is not routinely indicated. Therapy should include treatment of the underlying causes, cognitive and behavioural measures and drug treatment. Hypnotic therapy can be prescribed from the onset of insomnia and non-benzodiazepine selective agonists of the GABA-A receptor complex are the drugs of first choice. It is recommended that hypnotic treatment be maintained in cases where withdrawal impairs the patient's quality of life and when all other therapeutic measures have failed. Experience suggests that intermittent treatment is better than continuous therapy. The available data do not confirm safety of hypnotics in pregnancy, lactation and childhood insomnia. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in decompensated chronic pulmonary disease but no significant adverse effects on respiratory function have been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone in stable mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in treated obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Data for zaleplon are inconclusive. If the patient recovers subjective control over the sleep process, gradual discontinuation of hypnotic treatment can be considered.

N2  - This longitudinal study investigated sleep-wake behavior patterns during and after pregnancy, using an actimeter worn on the non-dominant wrist and a sleep log. Records were obtained from ten mothers, from the 34th week of gestation until the 15th week postpartum. Ten non-pregnant women were used as a control group, data being collected from them for 2 weeks. The sleep-wake behavior after delivery, obtained from wrist actigraphy, was greater in the postpartum period. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and circadian amplitude decreased in the weeks immediately following parturition, but wake after sleep onset increased. Subsequently, all the sleep and circadian variables improved slightly, but they had not returned to the levels of the non-pregnant control group even by the 15th postpartum week. The length of daytime naps increased, in order to make up for nocturnal sleep deprivation when the number of awakenings during nighttime had increased. There were significant positive correlations between total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and the length of daytime naps, but the numbers of awakenings at night and daytime naps did not show this correlation. The total sleep time indicated by sleep logs tended to be greater than that indicated by actigraphy, but wake after sleep onset tended to be underestimated by the sleep logs. The implications of these results are discussed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a support binder for low back pain in pregnancy. DESIGN: Pilot study, using a prospective, two-group design with repeated measures. SETTING: Ambulatory maternity clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Women of at least 20 weeks gestation with low back pain, but no preexisting back or disc disease. Thirty women assigned to the intervention group and 10 to a comparison group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a pain assessment at pretest. Intervention participants received a maternity support binder to wear while awake for 2 weeks. At an appointment 2 weeks later, a posttest questionnaire and a taped interview were administered. The comparison group participants received the support binder after the second appointment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain intensity, duration, and effect on daily activities were assessed using a pain in pregnancy questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group had significant reduction in mean pain scores and effect of pain on daily activities, including family, house and yard, recreational, exercise, and sleep. Interaction of group by time was significant for change in pain and effect on family, house and yard, and exercise activities. CONCLUSION: The use of a support binder for pregnancy-related low back pain is a promising intervention and was well-accepted by the participants.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate prenatal to postnatal changes in first-time parents' physical and mental health, and to describe social and health predictors of parents' postpartum health. Methods: This prospective study surveyed 261 expectant fathers and mothers during pregnancy and again at 6 months' postpartum regarding their health, partner, and work characteristics. Postpartum changes in health were evaluated by paired t tests, and predictors of postpartum health were determined using multiple regression analyses. Results: Both fathers and mothers experienced significant postpartum declines in perceived quality of life. In addition, fathers reported an increase in the number of days ill and a decrease in general health and vitality after childbirth. Mothers perceived an increase in vitality despite their diminishing sleep. Parents' postpartum health was associated with mothers' partner satisfaction, fewer illness days, and certain work characteristics, such as total work time and the balance of work between mothers and fathers. Conclusions: Both mothers and fathers experienced declines in health that persisted at least 6 months after the birth of their first child. Notably, postpartum health was associated with partner satisfaction and work characteristics. This information might be used to develop interventions for improving parents' health during this vulnerable time.

N2  - One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify: 1) what kinds of sleep problems that pregnant women experience in Japan; and 2) the relationships between sleep problems and month of pregnancy, sleep problems and the number of pregnancies, and sleeping hours, by means of a questionnaire given to pregnant women in Japan. Conditions to assure good quality sleep were studied. METHODS: Of 500 obstetric facilities which were randomly selected from areas surveyed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 260 finally agreed to participate in this study. Women who had their pregnancy confirmed and were on a revisit to the 260 obstetric facilities were enrolled. These pregnant women completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires during the waiting time for treatment and submitted them to the obstetric facilities in sealed envelopes. The questionnaire covered personal attributes such as age and highest level of education, pregnancy status, working status, and patterns of smoking and alcohol drinking. Sleep-related items such as 1) subjective sleep quality, 2) difficulty in getting to sleep, 3) frequent awakenings, 4) waking up too early, 5) sleeping hours and 6) daytime drowsiness were also included. RESULTS: The month of pregnancy was significantly related to four sleep-related items, including difficulty in getting to sleep and waking up too early. With respect to the relationship between the number of pregnancies and sleep problems, significance was found for five sleep-related items, including subjective sleep quality and waking up too early. Poor subjective sleep quality was significantly related to sleeping less than seven hours and whether or not pregnant women had a regular job. It was also suggested that the greater the number of pregnancies, the shorter the sleeping hours. When responses to each sleep-related item were compared between pregnant women and the general population, the former were more likely to have sleep problems. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that as well as the number of pregnancies and month of pregnancy with sleeping hours may be factor intimately related to sleep problems during pregnancy. A good quality sleep during pregnancy is vital for normal maternal health and fetal growth and sufficient sleeping hours are therefore needed. Attention should therefore be paid to the finding that pregnant women were more likely to have sleep problems than the general population.

N2  - Intermittent hypoxia (IH), one of the hallmarks of obstructive sleep apnea, occurs more frequently during pregnancy. We hypothesized that IH may lead to persistent postnatal changes in respiratory responses to acute hypoxia and may also lead to adverse effects on spatial function learning as revealed by the Morris water maze. To examine this issue, time-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to IH and room air (IHRA; 21 and 10% O2 alternations every 90 seconds) or to normoxia (RARA) until delivery. Ventilatory and metabolic responses to a 20-minute acute hypoxic challenge (10% O2) were conducted at postnatal ages 5, 10, 15, and 30 days. In addition, spatial task learning was assessed in the water maze at 1 and 4 months of age. Normoxic ventilation was higher at all time points in IHRA rats than in RARA rats (p < 0.01). Peak hypoxic ventilatory responses were attenuated in IHRA rats at 5 days of age and hypoxic ventilatory depression was accentuated at this age as well. However, ventilatory equivalents (minute ventilation/oxygen consumption) revealed significant reductions in peak hypoxic ventilatory responses of IHRA rats and hypoxic ventilatory depression at all postnatal ages (p < 0.01). Acquisition and retention of a spatial task were similar in the IHRA and RARA groups at both 1 and 4 months of age. We conclude that gestational intermittent hypoxia elicits long-lasting alterations in the control of breathing. We postulate that such IH-induced respiratory plasticity may create selective vulnerability to hypoxia during development.

N2  - The interest in studying the brain electrical activity as a function of the development of intelligence has been spurred by the need to understand how the brain responds to environmental information. The description of sleep in mentally retarded children reveals deviant patterns of the EEG-spindles and of the eye movement activity (REM sleep) when compared to normal children. The patterns may be considered as a valuable index of mental function. According to experimental evidence, the distribution of the eye movements of sleep appears either as random or ordered. The latter are altered in the mentally handicapped in whom the appearance out of chaos, of the order which is needed for intelligence and memory to function, is altered. The sleep signs are redundant as from birth. Their pattern is also related to the psychomotor development of the infant. If their distribution remains random, or appears in long uninterrupted sequences of waves as in epilepsy, intelligence does not develop. A similar strategy appears to function in the foetus when nature organizes the structures that will lead to the development of intelligence. The eye movement patterns of sleep change in the pregnant women as a function of term and resemble those of premature babies of a similar gestational age. They also change as a function of the menstrual cycle and more generally as a function of age. The hypothesis that attention is the diurnal equivalent of REM sleep is discussed. Attempts at modelling the eye movement patterns of REM sleep as a function of near zero gravity environments have been made. 1) By means of a Montecarlo simulation using the semi Markov model during the Spacelab 1 flight. 2) With the method of the single and multiple g-phase transition analysis of the strange attractor dimension (d) during parabolic flights. The implication of the latter for the neural processes involved in learning is that the central nervous system can preserve intact, from input to output, over a period of several days, all the information it receives 3) The relation between spindles and eye movements has also been viewed by a quantum approach which is another medium between the information and the way of describing it.

N2  - The physiological significance of spectral and fractal components of spontaneous heart rate (HR) variability in the fetus remains unclear. To examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different measures of HR variability, R-R interval time series obtained by fetal ECGs were recorded continuously over 24 h in five pregnant sheep at 116-125 days gestation. Conventional measures of short-term (STV) and long-term variability (LTV), low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 cycles/beat) and high-frequency (HF; 0.2-0.5 cycles/beat) spectral powers, the LF-to-HF ratio, and fractal dimension values were calculated from 24-h ECG recordings and quantified every 60 min. STV, LTV, and LF and HF spectral powers were minimal during the day but increased significantly to their highest values at night. We found a significant positive correlation between these measures, whereas the cosinor method showed significant similarity between their circadian rhythm patterns. Fetal R-R intervals also exhibited fractal structures. Fetal HR variability had a fractal structure, which was similar between day and night. These results suggested that the circadian rhythms exhibited by STV and LTV during the day were mainly due to changes in frequency components rather than to fractal components of fetal HR fluctuation.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered. Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk factor for preterm labor and birth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the physiological stability and behavioral effects of co-bedding with those of single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in incubators as well as the psychological effects on their parents. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, repeated measure. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16 infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and 11 parents in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in incubators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and posttesting for parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during baseline and activity. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group) analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight, feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group, except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents desire this intervention.

N2  - Aim: To determine any variation in the respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia of infants born small for gestational age (SGA) to smoking and to non-smoking mothers. Methods: A total of 70 average for gestational age (AGA) infants (>36 weeks gestation, >2500 g, >25th centile for gestational age, and no maternal smoking), and 47 SGA infants (<10th centile for gestational age) were studied at 1 and 3 months of age, in quiet and active sleep. Respiratory test gases were delivered through a Perspex hood to simulate face down rebreathing by slowly allowing the inspired air to be altered to a CO2 maximum of 5% and O2 minimum of 13.5%. The change in ventilation with inspired CO2 was measured over 5-6 minutes of the test. The slope of a linear curve fit relating inspired CO2 to the logarithm of ventilation was taken as a quantitative measure of ventilatory asphyxial sensitivity (VAS). Results: There was no significant difference in VAS between the AGA and SGA infants (0.25 v 0.24). However within the SGA group, VAS was significantly higher (p = 0.048) in the infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (0.26 (0.01); n = 24) than in those that did not (0.23 (0.01); n = 23). The change in minute ventilation was significantly higher in the smokers than the non-smokers group (141% v 119%; p = 0.03) as the result of a significantly larger change in respiratory rate (8 v 4 breaths/min; p = 0.047) but not tidal volume. Conclusions: Maternal smoking appears to be the key factor in enhancing infants' respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia, irrespective of gestational age.

N2  - Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H2O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). We demonstrated no difference between smoking and non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.001), and in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p<0.05). BHR was significantly elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p<0.01) and in the prone position at 2-3 (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). Increases in heart rate (ΔHR%) following arousal were significantly greater in the supine compared to the prone position in QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and in AS at both 2-3 (p<0.01) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). ΔHR% was significantly greater in AS compared to QS in both supine (p<0.05) and prone (p<0.001) positions at 2-3 weeks and in the supine position at 2-3 months (p<0.001). We conclude that sleep state, sleep position and postnatal age affect the cardiac responses following arousal from sleep in healthy term infants. Impairment of heart rate control in the prone position may be important in understanding the increased risk for SIDS in this position. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Studies of sleep across the life cycle in women have utilized both survey and polysomnographic techniques, but have tended to be of small sample size with diverse methodology. As a result, definitive conclusions about the impact of the menstrual cycle and use of oral contraceptives on sleep parameters cannot yet be made. Sleep disruption during pregnancy and postpartum is nearly universal, but effective and practical countermeasures are still needed. Longitudinal studies of sleep in the postpartum period are also lacking. Menopause is associated with insomnia due to several factors including hot flashes, mood disorders and increased sleep-disordered breathing. The use of hormone replacement therapy to treat sleep and other variables is an active area of investigation. In summary, much research is required to fully elucidate the impact of the life cycle on sleep parameters in women. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traditional surgical approaches, such as gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion, are accepted by less than 1% of the severely obese each year. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has been in clinical use for 8 years and it is timely to look at the developments in technique and to look at the outcomes for safety, effectiveness, and acceptability. Data are based on our clinical experiences and research reports derived from 1145 patients treated to date by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. We have also drawn on the published literature and on a systematic review of the literature about LAGB published by the Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures-Surgical. Generally reports that have included more than 100 patients and 3 or more years of follow-up have been selected. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has proved to be a safe procedure, 7 to 10 times safer than gastric bypass in terms of mortality, and associated with few perioperative complications. Late events have been more frequent with prolapse of the stomach through the band occurring in 15% of our initial patients and erosion of the band into the stomach in 3.2% of our initial patients. Both complications are treatable laparoscopically and have become less common with modifications of technique. Weight loss is gradual but progressive over the first 2 years and has stabilized at about 50% of excess weight lost for the next 4 years. There are major associated improvements in the multiple comorbidities of obesity including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sleep disordered breathing, comorbidities of pregnancy, and the quality of life (QOL). Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has several attributes that potentially will enable it to overcome the community's resistance to bariatric surgery. It has proved to be safe. It is highly effective in achieving good weight loss, major improvements in health, and improved QOL. Because of the laparoscopic placement, adjustablity, and the easy reversibility, LAGB can provide these benefits in a gentle and safe way.

N2  - The interactions of 3-month-old infants and their depressed mothers were classified as intrusive, withdrawn or good interactions. Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy. The depressed mothers and their newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation. Despite these group similarities, the infants of the "good interaction" mothers did not show high amounts of indeterminate sleep and they received better scores on the Brazelton scale. The more organized behaviors of these newborns may have contributed to the better interaction ratings of the "good interaction" depressed mothers. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP) determinations are still the "gold standard" for diagnosing gestational hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed 2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women for 48h every 4wks from the first hospital visit until delivery. Women were divided for comparative purposes into three groups: "detected" gestational hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP > 140/90 mm Hg after 20 wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy; "undetected" gestational hypertension, women with office BP < 140/90 mm Hg but hyperbaric index consistently above the threshold for diagnosis; and normotension, women with both office values and hyperbaric index below the respective thresholds for diagnosis. Small and insignificant differences in the 24h mean BP between "detected" and "undetected" gestational hypertension is observed in all trimesters, in contrast with highly significant differences between these two groups and normotensive pregnancies. Normotensive women are characterized by highly significant lesser incidence by 60% in preterm delivery, 70% in intrauterine growth retardation, and 50% in delivery by cesarean section (p < 0.001) compared with women with "detected" and "undetected" gestational hypertension (p > 0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy.

N2  - The author begins by describing the topographic location and qualification of the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) which is the well point (jingxue) of the kidney channel and, being one of the "acupuncture points associated with the three areas Heaven, Earth and Man" (tiandiren sancai xue), is very widely used. The author illustrates his clinical experience with the help of seven comprehensively described case studies. In the first case study, a patient's fainting condition was attributed to an affection of wind (apoplexy, vento percussio, zhongfeng), which caused both the qi and xue to rise to the surface and to block the sensory openings. The treatment consisted of "drastic lowering" (jiangce fa) achieved at the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan). In the case of a patient who had suffered chronic headaches over a number of years as a result of the reversal (jue) of the kidney functional system, the moistening and nourishment of the kidney functional system achieved by the author by suppletive needling of the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) showed beneficial effect. A patient suffering from epistaxis owing to the drying-out of the "active juices" (jin) and heat (re) in the pulmonal functional system received acupuncture treatment using the point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) and drawing blood at point LU 11 "Lesser Yang" (metallum structivum, shaoshang) in order to cool and drain the heat (re) in the main lung channel. In another patient infertility was attributed to depletion of the kidney qi. This was remedied by suppletion via the acupuncture points KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan), REN 7 "Yin Intersection" (copulatio yin, yinjiao), REN 4 "Gate of Origin" (prima clusarum, guanyuan) and SP 6 "Three Yin Intersection" (copulatio trium yin, sanyinjiao). In this case moxibustion was also used in addition to acupuncture. This treatment is also recommended in the incidence of male fertility disorders such as erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders and oligozoospermatism. In the case of another patient with sleep disorders resulting from inadequate harmony between the heart and kidney functional systems, the kidney system was supplemented using acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan); at the same time the author used the points HE 7 "Spirit Gate" (porta shen, shenmen), P 6 "Inner Pass" (clusa interna, neiguan) and SP 6 "Three Yin intersection" (copulatio trium yin, sanyinjiao) in order to cool the evolutive phase Fire. A further patient, after severe emotional upset, was suffering repeated attacks of vomiting because of a contraflow (contravection, ni) of the liver qi which had also affected the stomach functional system. In his course of therapy the author combined the acupuncture points KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) and LIV 3 "Great Rushing" (impedimentale maius, taichong) in order to free up the liver functional system and to enrich the kidney functional system. In the treatment of emesis, particularly during pregnancy, he recommends the additional use of the further points "Golden Liquid" and "Jade Fluid" (jinjin, yuye). The final case study focuses on an infant with oral candidiasis (thrush in the mouth) as a result of glare (huo) from the heart functional system blazing to the surface. Here the author describes the stimulation of the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) using a paste made of pulverized Evodia fruit (Wuzhuyu) and vinegar. The article closes with an examination of the effect of this compound when used on adults.

N2  - The effects of shift work on physiological function through disruption of circadian rhythms are well described. However, shift work can also be associated with specific pathological disorders. This article reviews the evidence for a relationship between specific medical disorders and working at night or on shift systems. The strongest evidence exists for an association with peptic ulcer disease, coronary heart disease and compromised pregnancy outcome.

N2  - Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, sudden contractions of the skeletal muscles. They are present in normal subjects under certain conditions (during a strong voluntary contraction, sleep, sports, pregnancy) and in several pathologies such as myopathies, neuropathies, motoneuron diseases, metabolic disorders, hydroelectrolyte imbalances or endocrine pathologies. There has been considerable uncertainty in the literature regarding the classification and nomenclature of muscle cramps, both because the term "cramp" is used to indicate a variety of clinical features of muscles, leading to its use as an imprecise "umbrella" term that includes stiffness, contractures and local pain, and because the spectrum of the diseases in which it appears is wide. The purpose of the present study is to propose a simple classification to provide a framework to better recognize the full spectrum of phenomenology of muscle cramps.

N2  - In the mammal, melatonin regulates the seasonal and/or circadian rhythm of PRL levels. Since several members of the PRL gene family are expressed during late pregnancy, we investigated the relationship between the expression of placental lactogen (PL)-II-one member of the PRL family- and melatonin, as well as the placental expression of one of the receptors for melatonin, melatonin receptor 1a (Mel1a). Herein we provide the first demonstration that Mel1a is not only expressed in the rat placenta, but that it is spatially and temporally regulated throughout late pregnancy. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses show that Mel1a mRNA is localized in the rat placenta on gestational day 19, and is mainly restricted to the spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells. Interestingly, the junctional zone of the placenta at this time showed the strongest gene expression when the tissue was obtained at 16:00 h (daytime) and showed the least expression when it was obtained at 04:00 h (night-time). In contrast, the labyrinth zone showed the strongest expression in tissue obtained at night and showed the least expression in tissue obtained during the day. PL-II gene expression also exhibited a circadian rhythm but the direction of the fluctuation was exactly opposite to that of the Mel1a gene, such that at night the junctional zone had the strongest expression, while the labyrinth zone had the weakest. In vitro treatment of placental tissue with an melatonin agonist, chloromelatonin, greatly decreased PL-II mRNA levels. That Mel1a plays a regulatory role in the expression of PL-II in the late-pregnancy rat placenta is strongly suggested by the pattern of its own spatial and temporal expression. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a growing population of patients. Medical and surgical advances have increased the number of CHD adult survivors, which may create quality-of-life (QOL) issues not previously considered. Quality-of-life issues pertinent to this patient population involve health and life insurance acquisition, birth control, genetic counseling, pregnancy concerns, employment, and independent living arrangements. The purpose of this study was to describe the QOL of adults with CHD. The study used a prospective cross-sectional case-control design to examine QOL using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The study participants were a sample of 124 adults with CHD from an outpatient cardiology clinic in a metropolitan university-affiliated teaching hospital in the Northeast and 124 matched healthy control subjects. Between the participants and the matched control subjects, there was a significant difference in the total mean SIP score, the physical and psychosocial dimension scores, and all the category scores (P < 0.05). The areas of life the adults with CHD reported as lacking in quality involved the categories of work (SIP of 11.1, moderate disability) and sleep and rest (SIP of 9.03, mild disability). The results of this study indicate that the SIP can be used for quantitative and subjective QOL assessment of adults with CHD. It is suggested that cardiac advanced practice nurses use the results of this study to develop appropriate information, counseling, and anticipatory guidance for this patient population.

N2  - Snoring is common in pregnancy, and snoring pregnant women have increased rates of pre-eclampsia. Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic women (p < 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than non-pregnant women (p < 0.02), but there was no difference when supine. Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p < 0.01) in the women with pre-eclampsia (mean ± SD: 0.9 ± 0.1 cm2) than either nonpregnant (1.1 ± 0.1 cm2) or pregnant women (1.3 ± 0.1 cm2). Supine oropharyngeal junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant women (0.8 ± 0.1 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 cm2; p = 0.01) but similar in women with pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 ± 0.1 cm2; p > 0.3). The study showed that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase their blood pressure.

N2  - Development of neurotensin (NT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), vasopressin (AVP) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) expressing neurons was investigated in the human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus of nine subjects ranging from 20-40 weeks of gestation using immunocytochemistry and morphometry. Results obtained showed that NT expressing neurons developed earlier than VIP, AVP and NPY expressing neurons. Consistent with results obtained from animal studies, we also found VIP expressing neurons were born earlier than AVP expressing neurons. Whether the NT expressing neurons play a role in generating circadian rhythms in the early life of humans needs to be further investigated. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study was part of a large departmental performance improvement initiative to implement and evaluate developmental and family-centered care as "best practice" in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal was to evaluate the safety, effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded infants/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended "back to sleep" behaviors in the same infants/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU. Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU. There is a performance improvement opportunity regarding the education provided to parents of multiple-gestation infants before discharge on the "back to sleep" recommendations.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to carry out a metasynthesis of the scientific literature on the Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH), in order to highlight its importance during human pregnancy. CRH, derived from the placenta, has been defined as "a placental clock" controlling the length of pregnancy, the timing of labour and delivery. Placental CRH plasmatic concentrations rise dramatically in the last trimester of pregnancy, reaching peak values just before the onset of labour. In human beings, like in other primates, there is a functional connection between the peculiar presence of placental CRH and the foetal zone of the foetal adrenal glands. The foetal zone is the major source of the precursor (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) of the estrogens produced by the placenta. In primates, placental CRH stimulates the release of ACTH and the adrenal function, satisfying the necessity of dehydroepiandrosterone before delivery. Placental CRH also stimulates the production of cortisol and this positive feedforward circuit represents the engine of the biological clock guiding the foetal development and the growth of labour factors such as oxytocin receptors, gap junctions and prostaglandins.

N2  - Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use [40]. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies [30,43] and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that Is safe when administered directly to infants Has a low milk:plasma ratio Has a short half-life Has a high molecular weight Has high protein binding in maternal serum Is ionized in maternal plasma Is less lipophilic 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

N2  - Programmed cell death or apoptosis is an essential component of human ovarian function and development. During early fetal life approximately 7 × 106 oocytes are formed in the human ovary. However, the number of oocytes is dramatically reduced already before birth through apoptotic cell death. In reproductive life, a number of primordial follicles start growing during each menstrual cycle. Usually only one will ovulate and the fate of the rest of the follicles is atresia through the mechanism of apoptosis. Ultimately, only around 400 follicles will ovulate during a woman's reproductive life. After ovulation, the dominant follicle forms the corpus luteum, a novel endocrine gland that is responsible for the production of progesterone and maintenance of endometrium during early pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, corpus luteum action must cease so that new follicles can resume growing during the next menstrual cycle. Apoptosis is also responsible for corpus luteum regression in the human ovary. In recent years, new knowledge of the role and regulation of apoptosis in the ovary has been acquired through the use of knockout and transgenic animals. Apoptosis seems to be the mechanism that makes the female biological clock tick. The following review will discuss the role of apoptosis and its regulation of human ovarian function.

N2  - Purpose. This evaluation was conducted as part of a protocol entitled Evaluation of the Menicon Z Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lens for up to 30 Days Extended Wear. The purpose of the protocol was to compare corneal endothelial morphology changes after wearing rigid gas-permeable (RGP) Menicon Z contact lenses, continuously for up to 30 days, with ACUVUE (Johnson & Johnson Vision Care) hydrogel contact lenses, worn for up to 6 nights of extended wear. Methods. Sixty patients, who were adapted to RGP daily wear and soft contact lens daily wear, were recruited at two study sites. The thirty subjects who wore RGP daily wear lenses were fitted with the Menicon Z (tisilfocon A, oxygen permeablility [Dk] = 163) RGP contact lens comprised the test group. The control group subjects (n = 30 former users of daily wear soft contact lenses) were fitted with ACUVUE (etafilcon A, Dk = 28) hydrogel contact lenses. After a 2-week adaptation period of daily wear, subjects began extended wear. Endothelial imaging was performed at the two study sites in this multicenter study (University Hospitals of Cleveland/Case Western Reserve University Department of Ophthalmology [CWRU] and The Ohio State University [OSU]). The hydrogel lens group was instructed to wear their lenses for 7 days and 6 nights before discarding the lenses and to sleep with no lenses on the seventh night. The RGP group was permitted to wear the lenses for up to 30 days and 29 consecutive nights before removing the lenses for cleaning and overnight soaking. Results. CWRU had 24 patients (12 soft contact lens and 12 rigid contact lens) and OSU had 21 patients (12 soft contact lens and 9 rigid contact lens) who completed the study and were included in the analyses. Patients who were withdrawn from the study at CWRU included one RGP patient dropped out because of pregnancy; one RGP patient developed vascularized limbal keratitis and discomfort; one could not be fitted with a bitoric RGP; two soft lens patients moved from the area, and one dropped out because of dry eyes. At OSU, four patients dropped out due to discomfort (two in each lens type); one moved from the study area; one decided not to participate soon after the consent visit; one had worries of reduced vision at 6 months; one subject's attitude changed prior to the 6 month visit; and one subject was withdrawn for reasons of poor study schedule compliance. Conclusion. The Menicon Z lens wearers in this study did not show significant endothelial cell morphology changes after 1 year of nearly continuous contact lens wear. This finding is particularly important considering the RGP wearers in this study were older by a average of 10 years (mean age approximately 40) and had worn their contact lenses an average of almost 10 years longer than the soft contact lens wearers. © 2003 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists, Inc.

N2  - Because smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for late fetal death and the sudden infant death syndrome, we investigated cardiorespiratory defense mechanisms to hypoxia in 7 prenatally nicotine-exposed (N) lambs (approximate maternal dose: 0.5 mg/ kg/day) and 11 control (C) lambs all at an average age of 5 days. The ventilatory response to 10% oxygen (hyperpnea) was significantly attenuated during quiet sleep in N lambs compared with C lambs and in N lambs aroused from sleep later compared with C lambs (161 ± 90 versus 75 ± 66 seconds, p < 0.05). The ventilatory response to hypoxia was similar in the two groups during wakefulness (W), whereas the heart rate response (tachycardia) was significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states. The ventilatory response to hyperoxia was significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states. Transition from W to quiet sleep was associated with a significant decrease in ventilation in C lambs but not in N lambs. In conclusion, prenatal nicotine exposure, at a dose comparable with moderate smoking, blunts major elements of the cardiorespiratory defense to hypoxia, i.e., the heart rate and ventilatory and arousal responses, and abolishes the normal decrease in ventilation during sleep compared with W.

N2  - Hypertension in pregnancy is diagnosed when pressures in excess of 140/90 mmHg are repeatedly measured. A differentiation is made between pregnancy-independent hypertension, i.e. pre-existing hypertension and gestational hypertension occurring for the first time after the 20th week of the pregnancy. If hypertension is accompanied by proteinuria, the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is made. Feared complications are eclampsia and the HELLP syndrome. For blood pressure measurement, a number of peculiarities must be noted:thus,for example, in severe pre-eclampsia the circadian rhythm may reverse, with pressure increases in particular in the evening and at night. Ambulatory management may be permissible only in the case of pre-pregnancy and gestational hypertension, provided the blood pressure can be kept below 160/100. Restricting physical activity, and regular monitoring of weight, blood pressure and laboratory investigations usually suffice. If pre-eclampsia or the HELLP syndrome is suspected, the patient should be hospitalized without delay. A hypertensive crisis must prompt immediate measures to lower the blood pressure - but not too quickly, in order to avoid severe consequences for the fetus caused by inadequate uteroplacental perfusion.

N2  - Context Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal mortality among American Indians, a group whose infant death rate is consistently above the US national average. Objective To determine prenatal and postnatal risk factors for SIDS among American Indians. Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls among American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa enrolled from December 1992 to November 1996 and investigated using Standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant death review. Main Outcome Measures Association of SIDS with maternal socioeconomic and behavioral factors, health care utilization, and infant care practices. Results The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2% and 13.6%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4% and 55.4%), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7% and 54.6%) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7% of case infants and 45.5% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-26.5), any visits by a public health nurse (aOR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8), periconceptional maternal alcohol use (aOR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.6-23.3), and maternal first-trimester binge drinking (aOR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.9-35.3). Conclusions Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing are important risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.

N2  - Naturally fluctuating hormones (menstrual cycle, through pregnancy or menopausal transition) are not related to marked sleep disturbances in women. It is likely, however, that subsets of women will display a central nervous system vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations so that sleep disturbances manifest as a part of a complex of discomforting symptoms. Sleep is impacted directly through the circadian system or brain sleep regulation or through the development of concurrent functional changes and symptoms. Women are susceptible to sleep-related disorders that are also common in men, such as primary insomnia and SBD although the contributing factors and manifestations may not be the same.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underyling SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprivred of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which results in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases moternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.

N2  - PURPOSE: To present guidelines for the recognition, management, and referral of pregnancy rhinitis with a goal of improving the quality of the pregnancy experience for women afflicted with this condition. DATA SOURCES: A case study illustrating the presentation of a severe case of pregnancy rhinitis is followed a literature review of etiology, diagnosis, and management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy rhinitis is a condition of clinical importance that is frequently exacerbated by use of intranasal decongestant sprays. The resulting rhinitis medicamentosa exacerbates the nasal obstruction, with resulting sleep disruptions that negatively impact the experience of pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurse practitioners may miss opportunities to provide support, anticipatory guidance, and symptom relief. Anticipatory guidance that stresses the critical necessity of avoiding nasal spray decongestants, environmental modification, use of intranasal saline, moderate exercise, and nasal strips for subjective relief may have the potential to markedly decrease escalation of the condition to a serious disorder.

N2  - Down's syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation and although known for more than a hundred years, the underlying pathomechanisms for the phenotype and abnormal brain functions remain elusive. Performing protein hunting in fetal Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) brain we detected aberrant expression of several proteins. Fetal brain cortex from controls and Down's syndrome at the early second trimester of gestation was used for expressional analysis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis with subsequent in-gel digestion of spots and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectroscopical identification followed by quantification of spots with specific software was applied. The nuclear matrix protein matrin 3, cytoskeletal motor protein HMP, and the circadian clock protein hlark were significantly decreased in fetal DS brain. C8ORF2 protein was reduced but did not reach statistical significance. Prox1 and predicted protein Dj149A16.6 were comparable between groups. Reduction of brain proteins may represent or cause deficient cytoskeletal structure, transcription machinery and exocytosis, functions already known to be deteriorated in DS brain. Some of the described proteins were only predicted and we here show the existence of the corresponding proteins in fetal human brain.

N2  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) might be due to the fetal consequences of a Mg maternal deficiency, which might be prevented by simple atoxic nutritional Mg intake by the mother. Various stresses in the pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion which may not be cured by nutritional Mg supplement, but requires a correction of its causal dysregulation. Beside the well established risk factors in baby care and in the environment, it is important to stress the possible role of a primary hypofunction of the biological clock. This may be treated by darkness therapy: total light deprivation at night for the infant and atoxic nutritional Mg supplement for the pregnant women. The place in the prevention of SIDS of Mg therapy for the infant and of the use of melatonin, L-tryptophan and taurine is now uncertain yet.

N2  - Background: Failure to arouse from sleep has been postulated as a mechanism to explain the final pathway of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Methods: We have reviewed the effects of the major risk factors for SIDS, prone sleep position, maternal smoking, prematurity and recent infection on arousability from sleep. In human infants it has been consistently demonstrated that arousal from sleep in response to a variety of stimuli is more difficult to induce from quiet sleep (QS) compared to active sleep (AS) over the first 6 months of life. Results: In the prone position both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability from both QS and AS were impaired at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months, but not at 5-6 months of age in both term and preterm infants. In term infants exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability were impaired when infants slept supine in QS at 2-3 months of age. Healthy preterm infants showed no impairment in arousability compared with term infants at matched postconceptional ages. However, preterm infants with a history of apnoea and bradycardia of prematurity showed decreased arousal responses in both QS and AS and this impairment was positively correlated to their 'perinatal risk score'. Infants who had recently suffered an infection requiring hospitalization showed decreased arousability in QS on the day of discharge when compared to 2 weeks later when they were completely well. Conclusions: In summary it has been found that the major risk factors for SIDS identified from epidemiological studies also decrease arousability from sleep in infants. We propose that this decreased arousability from sleep may be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a disease of unknown cause. The occurence of SIDS is rare during the first month of life, increases to a peak between 2 and 4 months old, and then declines. The following have been consistently identified across studies as independent risk factors for SIDS: prone sleep position, sleeping on a soft surface, maternal smoking during pregnancy, young maternal age, bedsharing, prematurity and/or low birth weight, and male sex. Although the cause of the sudden infant death syndrome is multifactorial, contemporary hypotheses include defects in arousal or cardiorespiratory control. The interesting is hypothesis that prolongation of the QT interval may have a role in the pathogenesis of SIDS.

N2  - This article describes infant mental health from two perspectives: why it is relevant and how to implement interventions, including preventive ones. Topics covered are based on evidence available in scientific literature. The first section addresses areas that justify the importance assigned to infants and their emotional well-being. One of them deals with new information about brain development. Recent available information emphasizes the crucial role of sensory/experiential input for the development of the brain in terms of determining the formation of new synapses, influencing cell migration and the "pruning" of refined and dedicated neuronal pathways. Experiences (exposure to language, contingent responses by the caregiver, motion in space) influence the development of the brain. Also, negative and anxiety provoking events as well as psychological trauma cause a negative outcome through this effect. Prolonged and/or severe trauma has been shown to influence negatively the functioning of the limbic system and the capacity of the child to feel empathy and/or compassion, to regulate emotions and to learn new information. New evidence is reviewed from longitudinal research. Several studies have demonstrated that it is possible to "trace back" which elements are necessary during early childhood, to put a child at a high risk of becoming a criminal or severe offender. These include attributes in the child him or herself (restlessness, impulsiveness, lack of fear) together with a history of maltreatment and chronically adverse experiences. Excessive shyness is another fairly persistent trait from early infancy to adulthood. Since these "risk factors" are known, particular children could be targeted for early intervention programs. A follow up study conducted by some of the authors with infants seen in a mental health clinic and followed up to age four, indicates that the strongest predictor of the outcome and functioning of the child at age four is not the severity or type of problems for which the child was originally evaluated. The strongest predictor was the quality of parenting and parenting behaviors of the caregivers as assessed during infancy. This finding suggests the importance of helping parents as early as possible to cope with infant problems in a benign and sensitive way, before negative circles of interaction are entrenched and spiral into an ongoing negative relationship. Together with the studies of risk, those focusing on resilience are summarized. Knowing which traits or experiences are protective against psychopathology is crucial, in order to promote their flourishing in early childhood. Studies with children at high psychosocial risk from Kauai, Hawaii as well as with children from other groups in the world converge in describing resilient traits in early childhood: an easy temperament, a "social orientation", sense of humor, attractiveness and the ability to communicate with others, as well as intelligence. Several experiences are protective, such as having few separations from the mother and having had a sibling when the index child was at least three years old. This knowledge can be used to promote resilient features in children and to develop interventions for those at most risk. Epidemiological evidence suggests that infancy disturbances are not rare, but frequent (15 to 20% of the population). Studies of the prevalence of problems like feeding and sleeping disturbances, excessive crying and disruptive behavior in infancy point in this direction. This justifies the need for early recognition and identification, particularly when they are severe. Excessive crying increases the risk of the child being abused or shaken; likewise sleep disturbance is associated with irritability and hyperactive behavior in the infant. Parents who are deprived of sleep are prone to be more negative and to feel exhausted. Eating disturbances can be associated with failure to thrive. Early malnutrition has been associated with hypertension in middle age, as well as with a higher risk of coronary disease. Maternal depression and domestic violence are rampant in the perinatal period. Maternal depression is associated with more crying and sleeping problems in infancy, and hyperactivity and negative behavior in the school age child. The findings of a survey in a "well-baby clinic" (health surveillance clinic) conducted by some of the authors concur in the finding that parents are worried about their baby's behavior in all these areas and that they readily identify the problems, when asked. Furthermore, their worries are justified. This is in sharp contrast with the tendency in most pediatric settings to "wait and see" hoping that problems in the baby will be solved by themselves. The second part of the review focuses on two issues: techniques of clinical intervention and preventive strategies and their results. There is scant scientific evidence on the efficacy of parent infant psychotherapies. Techniques vary widely in their content and their focus or target population. Strategies like brief parent-infant psychotherapy and the therapeutic consultation are framed psychodynamically and focus on the transgenerational transmission of "fantasmatic" interactions and projections placed on the infant. These appear more suitable for families that are relatively healthier and lacking massive stressors. On the other side of the spectrum, techniques such as interactive guidance and infant-parent psychotherapy are designed for families under more stress, and when the parent child relationship is very negative. These strategies are used with "unreachable families". Interactive guidance attempts to focus on what the parents are doing well through a videotaped feedback given to them, and gradually expanding their repertoire of sensitive and empathic behaviors towards the baby. Infant-parent psychotherapy is long term and involves interventions that are non traditional, like psychotherapy at home, practical help to the parents, and the promotion of a long term relationship of trust between the caregivers and the therapist. The focus is to achieve a "corrective attachment experience" in the parents, which will in turn tender them more sensitive and responsive towards their baby. Multi-modal and flexible techniques are advocated in order to tailor the intervention to the particular needs and style of each family. Finally, evidence on the effectiveness of various prevention programs is reviewed. These are grouped according to the timing of the intervention, from pregnancy to toddlerhood. Evidence suggests that improving marital communication and promoting conflict resolution before the baby is born may enhance maternal sensitivity and lead to a more secure attachment in the infant. There is research on interventions in the perinatal period. These include having psychosocial support during the delivery process. In addition, "bonding" between newborn and mother (without undue intrusion by health care personnel) has positive effects. This involves skin to skin contact and early breast-feeding. These simple interventions have been shown to promote maternal sensitivity, more patience and less behavioral difficulties several months later. The mere demonstration of the abilities of the newborn, his or her uniqueness and preferences as well as an observation of the baby's perceptual abilities, is associated with long term positive behavioral effects. All this points to the importance of conducting an intervention during a "sensitive period". Several meta-analytic studies on home visitation conclude that these programs are most effective if the intervention has a clear focus, is brief and practical help and advice are given to the parents on site. By contrast, with families having a high risk of abusing their child, home visitations are the only hopeful strategy so far.

N2  - Possibly the most important outcomes of bariatric surgery involve changes in obesity-related illness, quality of life (QOL), and psychologic well-being. Dramatic improvement or resolution of serious medical comorbidity accompanies the weight loss following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with the LAP-BAND (INAMED Health, Santa Barbara, CA). There are major improvements in the conditions of the metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Improvement in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta-cell function associated with weight loss induces remission in the majority of type 2 diabetics and reduces the risk of others developing type 2 diabetes. Improvement in dyslipidemia is characterized by raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentrations. Together with lower blood pressure, these changes provide a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk. Other medical conditions caused or aggravated by obesity are also significantly improved, including sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux. Weight loss is associated with improved fertility and more favorable pregnancy outcomes. All aspects of QOL improve substantially, especially physical disability, and post-weight-loss QOL measures approximate those of the general population. There are also major improvements in body image and reduction in depressive illness. These changes provide perhaps the most compelling data regarding the value of LAP-BAND surgery and underlie the great satisfaction experienced by patients. © 2002 Excerpta Medica Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: During recent years, coincident with the recommendation to position infants supine, the incidence of posterior deformational plagiocephaly has increased dramatically. The purpose of our study was to determine whether early signs of cranial flattening could be detected in healthy neonates and to document incidence and potential risk factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed in healthy newborns. Physical findings, anthropometric cranial measurements, and data on pregnancy and birth were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of localized cranial flattening in singletons was 13%; other anomalous head shapes were found in 11% of single-born neonates. In twins, localized flat areas were much more frequent with an incidence of 56%. The following risk factors for cranial deformation were identified: assisted vaginal delivery, prolonged labor, unusual birth position, primiparity, and male gender. CONCLUSION: We propose that localized lateral or occipital cranial flattening at birth is a precursor to posterior deformational plagiocephaly. The infant lies supine, with the head turned to the flattened area, and is unable to roll. Intrauterine risk factors for localized cranial flattening are the same as for deformational plagiocephaly. To avoid postnatal progression from a localized cranial flattening to posterior-lateral deformational plagiocephaly, we suggest amending the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics on sleep position: Alternate the head position and allow sleeping on the side and, when awake, supervise prone time.

N2  - From antiquity, in the human societies were used psychoactive substances, which in the modern society are widely used, with a purpose of euphoria. Some of these substances are acceptable from the society, when their use don't exceed the measure, such as alcohol, caffeine and tobacco, while some others, because of their guidance in dependence of a human from these substances and in uncontrollable antisocial behavior, are considered illicit substances, such as narcotic substances. Tobacco smoking is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in the World. These risks have been shown to be related to the nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco smoke. Lang cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are obvious health hazards to the smoker. In addition, respiratory diseases are increased in smokers; these include emphysema and chronic bronchitis as well as pulmonary tuberculosis, influenza and bacterial bronchitis and pneumonia. Smokers have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, aortic aneurysm, arterial thrombosis and stroke. Furthermore, smokers have a higher incidence of peptic ulcer disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and wrinkling. In passive smokers, studies have shown an increased incidence of lung cancer, exacerbations of asthma, coronary artery disease, nasal carcinoma, brain tumor and breast cancer. In children, exposure to parental smoking clearly increases the incidence of acute respiratory diseases. The direct role of nicotine in the pathogenesis of disease has not been completely defined. Its effects on cardiovascular disease may be mediated by direct increases in heart rate and blood pressure, depression of the magnitude of the increase in coronary blood flow that occurs in response to increased metabolic demand, including coronary artery spasm in susceptible people, causing platelet hyperaggregability and relative hypercoagulability and producing endothelial damage. In cancer pathogenesis, nicotine is not carcinogenic, but, when burned, may produce nicotine-derived nitrosoamines in amounts sufficient to contribute to cancer. In pregnancy, nicotine blocks the cholinergic receptor and blocks the acetylcholine-facilitated amino acid transport; however, more importantly, placental hypoxia induced by carbon monoxide and other tobacco gases depress energy-dependent processes such as transport of amino acids and other nutrients. Once absorbed, nicotine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is distributed throughout the brain within seconds. Experimentally, nicotine in low doses causes ganglionic stimulation and, therefore, causes a centrally mediated cardiovascular stimulation, while high doses cause ganglionic blockade with subsequent hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting and pallor. However, tolerance to these effects, although not complete, develops within 1 day. Cigarette smoking and tobacco use meet the criteria for drug dependence. Considerable behavioral and pharmacologic evidence show that nicotine is dependence-producing constituent of tobacco. Nicotine produces an euphoriant effect and provides the reinforcement for the smoking of cigarettes. Following abrupt smoking cessation or attempts to reduce consumption, withdrawal symptoms occur within hours. The symptoms include restlessness, irritability, anxiety, tension, stress intolerance, drowsiness, frequent awakenings from sleep, fatigue, depression, impatience, confusion, impaired concentration, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Effective treatments for tobacco dependence exist and all tobacco users should be offered those treatments. Five first-line pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence (sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patch) are effective and at least 1 of these medications should be prescribed in the absence of contraindications.

N2  - The rare association of Cushing's syndrome and pregnancy is explained by the amenorrhea and sterility inherent to the syndrome. In the literature, 125 cases have been reported: 30 cases of early diagnosis and 95 others diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy. At the start of pregnancy When hypercorticism exists before pregnancy it is hardly secretory. Its diagnosis, at an early stage, is not hindered by the hormone modifications of pregnancy. Its aetiological treatment raises the problem of the compatibility in pursuing the latter. In the second half of pregnancy The positive and aetiological diagnoses of Cushing's syndrome are difficult and its prevalence may therefore be underestimated. The evocative clinical signs are unspecific: excessive weight gain, hypertension of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. The 24-hour free hypercortisoluria and the absence of dexamethasone inhibition are of little diagnostic value after the 14th week of amenorrhea. The positive diagnosis therefore relies essentially on the abolition of the circadian rhythm of cortisol. The biological hyperandrogenia commonly observed is not discriminating. Adrenal aetiologies are frequent. Imaging must be performed to eliminate an adrenocortical tumor. Prognosis The maternal prognosis depends on the hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes and the complications of Cushing's syndrome. It depends on the activity of the hypercorticism and its early aetiological treatment, which must not be delayed after pregnancy. The foetal prognosis depends on the maternal prognosis. It is represented by preterm delivery, hypotrophy and death of the foetus in utero. The therapeutic management must be symptomatic and aetiologic, maternal and obstetrical. © 2002, Masson, Paris.

N2  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the generation and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Similar to other structures, it develops throughout gestation but is still immature for some time after. This suggests that the SCN could be vulnerable to maternal influences, such as poor nutrition, stress and drugs, all of which can affect neuronal development. Evidence is accumulating that suggests that this is the case, with body size at birth influencing melatonin production in adult humans and maternal malnutrition, and stress affecting sleep in rodents. Interestingly, the maternal environment affects the phase of rhythms and the response of the circadian timing system to light pulses. The nature of these changes in adult rhythmicity is similar to those commonly associated with depression in humans. Thus, abnormal fetal programming might predispose adults to depressive illness.

N2  - The position of the abomasum in six cows was examined by ultrasonography at regular intervals for six weeks after they had calved. Its position was established by determining the distance between the margin of the left side of the abomasum and the ventral midline at two sites. During the last weeks of pregnancy, the abomasum was positioned in a small region of the left ventral side of the abdominal cavity. At parturition it was positioned high on the left side and then descended. The abomasum was furthest from the midline immediately after parturition. Its position was related to the interval after calving, the cow's feed intake, and the pH and osmotic pressure of the rumen fluid. There was considerable variation between the cows in the position of the abomasum, which was in part due to analytical variation, and in individual cows it had a circadian rhythm.

N2  - BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Preterm infants in mechanical ventilation are vulnerable and may manifest physiological instability and a disorganized behavioural state when responding to external stimuli. Adequate positioning strategies may play an important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week postbirth. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to compare effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. DESIGN/METHODS: The infants were aged 25-36 weeks of gestation, < or = 7 days of age, and without sedation or congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance. FINDINGS: Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of startle, tremor, and twitch. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that prone positioning improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress for ventilated preterm infants during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants' extrauterine adaptation.

N2  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharamcokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown gender differences between men and women in unipolar depression, mainly related with hormonal variables that would determine women's specific organization and/or activation of the central nervous system from intrauterine to postmenopausal life. It is recognized that there are a higher prevalence of unipolar depression among women, a predominance of atypical depressive symptoms, a better response to MAOI and SSRI between menarche and menopause, and a higher frequency of rapid cycling and seasonal pattern. Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum, as well as the higher prevalence of thyroid diseases and stronger reactivity to stress of the axis that regulates the secretion of CRF, ACTH and cortisol, support the hipotheses of hormonal etiologies in these pictures and give an explanatory base to the observed differences. The appropriate distinction between unipolar and bipolar depression, the correct election of an antidepressive treatment and the exploration of the efficacy and efectiveness of other therapeutic strategies, such as light-therapy, sleep deprivation and thyroid and/or gonadal steroids supplementation or replacement therapy, are factors that must be taken into account when treating a depressive woman. © 2006 Sociedad de Neurolog Psiquiatry Neurocirugbr.

N2  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has dropped significantly in most countries following the development of education campaigns on the avoidance of risk factors for SIDS. However, questions have been raised about the physiological mechanism responsible for the effects of these environmental risk factors. Since 1985, a series of prospective, multicentric studies have been developed to address these questions; over 20,000 infants were recorded during one night in a sleep laboratory and among these, 40 infants eventually died of SIDS. In this review, the following methods were employed: sleep recordings and analysis, monitoring procedure, data analysis of sleep stages, cardiorespiratory and oxygen saturation, scoring of arousals, spectral analysis of the heart rate and the determination of arousal thresholds, and statistical analysis and the results including sleep apneas, arousals and heart rate and autonomic controls in both future SIDS victims and normal infants were introduced separately. In addition, the physiological effect of prenatal risk factors (maternal smoking during gestation) and postnatal risk factors (administration of sedative drugs, prone sleeping position, ambient temperature, sleeping with the face covered by a bed sheet, pacifiers and breastfeeding) in normal infants were analyzed. In conclusion, the physiological studies undertaken on the basis of epidemiological findings provide some clues about the physiological mechanisms linked with SIDS. Although the description of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still far from complete, it appears to involve both arousal responses and cardiac autonomic controls during sleep-wake processes. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Although infants have been noted to have greater relative right or left frontal EEG as early as the neonatal period, other ways in which these newborns differ have not been reported. In this study, 48 newborns were divided on the basis of greater relative right versus greater relative left frontal EEG to determine whether these groups differed in other ways at the neonatal period including behavior, physiology, and biochemistry. We also were interested in whether these EEG patterns were related to any prenatal maternal variables including mood states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as fetal activity. The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns had mothers with lower prenatal and postnatal serotonin and higher postnatal cortisol levels. The mothers of the greater relative right frontal EEG newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns themselves had elevated cortisol levels, showed a greater number of state changes during sleep/ wake behavior observations, and performed less optimally on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment (T. B. Brazelton, 1973) including the habituation, motor, range of state, excitability, and depressive symptoms scales. These data suggest that greater relative right frontal EEG newborns may be at greater risk for developmental problems than those with greater relative left frontal EEG activation. In addition, a discriminant function analysis correctly classified 67% of the newborns' EEGs by prenatal maternal variables, suggesting that these might be used to target pregnant women for prenatal intervention. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Organisms have developed endogenous mechanisms for keeping track of time which allow them to adjust to environmental changes. Entrainment of endogenous rhythms to the day-night cycle is of elementary importance for the regulation of physiological processes. How environmental changes influence the manifestation of cicradian rhythms during intrauterine and extraurterine growth depend on complex networking of molecular, physiological and sensory mechanisms. This work reports on development of circadian rhythms in the infant, with particular emphasis on the roles of times cues to which the infant is exposed. Subjects and Methods: Activity data of 12 families were continously recorded during the first 4 months after birth using non-invasive actigraphs. Recordings of parental activity started at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Time series analysis was used to investigate the periodic structure of the data. In addition, we review the literature on the ontogenesis of circadian rhythms in humans. Results: During the 3rd trimester, daily variation of physiological functions in the fetus showed a high degree of correspondence with maternal circadian rhythms. Early behaviour of most infants was highly variable between individuals but could be asigned to different entrainment patterns. Good correspondence of mother-infant activity patterns during the early postnatal period, when the infant was not yet entrained to the day-night-cycle, was correlated with the rapid development of an entrained daily pattern in the infant a few weeks later. Conclusion: Understanding the emergence of periodic structures at physiological and behavioural level during human ontogenesis will be an asset in the successful intervention and treatment during neonatal care.

N2  - Background: The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS) and related functional outcomes in infancy remain unexplored. Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the functional integrity of the CNS. Objective: We investigated whether CNS integrity in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA. Design: Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at parturition. On postpartum day 1 (P1) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to measure sleep and wake states. Results: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2 groups: high DHA (>3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (≤3.0% by wt of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on P1 was inversely associated with QS and positively associated with arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS, sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS. Conclusion: The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity.

N2  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms (p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep (p < 0.01) when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate whether a history of maternal tobacco smoking affected the maturation of arousal responses and whether sleeping position and infant age alters these relations. Design: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth, (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. Results: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions. In infants of non-smoking mothers, arousal thresholds were elevated in the prone position in AS at 2-3 months (p<0.01) and QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and 2-3 months (p<0.001). Conclusions: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.

N2  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharamcokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

N2  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins.

N2  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of body position on sidestream, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) wave measurements in maturing infants. Sidestream EtCO2 wave patterns were analysed longitudinally in 20 preterm infants (born at ≥32 wk) at 32-37 wk gestation, and in 39 full-term controls. Capnography measurements included maximal EtCO2, inspired CO2 and frequency of apnoea events (>3 s) in the supine, supine with inclination, side and prone positions. Apnoea frequency decreased during maturation, and was less prevalent in the prone than in the supine and side positions in preterm as well as in term infants (p < 0.05). No clinically significant apnoea episodes were found in our cohort. EtCO2 in term infants was lower than that in preterm infants (p < 0.05) and was not affected by sleep position in the most premature (<33 wk) and in term infants (>36 wk). EtCO2 was higher in the prone position than in supine or side positions in infants between 33 and 35 wk gestation (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Short apnoeic episodes decrease during maturation, and are less prevalent in the prone position in maturing infants (32-37 wk). Only modest changes in EtCO2 were recorded in the different positions during maturation.

N2  - Objective: We aimed to determine whether S100B protein levels in cord blood and the development of fetal behavioral states were altered and interrelated in small-for-dates (SFD) fetuses. Methods: Umbilical cord blood samples were collected from 12 SFD fetuses with normal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler findings, from six SFD fetuses with abnormal Doppler waveform patterns and from 36 controls matched for gestational age. S100B protein levels were measured by means of a specific radioimmunoassay. Fetal behavioral state recordings were made before delivery by Cesarean section and data were expressed as percentage of quiet sleep coincidence (C1F), of activity state coincidence (C2-4F) and of no coincidence (NOC). Flow velocimetry waveforms were recorded from the uterine artery, UA and fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA). Results: Mean S100B protein levels in umbilical plasma were significantly higher in the six SFD infants with abnormal prenatal Doppler findings (3.31 ± 0.65 μg/l) than in SFD infants with normal Doppler findings (1.56 ± 0.35 μg/l) and in controls (1.23 ± 0.43 μg/l). Similarly in these fetuses NOC was higher and C2F significantly lower (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in C1F. S100B concentrations were correlated with the UA pulsatility index (PI) (r = 0.78, p < 0.01), with the MCA PI (r = -0.78, p < 0.01) and with the UA PI/MCA PI ratio (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). Also, NOC and C2F percentages were correlated with the UA PI (r = 0.61, p < 0.01 and r = -0.61, p < 0.01, respectively), with the MCA P1 (r = -0.72, p < 0.001 and r = 0.66, p < 0.01, respectively), and with the UA PI/MCA PI ratio (r = 0.60, p < 0.01 and r = -0.54, p < 0.05, respectively). NOC was also correlated with S100B protein (r = 0.48, p < 0.05); the correlation of S100B protein and C2F almost reached significance (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a relationship between a biochemical marker of brain development and/or integrity and the development of fetal behavioral states, offering additional information on brain maturation in normal and high-risk pregnancies.

N2  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that prenatal hypoxia in rats might lead to consistent changes in the entrainment of the circadian clock by light. Pregnant female rats were placed in a chamber provided with hypoxic gas (10 % O2-90 % N2) at gestational day 5 and returned to normoxia before delivery. Once adult, rats born to hypoxic mothers had significant alterations in their circadian rhythm of locomotor activity (recorded in freely accessible running wheels). Under a regular 12/12 light/dark (LD) cycle, they showed a phase advance of their rhythm of activity (mean phase advance of 87 min) and were less active than control rats. After an abrupt 6 h phase delay in the LD cycle, rats from the prenatal hypoxic group (PNH) took significantly more time to resynchronise to the new LD cycle compared to controls (+53 %; 6.0 ± 1.5 vs. 9.2 ± 0.5 days respectively). Under constant darkness, PNH and control rats had a similar period of activity (24.27 ± 0.20 vs. 24.40 ± 0.13) but the response of PNH rats to a light pulse in the early subjective night was less marked than that of control rats (101 ± 9 vs. 158 ± 13 min). When submitted to acute restraint stress, PNH rats had a prolonged secretion of corticosterone compared to controls. These results indicate that prenatal hypoxia is a factor that has long lasting consequences for the functional output of the biological clock and the hormonal response to stress.

N2  - Interest in cobedding multiple-gestation infants has grown as focus has increased on the developmental approach to the care of the neonate. Little data, however, exist on the infants' response to cobedding. It is important to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and physiologic impact of this practice. Cobedding was offered to parents of twin infants < 37 weeks gestation, without arterial lines or ventilator requirements, by the health care team according to standard practice in our nursery. After parental informed consent, infants were placed on an event-recording cardiorespiratory monitor for 12 hours before cobedding and for the first 12 hours of cobedding. Recordings were evaluated by an investigator blinded to the bedding status of the infant. Apnea (a pause of respiration > 10 seconds, central apnea), bradycardia (a decline in heart rate to < 80 beats per minute), periodic breathing (a respiratory pattern in which there are ≥ 3 pauses in respiration of ≥ 3 seconds with < 20 seconds of breathing between pauses), adverse events (changes in medication, changes in oxygen requirements, temperature instability, the need for sepsis evaluation, or death) were evaluated. Other physiologic parameters were obtained through the use of standard bedside monitoring. Eleven sets of preterm infants, n = 22, with a mean gestation of 31.8 ± 2.9 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1,698.7 ± 552.0 grams were studied. Infants were evaluated at a corrected gestational age of 33.5 ± 1.9 weeks and a mean weight of 1,713.2 ± 484.0 grams. The number of events of central apnea before cobedding (57) was greater than those recorded during cobedding (18), p<0.05. There was no difference found in any of the other parameters compared. The numbers of events recorded before and during cobedding were compared by Student's t-test and significance was determined by p < 0.05. No adverse events (AE) were noted, and all infants remained cobedded throughout the study. This preliminary study suggests that cobedding of healthy preterm twins showed no increase in adverse events. Of the physiologic parameters studied, only the occurrence of central apnea changed with cobedding. This decrease in central apnea may reflect a change in sleep pattern due to more frequent arousal by the twin. Alternatively, a more regular breathing pattern may reflect a positive physiological response to contact between twins.

N2  - The AAP has alerted pediatricians to the importance of safe sleep environment for infants. The elements of a safe sleep environment include supine sleep position, safe crib, and avoidance of smoke exposure, soft bedding, and overheating. With the Back to Sleep campaign, prone sleeping among all U.S. infants has decreased to less than 20%, and the incidence of SIDS has decreased 40%. However, the decline in SIDS and prone sleeping has leveled off in recent years. Further declines may be possible with decreasing other modifiable risk factors, such as prenatal and postnatal exposure to cigarette smoking. Prior studies have demonstrated that health care professional advice is influential in determining infant care practices. It is important that physicians caring for infants be aware of the importance of a safe sleep environment and understand other modifiable risk factors for SIDS. We surveyed a random sample of 3,717 physicians in North Carolina and the metropolitan Washington, DC, area to determine knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction among physicians caring for pregnant women and infants. Twenty-three percent (835) responded. Most physicians are aware of prone sleeping and cigarette smoke exposure as risk factors for SIDS. Almost all physicians agree that there are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS, and they consider it important to discuss SIDS and SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents of young infants. In spite of this belief, only 56% of family/general practitioners, 18% of obstetrician-gynecologists, and 79% of pediatricians discuss SIDS routinely. Only 35% of pediatricians, 15% of family/general practitioners, and 16% of obstetrician-gynecologists provide written information. In addition, only 38% of physicians recommend supine, while 50% recommend side or back, 6% side, and 7% prone. Only two thirds of pediatricians and one third of family/general practitioners are aware that the AAP recommends supine as the preferred sleep position for infants. Pediatricians are more likely to be aware of the AAP recommendation (p<0.0001) and to discuss SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents (p=0.03). We conclude that many physicians who care for infants are unaware of the AAP's most current recommendation for sleep position and are incorrectly recommending the side position. Physicians may also be unaware of other sleep environment hazards. Further educational efforts must continue for physicians who provide care to pregnant women and children to ensure a continued decline in the incidence of SIDS.

N2  - Background: This article is a critical review of the efficacy of selected alternative treatments for unipolar depression including exercise, stress management techniques, acupuncture, St. John's wort, bright light, and sleep deprivation. Issues related to women across the life span, including pregnancy and lactation, are highlighted. Data Sources: Evidence of efficacy is based on randomized controlled trials. A distinction is made between studies that address depressive symptoms and studies that address depressive disorders. The review emphasizes issues related to effectiveness, such as treatment availability, acceptability, safety, and cost and issues relevant to women. Data Synthesis: Exercise, stress reduction methods, bright light exposure, and sleep deprivation hold greater promise as adjuncts to conventional treatment than as monotherapies for major depression. The evidence to date is not sufficiently compelling to suggest the use of St. John's wort in favor of or as an alternative to existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-regulated compounds. Initial evidence suggests that acupuncture might be an effective alternative monotherapy for major depression, single episode. Conclusion: This review indicates that some unconventional treatments hold promise as alternative or complementary treatments for unipolar depression in women and have the potential to contribute to its long-term management. Additional research is needed before further recommendations can be made, and there is an urgent need to carefully document and report the frequency of minor and major side effects.

N2  - We report results of the first longitudinal study of outcome correlates of parent-child bedsharing. Two hundred five families in nonconventional and conventional family lifestyles have been followed since 1975. A target child in each family was followed from the third trimester of mother's pregnancy through age 18 years. Bedsharing in early childhood was found to be significantly associated with increased cognitive competence measured at age 6 years, but the effect size was small. At age 6 years, bedsharing in infancy and early childhood was not associated with sleep problems, sexual pathology, or any other problematic consequences. At age 18 years, bedsharing in infancy and childhood was unrelated to pathology or problematic consequences, nor was it related to beneficial consequences. We discuss these results in light of widespread fears of harm caused by parent-child bedsharing. We suggest that such fears are without warrant if bedsharing is practiced safely as part of a complex of valued and related family practices.

N2  - The questions addressed in this study were whether prenatal depression effects on the foetus and neonate varied by ethnicity and socio-economic status. Eighty-six depressed pregnant women were compared by ethnic group, Hispanic and African-American, and by socio-economic status (upper/lower) on prenatal and neonatal outcome variables. The Hispanic mothers were older, had a higher SES and had higher prenatal norepinephrine levels. Their foetuses were also more active. At the neonatal period they had higher anger scores, but also higher serotonin levels, and their infants had higher dopamine and lower cortisol levels and they spent less time in deep and indeterminate sleep. The comparison by middle/lower socio-economic status revealed that the middle SES group was older, had more social support and showed less depressed affect but had higher norepiephrine levels prenatally. At the postnatal period the middle SES mothers had lower depression, anxiety and anger scores and lower norepinephrine levels. Their infants also had lower norepinephrine levels, fewer postnatal complications and were less excitable on the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale.

N2  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a crucial cytokine for establishing pregnancy. It has been demonstrated previously in rats that sleep increases during early pregnancy and that centrally administered GM-CSF promotes both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Therefore, whether GM-CSF is involved in pregnancy-enhanced sleep was investigated using the anti-GM-CSF antibody. Female rats received an intracerebroventricular infusion of either anti-GM-CSF or control IgG (10 μg each) for four nights from the first day of pregnancy (PD1-PD4). Although sleep amounts on PD1 were not affected, anti-GM-CSF decreased non-REM and REM sleep significantly during PD2-PD4 compared with the control baseline of the IgG group. The results demonstrated that anti-GM-CSF treatment suppresses pregnancy-enhanced sleep, suggesting that GM-CSF contributes to sleep regulation during pregnancy.

N2  - To understand the sleep-wake behaviours from the fifth pre-partum week to the 15th post-partum week by the number of actigraphic activities and sleep logs were evaluated in 10 women. It was found that total sleep time shortened, sleep efficiency decreased, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased in the weeks immediately after delivery. Compared with late pregnancy, total sleep time and sleep efficiency deteriorated significantly from the delivery week to the 12th post-partum week and there was a longer period of WASO until the 11th postpartum week. The after-delivery sleep parameters estimated by the actigraph were worse than those estimated from sleep logs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opiates. The evidence for use of different opiates was assessed in subgroup analyses. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group including searches (up to March 2002) of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (1966-March 2002), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal handsearching mainly in the English language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies enrolling a total of 511 infants met inclusion criteria (Carin 1983, Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986, Kandall 1983, Khoo 1995, Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies. Opiate (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found no significant effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3, -0.3) and duration of supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2, -120.3). Opiate vs phenobarbital: Meta-analysis of three studies found no significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46, 1.32). One of these studies (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be interpreted with caution. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate. Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate. No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbital, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution. Further research is needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using a sedative compared to a non-opiate control for NAS due to withdrawal from opiates, and to determine which type of sedative is most effective and safe. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002) and MEDLINE 1966-2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to sedative or control. Control could include another sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included treatment failure (failure to achieve symptom control or use of additional drug treatment), seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies enrolling a total of 285 patients met inclusion criteria (Finnegan 1984, Kahn 1969, Kaltenbach 1986, Khoo 1995, Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in three studies. Phenobarbital compared to supportive care alone has not been shown to reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight (one study). However, the duration of supportive care required to be given to infants each day was significantly reduced (MD -162.1 minutes/day, 95% CI -249.2, -75.1). Comparing phenobarbital to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found that phenobarbital produced a significant reduction in treatment failure (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24, 0.62). There was no significant difference in duration of treatment or duration of hospital stay. Comparing phenobarbital with chlorpromazine, one study found no significant difference in treatment failure rate. No data for neurodevelopment were available, reported by treatment group as allocated. No trials were eligible that assessed clonidine for NAS. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In newborn infants with NAS, there is no evidence that phenobarbital, compared with supportive care alone, reduces treatment failure; however, phenobarbital may reduce the daily duration of supportive care needed. Phenobarbital, compared to diazepam, reduces treatment failure. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chlorpromazine or clonidine in newborn infants with NAS. Clonidine and chlorpromazine should only be used in the context of a randomised clinical trial. The results of this review, taken in conjunction with the related review, Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants (Osborn 2002), indicate that treatment with opiates is the preferred initial therapy for NAS. It is hypothesised that this is particularly true for infants whose mothers have used only opiates during pregnancy. If a sedative is used, phenobarbital is preferred to diazepam. The results of an ongoing trial of the addition of phenobarbital to an opiate are awaited.

N2  - Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of Contergan in 1956, as a "non-barbiturate hypnotic", advocated to ensure a good night's sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from the market since 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies exposed to thalidomide in utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history, thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. Subsequently, thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.

In fetal sheep, definitive rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep states appear at ∼125 d gestation (term is ∼147 d). In adult animals, PGD synthase (PGDS) (functionally and structurally homologous to β-trace protein) is secreted into CSF with a circadian pattern, with the highest concentrations present during sleep. In this study we show that PGDS/β-trace protein is present in fetal sheep CSF at 125 and 135 d gestation but not at 90 d gestation. SeCl4, a specific inhibitor of PGDS, was given to unanesthetized fetal sheep (130-140 d gestation) by intracere-broventricular infusion at a dose of 25, 100, 500, or 1000 pmol/min for 4 hr. Artificial CSF was infused in control experiments. Arousal behavior, defined as the presence of nuchal muscle electromyogram activity, electro-ocular activity, and breathing movements during low-amplitude electrocortical activity, increased from 3.8 ± 1 min/hr to 6.6 = 0.5 and 7.0 ± 0.3 min/hr at doses of 100 and 500 pmol/min, respectively (p < 0.05). SeCl4 at 25 and 1000 pmol/min had no significant effect on arousal activity. Infusion of PGD2 at 500 pmol/min intracere-broventricularly for 4 hr decreased the incidence of arousal from 3.8 ± 0.5 min/hr to 0.7 ± 0.3 min/hr (p < 0.05). When 500 pmol/min PGD2 was infused immediately after a 4 hr infusion of SeCl4 (500 pmol/min), the SeCl4-induced increase in arousal behavior was abolished. Together, the presence of PGDS/βtrace protein in fetal CSF in late gestation and the effects of SeCl4 in increasing the incidence of arousal-like behavior suggest that PGD2 has a role in the induction and maintenance of prenatal sleep.

N2  - One hundred and sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anger during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high-anger women also had high scores on depression and anxiety scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high-anger women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high-anger mothers' high prenatal cortisol and adrenaline and low dopamine and serotonin levels were mimicked by their neonates' high cortisol and low dopamine levels. The high-anger mothers and infants were also similar on their relative right frontal EEG activation and their low vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high-anger mothers had disorganised sleep patterns (greater indeterminate sleep and more state changes) and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (orientation, motor maturity and depression). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated angry mood during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Children born of mothers who abused illegal substances during pregnancy can present with signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, including irritability, jitteriness, diarrhoea. Usually these symptoms appear from a few hours up to a few days after birth. It is frequently followed by a post-withdrawal period of several weeks duration with crying, excitability, sleep irregularities and feeding difficulties. The purpose is to report the presence of nystagmus in infants born from drug-addicted mothers. Methods: Five children born from drug-addicted mothers were examined. Results: Three children (case 1-3) presented with congenital horizontal pendular nystagmus. Two other children (case 4-5) presented with a peculiar transient horizontal nystagmus, lasting 6 months and 7 months respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, transient horizontal pendular nystagmus has never been reported in the literature. It was detected in two children who suffered from a post-natal withdrawal syndrome necessitating substitution therapy, including morphine. This may represent a form of morphine midbrain toxicity.

N2  - Many changes in the respiratory system occur during pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, which can alter respiratory function during sleep, increasing the incidence and severity of sleep disordered breathing. These changes include increased ventilatory drive and metabolic rate, reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients, and changes in upper airway patency. The clinical importance of these changes is indicated by the increased incidence of snoring during pregnancy, which is likely also to reflect an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. For the respiratory physician asked to review a pregnant patient, the possibility of sleep disordered breathing should always be considered. This review first examines the normal physiological changes of pregnancy and their relationship to sleep disordered breathing, and then summarises the current knowledge of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.

N2  - About a billion of Moslem fast every year during the holy month of Ramadan. This ritual consists in abstaining from drinking and eating from sunrise to sunset. The length of the fast varies 10 to 18 hours and is function of the geographical location and the season in which it takes place. The brutal change of the life style and the necessity to feed itself at night entail behavioral modifications and diminish vigilance, and can modify eating habits and the balance of the diet as well as biologic variations among healthy individuals. Studies bringing back these effects remain rare. Inspite of the temporary exonerations granted by the religion to children, pregnant women, travellers and sick people some still prefer to fast. It is important that the doctors caring for Moslem patients become aware of modifications misled by this practice and means to correct them. Diabetic patients and especially type 1, who fast, expose themselves to risks of hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. Fasting is allowed for type 2 diabetics whose diabetes is well under control and without degenerative complications whereas it is contraindicated in type 1 diabetics and, in all insulin-treated patients. Nevertheless, when these patients are fasting during the Ramadan, it is necessary to counsel an increased glucose monitoring and an adaptation of the therapeutic remedy. Diabetics will be advised on a sufficient hydration, a well balanced nutrition in 2 or 3 meals, avoiding to many carbohydrates and especially sweets and correct amount of sleep. In the case of oral treatment, biguanids are indicated. If the patient is on oral hypoglycaemic agents, we'll choose those with a short action and give 2/3 of the dose on the evening. In the case of insulin, 2 injections (intermediate + regular or analogs) seem suitable, giving 2/3 of the dose in the evening. Analogs are interesting because the better metabolic control and less hypoglycaemia.

N2  - End-organ damage associated with hypertension is more closely related to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) than clinic or casual blood pressure measurements. ABP measurements give better prediction of clinical outcome than clinic or casual blood pressure measurements. The technique of ABP monitoring (ABPM) is specialised; validated monitors and appropriate quality control measures should be used. Interpretation of ABP profile should include mean daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour measurements, and consideration of diary information and time of drug treatment. Reports may also include ABP "loads" (percentage area under the blood pressure curve above set limits) for daytime and night-time periods. Normal blood pressure values for adults are <135/85 mmHg for daytime, <120/75 mmHg for night-time, and <130/80 mmHg for 24 hours. ABPM is indicated to exclude "white coat" hypertension and has a role in assessing apparent drug-resistant hypertension, symptomatic hypotension or hypertension, in the elderly, in hypertension in pregnancy, and to assess adequacy of control in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. White coat hypertension requires continued surveillance; patients who display this phenomenon may, in time, develop established hypertension. Appropriate use of ABPM may result in cost savings. Randomised controlled trials comparing management based on clinic or casual versus ABP measurements are needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on the pregnant women. METHOD: 465 women in pregnancy were studied by random. The snoring rate, the relation with hyper blood pressure and preeclamptism, and the influence on infant were observed. RESULT: The magnificent statistics shows total snoring rate is 24.7%(115/465). 21.3%(92/442) is after pregnancy, of them, 28.7% meet the standard of OSAS, 12.17% with hyper blood pressure, 7.8% with preeclamptism, 5.2% infant with aplasia. CONCLUSION: Diseases incidence with OSAS is more oboious than that with normal pregnant women. OSAS has a marked1 influence on pregnancy. Pregnant women with obvious OSAS can be regard as an independent factor of high risk pregnancy. We should pay more attentions to them in their early stage.

N2  - This review highlights recent studies investigating the role of prostaglandin (PG)D2 in reproduction. PGD2 induces sleep, allergic responses, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and relaxation of vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle, and has some roles in reproduction. Two types of PGD2 synthase are known. Lipocalin-type PGD synthase is present in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and may play an important role in male reproduction. Another PGD synthase, hematopoietic PGD synthase is present in the spleen, fallopian tube, endometrial gland cells, extravillous trophoblasts and villous trophoblasts, and perhaps plays an important role in female reproduction. Recent studies demonstrate that PGD2 is probably involved in multiple aspects of inflammation through its dual receptor systems, DP and CRTH2. CRTH2 but not DP is a chemo-attractant receptor for PGD2. Interestingly, CRTH2 is a most reliable marker for the detection of human T helper type 2 (Th2) and T cytotoxic type 2 (Tc2) cells, and the percentages of CRTH expressing CD4+-T cells and CD8+-T cells were significantly higher in the decidua especially at the implantation site, suggesting that Th2 and Tc2 cells recruit into the materno-fetal interface, in a PGD2-mediated manner. PGD2 has a very unique effect to inhibit antigen presentation by inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) migration through DP but not CRTH2. PGD2 might appear to contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy by controlling the Th1/Th2 balance and antigen presentation by DCs through its dual receptor systems, CRTH2 and DP. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2002.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the association between fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram patterns during overnight sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected prospectively between December 1, 1999, and June 30, 2001. Initially, the participating patients were asked to complete a 66-question survey for the assessment of maternal perception of sleep quality that was referred to as the sleep disturbance score: a continuous score from 0 (no evidence of sleep disturbance) to 110 (extreme sleep disturbance). Second, a subgroup of patients was monitored overnight by concomitant fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram tracings. Statistical analysis included the Student t test, chi2 test, logistic regression, and Cramer's V contingency correlation. RESULTS: One hundred two singleton pregnancies formed the study population. The mean sleep disturbance score was 26.7 +/- 9.9. Maternal age was the only variable that correlated with sleep disturbance score. A subgroup of 11 patients was studied overnight. A significant correlation between active fetal sleep and maternal wakefulness was demonstrated in 6 patients. The mean sleep disturbance score for these patients was significantly higher than for patients without such correlation (P =.04). CONCLUSION: This study establishes an association between fetal activity and maternal wakefulness, which explains many of the maternal awakenings during sleep in the third trimester.

N2  - Fifty-two pregnant women recruited during their second trimester were given EEGs and divided into greater relative right and left frontal EEG activation groups. The greater relative right frontal EEG women had lower dopamine levels during their second trimester and lower dopamine and higher cortisol levels during the neonatal period. The newborns of the right frontal EEG mothers also showed greater relative right frontal EEG, had lower dopamine and serotonin levels, spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had inferior Brazelton scores. A discriminant function analysis based on the mothers' prenatal depression scores and biochemical measures correctly classified 74% of the women as greater relative right or left frontal EEG group members.

N2  - Objectives. The Back to Sleep campaign has been credited with recent declines in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Using survey data for the 1996-1998 birth cohorts, this epidemiologic study examines infant sleep position in a large, population-based sample. Data and Methods. Data concerning infant sleep position are drawn from the 1996-1998 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for 15 states. Weighted multiple logistic regression analysis is used to examine correlates of infant sleep position. Results. The prevalence of prone infant sleeping significantly declined between 1996 and 1998 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.63, 0.78]). African Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone, (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.33,1.59), and were less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.57). Hispanic/Latinos were less likely overall than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.95), but were also less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.87). Adherence to sleep position recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics increased sharply among Hispanic/Latino infants. Very low birth weight infants and infants in larger families were less likely to sleep in the recommended supine position. Infants born between 1001 and 1500 g (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.79), and extremely low birth weight infants between 500 and 1000 g (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72) were especially unlikely to sleep supine. Infants in households with more than 3 other children (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.74) were more likely to sleep prone. Conclusions. The prevalence of supine infant sleep increased between 1996 and 1998. Low adherence to sleep position recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics among African Americans, very low birth weight infants, and infants in large families remain public health concerns.

N2  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Various maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy (e.g., unintended pregnancy, late entry into prenatal care, cigarette smoking, not breast-feeding) are associated with adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Information regarding maternal behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends, to enhance the understanding of the relations between behaviors and health outcomes, to plan and evaluate programs, to direct policy decisions, and to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This report covers data from 1993 through 1999. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver a live-born infant. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with a telephone interview. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets. PRAMS generates statewide estimates of various perinatal health topics among women delivering a live infant. Data for 1999 from 17 states are examined. In addition, trend data are examined for 12 states that had at least 3 years of data during 1993-1999. RESULTS: In 1999, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy resulting in a live birth ranged from 33.7% to 52% across the 17 states. During 1993-1999, only one state reported a decreasing trend in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy. Women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care ranged from 16.1% to 29.9%. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care significantly decreased over time in seven of the 12 states with trend data. In general, women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report late or no entry into prenatal care. The prevalence of smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 6.2% to 27.2%, and the prevalence decreased in five states from 1993 to 1999. Overall, smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy was associated with younger age (<25 years), non-Hispanic ethnicity, having less than or equal to a high school education, receiving Medicaid, and delivering a low birthweight infant. The prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during pregnancy ranged from 2.1% to 6.3%. No trends were observed for physical abuse from 1996 to 1999, the only years for which these data were available. Across the 17 states, only Medicaid status was consistently associated with experiencing physical abuse during pregnancy. The prevalence of breast-feeding initiation ranged from 48% to 89%. Ten of 12 states with trend data reported increases in the prevalence of breast-feeding initiation. Overall, women aged <20 years, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were less likely to breast-feed. The prevalence of breast-feeding duration for at least 4 weeks ranged from 34.9% to 78.1%. From 1993 to 1999, increases in levels of breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks were observed in eight states. Women aged <25 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were generally less likely to breast-feed for at least 4 weeks. The prevalence of back sleep position for infants ranged from 35.1% to 74.6%. Increases in the use of the back sleep position were observed in all 12 states with trend data from 1996 to 1999. Black race and having less than or equal to a high school education were consistently associated with not using the back sleep position. INTERPRETATION: For surveillance during 1993-1999, the majority or all states observed increases in breast-feeding initiation, breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks, and back sleep position. Approximately one half of the states observed decreases for late or no entry into prenatal care and smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Little or no progress was observed in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy or physical abuse during pregnancy. With few exceptions, the 17 states failed to meet the Healthy People 2000 objectives for the seven reported behaviors in 1999. Certain de

N2  - Drug treatment of anxiety and insomnia during pregnancy and lactation is emphasized by a high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among fertile women and by a high consumption of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. Pregnancy has been associated with anxiety; moreover, pregnancy and postpartum are risk periods for onset or exacerbation of anxiety disorders. The results of studies investigating impact of anxiety on fetus are equivocal. Onset or exacerbation of obssesive compulsive disorder is frequently observed during pregnancy or after childbirth. Previous assumptions that pregnancy protects from panic disorder, have not been confirmed. Posttraumatic stress disorder can occur as a result of delivery, abortion or stillbirth. Tokophobia, fearful avoidance of pregnancy, can be included among specific phobias. Sleep disorders are frequent during pregnancy and postpartum. Administration of benzodiazepines may be associated with congenital malformations, especially oral clefts, although new findings are inconclusive. Similarly, their neurobehavioral toxicity remains questionable. Benzodiazepines in neonates and breast-fed infants may cause sedation, weight loss, dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Well-known is the "floppy infant syndrome". In treatment of anxiety disorders in pregnancy and lactation, non-pharmacological interventions, such as psychotherapy, are preferred. If there is a need for drug treatment, antidepressants, e.g., SSRI's are the first-line choice. Benzodiazepines should be completely avoided during first trimester, short-acting drags can be given in the lowest effective dose and they should be gradually tapered-off prior to the delivery. In lactation, short-acting benzodiazepines can be also administered; low single doses are safe, if the infant is monitored for drowsiness. For insomnia, zopiclon can be prescribed in pregnancy and zolpidem during breast-feeding.

N2  - Late-gestation blockade of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) activity in pregnant mice produces discrete morphological abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of offspring. We investigated the functional implications of this lesion on the behavioural arousal response to moderate hypoxia. Pregnant mice received twice-daily injections of 200 μl saline (control), or saline + 50 μg VIP antagonist (anti-VIP) on embryonic days 17 and 18. Offspring were studied unrestrained at 6-7 weeks after birth, in a bias-flow whole-body plethysmograph during behavioural quiet sleep. Arousal was defined by movement (MVT) lasting ≥1 s. Hypoxic ventilatory (HVR) and arousal responses were measured during a 5 min exposure to 10% O2-3 % CO2 (hypoxia); peripheral chemoreflex drive was estimated by transient hyperoxia administered at rest and end-hypoxia (Dejours-type test). MVTs increased in all mice during hypoxia, but in anti-VIP mice: (a) MVT onset was delayed (174 ± 90 vs. 108 ± 59 s from the start of hypoxia, anti-VIP vs. control; P = 0.008); and (b) MVTs were less frequent, and total MVT time in hypoxia was less (8 ± 7 vs. 15 ± 9 %; P = 0.03). The HVR, and peripheral drive at rest and end-hypoxia were comparable in control and anti-VIP mice. In conclusion, a significant arousal deficit was evident in anti-VIP mice. This was not associated with obviously deranged peripheral or brainstem-mediated responses to hypoxia during sleep. This may signal a general deficit in the way hypoxic distress is monitored and processed, and arousal initiated and sustained in these mice.

N2  - The pineal hormone melatonin is the mediator of external light to physiologic adaptation to day and night rhythms, it regulates reproduction in animals but attempts to utilize melatonin in women for contraception have failed. Melatonin seems to be the natural hormone to facilitate sleep in insomniac patients and causes no hang over. When applied together with benzodiazepine it allows reduction of benzodiazepine without withdrawal effects. It should be applied 2 h before sleeping time in doses between 3 and 5 mg. Melatonin acts via the γ-aminobutyric acid- and benzodiazepine receptor explaining its success in treatment of seizures in children and in adults. Constant application of benzodiazepine reduced the production of natural melatonin in rats, supporting the evidence that long-term application of benzodiazepine in humans does not restore sleeping habits but reduces natural sleeping habits even more. Low melatonin levels were seen in bulimia or neuralgia and in women with fibromyalgia; replacement reduced pain, sleeping disorders, and depression in fibromyalgia and bulimia. Melatonin profiles are a diagnostic tool to distinguish between several forms of depression, like major depression, winter depression (SAD), unipolar depression, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In patients with a major depression success with antidepressants correlated with an increase in their melatonin profiles but only patients suffering from DSPS can be successfully treated with melatonin. In perimenopausal women melatonin administration did produce a change in LH, FSH and thyroid hormones. Some oncostatic properties are supported by cell culture work and studies in animals. In Nordic countries indigenous people suffer less from breast and prostate cancer, winter darkness seems to protect. The supposedly increased melatonin levels created the 'melatonin hypothesis'. Epidemiological studies did show that blind people indeed have half the rate of breast cancers, supporting the hypothesis. Controversial results concerning melatonin and insulin resistance and glucose tolerance have been published. In postmenopausal women application of melatonin reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Pregnant women should avoid melatonin, since its teratogenic effect is not known. Patients suffering from non-hormone dependent tumors, like leukemia, should avoid melanin, since tumor growth was promoted in animal experiments. It can be expected that melatonin will receive wide consideration for treatment of sleeping disturbances, jet lag, and fibromyalgia once an oral formulation becomes available in Europe. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objectives - A survey of the effects of pregnancy on parasomnias. Material and methods - In an area of a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community, women were interviewed during and after their pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess the frequency of their parasomnias. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last one the 3 months after delivery. Altogether 325 mothers filled all the five questionnaires and constitute the study group. Results - The total number of parasomnias declined (P < 0.001) during pregnancy and even more among the primiparas than among the multiparas (difference until third trimester, P = 0.02). Among various parasomnias reported, sleep talking and sleepwalking decreased from the prepregnant period to the second trimester (22.8 vs 12.6%, change P = 0.003), and the reported sleep starts also diminished from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (78.5 vs 63.1%, P < 0.001), but these phenomena did not change further during the follow-up. Altogether 55.7% of the women reported having nightmares 3 months before the pregnancy, and 47.7, 49.5, 41.2 and 40.3% (change from the prepregnant period, P < 0.001), respectively, at first, second and third trimester and after the delivery. Reported hypnagogic hallucinations decreased from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (9.8 vs 6.5%, P = 0.027), but returned thereafter to the previous level. During the prepregnant period, 25.8% of the women reported bruxism and only 19.9% during the first trimester (P = 0.009). Though the prevalence of sleep paralysis decreased during the first trimester of pregnancy, it was the only parasomnia that increased during later pregnancy (from 5.7 to 13.3% in the second trimester, P < 0.013). Conclusions - The reported frequency of most parasomnias decreases during pregnancy and even more in primiparas than multiparas.

N2  - Using a prospective design over three complete menstrual cycles, 147 heterosexual and 89 lesbian women made daily recordings of their basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus status, menses, and completed a daily checklist of various sexual behaviors (including sexual self-stimulation and sexual activity with a partner). They also gave their age, height, weight, age at menarche, number of pregnancies, duration of sleep, tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol use, and whether they had a live-in sexual partner. Using BBT, cervical mucus status, and menses information, cycle days were grouped into five discrete phases: menses, follicular, ovulatory, early luteal, and premenstrual. Daily frequencies of sexual behavior with a partner and autosexual behavior were computed for each phase. Mixed ANOVAs on the resultant proportional data revealed similar patterns for autosexual behavior across the phases for both heterosexuals and lesbians who did not have a live-in partner, in which autosexual behavior was highest during the follicular and ovulatory phases. For those with live-in partners, autosexual behavior did not vary across the phases. Lesbians engaged in more autosexual behavior overall. Allosexual behavior peaked during the follicular phase for both heterosexuals and lesbians, and the phasic pattern was unrelated to live-in partner status. Additional analyses suggest that the observed patterns were unrelated to anticipated changes in sexual activity due to menses. Results are discussed in terms of social variables and hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Fatigue is a common complaint of patients seen in primary care. Factors that contribute to fatigue in a patient population include poor health status, psychological stress, poor nutrition, and pregnancy. Less well understood are factors that contribute to fatigue among healthy, nonpregnant individuals. Within the framework of the theory of unpleasant symptoms, 40 healthy young smoking and nonsmoking adults between the ages of 18 and 35 were evaluated to determine self-report level of fatigue and contributing physiological, psychological, and situational factors. Results indicate that while self-report of fatigue did not vary in this population based on gender, subjects who were moderate to heavy cigarette smokers were significantly more fatigued than were nonsmokers (F = 10.24, df = 1, 38, P < 0.01), with the effect being specific to male smokers. Self-report of fatigue did not correlate with body mass index, baseline inflammatory or immune status, or blood pressure. Positive psychological and situational predictors of fatigue included depression (r = 0.556, P < 0.001), state anxiety (r = 0.569, P < 0.001), sleep quality (r = -0.399, P < 0.05), and sleep quantity (r = -0.411, P < 0.05). These results suggest that psychological and situational factors are key contributors to fatigue in young adults and that smoking is a risk factor for fatigue in men.

N2  - Background: Mefloquine is a clinically important antimalaria drug, which is often not well tolerated. We critically reviewed 516 published case reports of mefloquine adverse effects, to clarify the phenomenology of the harms associated with mefloquine, and to make recommendations for safer prescribing. Presentation: We postulate that many of the adverse effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic syndrome caused by primary liver damage. In some users we believe that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either independently or as a secondary consequence of the hepatocellular injury. The mefloquine syndrome presents in a variety of ways including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness, fatigue, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and concentration, and occasionally frank psychosis. Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill, recreational drugs, and other liver-damaging drugs) may be related to the development of severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine. Implications: We believe that people with active liver or thyroid disease should not take mefloquine, whereas those with fully resolved neuropsychiatric illness may do so safely. Mefloquine users should avoid alcohol, recreational drugs, hormonal contraception and co-medications known to cause liver damage or thyroid damage. With these caveats, we believe that mefloquine may be safely prescribed in pregnancy, and also to occupational groups who carry out safety-critical tasks. Testing: Mefloquine's adverse effects need to be investigated through a multicentre cohort study, with small controlled studies testing specific elements of the hypothesis.

N2  - Objectives: To survey the effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep. Methods: Mothers were interviewed during and after pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess alterations in their sleep. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last the 3 months after delivery. The study was carried out in a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community. Altogether, 325 pregnant women completed all five questionnaires. Results: The total amounts of reported sleep and of nocturnal sleep increased significantly during the first trimester of pregnancy, began to decrease thereafter and were shortest during the 3 months after pregnancy. During late pregnancy expectant mothers over 30 years of age reported less sleep than those under 30. During the whole pregnancy, but increasingly toward the end of pregnancy, sleep became more restless and fragmentary and its subjective quality worsened, due at least partly to increased restless legs and nightly awakenings increasing with advancing pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, although total sleeping time increases. The amount of reported sleep begins to decrease in the second trimester. The frequency of reported sleep disturbances, such as restless legs syndrome and nocturnal awakenings, is maximum in the third trimester but is about normal within 3 months after delivery. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - The use of urinary cortisol (UC) as an additional tool to evaluate sows welfare was assessed in two experiments. In a preliminary methodological experiment, the kinetics of cortisol excretion in urine was studied during an Adreno Cortico Trophic Hormone (ACTH) challenge test in 10 pregnant sows. In a second experiment, 96 primiparous sows of an experimental unit were assigned to two different housing systems: 48 animals were housed in individual pens (IP) and 48 animals in collective pens (CP) with 6 animals per pen. UC was measured at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy and compared with other welfare indicators such as behaviour or skin damage. In both experiments, UC was measured using a high pressure liquid chromatography assay. In experiment 1, UC was constant on the day before injection of ACTH, with no variations related to circadian rhythm. It began to rise 2 h after the injection, peaked between 2 to 5 h after then returned to the basal concentration on the day after the injection. In experiment 2, UC concentrations were not different between CP- and IP-housed sows but they were higher in sows exhibiting the less stereotypies in comparison with sows exhibiting the most stereotypies. The results of this study suggest that UC is a good indicator of acute stress, more convenient than plasma cortisol measurement since it is a non-invasive method avoiding restraint or catheterisation of sows. They also suggest that UC could also give additional information on the assessment of chronic stress and improve the evaluation of animal welfare if used in conjunction with other welfare indicators.

N2  - Aims: This study was carried out to investigate how the locus of control (LOC) varies between those who stop smoking in connection with pregnancy and those who do not. The LOC reflects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his life events. Methods: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the time of conception and paid their first visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and questionnaire based, covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC. One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. Results: The median LOC found was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air. Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated to a more external LOC (p<0.05). No differences were found between those who stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy smokers. Conclusion: The LOC does not seem to influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy. © Taylor & Francis 2002.
