AB  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant ( P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.

AB  - Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15-20% of obese pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.

AB  - Background: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI ≥25 kg/m2) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9-13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression. Results: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group ( p = 0.01, effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length. Conclusions: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.

AB  - Objective: Given the significance of sleep quality among pregnant women and its effects on the health of the fetus and the lack of sufficient studies in this field as well, the present study aimed to both identify some of the psychological factors associated with sleep quality among pregnant women and investigate the relationship between sleep quality among pregnant women and other variables, including depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, perceived social support, and marital adjustment. Materials and methods: In this descriptive-correlational study, 425 pregnant women, visiting Islamabad and Ravansar-based prenatal care centers (randomly selected from the townships of Kermanshah Province (Iran)) in 2015, were selected. To collect the required data, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWSMAT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RIS), Zimet's Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and depression, anxiety and stress scales were used. Results: The results of data analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between the quality of sleep and variables like depression, anxiety, stress, perception, social support and marital adjustment. Further, the results showed that the hierarchical regression of all variables could predict 31% of the changes of sleep quality. Additionally, anxiety, depression and stress were ranked first, second and third in terms of the shares of variables in predicting the quality of sleep. Whereas, resilience, perceived social support and marital adjustment were unable to predict the quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given the results of the present study, it is suggested that the roles of the psychological factors be considered in improving the quality of sleep among pregnant women.

AB  - Question Does a very low calorie diet (VLCD) plus intensive lifestyle counselling improve mild obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in overweight patients? Methods Design: randomised controlled trial (RCT). Allocation: unclear allocation concealment. Blinding: blinded (outcome assessors). Follow-up period: 1 year. Setting: Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. Patients: 81 patients 18DS65 years of age (mean age 51 y, 65% men) who had a body mass index of 28DS40 kg/m2 and an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of 5DS15 events/hour. Exclusion criteria were active treatment for OSA, pregnancy, and chronic kidney, thyroid, or liver disease. Intervention: a VLCD (600DS800 kcal/d) for 12 weeks plus intensive lifestyle counselling for 1 year (n = 40) or general oral and written information about diet and exercise at baseline, 3-month, and 1-year visits (control) (n = 41). Outcomes: included mild OSA and changes in weight, AHI, Snore Outcomes Survey (SOS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Patient follow-up: 89% (intention-to-treat analysis). Main results Fewer patients in the VLCD plus counselling group had mild OSA than in the control group (table). A VLCD plus counselling led to a greater reduction in weight and improvements in AHI and SOS scores compared with control (table); groups did not differ for ESS scores (table). Conclusion A very low calorie diet plus intensive lifestyle counselling improved mild obstructive sleep apnoea in overweight adults.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria strategy promoting these measures in Kenya.Methods: All women aged 15-49 years were interviewed during a community survey in four districts between December 2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression.Results: Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP.Conclusion: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. RESULTS: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r > or = 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

AB  - Objectives: To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O&NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables.Methods: We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls.Results: Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered -SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics.Conclusions: Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of acupression at the H7 point on sleep quality during pregnancy. After oral consent had been obtained, the midwife invited the women claiming to have poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-1. Then, the same midwife, previously trained by an expert acupuncturist (I.N.), advised the women to put on the wrist overnight compression H7 Insomnia Control half an hour before going to bed and to take it off upon awakening, for 10 consecutive days and thereafter every odd day (active group). Women refusing to wear the device for low compliance toward acupression were considered as the control group. After 2 weeks, a second questionnaire evaluation was completed. In the active, but not in the control, group, a significant improvement of sleep quality was observed after H7 device application. The study suggests that H7 acupression applied for 2 weeks improves sleep quality in pregnant women. This preliminary result should serve to stimulate further studies on the long-term effects of acupression.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to test the effects of acupuncture on insomnia in a group of pregnant women under real life conditions, and to compare the results with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone (sleep hygiene). Methods: A total of 30 conventionally treated pregnant women were allocated at random Into groups with or without acupuncture. Seventeen patients formed the study group and 13 the control group. The pregnant women scored the severity of insomnia using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10. Women were followed up for eight weeks and interviewed live times, at two-week intervals. Results: Eight women dropped out. five in the study group and three in the control group. The study group reported a larger reduction on insomnia rating (5.1) than the control group (0.0), a difference which was statistically significant (P=0.0028). Average insomnia scores decreased by at least 50% over time in nine (75%) patients in the study group and in three (30%) of the control group. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that acupuncture alleviates insomnia during pregnancy and further research is justified.

AB  - Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of acupuncture under real life conditions, in the treatment of emotional complaints during pregnancy. METHODS: A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships, social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four points were permitted as optional points. RESULTS: Three women from the acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Emotional complaints are very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study, acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of the personality characteristics of self-esteem, ego-development level, and unconscious attitudes toward pregnancy and motherhood on adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood in primiparas age 30 years and older. The conceptual framework was derived from Roy's four modes of adaptation which were operationalized to incorporate the independent and dependent variables. A descriptive correlational design was used, and instruments used in data collection included: Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, Loevinger's Washington University Sentence Completion Test (form 81), Lakin's Modified Thematic Apperception Test, Erickson's Pregnancy Symptom Checklist, and the Price Assessment of Maternal-infant Sensitivity Scale. Data were collected, using a non-random purposive sampling, over an 18 month period. The sample included 70 subjects who were scheduled to deliver at a major Boston teaching hospital. During the second trimester of pregnancy, the subjects completed the self-esteem scale, the sentence completion test, the pregnancy symptom checklist, and story writing in response to four TATs. At 12 weeks postpartum, a qualitative interview was conducted, and the maternal-infant sensitivity scale was completed during a feeding session at a scheduled home visit. The results of the study suggest a correlation between self-esteem and the physiological and psychological symptoms reported during pregnancy, and between pregnancy symptoms and postpartum maternal-infant sensitivity. Significant correlations were obtained between maternal and paternal age and the subjects' ego level, and length of marriage and TAT scores. Qualitative interview revealed positive themes of love, compassion, fulfillment in the maternal role, an unexpected 'falling in love' with their infants, and negative themes of sleep deprivation, lack of ability to prioritize activities of daily living, and concern about the marital relationship. Recommendations include replication of the study in a sample of younger primiparas, multiparous women, and a more heterogeneous group of pregnant women. Further research is indicated to investigate the significance of the Roy model on adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood. The results have nursing implications for assessment and intervention in the care of women who begin childbearing in their decade and beyond.

AB  - The article describes the risk factors for childhood obesity and the roles different groups can play in addressing obesity prevention and management. Higher pre-pregnancy weight status all have been linked with childhood obesity. Maintaining healthy dietary patterns throughout childhood is considered an important obesity prevention strategy. Shorter sleep duration is a third risk factor for obesity.

AB  - Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the "de novo mutation" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP.Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort.Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA.Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the "de novo mutation" hypothesis.

AB  - This study examined the incidence of adverse prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal experiences amongst children with anxiety disorders, and the relationship to clinical symptomology and functional impairment in treatment-seeking children (N = 107) with a primary anxiety disorder. Anxious children had higher rates of reported maternal prescription medication use during pregnancy, maternal smoking and illness during pregnancy and neonatal complications (including neonatal intensive care and feeding issues) compared with population base rates and non-affected children. Almost one-third had early problems with sleep. Developmental problems were common with more than half having at least one area of delay. More than three quarters of anxious children had a first-degree family member with a psychiatric history. There were several associations between neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and functional impairment. Findings suggest higher rates of perinatal complications in anxious children.

AB  - Objective: Although afternoon napping is very common, particularly in China, there are limited data regarding the potential health effects of afternoon napping during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight (LBW).Methods: A total of 10,111 women aged 15-50 years were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012-2014. Information on sleep habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Compared with women who reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI 0.58-1.18) and 0.61 (0.44-0.83) for those who reported ≤1 h and >1 h of napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association between LBW and napping 5-7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92).Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. METHOD: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSION: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

AB  - Background: Allostatic load (AL) measures the cumulative impact of chronic stress and is associated with adverse health outcomes. A novel scoring system has previously been developed for AL in early pregnancy that is associated with pre-eclampsia. It was hypothesized that AL, as identified by the present model, is associated with psychosocial stressors and, specifically, poor sleep quality.Methods: Women were selected from a low-risk, community-dwelling study population who enrolled at <15 weeks gestation. Nine physiologic components were divided among the domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association of AL with age, income, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare AL by race and educational attainment.Results: A total of 103 women were identified, with: a mean age of 29.8 ± 5.0 years, 17.5% black, and mean gestational age 12.2 ± 1.1 weeks. Allostatic load was positively correlated with the PSQI (ρ = 0.23, p = 0.018). There were no associations with age, income, prenatal distress, race, or depression scores. College-educated women had lower AL compared with those with less education (0.57 ± 0.43 vs 0.81 ± 0.55, p = 0.045).Conclusion: Higher AL, measured by the pregnancy-specific model, was associated with poorer sleep quality and lower educational attainment, both of which were considered to be chronic stressors. These relationships were consistent with previous findings in non-pregnant populations, and suggest that AL may be useful for capturing the physiologic impact of chronic stress in early pregnancy.

AB  - Adults born preterm have higher blood pressure (BP) than those born at term. Most studies have focused on preterm birth, and few have assessed BP variability, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP, measured by an oscillometric device, in 42 young adults born early preterm (<34 weeks), 72 born late preterm (34-36 weeks), and 103 controls (≥37 weeks). Sleep was confirmed with accelerometry in 72.4% of subjects. The 24-hour systolic BP of adults born early preterm was 5.5 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3), awake systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 2.8-10.1), and sleeping systolic BP was 2.9 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval 0.3-7.5) when adjusted for age, sex, and use of accelerometry. The differences remained similar when adjusted for height, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, parental education, maternal body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus and attenuated slightly when adjusted for maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Adults born early preterm also had higher BP variability as indicated by higher individual standard deviations of systolic BP and diastolic BP. Although our results were consistent with a dose-response relationship between shorter gestation and higher BP, the difference between the late preterm and term groups was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that the higher BP in adults born early preterm is present during both waking and sleeping hours, may be more pronounced during waking hours, and is accompanied by higher individual BP variability.

AB  - Background: Although an increase in research and treatment models exists for women survivors of sex trafficking (Clawson, Salomon, & Grace, 2013; Johnson, 2012), a limited literature connects the needs of survivors to music therapy treatment protocols (Schrader & Wendland, 2012). Literature on the effectiveness of music therapy with populations displaying similar symptoms (Amir, 2004; Bensimon, Amir, & Wolf, 2012) suggests that treatment involving music would potentially benefit survivors of sex trafficking. Related Literature: As victims of trafficking, the women are psychologically and physically enslaved. Once rescued, they are in desperate need of trauma-informed aftercare based on neurobiological research that appropriately treats each survivor’s complex needs (Clawson, Salomon, & Grace, 2013). In particular, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, and anxiety are core problems. Objective: The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the status of music therapy with women who have been trafficked, focused in the following ways: (a) Are music therapists working with this population? (b) What are the complex needs identified in the literature? (c) How are music therapists addressing the needs identified in the literature? (d) Does treatment support a neurobiological approach? and (e) What support do music therapists need to work with this population? Methods: Based on a review of the literature, a list of 18 observed needs for the women was compiled and a 20-item questionnaire was designed and distributed via SurveyMonkey. The questions primarily involved rating scales that requested music therapists working with the population to identify information about observed needs, employed music experiences, treatment focuses, and materials they consulted or needed. Participants were sent an e-mail asking them to verify whether they were board-certified music therapists and had worked with clients who had survived trafficking. Twelve participants met the inclusion criteria, and eleven participants completed the questionnaire (91.6% return rate). Responses were analyzed using one-way within-subject ANOVAs, follow-up dependent t-tests using the modified Bonferroni correction, and Pearson r; all were evaluated at α = .05. Two questions also required coding procedures. Results: Results indicated that only a few music therapists are working with the population (n = 12); the age range is 6 to 59, with most survivors between the ages of 12 and 23. Music therapists rated 90% of the listed needs as moderately important or higher, indicating their awareness of the women’s needs. Some observed needs also were considered significantly more important within each domain, except for the cognitive domain: (a) emotion—experiencing anger and depression were significantly more important than guilt; (b) social —difficulty with attachment relationships and mistrust of others were significantly more important than identification with the trafficker; and (c) medical—disruption of sleep/eating cycles was significantly more important than pregnancy complications and physical injuries. All Cohen’s ds supported these results. No significant differences, however, existed among music therapists’ ratings of how often they use seven music experiences, F(6,54) = 1.68, p = .143, Eta2 = .16. The strong effect size suggests that differences may exist if a larger n was available. Post hoc correlations between observed needs and parallel music therapy focuses revealed eight moderately high, significant relationships at p ≤ .048: difficulty learning (r = .67), delayed development (r = .82), anger (r = .89), guilt (r = .78), depression (r = .74), identification with trafficker (r = .85), addictions (r = .87), and sleep/eating cycles (r = .69). Information most often requested by music therapists working with this population (63.5 to 72.7%) was types of trauma, counseling skills, needs of the women, and facts about sex trafficking. Conclusions: The results suggest that women survivors of sex trafficking are a population that is drastically under-represented in music therapy practice. Although music therapists appear to be aware of the needs of the population, they tend to focus their treatment on just a few of the 18 needs, especially those within the emotional and cognitive domains. Data and anecdotal comments from the respondents further suggest a desire (a) for more research (e.g., trauma-informed treatment protocol linking treatment focuses with music experiences) and training; and (b) to form a support group among the music therapists working with these women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear if it is safe for babies to bed share with adults. In Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is bed-sharing with an adult. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. DESIGN: An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and 831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was > or =10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34). The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks, respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, p<0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is augmented further by bed-sharing. These factors should be taken into account when considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify key predictive variables of functional status after childbirth. DESIGN: An investigative survey design. SETTING: Primary health care maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population. All were aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure. Three variables predictive of functional status after childbirth were identified, namely, satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and perceived lack of support following childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Return to full functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery after childbirth. Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion, overload and dysfunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To help women avoid the additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a postnatal support plan. Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of baby care.

AB  - Background: Stillbirth occurring after 28 weeks gestation affects between 1.5-4.5 per 1,000 births in high-income countries. The majority of stillbirths in this setting occur in women without risk factors. In addition, many established risk factors such as nulliparity and maternal age are not amenable to modification during pregnancy. Identification of other risk factors which could be amenable to change in pregnancy should be a priority in stillbirth prevention research. Therefore, this study aimed to utilise an online survey asking women who had a stillbirth about their pregnancy in order to identify any common symptoms and experiences.Methods: A web-based survey.Results: A total of 1,714 women who had experienced a stillbirth >3 weeks prior to enrolment completed the survey. Common experiences identified were: perception of changes in fetal movement (63% of respondents), reports of a "gut instinct" that something was wrong (68%), and perceived time of death occurring overnight (56%). A quarter of participants believed that their baby's death was due to a cord issue and another 18% indicated that they did not know the reason why their baby died. In many cases (55%) the mother believed the cause of death was different to that told by clinicians.Conclusions: This study confirms the association between altered fetal movements and stillbirth and highlights novel associations that merit closer scrutiny including a maternal gut instinct that something was wrong. The potential importance of maternal sleep is highlighted by the finding of more than half the mothers believing their baby died during the night. This study supports the importance of listening to mothers' concerns and symptoms during pregnancy and highlights the need for thorough investigation of stillbirth and appropriate explanation being given to parents.

AB  - Sinus bradycardia which is a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of less than 60 bpm is caused by intrinsic cardiac disorders like sick sinus syndrome or inferior myocardial infarction, metabolic and environmental causes (such as hypothyroidism and electrolyte disorders), medications (such as beta-blockers and amiodarone), infection (such as myocarditis), increased intracranial pressure, and toxic exposure, while it can sometimes be a normal phenomenon, especially during sleep, in athletes, and during pregnancy. Symptomatic sinus bradycardia should warrant a thorough work-up in order to identify any reversible causes; otherwise, placement of a permanent pacemaker could be needed. We present the case of a patient who was admitted due to confusion and fever and was found to have pneumococcal meningitis and bacteremia, and during his hospital stay he developed symptomatic sinus bradycardia that was of intractable cause and persistent. Placement of a permanent pacemaker was chosen until the night staff of the hospital discovered by chance the neglected cause of his bradycardia.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify how puerperae perceive experiences they will face after hospital discharge and to identify the factors related to the formation of the living images. Forty-four puerperae who had normal pregnancies responded to a questionnaire regarding their anticipated and actual experiences. A statistical analysis was performed to assess the difference between the living images of daily activities and actual experience as well as to correlate these findings with the background of the subjects.Results1. Living images after hospital discharge were close to actual experience, except for the number of baby care hours.2. For the period immediately after hospital discharge, the puerperae experiences were close to what they perceived because of the support they received from family.3. At the time of the medical examination, one month after delivery, the puerperae noted that housekeeping hours increased as they expected but baby care hours increased significantly more than they expected. Sleep and rest hours were reduced.4. The following can be considered as factors used by the puerperae in forming living images after hospital discharge : factors such as baby care experiences, the baby feeding method, and the amount and quality of support they received after discharge.

AB  - Globally, anxiety and depression is the third leading cause of disease burden for women 14 to 44 years of age. The World Health Organisation reports that 15 to 57% of women in developing countries experience symptoms of depression. Maternal mental illness has a negative impact on infant and young child (IYC) growth, development and care, having serious health implications in terms of physical, cognitive and emotional well-being during crucial stages of the life span, such as the first 1000 days and early childhood. Various studies conducted in both developed and developing countries, have shown that maternal depression is associated with negative health outcomes such as: low birth weight, developmental delay, incomplete immunisation schedules, acute or chronic diarrhoea, somatic symptoms, disrupted sleep patterns and child abuse, as well as psychiatric and neuro-behavioural disorders. In addition, maternal depression impairs IYC care practices related to breastfeeding, health care, safety and development. It also contributes to inadequate nutrition during pregnancy as well as that of offspring during infancy and childhood, resulting in suboptimal brain development and inadequate growth. Infants with depressed mothers are not only vulnerable to becoming underweight, but also being stunted.

AB  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression ( X 13.39; p < 0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was also associated with probable depression ( X 9.20 p < 0.01), though this was attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute 'sleep-related causes' to their low mood ( X 20.78; p < 0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).

AB  - About 20 per cent of pregnant women experience antenatal depression (AD), which not only has deleterious effects on the woman and her baby but also increases the risk of developing postpartum depression. Nurses who understand the prevalence, signs and symptoms, and risk factors associated with AD can help to identify it and prevent the sequelae. The signs and symptoms of depression in pregnancy do not differ from depression at any other time. However, AD may go undiagnosed because of a focus on maternal and fetal well-being and the attribution of complaints to the physical and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Risk factors include history of depression, lack of partner, marital difficulties, lack of social support, poverty, family violence, increased life stress, substance abuse, history of previous abortions, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence toward the pregnancy and anxiety about the fetus. Most of the standard treatments for depression can be used in pregnant women, with the exception of some antidepressant medications. Supportive therapies -- exercise, adequate nutrition, adequate sleep, and support from family and friends -- are also indicated. Screening of women with known risk factors is crucial, but the authors suggest that the high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy indicates a need for universal screening.

AB  - In the United States, roughly half of women are either overweight (24.5%) or obese (21.4%) when they become pregnant. Women who are obese before pregnancy are at increased risk for a number of pregnancy complications relative to normal-weight women. Specifically, obesity is associated with significantly increased maternal risks, including gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and sleep disordered breathing. Maternal obesity is also associated with increased risks of adverse fetal outcomes, including prematurity, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and abnormal fetal growth. In this review, we will discuss the implications of obesity with respect to antepartum care.

AB  - Introduction: Nearly 40% of US women of childbearing age are obese. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with multiple risks for both the woman and fetus, yet clinicians often feel unprepared to provide optimal antepartum care for this group of women. We collected and reviewed current evidence concerning antepartum care of women who are obese during pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. Current evidence relating to the pregnancy care of women with a prepregnancy body mass index of 30kg/m2 or higher was identified using MEDLINE databases via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection between January 2012 and February 2018. Results: A total of 354 records were located after database searches, of which 63 met inclusion criteria. Topic areas for of included studies were: pregnancy risk and outcomes related to obesity, communication between women and health care providers, gestational weight gain and activity/diet, diabetic disorders, hypertensive disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, mental health, pregnancy imaging and measurement, late antepartum care, and preparation for labor and birth. Discussion: Midwives and other health care providers can provide better antepartum care to women who are obese during pregnancy by incorporating evidence from the most current clinical investigations.

AB  - Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring's neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use.Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38).Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus.Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the relationship of anxiety and quality of life and sleep variables to recurrent miscarriages (RMs) in patients during two stages of their treatment in an RM-dedicated clinic - before and after the evaluation - and determine what factors could aggravate anxiety and worsen global well-being outcomes. Study design: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including canonical correlation were performed. Results: All the patients revealed a mild to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her psychological health. Conclusions: This study establishes anxiety as a common response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and reassurance.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the use of nursing diagnoses and interventions proposed for women in labour and high-risk pregnancies. Method: This is a descriptive, retrospective study with documentary analysis of 1000 medical records and a checklist conducted from July to September 2014, at a maternity hospital in Paraiba, Brazil. It consisted of analysing descriptive measures and comparing the relationship between nursing diagnoses and interventions using NANDA – International and the Nursing Interventions Classification. Results: The most common diagnoses in labour were acute pain (62%), fatigue (24.7%), and anxiety (22%). For high-risk pregnant women they were impaired sleep and rest (100%), risk of infection (81.8%), and anxiety (77.2%). The interventions were hand washing (80.8%) and identify and accommodate patient in the bed (78%). Conclusion: The diagnoses express needs during parturition and the psychobiological changes in high-risk pregnancy. The interventions are disconnected from the diagnoses and should therefore be reviewed and altered.

AB  - Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

AB  - Introduction To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18-44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [β = −0.03, (−0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [β = −0.19, (−0.38, −0.01) and β = −0.20, (−0.33, −0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [β = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.

AB  - Objective: To report maternal sleep practices in women who experienced a stillbirth compared with controls with ongoing live pregnancies at similar gestation.Design: Prospective case-control study.Setting: Forty-one maternity units in the United Kingdom.Population: Women who had a stillbirth after ≥ 28 weeks' gestation (n = 291) and women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n = 733).Methods: Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire that included questions on maternal sleep practices before pregnancy, in the four weeks prior to, and on the night before the interview/stillbirth.Main Outcome Measures: Maternal sleep practices during pregnancy.Results: In multivariable analysis, supine going-to-sleep position the night before stillbirth had a 2.3-fold increased risk of late stillbirth [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.04-5.11] compared with the left side. In addition, women who had a stillbirth were more likely to report sleep duration less than 5.5 hours on the night before stillbirth (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.68), getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85-4.26), and a daytime nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.94). No interaction was detected between supine going-to-sleep position and a small-for-gestational-age infant, maternal body mass index, or gestational age. The population-attributable risk for supine going-to-sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5-9.2).Conclusions: This study confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. Further work is required to determine whether intervention(s) can decrease the frequency of supine going-to-sleep position and the incidence of late stillbirth.Tweetable Abstract: Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with 2.3× increased risk of stillbirth after 28 weeks' gestation.Plain Language Summary: Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is a tragedy for mothers and families. One approach to reduce stillbirths is to identify factors that are associated with stillbirth. There are few risk factors for stillbirth that can be easily changed, but this study is looking at identifying how mothers may be able to reduce their risk. In this study, we interviewed 291 women who had a stillbirth and 733 women who had a live-born baby from 41 maternity units throughout the UK. The mothers who had a stillbirth were interviewed as soon as practical after their baby died. Mothers who had a live birth were interviewed during their pregnancies at the same times in pregnancy as when the stillbirths occurred. We did not interview mothers who had twins or who had a baby with a major abnormality. Mothers who went to sleep on their back had at least twice the risk of stillbirth compared with mothers who went to sleep on their left-hand side. This study suggests that 3.7% of stillbirths after 28 weeks of pregnancy were linked with going to sleep lying on the back. This study also shows that the link between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth was not affected by the duration of pregnancy after 28 weeks, the size of the baby, or the mother's weight. Women who got up to the toilet once or more at night had a reduced risk of stillbirth. This is the largest of four similar studies that have all shown the same link between the position in which a mother goes to sleep and stillbirth after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Further studies are needed to see whether women can easily change their sleep position in late pregnancy and whether changing the position a mother goes to sleep in reduces stillbirth.

AB  - Study Objectives: Our investigation aims to assess the impact of symptoms of maternal sleep-disordered breathing, specifically sleep apnea risk and daytime sleepiness, on fetal leukocyte telomere length.Participants and Setting: Pregnant women were recruited upon hospital delivery admission.Interventions: Sleep exposure outcomes were measured using the Berlin Questionnaire to quantify sleep apnea and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure daytime sleepiness. Participants were classified as "High Risk" or "Low Risk" for sleep apnea based on responses to the Berlin, while "Normal" or "Abnormal" daytime sleepiness was determined based on responses to the Epworth.Design: Neonatal umbilical cord blood samples (N = 67) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated from cord blood leukocytes using Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical procedures were employed.Measurements and Results: On the Berlin, 68.7% of participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value < 0.05), and the T/S ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual snorers (P value < 0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.

AB  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD, <37 weeks gestation). We examined the individual and joint associations of pre-pregnancy BMI, second trimester exercise and sleep on PTD. We conducted a nested, population-based case-control study interviewing postpartum 344 cases delivering at <37 weeks, as identified by clinical estimate of gestational age from prenatal screening records, and 698 term controls, excluding term low birthweight. Eligible women participated in California's statewide Prenatal Screening Program, worked during pregnancy, and delivered a singleton birth in Southern California in 2002-2003. Modeled separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.96-per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95 % CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs. no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95 % CI = 0.80-1.48 for <7 h; OR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.57-1.48 for >8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.

AB  - Objectives: Tests of the relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity (OW/OB) among women have been inconsistent. Few studies reporting such associations have focused on women of childbearing age. This paper investigates this association among Canadian women of childbearing age.Methods: Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. The sample consisted of women aged 18-44 years. All variables were self-reported. Sleep duration was dichotomized as insufficient (< 7 h/night) or adequate (≥ 7 h/night). A composite score of sleep quality was used and dichotomized as poor none/little of the time or some/most/all of the time. Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index. Associations between sleep and OW/OB were assessed using logistic regression analyses with survey weights. Three models were computed for sleep duration/quality: model without covariates, model adjusted for demographics (age, ethnicity, level of education, household income, marital status, employment, parity, region, and season), and model adjusted for demographics and variables associated with OW/OB (mood disorder, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol).Results: Total sample consisted of 9749 women of childbearing age. Thirty-eight percent had insufficient sleep duration. Sleep duration was significantly associated with OW/OB in the model with no covariates and discriminated 52.8% of women of childbearing age, but this association was no longer significant in the models adjusted for covariates. Sleep quality was not significantly linked to OW/OB in any of the models.Conclusion: Targeting sleep alone would likely not contribute to lower risk of OW/OB among Canadian women of childbearing age. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones, are needed to confirm these findings.
