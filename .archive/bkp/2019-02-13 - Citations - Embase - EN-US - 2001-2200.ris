N2  - Jane Honikman is a Postpartum Parent Support Consultant from Santa Barbara, California. In 1977, she co-founded Postpartum Education for Parents (PEP). She founded Postpartum Support International (PSI) in 1987. « I was pregnant, single and alone. I gave birth in a foreign country, and never saw my baby. I had no emotional support ». « I was married, and was finally pregnant. I gave birth, away from my extended family, but with a supportive husband. We had no emotional support » It is these contrasting, yet similar experiences, which have motivated Jane Honikman to become passionate about improving the outcomes for babies and their parents. After the birth of her second child, she co-founded, with some of her friends, Postpartum Education for Parents (PEP). It was conceived from their own needs as struggling young parents, removed from their families, and inundated with professional advice. It was about making friends, learning about community resources, and gaining confidence as new parents. The first ever warm line, staffed entirely by trained parent volunteers, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week was launched and it has been available since July 1, 1977. Communities are human systems where we live, work, learn, pray, and play together. We tend to gather together based on our cultural values and with a common purpose. It is during pregnancy that the first shift in emotional needs occurs. The arrival of the newborn does interrupt a new parent’s existing community, as well as a good night’s sleep. Social connections, our networks, exist within each community, yet how do expectant and new families find or create them? In general, our networks help us find employment, friendship, and provide emotional support and comfort. We may relish these natural human interactions, take them for granted, or in some cases, ignore them. Then, the new baby arrives. The need for community support takes on a different meaning. During this interactive course, Oguz Omay will interview Jane Honikman on how to build efficient and sustainable community networks for new families. The presenters will explore how best a perinatal psychiatry team may work with users’ associations and the participants will be called to comment on challenges they perceive in their own cultural context.

N2  - Introduction. Obstructive sleep apnea (OAS) occur frequently during pregnancy and predict adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be associated with respiratory complications after delivery. The tolerability of CPAP should be low following delivery because it impairs the interactions between mother and newborn. Elevated body position improves airway diameter and patency in OSA and during anesthesia, thus we hypothesized that it improves upper airway (UA) during wakefulness, and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) early after delivery. Methods. We measured in 50 women within 48 h after delivery upper airway diameter [mid of oral cavity to epiglottis, (UAD); Acoustic Pharyngometry, Eccovision Sleep Group Solutions) in sitting, 45 degrees elevated and supine position during wakefulness. Prior to bedtime, we connected our patients to an Alice PdX polysomnography monitor (Respironics Inc.), and changed the bed position such that each patient spent half the night in supine and elevated position (randomized cross over design). Results. OSA was diagnosed in 35.5% of the patients and associated with significantly higher rates of caesarean section (36.4% vs. 10.0%) and longer duration of hospital stay after delivery (n=31; Abb. 1; p=0.03). During wakefulness UAD was significantly smaller in supine vs. 45 degrees elevated and sitting body position, (n=39; Abb. 2; p<0.05). Elevated body position during sleep significantly reduced AHI (3.88±1.3/h vs (Figure presented) 6.27±2.2/h; p<0.05) without impairing sleep architecture (no difference in time awake after sleep onset, arousal index, and amount of different sleep stages). Conclusion. OSA following delivery is associated with adverse outcome. The elevated head of the bed improved AHI following delivery by increasing airway size.

N2  - Understanding sleep and how vulnerable different populations are to not sleeping well is an ongoing issue for researchers and clinicians. There is an overall need to get the right message or psycho-education to the right group to enable a change in behaviour. We shall be examining 3 distinct populations. In Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) it is rare to achieve a greater than a 6-hour adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) on a nightly basis for sufferers. Psychoeducation/ Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)/ Motivational Interviewing (Richards et al., 2007; Olsen et al., 2008, 2010; Aloia et al., 2001, 2007) have all been used in the past with varying degrees of success. We also know that self-efficacy is an important component in this treatment process (Stepnowsky ET a., 2002;Weaver et al., 2005, 2008).We shall be discussing the role of CBT and health coaching in the role of improving adherence in individuals with low self-efficacy as they undertake CPAP therapy. Living in rural communities in Australia is often a considerable barrier to obtaining good health care for insomnia. We are undertaking to train Practice Nurses working in 2 rural communities who are then able to undertake brief behavioural interventions in the treatment of insomnia Troxel et al., 2012; Buysse et al., 2011). This research is based on previous research models with particular emphasis on a stepped care model (Espie et al., 2007; 2011). Our third area of interest is the role of sleep for new parents. So much of parent education for new parents is geared towards a normal birth and successful breast feeding post birth. Little time is spent on the role of sleep or lack of sleep in this population.We are currently undertaking a sleep intervention for first time parents in their last trimester to help them have a more realistic understanding of the changes in sleep during pregnancy and what to expect in their baby's sleep in the first year of life (Kempler et al., 2012). In doing this we are also hoping that such an intervention may reduce the risk of post natal depression. We shall be discussing some of these strategies in detail.

N2  - Background: Reproduction (pregnancy or fathering a pregnancy) and raising a family are important considerations for many individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Health care professionals have long struggled with how to address these issues. To date, to the best of our knowledge, there has never been a multidisciplinary multi-angled systematic approach to harness all the rich sources and types of available information, encompassing the full reproductive period from pre-pregnancy through into childhood. In February 2013, we were able to create a virtual MS Centre of Excellence (MS-CERCH) with the goal of initiating a multidisciplinary, coordinated platform capable of addressing a number of important clinical and developmental questions by bringing together population-based data derived from linking multiple health administrative and education-related databases together with detailed clinical, interview-based and questionnaire derived information. This platform will provide prospectively collated data for: (i) women with MS (including drug therapies, all pregnancy outcomes, reason(s) for any pregnancy losses, MS relapse rates corrected for MS course prior to pregnancy); (ii) men with MS who are fathering a pregnancy (including drug exposure during conception, relapse rates post delivery related to the stress and loss of sleep with a newborn); and (iii) the children of parent(s) with MS, including early, mid and late childhood developmental outcomes (0-12 years). Methods: The meeting included a wide range of health care professionals, researchers and trainees who exchanged ideas and discussed feasibility. The MS-CERCH steering committee also includes Dr. Kerstin Hellwig (Germany), Dr. Annette Langer- Gould (USA), Dr.Maria Houtchens (USA), Dr.Pierre Duquette (Canada), Motherisk (Drs.Gideon Koren and Anna Pupco, Canada), Dr. Vincent Armenti (USA), Dr. Jan Freedman (Canada), Dr. Penelope Smyth (Canada) Results: The MS-CERCH mandate was agreed upon, namely “To provide evidence in reproductive decision-making and parenting related issues to individuals with MS and related disorders”. Work is in progress to develop a prospective registry and to conduct collaborative projects. Conclusions: The steering committee is planning collaborative projects to prove that this group can work productively and collaboratively. The purpose of this abstract is to introduce this multicentre endeavour to international colleagues who may want to join with MS-CERCH.

N2  - Introduction. Resistant or refractory hypertension (rHTA) is a clinical problem in the patients admitted in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Sometimes the management represents a challenge for the clinician. OBJECTIVES. Aim of this study was to evaluate the main causes involved in rHTA of the patients admitted in our intensive care unit. METHODS. Observational and prospective study of the patients admitted in the intensive care unit with criteria of refractory hypertension fromJanuary 2009 to January 2011. All patientswere performed a standard test battery (blood analysis and urine, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound) and other specific studies (hormone study, polysomnography isotopic nephrogram, angioresonance, renal arteriography). RESULTS. The study population included 172 patients. The majority (65 %) were admitted to the ICU in the context of cardiac pathology. We found that the kidney disease was the most common cause for rHTA (34.4 %) including chronic kidney failure, renovascular hypertension, glomerulonephritis, polycystic disease. The second place was for drugs (30.6 %), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remained the most frequent druginduced hypertension, others drugs found were corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, ciclosporin and anabolic steroid. Central causes of hypertension represented the 17.8 % emphasizing the morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, intra-axial hemorrhage or intracranial hypertension. Endocrino-metabolics causes were presented in 11.7 %: Hypothyroidism, hyperaldosteronism hypoaldosteronism, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism cushing0s syndrome, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, licorice abuse, lead poisoning. Other responsible causes were pregnancy (3.9 %) and aortic coarctation (1.7 %). CONCLUSIONS. In the most of the case the rHTA has a specific etiology but specialized studies are needed. We propose a model of a multidisciplinary team envolved in the diagnosis because it provides an early diagnosis, allows the start of an appropriate treatment and can also help to identify the factors of decompensation.

N2  - Objective: Several etiological factors such as genetic factors, pregnancy, infections, lymphoma and head trauma have been thought to play a role in the etiology of narcolepsy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of head trauma in patients diagnosed with narcolepsy. Method: The diagnosis of narcolepsy was made at sleep laboratory of a university hospital by polysomnographic studies (PSG) and multiple sleep latency (MSLT) tests. A form was filled with patients to determine the frequency of head trauma in their medical history. Results: A total of 45 patients were included in the study. 17 patients had a history of head trauma previously. This ratio was greater than normal population and was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion: It was shown that damage occurs at hypocretin neurons after traumatic brain injury and decreased CSF hypocretin levels may cause narcolepsy. The results of this study confirm the previous findings in the literature.

N2  - Aim: To investigate gender-related differences in amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years. Methods: Preterms born <30 weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002 were prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first 2 weeks of life were classified according to aEEG composite scores - including background pattern, sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 3 years of age. Results: Neurodevelopmental outcome data was available for 148 of 264 eligible infants - 64 showed a normal outcome and 84 an impaired outcome. A logistic regression model revealed a significant independent influence of IVH, analgetic/sedative/anticonvulsant medication, gestational age and gender on aEEG composite scores. Odds ratios for having an abnormal aEEG composite score within the first 2 weeks of life for 'female sex', 'no IVH', 'no medication' and 'gestational age' were calculated. aEEG did not differ between males and females with normal outcomes. In patients with abnormal outcome, however, male preterms showed more burst-suppression patterns and less SWC when compared with female preterms. Conclusion: Being male with an abnormal outcome at 3 years of age is reflected by a less mature early aEEG when compared with the one of females. This association is independent of IVH and medication and was less evident with increasing gestational age. © 2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Background and objectives: the paper consists in presenting the main findings of a survey conducted in 2011 which targeted a group of women through six health centers Boumerdes city (Algeria), in order to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity among those surveyed, understand the relationship between overweight, obesity, eating behavior and lifestyle, assess the prevalence of chronic diseases they might suffer and finally evaluating the level of consciousness with regard to the relationship between overweight, obesity and chronic diseases Methods: The survey targeted 786 women, non-pregnant and non-lactating, aged between 18-70 years. The questionnaire contains qualitative variables (lifestyle, eating habits, and education) and quantitative variables (weight, height), 3. Results: 44.9% of respondents are aged 40 to 49 years with an average age of 41 years. 2/3 of these women are educated, 37.7% with a university degree and 10% are illiterate. They are workers in 64.8% of cases and married in 70% of cases. Poor eating habits are observed and taking Consumption of fast food is found in 41.8% of cases and more than 5 times per month; The household budget determines the nature of the meal. Physical inactivity is observed; only 7.2% of women are overweight or obese exercise sport against 10.3% with normal weight. 51% of respondents spend an average of 2 hours per day watching television. 64.3% of normal weight women and 72% of overweight and obese women take a nap less than 1 hour per day. 33.2% reported having at least one chronic disease. 92.3% are aware of the risks of obesity to health; Conclusions: Obesity and overweight pose a serious public health problem, in view of the nature of chronic diseases that are generated and the high cost of their care. Nutrition education and physical activity are essential for their reduction.

N2  - Despite free distribution of insecticide treated nets in Nigeria, the use it as a means of malaria prevention and control has not been fuIly embraced. The aim of this survey was to determine the level of awareness, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets among residents of Abavo community, Delta State Nigeria It is a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted among 250 heads of households. One hundred and seventy five (70%) respondents were aware of insecticide treated net as a means of prevention against malaria, 111 (44%) claimed to own insecticide treated nets. On further inspection of houses of those who claimed to own ITNs, seventy four (66%) actually had theirs hanged, the rest were either in their packs or not seen. Ninety five (38%) respondents out of the total sleep under insecticide treated net. About 92 (70%) households having under-five and 39 (81.3%) of households having pregnant women claim to use ITNs. It was observed that the level of education (chi2 = 48.35, p = 0.001), presence of under 5 children in a household ?2 = 7.229, p = 0.027) influenced ownership of Insecticide treated nets. In conclusion despite a high level of awareness about ITN found in this survey, ownership and utilization of insecticide treated nets were low.

N2  - Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Twelve women (age 7 SD=26.9 7 5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase. Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts >30 min. On average 7 SD, new mothers phase delayed 42 7 80 min (range = 163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6. Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication. Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frequency of pertussis is highly variable from country to country and it depends on multiple factors including case definitions and type of surveillance systems used. Many countries recently reported an increase of pertussis cases especially in infants and adolescents. METHODS: From April 2006 to March 2010, 0-15 year old patients hospitalized with suspected or proven pertussis were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Patients with ≥14 days of cough plus paroxysms, whooping or post-tussive vomiting fulfilled the clinical case definition of pertussis. For laboratory confirmation, Bordetella pertussis PCR was offered free of charge. RESULTS: Data were available from 159 of 173 reported cases and 130 (90% of them <12 months old) were eligible including 125 laboratory confirmed B. pertussis infections. Rates per 100,000 population were 2.6 (<16 years) and 38.8 (<12 months), respectively. Most frequent complications were cyanosis (63%) and sleep disturbance (60%); 35 (27%) patients received intensive care, 1 patient died. Source of infection was known in 79 (61%) patients and was mainly a sibling, parent or both. Most patients were unimmunized (65%) or incompletely immunized (30%). CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of pertussis hospitalization in young infants established in this surveillance project and the incomplete pertussis immunization status in almost all hospitalized patients require further efforts for improvement. In addition, introduction of pertussis immunizations for all adolescents (in 2013), young adults (in 2012), and pregnant women (in 2013) in Switzerland should increase indirect protection of vulnerable newborns and infants too young to be fully immunized.

N2  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently diagnosed in the presence of impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of activities and interests. However, there is considerable variability in the behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans the entire range of IQ and language abilities, as well as other behavioral, communicative, and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to incorporate a degree of heterogeneity, the variability in the nature and severity of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW), and in uteri exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The findings from this "proof of principle" paper provide support for this "bottom-up" approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups. © 2013 Unwin, Maybery, Wray and Whitehouse.

N2  - Fetal brain development involves the development of the neuro-vegetative (autonomic) control that is mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Disturbances of the fetal brain development have implications for diseases in later postnatal life. In that context, the fetal functional brain age can be altered. Universal principles of developmental biology applied to patterns of autonomic control may allow a functional age assessment. The work aims at the development of a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) based on heart rate patterns. We analysed n = 113 recordings in quiet sleep, n = 286 in active sleep, and n = 29 in active awakeness from normals. We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet sleep (n = 113, 63 females) and active sleep (n = 286, 145 females) state by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. According to universal system developmental principles, we included indices that address increasing fluctuation range, increasing complexity, and pattern formation (skewness, power spectral ratio VLF/LF, pNN5). The resulting models constituted fABAS. fABAS explained 66/63% (coefficient of determination R2 of training and validation set) of the variance by age in quiet, while 51/50% in active sleep. By means of a logistic regression model using fluctuation range and fetal age, quiet and active sleep were automatically reclassified (94.3/93.1% correct classifications). We did not find relevant gender differences. We conclude that functional brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from autonomic control patterns. fABAS reflect normal complex functional brain maturation. The presented normative data are supplemented by an explorative study of 19 fetuses compromised by intrauterine growth restriction. We observed a shift in the state distribution towards active awakeness. The lower WGA dependent fABAS values found in active sleep may reflect alterations in the universal developmental indices, namely fluctuation amplitude, complexity, and pattern formation that constitute fABAS. © 2013 Hoyer et al.

N2  - Extreme variability in sleep duration and/or fragmentation impacts physiology and disease risk. Pregnant women have sleep variability given the changes that take place following conception. No investigations have examined the degree to which pregnant women experience sleep variability nor have any examined whether sleep variability results in immunological changes important for a successful pregnancy. Sleep diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep data collected from 168 pregnant women at 10-12 weeks'(T1), 14- 16 weeks'(T2), and 18-20 weeks'(T3) gestation were assessed for intra-individual variability, estimated from each subject's standard deviation on diary (D) and actigraphy (A) measures. Morning blood samples for assay of cytokines were collected. Greater variability in both D-and A-sleep variables were associated with higher circulating cytokine concentrations. At T1 greater variability in Dassessed sleep efficiency (r = .29, p = .03) was associated with higher IL-6; greater variability in TIB was associated with higher IL-6 (r = .26, p = .05) and TNF-a (r = .23, p = .04). At T3 greater variability in D- and A-assessed sleep latency was associated with higher IL-6 (r = .30, p = .01; r = .32, p = 01); D WASO was associated with lower TNF-a (r = -.24, p = .03). Sleep variability appears to be a stressor that could increase in circulating inflammatory markers and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Importantly it is a modifiable stressor that can be intervened upon.

N2  - Introduction It is estimated that 10% of pregnancies are affected by hypertension worldwide and one-half of all are due to preeclampsia. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of reported preeclampsia / hypertension among women who were later diagnosed with OSA. Material and methods The OSA women (n=156) newly diagnosed with moderate or severe OSA mean (SD) AHI 42.6 (20, 0), mean ODI 32, 0 (20,0). They all answered a questionnaire including questions about sleep, symptoms of OSA and if they had been diagnosed with preeclampsia (PE) or pregnancy induced hypertension (HT). Results Among the 156 OSA women 146 had been pregnant and 31% reported that they had during pregnancy been diagnosed with PE and 37% HT. When the OSA women reporting preeclampsia were compared to OSA women not reporting PE, they were more likely to be more obese BMI 35,6 m2, (6,3) vs. 32,5 m2, (5,3), p=0,002), younger (mean age 56,1 vs. 59.6 years, p=0,01), and current smokers (29% vs. 13%). In a multivariate logistic regression, they are also more likely to report nocturnal sweating and morning headaches after adjusting for significant demographic factors. No significant differences were found in OSA severity, insomnia, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obstructive lung diseases, restless legs syndrome between OSA women reporting PE and those who did not. Conclusion Among women OSA patients one third reported having had preeclampsia or hypertension during pregnancy which is three times more often than reported in the general population. These women were compared to other OSA women more obese, younger, more often smokers and reporteted night time sweatening and headache upon wakening more often.

N2  - Objective: To analyse the circadian rhythm maturation of temperature, activity and sleep during the first year of life in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) and its relationship with obesity markers. Methods: A prospective analysis of the children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal circumference was evaluated ecographically during gestation. Skin temperature and rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 15days and 1, 3 and 6months. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were evaluated during the first year of life. Results: Children from the GDM groups tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the beginning of the last trimester (p=0.077) and at delivery (p=0.078). Mean skin temperature or activity was not different among the groups. The I<O sleep index pointed to increasing concordance with parental sleeping at 3 and 6months but no significant GDM-dependent differences. However, some of the parameters that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index from the temperature-activity variable were significantly lower at 6months in the GDM+insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal adiposity, correlated negatively with parameters related to circadian rhythm maturation as the circadian/ultradian rhythm (P1/Pult ratio). Conclusions: Fetal adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM. In addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the circadian function index of temperature activity at 6months of age. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The placenta is composed of several different trophoblast cell subtypes that have been defined based on distinct anatomical locations and structural features, but often the reasons for the diversity have been unclear. My laboratory has been using cell lineage tracing and detailed gene expression in the mouseplacenta in order to define distinct functional cell types. Placentaspecific hormone genes have rapidly evolved, among them members of the growth hormone/prolactin (Prl) superfamily.We have found that 23 genes in the Prolactin-like protein (PLP)/placental lactogen (PL) gene family which sits in a 1 Megabase region of mouse chromosome 13 are exclusively expressed in the placenta and yet, while there is some overlap of some genes, there are several different patterns of gene expression. These patterns of expression have helped to distinguish 5 different endocrine cell types that sit at different positions within the maternal blood space, all of which are polyploid trophoblast giant cells (TGCs). There is no obvious correlation between expression and position in the gene locus. Surprisingly, even close paralogues that are the most evolutionarily related often do not have identical expression. There are 4 genes that are most similar to Prl, and which probably function through the same receptor (PrlR).We have found that pregnant females that are mutant for the PrlR gene develop gestational diabetes due to a failure in adaptation of the number of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Females which are deficient for the Prl gene do not develop diabetes, implying that the placenta-derived, and not maternalderived, Prl-like hormones mediate the maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. To directly test this hypothesis, we have generated a mouse with a 1 Megabase deletion of the placenta-specific PLP/PL genes. Homozygous mutant conceptuses can survive as long as there are wildtype or heterozygous littermates. However, pregnancies in which 100% of the conceptuses are mutant are lost by gestation day 13.5 and the females develop hyperglycemia. One of the PLP/PL genes (PL1alpha) is expressed in a circadian rhythm during the day and changes signalled by feeding. The intriguing finding is that different TGC subtypes show different patterns of expression of PL1alpha indicating that these cells are functionally distinct.

N2  - Background: Suicidality has a multifactorial determination and is clinically under-diagnosed. Self-reported poor health, negative affect and sleep difficulties are associated with psychological distress, including suicidality. Aim: To analyze the association between lifetime SRH, sleep difficulties, negative affect (NA) and suicidal ideation in pregnancy (T0) and post-partum (T1) and if they are predictors of suicidal ideation. Methods: 397 pregnant women completed the Portuguese version of POMS, PDSS and a set of items evaluating SRH, and sleep difficulties in the last trimester of pregnancy an three months of post-partum. Findings: In pregnancy, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with lifetime SRH (p< .05), NA (p< .01) and difficulties of initiating sleep (DIS) (p< .01). In post-partum, suicidal ideation was also associated with DIS (p< .01), NA (p< .01), but not with SRH. In pregnancy, the predictors of the probability of having or not suicidal ideation are both SRH and DIS. In postpartum the suicidal ideation predictor was only DIS. However when NA was introduced in the regression model, NA was the only predictor of suicide ideation in both pregnacy and postpartum. Conclusion: Difficulties of initiating sleep should be considered an indicator of suicidal ideation during the perinatal period. However NA might explain this association.

N2  - Introduction: Socially prescribed perfectionism has been associated with long-term sleep disturbances (Azevedo et al., 2010). Objective: To investigate the association between perfectionism dimensions and insomnia in pregnancy. Methods: 581 pregnant women, mean age 29.8 years (SD=4.5), average weeks of gestation 32.6 (SD=3.5), mostly married (75%) and nulliparae (64%) participated in the study. The multidimensional perfectionism scale (Hewitt and Flett, 1991; Soares et al., 2003) was used to assess total levels of perfectionism, self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) and dimensions of socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP): others high expectations (OHE) and conditional acceptance (CA) (Macedo et al., 2009). Insomnia symptoms and related daytime impairment were assessed with an insomnia questionnaire (Marques et al., 2011). Objective estimations of sleep were obtained through actigraphy in a small group (n=60). Results: In comparison to good sleepers, insomniacs showed higher levels of SPP (M=53.4, SD=13.0 versus M=49.6, SD=12.3, p< .05) and SPP-CA (M=19.6, SD=6.1, versus M=18.0, SD=5.5, p< .05). Women with difficulties initiating sleep reported higher levels of SPP-CA than good sleepers. Analyses of actigraphy revealed that SPP-CA was associated with less sleep time (r=-.45, p< .05), less sleep efficiency (r= -.34, p< .05), more time awake during sleep (r= .43, p< .05) and more mean activity asleep (r= .38, p< .05). Conclusion: Conditional acceptance is the SPP perfectionism sub-dimension particularly associated with self-reported insomnia and sleep alterations measured objectively with actigraphy in pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate if the sleep pattern (SP) of women undergoing voluntary interruption of pregnancy is affected by the method of termination of pregnancy (VToP, medical or surgical). DESIGN: This prospective study, performed between August 2012 and April 2013, included women referred to our University hospital for VToP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients within 49 days of amenorrhea underwent medical interruption of pregnancy (group M) while those with amenorrhea comprised between 49 and 90 days underwent the surgical termination of pregnancy (group S). Sleep quality, insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Insomnia severity index (ISI) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), respectively. Patients were evaluated at baseline, at 1-month and 3- month after the VToP. RESULTS: Of the 203 consecutive women approached for the study, 132 accepted to participate, yielding a response rate of 65.0%. Fifty-three women (40.2%) underwent medical VToP and 79 women underwent surgical VToP. At baseline, no difference was observed between group M and S in the prevalence of poor sleep quality (group M: 60.4%, group S: 58.2%; p=0.948), of clinically relevant insomnia was (group M: 3.8%, group S: 6.3%; p=0.806) and of excessive daytime sleepiness (group M: 13.3%, group S: 13.9%; p=0.888). 1-month after VToP, there was non-significant amelioration of PSQI, ISI and ESS in both groups. At 3-month, there was a significant improvement of the three questionnaires in both groups compared with baseline. Patients who underwent VToP, either medical or surgical for the first time showed baseline scores significantly worse than those who previously underwent VToP. CONCLUSION: In women undergoing voluntary termination of pregnancy, the sleep quality is not influenced by the interruption technique. Sleep quality of patients who undergo termination of pregnancy for the first time is significantly worse compared with those who previously underwent termination of pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The quantity and quality of sleep affects not only health, mood, but also hormones and fertility. Some studies evaluated the impact of sleep on reproductive hormone secretion. However, effect of sleep on IVF outcomes was not well investigated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of sleep on IVF outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study included 656 women undergoing IVF cycles between September 2011 and December 2012. Sleep duration estimations were extracted from the participants' answers to the questionnaire before starting IVF treatment. The participants were then split into three groups by sleep duration: short-time sleepers (4-6 hours), moderate-time sleepers (7-8 hours) and long-time sleepers (9-11 hours). RESULTS: The mean sleep duration was 7.4 hours. Among 656 women, 120 women slept usually 4-6 hours per day (short-time sleepers), 445 women, 7-8 hours (moderate-time sleeper), and 91 women, 9-11 hours (long-time sleepers). In each group, age, number of transferred embryos reflected no differences. Number of oocytes (10.6, 10.6, 10.7) and fertilization rate (68%, 68%, 73%) were similar among three groups. Pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the moderate-time sleepers group than in long-time sleepers group [52.6%(234/445) vs. 42.9%(39/91), P=0.045]. Pregnancy rate of the group sleeping moderately had increased tendency as compared with that of the group sleeping shortly [52.6%(234/445) vs. 45.8%(55/ 120), P=0.090]. CONCLUSION: Getting enough sleep has beneficial effect on reproductive hormone secretion. It might be helpful to fertility and IVF outcomes. However, excessive sleep disturbs circadian rhythms and hormone cycles. Probably by this reason, IVF outcomes could be impaired in our study. Therefore, moderate sleep about 7-8 hours is recommended to the patients undergoing IVF cycles for improving IVF outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The area of sleep disorders and infertility is essentially unexplored. However, previous research has established a link between polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of anovulation and infertility, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The present study aims to assess the relationship between sleep patterns and clinical outcomes with in vitro fertilization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women >21 years old who were seen for infertility visits at our institution between 2009 and 2011 were identified. Patients were contacted by email to complete an online questionnaire assessing demographics, sleep patterns, and fertility treatments. Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients for scores on standardized sleep measures and IVF variables were generated for ordinal and ratio data, respectively. RESULTS: 79 patients completing 131 fresh and 90 frozen IVF cycles participated in the online survey. Most patients were Caucasian (94%). Median age and BMI were 36 [32,40] and 23.49 [22, 27, respectively]. 12 respondents (15%) indicated their diagnosis as anovulation or PCOS. Relevant findings are noted in Table 1. There is a positive association between daytime sleepiness and more retrieved oocytes and clinical pregnancies which persisted when first cycles were independently analyzed. (Table Presented) CONCLUSION: PCOS and its associated comorbidities such as obstructive sleep apnea may underlie both disordered sleep and the finding of better response to ovarian stimulation described in this study. Further research should be undertaken to assess the relationship between dysfunctional sleep parameters and infertility.

N2  - Introduction: Positive affect (PA) is correlated to several positive outcomes and might be a constituent of happiness (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Objectives: To investigate the correlates of PA in pregnancy and postpartum. Methods: 397 pregnant women (T0) were also followed at 3 months postpartum (T1). At both time-points, they completed a questionnaire, the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and were also interviewed with some sections of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic studies (DIGS). Descriptive and correlation analyses were performed. Results: T0/T1 PA scores were correlated (p< .01). T0 PA was associated with fewer children, and T1 PA with a concurrent better self-reported health (p< .05). PA at T0/T1 was associated with nulliparity (p< .05/p< .01), mother's age (younger) (p< .05/p< .01). PA at T0/T1 was associated with lower levels of perceived life stress (p< .01); better life quality (p< .01); more social support (p< .01); lower levels of anxiety trait, depressive/anxious emotional states (p< .01), depressive symptoms (p< .01), and suicide ideation (p< .01); less self-reported maternal sleep difficulties and lower interference of it on their mood and working functioning. Moreover, PA assessed at pregnancy was associated with these variables at postpartum. PA at T1 was associated with a better perception of the infant as having less feeding/sleeping/and behavior problems. Conclusions: PA is a protective emotional trait, a good indicator of physical/mental health, and well-being in perinatal period. Mother's PA influences her perception of the infant temperament and may contribute positively to the dyadic interaction.

N2  - Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. As the placenta plays a central role in mediating many of these outcomes, we hypothesized that markers of feto-placental wellbeing are altered in women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes. Controls were identified from a sample of women screened for symptoms of SDB by using questions from the multivariable apnea prediction index. Women who scored zero (never) on snoring, gasping and apneas were selected as controls. Women with available feto-placental screening markers (estriol (uE3) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)) were then selected. Standard statistical analyses were used. Results: Twenty six OSA cases and 165 controls were identified. Median age and body mass index (BMI) were 27.0 and 28.5, p=0.5, and 37.7 and 22.9, p<0.0001 in cases and controls, respectively. Marker values were adjusted for gestational age and race and reported as multiples of median. Median uE3 was significantly lower in OSA cases compared to controls, even after adjusting for confounders such as BMI, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes (0.85 +0.31 vs. 1.06 +0.35, p=0.03). Median AFP was lower in cases than controls (0.84 + 0.35 vs. 1.02 + 4.16, p=0.04) but were no longer significant after adjusting for confounders. In OSA group with polysomnograms, AFP and uE3 negatively correlated with nadir oxygen saturation and the apnea hypopnea index, respectively. Conclusion: OSA is associated with alterations in markers of feto-placental wellbeing. Prospective studies need to elucidate this association further.

N2  - Background and aims: Sleep apnoea is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is unknown whether or not diabetic patients share the same sleep breathing pattern than non-diabetic patients. Materials and methods: Case-control study between 119 T2DM patients and 238 non-diabetic subjects closely matched by age, gender, BMI, waist and neck circumferences, and smoking status. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examination included a respiratory polysomnography, oxygen saturation measures as the cumulative percentage of time spent with oxygen saturations below 90% (CT90), and the degree of sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Studies with less than 5 hours of correct signal recording were ruled out. An apnoea was defined as cessation of airflow with duration of at least 10 seconds, and differentiation between obstructive and central apnoeas was made. The apnoeahypopnea index (AHI) was defined as the sum of apnoeas plus hypopneas divided by time in bed. Results: A higher AIH was observed in T2DM patients (34.0±3.4 vs. 26.0±2.8 events/hour; p=0.017). When sleep events were evaluated separately, a similar incidence of hypopnea events was present in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (18.3±1.1 vs. 16.7±3.9 e/h; p=0.951). However, in T2DM patients, a significantly increase in the number of apnoea events (15.2±8.2 vs. 10.3±3.2 e/h; p=0.048) and in the CT90 (18.0±33.5 vs. 10.7±10.4 %; p=0.042) were detected. No differences between obstructive and central apneas were observed. In addition, diabetic patients also showed higher daily sleepiness (7.5±3.6 vs 6.0±3.2, p=0.012) than non-diabetic subjects. Conclusion: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for higher rates of sleep apnoeas, as well as severe nocturnal hypoxemia and daily sleepiness.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common in the pregnant population. Progesterone stimulates the ventilatory drive and enhances the responsiveness of the upper airway dilator muscles during sleep, theoretically protecting against SDB. On the other hand, by increasing the negative inspiratory pressure, progesterone may cause collapse of the edematous upper airway in this population. We hypothesized that pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have altered levels of progesterone. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing second trimester progesterone between pregnant OSA cases (n=22) and pregnant controls at low risk for OSA (n=66). Cases were identified using an ICD-9 code; Controls were identified from a convenience sample screened for symptoms of SDB at delivery. Levels of progesterone and HCG were determined using the automated Immulite 2000 immunoassay. Results: Mean age was similar in cases and controls (28.6 + 6.2 vs. 27.3 + 6.4, p=0.4). Mean body mass index (BMI) was 41.8 +8.3 in cases vs. 30.5 + 5.0 in controls, p<0.0001. There was a significant negative correlation between BMI and progesterone (r=-0.2, p=0.03). Mean progesterone levels were adjusted for BMI and gestational age (multiples of medians) and were lower in cases compared to controls (1.0 +/- .17 vs. 1.01 +/- 0.15, p=0.02) even after adjusting for preeclampsia. Conclusion: Progesterone levels are lower in OSA cases compared to low risk controls, even after adjusting for confounders. Progesterone likely plays a protective role against the development of SDB. Conditions such as obesity may possibly predispose to SDB through lower levels of progesterone.

N2  - Introduction: MASA syndrome, also called CRASH syndrome and Gareis-Mason syndrome, is a rare X-linked recessive neurological disorder.The acronym “MASA” describes four major symptoms - mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs. A more suitable name for this syndrome is “L1 syndrome”. The disorder has been associated with mutations in the L1CAM gene. This syndrome has severe symptoms in males, while females are carriers because only one X-chromosome is affected. The aim of this report is to show similarities and differences between clinical manifestations in twins with the L1CAM gene mutation. Our patients: Born prematurely at 35 weeks gestation. Pregnancy was complicated with early bleeding and gestational diabetes. Immediately after birth hypertonus of the lower extremities in both twins was observed. Sixteen-year clinical follow-up showed spastic paraparetic form with shuffling gait, clumsiness, delayed speech development, with lower intellectual functioning at the level of light to moderate mental retardation, primary nocturnal enuresis, behavioral and sleep disorder (more pronounced in the second twin). Brain MRI in both twins showed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, complete lack of the anterior commissure, and internal hydrocephalus. EEGs showed nonspecific slower dysrhythmic changes. Kidney ultrasounds showed mild dilatation in the channel system of both kidneys in both twins. Ophthalmologic examinations was normal. Molecular genetic testing (Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz) identified homozygous intron 26 L1CAM gene mutation IVS26-12G→A in both twins. The mother is a carrier of the same heterozygous mutations. Conclusion: Our patients, the twins show similar clinical changes typical of MASA syndrome. After identifying the specific geneticmutations this family has become informative for prenatal diagnosis.

N2  - Introduction: China is a country with huge population infected by Hepatitis B. Mother-to-child transmission is one of the main route of transmission of HBV. TLR-2 is an important pattern recognition receptor of the body's immune defenses and distributed among immune cells and nonimmune cells. Its combination with pattern recognition receptors stimulate the release of inflammatory factor and start specific immune response. TLR-2 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of disease triggered by virus infection. The expression of TLR-2 induced by virus infection is closely related to the occurrence of disease. The activation of TLR-2 can initiate the body immune response to relevant virus and is possibly involved with pathogenic effect and its escape from the immune surveillance of the host. Holmlund found the place of TLR-2 in the placenta of mature pregnant women for the first time. The study shows that TLR-2 has strong expression in trophoblast cells and decidual cells as well as in nap mesenchymal cells. However, there are few reports about the express of TLR-2 in HBsAg placenta and its relation with HBV intrauterine infection. This paper studies on the distribution of TLR-2 in HBsAg positive placenta tissue and its function in HBV intrauterine infection, thus providing scientific reference for prevention of HBV intrauterine infection. Objective: to study the function of TLR-2 in HBV intrauterine infection and using immune histochemical method, to find the expression, distribution of TLR-2 in placenta tissue among healthy pregnant women and HBsAg positive women and the relation between TLR-2 and HBV (Intrauterine infection); to explore the function of TLR-2 infighting againstHBVinfection inplacenta cells. Method: to examine the distribution of TLR-2 in placenta tissue in healthy pregnant women and HBsAg positive women by immune histochemical method; to test the amount of HBV-DNA of the new born by fluorescence quantitative PCR. Result: Result of HBV markers in serum:clinical test and examination of this experiment indicate the HBsAg and HBeAg of peripheral blood of 30 cases were positive; 9 cases of HBsAg of the peripheral blood of the newborn were positive or HBV-DNA>500copies /ml, that is 9 newborn experienced Intrauterine infection and Intrauterine infection rate was 30.00%(9/30). TLR-2 in placenta tissue of 13 normal pregnant women were tested by immune histochemical method. The result showed 5 cases were positive and the rate was 38.46%;TLR-2 in placenta tissue of 17 cases with HBsAg positive but no newborn HBV intrauterine infection are tested,7 cases are positive with a positive rate of 41.18%;TLR-2 in placenta tissue of 13 cases with HBsAg positive and new born HBV intrauterine infection are tested, 9 cases are positive with a positive rate of 69.23%; TLR-2 in placenta tissue show claybank positive signal, cells of all type are focal in the tested placenta, mainly in trophoblast cells and embryolemma, mainly distribute in cell membrane and cytoplasm, rarely seen in nucleus. Conclusion: TLR-2 is mainly expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm of placenta cells. It is expressed both in the mature placenta of HBsAg positive pregnant women and normal pregnant women, there is no difference of expressions between placenta tissue with HBsAg positive and newborn infected by HBV and those with ones non-infected by HBV;the expression in placenta with HBV intrauterine infection is obviously high and has differences with the test group with no intrauterine infection. The expression of TLR-2 in placenta tissue is related to HBV intrauterine infection,the expression of TLR-2 in placenta barrier is related to HBV intrauterine infection but its occurrence mechanism needs to be further studied.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine impact of daylight savings time (DST) on clinical outcomes of IVF. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing autologous IVF cycles prior to/during spring or fall DST 2010-2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study groups were IVF patients for whom spring/fall DST fell between cycle day 1 and hCG trigger. Control groups included patients with egg retrieval dates 3 weeks prior to DST. Primary outcome was pregnancy; secondary outcomes were biochemical pregnancy/spontaneous abortion (biochem/SAB), and implantation. Secondary analysis restricted analysis by age (≤40, >40). Bivariate analysis utilized Pearson chi square. A sample size of 128 per arm is needed to detect 0.5 difference in means at 80% power and 2-sided 0.05 significance level. RESULTS: There was no difference in pregnancy or implantation rates for DST vs controls in fall or spring. There was, however, a higher rate of biochem/SAB rates in spring DST vs controls (12.3% vs 7.8%) approaching significance (p=0.10). Secondary analysis showed a significant difference (14.1% vs 7.7%) at p=0.05 when the analysis was restricted to patients ≤40. CONCLUSION: Current literature does not document direct association between DST & fertility, but seasonal variation in pregnancy rates suggests changes in circadian rhythm play a role. Our results show no difference in pregnancy/implantation rates in IVF patients during DST, but do suggest an increased biochem/SAB rate during spring DST in women ≤40. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects more than 12 million individuals annually. Power and control are central concepts underlying abusive relationships. Physicians may see IPV victims, perpetrators, and their children for annual examinations, as well as for injuries and health conditions associated with abuse. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women of childbearing age (ie, 14 to 46 years) be screened for IPV. Brief, validated screening tools, such as the 4-item Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream (HITS), can be used to facilitate screening. Physicians should always assess patients whose medical histories or presenting symptoms or injuries are consistent with abuse. Risk factors for IPV and consequences of abuse include general health conditions (eg, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome), reproductive issues (eg, gynecologic disorders, unintended pregnancies), psychological conditions (eg, depression, sleep disturbances), and risky health behaviors (eg, substance use, poor health care adherence). Tools for identifying perpetrators are under investigation. To prepare the practice to address IPV, physicians should educate themselves and staff and learn about community and national resources. By identifying and responding to IPV, clinicians may be able to reduce IPV and interrupt the intergenerational cycle of violence.

N2  - Introduction: In comparison with postnatal depressive symptoms, few studies considered antenatal depressive symptoms risk factors/correlates. Objectives/aims: In a multidimensional work our aim was to explore the associations/predictive role of lifetime and current pregnancy variables for antenatal depressive symptoms. Methods: Two hundred and thirty six women (M = 30.5; SD =4.02; variation = 19-41), at the third pregnancy trimester were interviewed with the DIGS/OPCRIT (to make lifetime/current depression diagnoses) and answered a booklet about sociodemographic variables, lifetime/current insomnia, current stress perception, perception of being an anxious person, gynecological variables, past health perception and pregnancy health problems, among others. They filled in the Profile of Mood States to assess anxious symptoms, Negative and Positive affect and the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) to assess antenatal depressive symptoms at pregnancy. Women with a depression diagnosis (DSM-IV/ICD-10, n =5) and on sleep medication at pregnancy were excluded from the analyses. Results: We found significant associations between antenatal depressive symptoms (PDSS total score), current job situation, perception of being an anxious person, lifetime history of depression (DSM-IV/ICD-10), past health perception, health problems at current pregnancy, stress perception at pregnancy, lifetime and current insomnia, anxious symptoms at pregnancy, Negative and Positive affect. In an hierarquical multiple regression past health perception, negative affect, positive affect and current insomnia were significant predictors of antenatal depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Past health perception, negative affect (anxious and depressive symptoms) and insomnia at current pregnancy seem to be risk factors/correlates for the outcome. Positive affect seems to work as a protective correlate.

N2  - Background: We aimed at assessing possible gender differences in personal and environmental characteristics of an asthmatic children outpatient population. Method: We reviewed personal histories of asthmatic children who underwent medical visits at our outpatient clinic from September 2011. Medical history was taken in a standardised way and data fed into personal computer. Out of 250 asthma patients, so far data on 66 were fed into the computer and analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 19 release. Results: 38 (57.6%) males and 28 (42.4%) females were analyzed, aged 9.7 ± 3.2 in males and 8.9 ± 2.8 years in females. Gestational age was 39.04 ± 1.76 in males and 38.11 ± 2.70 weeks in females (P < .09); birthweight was 3354 ± 503.35 in males and 3045 ± 780.07 g in females (P < 0.05). Exposure to maternal smoke in pregnancy was 21.1% in males and 3.6% in females (P < 0.04); Exposure to current maternal smoke was 28.9% in males and 7.1% in females (P < 0.03); Exposure to third-hand smoke was 42.1% in males and 25% in females (P < 0.15); Conjunctivitis was reported by 34.2% in males and 39.3% in females (P < 0.06); Sleep Disorders was reported by 47.4% in males and 25% in females (P < 0.01); Food Allergy was reported by 42.1% in males and 10.7% in females (P < 0.04); Gastroesophageal reflux was reported by 21.1% in males and 7.14% in females (P < 0.12). Conclusion: By these preliminary analyses, pre-adolescent male children show higher exposure to passive smoking and higher frequencies of comorbidities than females. Multivariate analyses to assess the relative risks will be performed on the whole population.

N2  - In March 2011, the Acromegaly Consensus Group met to revise and update the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acromegaly complications. The meeting was sponsored by the Pituitary Society and the European Neuroendocrinology Association and included experts skilled in the management of acromegaly. Complications considered included cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic, sleep apnea, bone diseases, and mortality. Outcomes in selected, related clinical conditions were also considered, and included pregnancy, familial acromegaly and invasive macroadenomas. The need for a new disease staging model was considered, and design of such a tool was proposed. © 2012 The Author(s).

N2  - According to literature, female asthmatic patients show more severe asthma with lower level of lung function. Aim of our study is to assess gender differences in host and environmental characteristics and in asthma severity level among patients followed within the IBIM Pulmonary and Allergy Pediatric Clinic. A series of asthmatic patients (September 2011 - May 2013) were investigated through standardized questionnaire and spirometry. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS release 19. Preliminary results refer to 154 patients: 94 males (M) (61.03%) and 60 females (F) (38.97%); age (years): 8.95 ± 2.8 M vs 8.88 ± 2.7 F; maternal history of asthma: 25.5% M vs 16.7% F (p<0.053); exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy:14.9% M vs 5% F (p<0.06); exposure to pets - in the first life year 16% M vs 6.7% F (p<0.09), - current: 29.8% M vs 10% F (p<0.004); BMI (Kg/m2):19.90 ± 4.96 M vs 18.15 ± 3.62 F (p<0.020); being overweight: 52.1% M vs 31.7% F (p<0.012); asthma severity level: intermittent, 58.5% M vs 43.3% F (p<0.067); severe, 5.3% M vs 15% F (p<0.042); FEV1 (%Pred) 95.22 ± 15.42 M vs 89.99 ± 17.96 F (p<0.062); FVC (%Pred) 99.38 ± 16.53 M vs 93.65 ± 16.13 F (p<0.040); impact on quality of life (PAQLQ): 5.30 ± 1.05 M vs 5.67 ± 0.86 F (p<0.095); alteration of sleep quality: 2.12 ± 2.26 M vs 1.22 ± 1.35 F (p<0.044). In conclusion, we have confirmed in a consecutive series of patients that there are gender differences in asthma characteristics in children. Further analyses on a larger series of pediatric patients are needed in order to assess the impact of gender differences on asthma management.

N2  - Background: SSADH deficiency is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder ofGABAmetabolism. The early diagnosis is challenging due to the rather variable and non-specific phenotype of nonprogressive neurological dysfunction, including a variety of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Clinical case: Infant of 7 months of age at diagnosis, born from a nonconsanguinuos couple. Uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Initial clinical features were global developmental delay, stereotypes, sleep disorders, and fluctuant awareness, social interaction and non-paretic hypotonia with hyporreflexia. Characteristic organic acids pattern. Molecular analysis of SSADH gene identified an homocygous 1226 G>A missense mutation. MRI at 4 years old showed an increased T2- weighted signal of globus pallidi, not observed in the previous study done at 8 months of age. In 8 years of follow-up, he developed a non-progressive severe autistic disorder with a global developmental delay, without seizures or other neuropsychiatric features, with severe constipation and urine retention due to bladder-sphincter dysinergia, autonomic symptoms not previously reported. Vigabatrin was administered without clinical effect. Conclusions: We report an early diagnosis of a SSADH patient with a longitudinal follow-up of 8 years that contributes, among other things, to widening the phenotype with the possible autonomic symptoms and highlighting that initial MRI can be non-typical.

N2  - Objectives: MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome is an emerging neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe psychomotor retardation, autistic features, epilepsy and abnormal movements, reported in only 43 patients by now (1). We describe the case of a 3.5 years child carrying a novel microdeletion in 5q14.3 region, encompassing part of MEF2C gene. Methods: Array-CGH analysis was performed using the Agilent array 180K and data analysis by Agilent Cytogenomics 2.5.8.1. Results: Our proband was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy to healthy unrelated parents with an unremarkable family history. At birth, head circumference was small (25° perc.), compared to weight and length (50° perc.). The neonatal period was normal. He underwent regular controls for convergent strabismus since 6 months (ms) of age. Motor milestones were slightly delayed (head control acquired at 5 ms, sitting position at 10, ambulation at 27 ms). Griffiths scale at 37 ms revealed severe intellectual impairment (GQ 26, MA 9.5 ms). He presented two episodes of febrile convulsions at 18 and 22 ms. EEG showed only irregular organization of activity during sleep. Brain MRI at 24 ms was normal. Last examination at 3.5 years showed diffuse hypotonia and hyporeflexia, cingular muscles weakness and unsteady gate. No evidence of dysmetria. Speech was absent and chewing impaired. Impersistent eye contact and stereotypic repetitive movements were present. The patient had a deletion of 88kb [arr 5q14.3 (88119525- 88193351x1) dn] within MEF2C gene, resulting to be the second shortest deletion reported so far [1]. Conclusions: Our case supports the hypothesis that patients with smaller deletions in the 5q14.3 region involving MEF2C gene may show a milder motor phenotype with possible ambulation (although wide-based and unstable, in the absence of any objective cerebellar signs), and a lower risk of presenting refractory and intractable seizures [2].

N2  - Vitamin B12 is the collective term for a group of chemical substances known as cobalamin. It has an important role as cofactor in homocysteine (Hcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA) and folate metabolism. Vitamin B12 is essential for cell division and tissue repair, the formation of red blood cells, synthesis mediators and myelin in central nervous system. The most frequent cause of cobalamin deficiency in infants is poor nutrition. There are no specific symptoms for cobalamin deficiency. In the first year of life neurological manifestations are more frequent. Metabolic errors Hcy and MMA are strongly correlated to serum cobalamin, whereas the relation to serum folate is weak or absent. Objectives: To evaluate the main reason, neurological characteristics and laboratory abnormalities of infants with vitamin B12 deficiency. Material and methods: Cases of infants with B12 vitamin deficiency who had been hospitalized in the department of newborns and infants of Tallinn Children's Hospital during the 2012 were analysed. Results: All 56 infants who had been diagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency were breastfed. The average age at diagnosis was 5 months. The most frequent clinical symptoms were: irritability and disturbance of sleep occured in 30 cases (53.6%); abnormal movements such as tremor, twitches etc in 17 cases (30%); developmental delay in14 cases (25%). All patients had considerable decrease cobalamin level in serum accompanied by errors Hcy in 20 and MMA in 27 cases. The neurological manifestations and metabolic errors withdrew after vitamin B12 supplementation. Conclusions: Nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency among infants is an important health issue. Frequent manifestations are different neurological symptoms with metabolic errors. Timely diagnosis and treatment are presumptions to avoid irreversible damage of the nervous system.Nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency in infants can be avoided by mothers' adequate nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

N2  - Introduction: The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL; CLN) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material. It is often a long search before the diagnosis can be made. Case report: We describe the case history of a monozygote female twins, normal at birth and with progressive microcephaly, psychomotor regression and absent of social contact from the age of 10 months. Both parents were consanguinous and had already a 2-year old daughter developed normally. The pregnancy and perinatal period of both girls was without any problems and also during the first months the development was normal. At the age of 12 months they showed loss of social contact and remarkable stereotypical hand movements. On clinical examination there was a declining head circumference which lead to the start of an extensive genetic search for Rett syndrome. We found a missense mutation in MECP2gen, not known in the international Rett database. The mutation was absent in the father, present in the mother, but maternal X-inactivity showed 95% skewing, supporting the hypothesis that it was a pathogenic mutation. Further genetic search in the maternal family was negative. At the age of 2 both girl could barely sit, there was a restlessness in arms en leggs, hyperreflexia and evolution to spasticity combined with total loss of visual contact. The girls were very irritable and sleep was disrupted. On further examination, skin biopsy was abnormal with intracellular accumulation of lipopigment storage material. The pattern was described as granular osmiophilic deposits, pathog nomonic for NCL 1. Discussion: NCL 1 must be included in the differential diagnosis of children with Rett-like symptoms.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a facilitated, small group weight loss program in a fertility clinic. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Food For Fertility seven-week program at Seattle Reproductive Medicine provides facilitated, evidence-based education on an anti-inflammatory, low-glycemic diet for patients with a BMI of 27 or greater. The course also promotes weight loss through healthy nutrition, increased physical activity, and mindful/ intuitive eating. The dietitian- facilitated small group setting provides strong peer support. Pre- and post-evaluation tools were developed to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of Food For Fertility in affecting positive change. The pre-evaluation questionnaire takes a baseline measure of knowledge, behavior and beliefs in key lifestyle areas: diet, activity, stress, sleep and social support. The post-evaluation tool measures change in the assessment areas. Patients are weighed weekly during the program. RESULTS: Evaluation of the most recent class of 9 participants revealed a starting average BMI of 37.1, with a decrease to 35.8 (p<0. 01). Participants reported increasing physical activity, eating healthier, and feeling more confident in their ability to lose weight. Mindful eating skills, nutrition education, and accountability were noted as program benefits/take-aways(?). Participants found peer support and class fitness walks to be supportive of their success with improving their behaviors. Educational support groups have been implemented monthly based on participant interest. CONCLUSION: Specific nutrition and lifestyle small group programs such as Food for Fertility improve women's health via better eating and weight loss in preparation for fertility treatments. These same interventions set the stage for a healthier pregnancy once conception occurs. Because women who are trying to conceive may be highly motivated to make healthy diet and lifestyle changes, this is a window of opportunity in which to provide nutritional education and support.

N2  - Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is unknown. In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range in awake 6-9-month-olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic deprivation. Between-subject comparisons of infants from low- and high-income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low-income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region-selective differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in low-income families. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the role and the usefulness of a close EEG monitoring in children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), following a prenatal diagnosis. Material and methods: We present 3 patients with negative familial history, in which the routine fetal ultrasound revealed the presence of multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas. Between 30 and 32 weeks of gestation we performed a fetal MRI, which was able to detect the presence of subependymal nodules or tubers, allowing a definite prenatal diagnosis of TSC. Due to large rhabdomyomas and to the risk of cardiac symptoms, we planned delivery by cesarean section in tertiary centres with experienced neonatal cardiologists. Soon after birth, all these children began a close EEG monitoring, with awake/sleep EEG performed every 3-4 weeks. All the families have been informed of the high risk of epilepsy of TSC infants in the first year of life, and have been educated to recognize focal subtle seizures and epileptic spasms. Results: EEG monitoring allowed us to identify focal epileptiform abnormalities early and to observe their evolution towards multifocal abnormalities. In the child who developed epileptic spasms we observed a further evolution toward secondary bilateral synchronization and a tendency toward a pre-hypsarrhythmic pattern the day before the appearance of spasms. The immediate treatment with vigabatrin early reversed this EEG pattern, and we never observed again abnormalities suggestive of an epileptic encephalopathy. Conclusions: Our data suggests that epileptogenesis is a slow process, taking several weeks or months from the first EEG epileptiform abnormalities to the first seizure. The close EEG monitoring allows us to detect subtle changes in the EEG pattern which might indicate an evolution towards epilepsy. The immediate detection and treatment of seizures is crucial to minimize the possible long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae of early life seizures.

N2  - The circadian clock has been linked to female reproductive physiology and endocrine in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have shown increased rates of abnormal reproduction and adverse pregnancy. But little is known how the circadian rhythms affect reproduction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influences of circadian rhythms on estrous cycle in female mice using clock gene Rev-erb-α knock out (Rev-erb-α(-/-)) mice. To test the fertility of Rev-erb-α(-/-) mice, litter sizes were counted after mating with C57BL/6J male mice. HE staining was used to observe the change of follicle development. The number of embryos of Rev-erb-α(+/+) and Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice was compared 1.5 d after mating with C57BL/6J male mice. Then Rev-erb-α(+/+) and Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice were housed to adult, and daily vaginal lavage with 0.9% saline was used to monitor estrous cycle for at least 30 days. Quantity of various cells was counted on specified smears views after staining. We observed estrous cycles of Rev-erb-α(+/+) and Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice using line plots and periodic spectrograms. The results showed that the Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice were infertility, and the number of embryos of Rev-erb-α(-/-) females was less than that of Rev-erb-α(+/+) females. However, the follicle development of Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice was normal. The estrous cycle of Rev-erb-α(-/-) female mice was 3.22 days longer than that of Rev-erb-α(+/+) female mice. The results suggest that loss of Rev-erb-α prolongs estrous cycle, which is probably one of the reasons for female mice infertility, and circadian rhythm is important for mammalian estrous cycle.

N2  - Recent research and policy around sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) have emphasised the place of safe sleeping practices within SUDI prevention strategies. Māori SUDI prevention workers have focussed on innovations around the safe sleep environment for some time now, as they have grappled with difficult to change and disproportionately high Māori SUDI rates. The wahakura (a flax bassinet modelled on a traditional Māori infant sleeping item) was developed in 2006 aiming to mitigate some of the risks of bedsharing with vulnerable infants, in particular infants exposed to maternal smoking in pregnancy. Early wahakura projects in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay showed high acceptability, effectiveness as an infant health promotion vehicle but difficulty maintaining a low/no cost supply for vulnerable families. The Hawke's Bay project revealed two pathways forward: the need for robust research to ensure the safety of the wahakura and the exploration of financially viable and more readily available alternatives. Work on both pathways is currently in progress around the country, signalling New Zealand's ongoing contribution to SUDI prevention and its potential contribution to knowledge and practices applicable to indigenous and other marginalised communities worldwide. © NZMA.

N2  - Prolactin (PRL), also known as lactotropic hormone or Lactotropin, is a phylogenetically ancient proteohormone, which is formed by the lactotropic cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. It is responsible for the growth of the mammary gland during pregnancy, the milk secretion during lactation and for the regulation of many other endocrine functions but also metabolic effects.In its primary structure human prolactin is composed of 198 amino acids. Its structure is similar to somatotropin. The synthesis of prolactin is controlled by a gene on chromosome 6. Prolactin secretion is regulated by the hypothalamus via neurotransmitters (dopamine) with a circadian rhythm and increased prolactin levels in the second half of the night. In contrast to dopamine which controls the secretion of prolactin as inhibitor, the following hypothalamic factors are stimulating the prolactin release: TRH, VIP, angiotensin II, endogenous opioids, oxytocin. Different forms of circulating prolactin have been described: "little prolactin", "big prolactin" (macroprolactin). The importance of makroprolactines is not yet clear. Their presence can lead to an overestimation of prolactin concentration. In humans, elevated levels of prolactin lead to a suppression of oocyte maturation and ovulation.Hyperprolactinemia occurs in less than 1% of the general population and in 10-40% of patients with secondary amenorrhea. About 75% of patients with galactorrhea and amenorrhea have hyperprolactinemia. Of these patients 30% have prolactin-secreting tumors. Hyperprolactinemia can result from hypothyroidism, certain medications (eg antipsychotics), acute and chronic stress in pregnancy and fromstimulation of the nipples. The likelihood of a prolactin-producing tumor of the pituitary gland (prolactinoma) increases with the severity of hyperprolactinemia. Most prolactinomas occur between the age 20 and 40. Pituitary tumors, mostly adenomas, account for 10-15% of all intracranial tumors. Prolactinomas can be distinguished depending on the size of the MRI between micro (< 10 mm) and macroprolactinomas (> 10 mm). Depending on size, location, displacement symptoms (eg, optic chiasm), age and desire for fertility different treatment options such as medical treatment, neurosurgical and radiological treatment options are available. Drug therapy with dopamine agonists is the therapy of choice for most patients with prolactinomas, while surgery is reserved for cases withresistance to drug therapy andspecific indications. The pharmacological effects, side effects and the pharmacological profile of the dopamine agonists bromocriptine, DOPERGIN, Quinagolid and cabergoline is discussed. Cabergoline may result in long-term therapy to fibrosis and heart valve disorders, but only at high doses (> 2 mg in the context of Parkinson's disease therapy). Neurosurgical intervention is indicated as first-line therapy only for patients with infertility, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome or specific forms of macroprolactinomas. The differential diagnosis and management ofmicro-and macro-prolactinomas in patients with and without infertility are discussed. The primary goal of therapy in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas is the normalization of prolactin levels to prevent side effects of hyperprolactinemia (eg, estrogen deficiency symptoms) and tumor shrinkage in case of prolactinomas in order to avoid serious clinical side effects due to continued tumor growth. International guidelines are relevant to the Endocrine Society (USA) for the diagnosis and treatment of Hyperproaktinämie.

N2  - Background: Sleep disruption (SD), a major manifestation of sleep apnea and other sleep disorders, is characterized by recurrent awakenings at night and is a common sleep disturbance of pregnant women, particularly during the third trimester. Sleep apnea has been linked to the presence of metabolic dysfunction and has also been associated with higher risk for pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. Increasing evidence suggests that some metabolic disorders, which become manifest in adult life, may have their roots during early development. Intrauterine and early postnatal environments have a significant long-term influence on body weight and energy homeostasis and metabolic function in offspring. We hypothesized that SD during the third trimester of gestation may increase the propensity for obesity and insulin resistance in the offspring. Methods: Time-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were fed with normal chow and exposed to SD or control sleep (CS) conditions for the last 6 days of gestation. SD was performed for 12 hrs during daylight and consisted of gentle, mechanically-induced arousals at 2 min intervals using a custom developed automated device. After birth, litters were culled to 6 pups, subsequently kept with the mothers for 21 days, and then fed with normal chow (10% fat) for 17 wks. Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly throughout the remainder of the study. At 20 weeks, blood samples were collected from 3-hour fasted offspring mice for leptin and lipid profiles, and insulin tolerance (ITT) and glucose tolerance (GTT) tests were conducted. In adipose tissues, leptin and adiponectin expression levels were assessed using qRT-PCR. Results: Body weight, food intake, fasting serum leptin, insulin, triglycerides, and LDL levels were all significantly higher in offspring of mothers exposed to SD during pregnancy when compared to CS-exposed mothers. Visceral and subcutaneous adiposity were increased in the offspring of SD-exposed mothers, and evidence for insulin resistance in GTT and ITT emerged as well. Leptin expression was increased in adipose tissue of offspring of mothers exposed to SD during pregnancy, while adiponectin expression was decreased. Conclusion: Our findings support the notion that the presence of SD during late gestation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Perturbations to this environment by disrupted sleep can therefore have long-term detrimental effects to the fetus, and lead to persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

N2  - RATIONALE: Gestational diabetes (GDM) complicates 2-9% of pregnancies. Recent evidence suggests that a high rate of sleep disturbance during pregnancy (i.e. insomnia, snoring and other symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing) is associated with gestational metabolic consequences. However there is paucity of data evaluating the association between GDM and sleep disturbances using objective sleep recordings. The aim of this case-control study was to examine the association of maternal sleep disorders with the occurrence of GDM using complete polysomnography (PSG) and questionnaires. METHODS: Consecutive pregnant women (with no co-morbidity and a BMI < 35 Kg.m-2) were eligible if diagnosed with GDM by routine 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during pregnancy. During the same period, BMI-, age- and gestational age at PSG-matched controls (with normal 50g OGTT) were recruited. One night of home complete (Level II) PSG was performed between 24-32 wks' gestation. Sleepiness was assessed via Epworth score (ESS), subjective sleep quality via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (includes self-reported snoring and sleep time (RST)), and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) via standard questionnaire (Sleep Med 2003; 4:101). RESULTS: PSG was performed at 32.0± 1.2 wks' gestation in 26 cases and 26 controls. Subject characteristics, including mean pre-pregnancy BMI, were similar in the 2 groups ESS was higher in cases than controls (9.8± 3.6 vs 7.2± 3.6, p=0.01)) and 46 % of women with GDM reported RLS compared with 19% of controls (p=0.02). Total sleep time by PSG and RST did not differ between cases and controls. Objective (PSG) and subjective (PSQI) sleep quality measures were also similar in the 2 groups. Oxygen desaturation index and % TST saturation below 90% were the same in both groups. Proportions of cases and controls with snoring ≥ 3 times/wk and flow limitation as well as mean values of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and other PSG indices were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences in either objective or subjective measures of sleep duration or sleep-disordered breathing between women with and without GDM. However daytime sleepiness and a high frequency of RLS were associated with GDM. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction/Rationale: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy may be related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). Symptoms of SDB have been shown to increase in prevalence with the progression of pregnancy and when compared to pre-pregnancy. Although associations between maternal SDB and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes and low birth weight infants respectively, have been explored, the results have been conflicting. Our primary objective was to perform a systematic review of the literature, and where feasible, a meta-analysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB have a higher risk of APOs when compared to women without SDB. Methods: The Cochrane library, Pubmed, EMBASE and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched by 2 independent reviewers in June 2012 to identify studies that explored the relationship between SDB in pregnancy and APOs. We included original studies published in English or French, in which subjects were pregnant women, and OSA was defined by symptoms or the reference standard, polysomnography. Studies were excluded if there was no comparison or control group. Disagreement regarding study inclusion was resolved by consensus. For each study that met criteria, data were extracted on study design, quality and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using the Der Simonian and Laird random-effects model to account for the between-study variation. Pooled estimates for crude odds ratios were obtained using the Mantel-Haenszel method, and the inverse variance method was used for pooling adjusted odds ratios. Results: Of the 4386 studies identified from electronic databases, 31 met the defined criteria. All of these studies were observational except for 2 involving intervention with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. The three main APOs evaluated in the studies were gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and delivery of low birth weight infants. Of the studies that reported dichotomous outcomes, SDB during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk for each of the 3 APOs in unadjusted analyses (Table 1) and in adjusted analyses for gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes (Figures 1 & 2). Conclusion: Based on published studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. Small sample sizes, a lack of objective sleep recordings to diagnose SDB, and few studies that adjusted for confounders are major limitations to this literature. Large-scale, prospective cohort and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between SDB and APOs.

N2  - Background: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP) and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria outlined by the GRADE Working Group. Main results: We included 26 randomised trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal care. For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow. For pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture. For lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight- to 20-week exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16-to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N = 257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N = 1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at 26-rather than 20-weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture. When reported, adverse events were minor and transient. Authors' conclusions: Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16-to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP. There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out. Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26-rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small. There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture. Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.

N2  - Introduction/Rationale: Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy, in particular snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness, are common and increase compared to pre-pregnancy. It has been hypothesized that the hypoxia-reoxygenation, sleep fragmentation and cardiovascular changes associated with OSA may adversely affect placental function, and in turn, fetal growth and outcomes. Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are at high risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality and adverse long-term health consequences. Although observational studies have suggested an association between symptoms of maternal OSA and SGA, there is a paucity of studies assessing this interaction via objective sleep recordings to accurately identify OSA. Our primary study objective was to determine if the prevalence of OSA using full night polysomnography (PSG) is higher among women with a SGA infant than those with an appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infant. Methods: As part of an ongoing prospective multi-center cohort study investigating maternofetal outcomes in pregnancy (Core Pregnancy Cohort of the Integrated Research Network in Perinatology of Quebec and Eastern Ontario (IRNPQEO)), we are currently recruiting pregnant subjects for assessment of OSA by a complete at-home PSG in the 3rd trimester. We performed a preliminary case-control analysis in which women having delivered infants with birth weight < 10th percentile (Kramer) for gestational age (“SGA cases”) were compared to randomly selected women with infant birth weights > 10th percentile (“AGA controls”). The exposure of interest was OSA as defined by an apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15 events per hour on the PSG based on Chicago scoring criteria. Results: To date, we have analyzed data from 12 SGA cases and 12 AGA controls. SGA and AGA subjects did not differ with respect to baseline demographic characteristics (Table 1). The mean birth weight in the SGA group was significantly lower than in the AGA group at similar gestational age. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in third trimester maternal sleep characteristics including AHI. OSA was identified in 2 SGA cases and 3 Controls. A simple linear regression analysis using AHI and birth weights as continuous variables did not yield a significant relationship. Conclusion: In this preliminary analysis, no relationship between OSA and risk of an SGA infant was identified. These findings are limited, however, by the small sample size to date.

N2  - Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISI≥10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS≥9 and 9% with EPDS<9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS≥9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS<9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Disruption of sleep causes adverse health outcomes and poor quality of life. People with sleep disruption have higher levels than people without disrupted sleep of depression and anxiety and increased rates of cardiovascular diseases. Women have a higher incidence than men of insomnia and depression related to poor sleep. The types of complaints differ significantly between the sexes. Women are more likely than men to complain of insomnia, headache, irritability, and fatigue than the "typical" symptoms of loud snoring and breathing cessation during sleep. Hormones play an important role in sleep in women. Reproductive hormones were found to have a protective effect on sleep apnea in women of premenopausal age. Pregnancy is another period when the prevalence of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome increases from hormonal effect. Cardiovascular mortality is high in women with obstructive sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy improves outcomes in most cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and therapies for the three most common sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome), along with effects of menopause, pregnancy, and social factors on sleep in women, are key considerations for clinicians caring for female patients across the adult life span.

N2  - INTRODUCTION Mandibular advancement devices (MAD) are employed in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) as an alternative in patients with mild or moderate OSAS or even in severe patients who do not tolerate the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or refuse surgery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Orthoapnea MAD in the treatment of OSAS in adults. methods Patients diagnosed with mild or moderate OSAS by respiratory polygraphy were included. Those with serious comorbidity, severe obesity, anatomic problems that prevent MAD placing, high gag reflex, and pregnant women were excluded. A basal polygraphy was performed and repeated after four weeks of treatment. During the treatment, two 3D i-CAT scans were performed with and without MAD to measure airway area and volume. The following variables were registered: sex, age, total apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) - in supine and non supine position -, total amount of apnoeas, amount of obstructive apnoeas and hypopnoeas, desaturation per hour index and percentage of time during which the saturation was under 90% (CT90). The treatment was considered effective when an AHI lower than 5 or a significant reduction was reached. The results were analyzed by Student's T-test for paired data, nonparametric Wilcoxon test and McNemar test. 103 patients were included in the research: 84 men (81.6%) and 19 women (18.4%); average age of 46.47± 9.71; body mass index average of 27.36 ± 2.45 kg/m2. Results The airway area patency and volume increased after the treatment (area from 256 to 308 mm2; volume from 4533 to 6356 mm3). When comparing the respiratory parameters before and after the treatment statistically significant decreases (p<0.05) were obtained in average AHI (from 14.7 to 5), both in supine (from 25.2 to 6.9) and non supine position (from 7.7 to 3.7); average of total apnoeas (from 97.9 to 31.3); average of obstructive apnoeas (from 32 to 10.7); average of hypopnoeas (from 64.5 to 21.7); desaturation per hour index average (from 12.4 to 4.8); average CT90 (from 2.4 to 0.7). In 72.80% of the cases the AHI was halved. In 90.30%, an AHI under 10 was reached and, in 61.2%, under 5. Conclusions The use of Orthoapnea MAD proves to be an efficient therapeutic alternative, increasing airway area patency and volume, thus reducing the AHI on patients with mild and moderate OSAS, and improving some of its pathophysiologic consequences.(Table Presented).

N2  - Background and Objectives: Abuse associated with pregnancy is a major public health concern. Victims experience several physical and mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, headaches, sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. International migrant women may be at particular risk of suffering from these conditions. The aim of this study was to describe the profile of international migrant women who have experienced abuse associated with pregnancy and their responses in the early months post-birth. Methodology: Line-by-line thematic analyses were performed of textual data extracted from the records of international migrant women living in Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver who had participated in a study examining their health and care around the time of birth and reported having been abused. Recurring topics, words, phrases, feelings, and activities related to abuse were identified, coded, and interpreted. Results: Of the 1025 migrant women participating in the original study, 59 (5.8 %) reported having been abused. Nearly 50 % had not completed high school and had a low household income. The majority were not living with partners, were asylum-seekers from Africa or Latin America and had been in Canada<2 years. Nearly 50 % were at risk of postpartum depression and were experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression; 25 % showed symptoms of PTSD. The abuser was identified as the partner by more than 50 %. Responses to abuse included: geographical separation; emotional/psychological responses; isolation; silence; lifestyle changes; reporting; and legal processes. Conclusions: Migrant women who have experienced abuse associated with pregnancy have a high psycho-social risk profile and demonstrate a range of responses to the abuse.

N2  - Introduction: Maternal supplementation of folic acid during pregnancy may play a role in the development of wheezing and asthma among offspring, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms1, 2. To date no study has investigated antenatal folate levels and its association with offspring lung function. We hypothesized that higher maternal red blood cell (RBC) folate levels measured at 28-32 weeks of pregnancy would be associated with a higher (worse) lung clearance index (LCI) measured in the first months of postnatal life. Methods: Setting: The Barwon Infant Study population-based birth cohort with an unselected sampling frame and antenatal recruitment. Maternal RBC folate levels at 28-32 weeks of pregnancy were determined using a Dxl 800 random access immunoassay analyser (Beckman Coulter, Calif, USA). Ventilation inhomogeneity was measured in infants between 4 to 12 weeks of postnatal age during natural sleep using an ultrasonic flowmeter (EcoMedics, Duernten, Switzerland) and sulfur-hexafluoride (SF6) as a tracer gas, according to recent guidelines . 3 The LCI was calculated as the cumulative expired gas volume required to lower the end-tidal tracer gas concentration to 1/40th of the starting concentration, divided by the functional residual capacity (FRC). Data were analysed by multiple linear regression restricted to infants of non-smoking mothers. Results: Among 106 infants with acceptable and reproducible MBW measurements, 50 (56%) were female, median age at MBW testing was 6.3 weeks (range 3.4 to 13.1 weeks), the mean RBC folate level was 1.631 μmol/L (range 1.032 to 3.000 μmol/L), and the mean LCI was 6.78 units (standard deviation = 0.46). There was no evidence that RBC folate levels were associated with LCI (β = -0.05; p=0.690, 95%CI -0.3, 0.2); FRC (p=0.855); or cumulative expired volume (p= 0.923). These results were not significantly altered by adjustment for gender, length of gestation, postnatal age, height or weight. Conclusions: There was no evidence that maternal folate levels at the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy were associated with differences in ventilation inhomogeneity in their offspring.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Many early life risk factors for childhood obesity are more prevalent among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and may explain the higher prevalence of obesity among racial/ethnic minority children. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in adiposity and overweight are explained by differences in risk factors during pregnancy (gestational diabetes and depression), infancy (rapid infant weight gain, feeding other than exclusive breastfeeding, and early introduction of solid foods), and early childhood (sleeping <12 h/d, presence of a television set in the room where the child sleeps, and any intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or fast food). DESIGN Prospective prebirth cohort study. SETTING Multisite group practice in Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1116 mother-child pairs (63%white, 17%black, and 4% Hispanic) EXPOSURE Mother's report of child's race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z score, total fat mass index from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and overweight or obesity, defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher at age 7 years. RESULTS Black (0.48 U [95%CI, 0.31 to 0.64]) and Hispanic (0.43 [0.12 to 0.74]) children had higher BMI z scores, as well as higher total fat mass index and overweight/obesity prevalence, than white children. After adjustment for socioeconomic confounders and parental BMI, differences in BMI z score were attenuated for black and Hispanic children (0.22 U [0.05 to 0.40] and 0.22 U [-0.08 to 0.52], respectively). Adjustment for pregnancy risk factors did not substantially change these estimates. However, after further adjustment for infancy and childhood risk factors, we observed only minimal differences in BMI z scores between whites, blacks (0.07 U [-0.11 to 0.26]), and Hispanics (0.04 U [-0.27 to 0.35]).We observed similar attenuation of racial/ethnic differences in adiposity and prevalence of overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood adiposity and obesity are determined by factors operating in infancy and early childhood. Efforts to reduce obesity disparities should focus on preventing early life risk factors.

N2  - Objective: Most physiologic processes exhibit day/night rhythms driven by the circadian clockwork, including kidney functions such as water and electrolyte homeostasis. Circadian expression of numerous genes critical for these functions (e.g. αENaC, SGK1 and NHE3) has been demonstrated. The central molecular clockwork appears to develop gradually during early postnatal life. We sought to describe the development of the circadian gene expression patterns in the kidney. Methods: Pregnant SD rats and their pups were housed under 12/12h light-dark cycles and constant temperature with free access to food and water. Offspring (7/group) were sacrificed at 4 hour intervals on embryonic day 20 and 1, 4 and 12 weeks postnatally. Gene expression patterns were profiled by real-time rtPCR for the canonical clock genes, Clock, Bmal1, Rev-Erbα, Per1, Per2, Cry1 and the kidney specific clock-controlled genes α ENaC, Sgk1 and NHE3. Circadian rhythms were assessed by cosinor analysis. Results: Rev-Erbα and Per2 gene expresion exhibited significant circadian rhythms at all time points. BMAL1, Per1, Cry1 and SGK1 were expressed constantly on embryonic day 20 but developed significant circadian rhythmicity within the first postnatal week. Rhythmic expression increased in amplitude and showed a phase shift at 4 and 12 weeks. Rhythms of Clock, α ENaC, and NHE3 were observed at neonatal age, phase-shifted in the first postnatal week and were lost for αENaC and NHE3 at 12 weeks. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a complex time course of development of the canonical molecular clock genes during early postnatal life in rats. Clock-controlled tubular genes show divergent patterns of circadian rhythmicity, with amplitudes increasing in some and dampening in others. We postulate that circadian tubular functions emerge in early postnatal life from integration of internal and external cues.

N2  - Rationale: Defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA, the diagnosis of CLD fails to account for extra-thoracic processes for which oxygen is beneficial, such as abnormalities in ventilatory control. We used respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) during a room air challenge (RAC) to determine how often immature ventilatory control was linked to the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA in infants born at 28 weeks gestation and less. Methods: RIP was recorded before and during RAC from 23 consecutive infants enrolled in PROP requiring supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA. During a 15 minute run-in period, measures of SpO2%, percent of quiet sleep time in periodic breathing (%PB), and minute ventilation during quiet sleep from QDC-calibrated RIP (VE) were collected. FiO2 was then reduced in steps to room air, followed by wean from flow. RAC failure was defined as run-in period SpO2% <90%, or, during the RAC, SpO2% < 90% for five consecutive minutes, or SpO2% <80% for 15 consecutive seconds. %PB and VE during the run-in period were compared to the final minutes of RAC. Results: One infant had run-in SpO2% < 90% and RAC was not done. Of the remaining 22 subjects, six tolerated breathing room air without flow for 60 minutes. Eight of the 16 infants failing had 40% or greater increase in %PB during 3 minutes before failure as compared to the run-in period (mean increase 49.6% + 7.8%). VE declined by 23.7 + 10.1% compared to run-in for the minute before failure in all infants failing RAC. Conclusions: Half of the infants who failed had marked increase in periodic breathing during RAC. All who failed the challenge had reduced VE. These results suggest that the definition of CLD is misleading and may be overestimating lung disease prevalence by failing to consider the contribution of immature respiratory patterns and central response to hypoxemia.

N2  - Background: In the German-speaking world there are no evidencebased recommendations on the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of patients with opioid dependency. Aim: Development of a practically oriented guideline for doctors, who use buprenorphine/naloxone with patients with opioid dependency. Method: Analysis of the current data situation on the buprenorphine/naloxone treatment of patients with opioid dependency, taking into particular consideration the aspects "treatment aims", "adjustment/change to buprenorphine/naloxone", "quality of life with substitution treatment", "opioid dependence in women", "drug interactions", "overdose and consumption of other narcotic drugs" as well as "psychiatric comorbidity". Results: Buprenorphine has proved itself in the treatment of opioid dependency,the combination with naloxone reduces abuse and black market dealing.Cognitive functions, sexual functions, sleep quality,fitness to drive and quality of life are as a rule less impaired with buprenorphine/naloxone than with methadone. Interactions between buprenorphine/naloxone and other potential addictive drugs such as benzodiazepines or alcohol are less commonly observed. Also, the risk of drug interactions with antimicrobial substances and anti-depressants is lower for the majority of the examined substance classes. Relevant interactions concern drugs, which are also metabolised by CYP3A4. Basically substitution treatment with long-acting substances such as buprenorphine as mono preparation in accordance with WHO recommendations is the treatment of choice with pregnant women. However, according to Suboxone® specialist information (as at September 2011) the use of the combination buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy is not recommended. Because of its pharmacological properties ("ceiling effect" with partial |j receptor agonism), the danger of an overdose with life-threatening respiratory depression is lower with treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone than with full j opioid receptor agonists. With regard to the optimum treatment of comorbid psychiatric illnesses in opioid dependent patients undergoing substitution there is still a considerable need for clinical research, some data offers indications of benefits of buprenorphine, specifically with depressive opioid dependent patients. Conclusion: The aim of substitution treatment with patients with opioid dependency is the improvement of physical and mental health. Buprenorphine/naloxone substitution treatment represents a highly effective treatment option - with positive effects on quality of life and favourable safety profile. © ecomed Medizin, Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH, Landsberg.

N2  - Objective:The objective of this study is to determine whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with reduced fetal growth, and whether nocturnal oxygen desaturation precipitates acute fetal heart rate changes.Study Design:We performed a prospective observational study, screening 371 women in the second trimester for OSA symptoms. 41 subsequently underwent overnight sleep studies to diagnose OSA. Third trimester fetal growth was assessed using ultrasound. Fetal heart rate monitoring accompanied the sleep study. Cord blood was taken at delivery, to measure key regulators of fetal growth.Results:Of 371 women screened, 108 (29%) were high risk for OSA. 26 high risk and 15 low risk women completed the longitudinal study; 14 had confirmed OSA (cases), and 27 were controls. The median (interquartile range) respiratory disturbance index (number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas or respiratory related arousals/hour of sleep) was 7.9 (6.1-13.8) for cases and 2.2 (1.3-3.5) for controls (p<0.001). Impaired fetal growth was observed in 43% (6/14) of cases, vs 11% (3/27) of controls (RR 2.67; 1.25-5.7; p = 0.04). Using logistic regression, only OSA (OR 6; 1.2-29.7, p = 0.03) and body mass index (OR 2.52; 1.09-5.80, p = 0.03) were significantly associated with impaired fetal growth. After adjusting for body mass index on multivariate analysis, the association between OSA and impaired fetal growth was not appreciably altered (OR 5.3; 0.93-30.34, p = 0.06), although just failed to achieve statistical significance. Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations accompanied nocturnal oxygen desaturation in one fetus, subsequently found to be severely growth restricted. Fetal growth regulators showed changes in the expected direction- with IGF-1 lower, and IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 higher- in the cord blood of infants of cases vs controls, although were not significantly different.Conclusion:OSA may be associated with reduced fetal growth in late pregnancy. Further evaluation is warranted to establish whether OSA may be an important contributor to adverse perinatal outcome, including stillbirth. © 2013 Fung et al.

N2  - Objective. To evaluate if there is a relation between quality of life and quality of sleep in pregnant women. Method. This was a cross-sectional study which participants were selected at Ipiranga Hospital and applied an evaluation form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), questionnaire of quality of life (SF-36), and was given a booklet of guidelines of sleep hygiene. Inclusion criteria was pregnancy; exclusion criteria was hearing loss, sleep disturbance, prior night occupation, neurological damage and that was not doing prenatal care. Results. 51 volunteers participated in the work, of which 32 were in the third trimester and 10 in the second trimester, the average age was 25,3 (±6,3) years, and 70% of the entire sample had poor sleep quality. It was also observed that multiparous pregnant women had worsening in sleep and quality of life. Conclusion. There was no correlation between quality of sleep and quality of life in pregnant women. But it was worst in the second trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: It is widely acknowledged that sleep duration and quality change across pregnancy and that for some women this change is extreme. The current study compared the sleep of women during late pregnancy with the sleep of women in the general population to understand differences in total sleep time and associated demographic factors. Methods: Women (16-46 yrs) completed questionnaires on sleep, health and mood between 35-37 weeks gestation as part of the E Moe, Mama: Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study (n=1075). Self-reported sleep duration in 24-hrs (TST) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) were compared to data from a representative sample of 958 New Zealand women of the same age (Paine et al, 2004; Paine et al, 2005). Multivariate analyses were used to determine if TST or excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS >10 vs ESS ≤10) were related to being pregnant, age (5 yr bands), ethnicity (Maori vs non-Maori) or social deprivation (NZ Deprivation Index 1-10). Results: Being pregnant and older were associated with shorter average sleep duration (F=3.56, p=.007). Younger pregnant women (<30yrs) obtained similar amounts of sleep to those of the same age in the general population, but older pregnant women reported less sleep than younger pregnant women and, depending on the age bracket, also less sleep than those in the general population. The likelihood of excessive daytime sleepiness was greater for pregnant women (OR=1.7, 95%CI=1.3-2.3), being Maori (OR=1.4, 95%CI=1.1-1.9), and for the 10% most deprived (OR=2.0, 95%CI=1.1-3.5). TST was not related to daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: Age may be an important factor in determining sleep duration during pregnancy, although parity may play a role as well. Being pregnant, identifying as Maori or being socio-economically disadvantaged is related to an increased likelihood of excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep duration was not found to inluence daytime sleepiness suggesting that changes in sleep quality may be more important.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with fetal growth retardation (FGR), preeclampsia (PreE) and preterm birth (PTB < 37 weeks of gestation). The Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) is an instrument validated in primary care populations that identiies persons at high risk for SDB (HR-SDB). We assessed the utility of the BQ for predicting pregnancy complications. Methods: Women with normal pregnancies completed the BQ initially in the 2nd trimester with a planned repeat assessment in the 3rd trimester. The BQ comprises 3 sections: 1) snoring severity, 2) fatigue severity, and 3) either obesity (deined as BMI >30) or chronic hypertension. HR-SDB is present if at least 2 of 3 sections are scored abnormal. The primary outcome was FGR, deined as a birth weight <10th%ile for gestation. Sample size and statistical power calculations assumed 25% would be HR-SDB & 10% would have FGR: 500 women would have 90% power to detect an odds ratio of at least 2.5. Secondary outcomes included PreE, PTB, gestational diabetes (GDM) and a Composite of PreE, FGR or PTB. Results: 500 women, age 23±5 y, BMI 29±7.5, completed the initial BQ at a mean 16±4 weeks of gestation, and 476 (95%) with pregnancy outcomes were delivered at 38.8±3 weeks. HR-SDB was observed in 34% at the initial visit. Complications rates with (odds ratios and 95% conidence intervals) included: FGR-7.2% (0.59; 0.26,1.3), PreE-7.4% (1.2; 0.58,2.4), PTB-7.8% (0.71; 0.34,1.5), GDM-2.3% (2.4; 0.73,8.1) and Composite-19% (0.69; 0.42,1.1). We also repeated these analyses with 450 women who completed the 3rd trimester BQ at 30±1 weeks. Here the only signiicant relationship was with GDM (p=0.03); however, after controlling for obesity, the relationship was not signiicant. 80% of women who were HR-SDB at the initial visit and 69% at the 3rd trimester visit were obese. Conclusion: HR-SDB from an abnormal BQ was common in our population but a poor predictor of pregnancy complications previously reported to be associated with obstructive sleep apnea (based on polysomnography). Inclusion of obesity as a BQ component of HR-SDB in a young, generally obese obstetric population may explain the observed high rate and also the GDM association. Additional research may develop and validate better screening tests for use in pregnant populations.

N2  - Introduction: Abnormalities in glucose metabolism are common in pregnancy and linked to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Selfreported short sleep duration has been identiied as a modiiable determinant of hyperglycemia in pregnancy; however, no studies have conirmed this inding using objective measures of sleep time. We sought to examine the relationship between objectively-measured sleep duration via actigraphy and gestational hyperglycemia. Methods: We analyzed data from 76 mothers enrolled in Project BABIES, a longitudinal study of urban, low-income pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in mid-pregnancy (mean 21 weeks' gestation, range 18 to 25 weeks) and included 7 nights of wrist actigraphy. Hyperglycemia was assessed using results from 1-hour screening and 3-hour diagnostic oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) for gestational diabetes, abstracted from mothers' prenatal records. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The majority of participants were Black (86%), < 25 years old (74%), low-income (100% Medicaid), and overweight or obese in early pregnancy (59%). Mean nocturnal sleep duration was 6.9 ± 0.9 hours (range 4.4-8.8 hours) and mean glucose values from the 1-hour OGTT were 98.2 ± 25.6 mg/dL (range 56-200 mg/dL). Measured sleep duration inversely correlated with 1-hour OGTT values (r = -0.21, p = 0.07). The odds ratio of having 1-hour OGTT values ≥ 130 mg/dL was 0.44 (95% conidence interval: 0.20-0.98) per nightly hour of sleep. Controlling for age and body mass index did not change our results. All mothers with at least one abnormal 3-hour OGTT result slept < 7 hours per night (100%); however, there were few mothers meeting this criterion for more pronounced hyperglycemia in our sample (4%). Conclusion: In this irst study using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we conirmed an association between short sleep duration and hyperglycemia in pregnancy. Future studies should assess whether extending gestational sleep duration reduces the risk of hyperglycemia in urban mothers.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are thought to be common during pregnancy. Changes in sleep pattern, duration and quality are usually associated with the biological and physical changes that arise during pregnancy. We analyzed a large nationally representative sample collected during the 2005-2006 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare sleep disturbances in pregnant women with non-pregnant women. Methods: The variables were weighted to provide state-level estimates and descriptive statistics were calculated. Logistic regression models were used to determine the strength of the association between pregnancy and sleep disturbances, controlling for respondent characteristics. The inal sample consisted of 1692 women of childbearing age. Results: In unadjusted analyses, women who were pregnant were more likely to often have trouble getting back to sleep (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01-2.67), leg cramps sometimes (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.30-2.69), and leg cramps often (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.33-5.25). Women who were pregnant were also less likely to take sleeping pills both sometimes (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13-0.48) and often (0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.50). Once adjusted, only taking sleeping pills and leg cramps, both sometimes and often, remained statistically signiicant. Conclusion: Women who were pregnant were more likely to experience leg cramps and less likely to take sleeping pills. However, we found no association between pregnancy and having trouble falling and getting back to sleep or feeling sleep.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep is an integral contributor to health. Sleep disturbance is associated with various morbidities including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and depression. Pregnancy is a period during which there is an increase in reported sleep disruption. Evidence indicates that pregnant women with disturbed sleep may be at increased risk for adverse health outcomes. In addition to physiological determinants, sociodemographic factors also contribute to poor sleep. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quantity and quality in pregnant women. Methods: Participants were 181 pregnant women 18-45 years of age. Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity were assessed with sleep diaries and actigraphy that were completed on three separate 14-day periods. Indices of SES were self-reported educational attainment (dichotomized at </≥ college education) and household income (dichotomized at </≥ $50,000/ year). Covariates included perceived stress, depressive symptoms, race, parity, and marital status. Linear or logistic regression analyses were used to model the independent effects of SES on sleep after adjusting for covariates. Participants were further stratiied by low or high stress to examine independent and synergistic effects of stress on sleep. Results: Sleep quality, sleep onset latency and sleep eficiency, measured by self-report and actigraphy, were worse for women who had less than a college education and/or a household income < $50,000/year. SES was not associated with sleep duration. Pregnant women with lower SES and higher self-reported perceived stress had the poorest sleep quality and the most dificulties with sleep continuity . Conclusion: Low SES was associated with poorer subjective and objective sleep, even after statistical adjustments. These associations were exaggerated in women with higher perceived stress, suggesting a syngergistic effect of stress and SES on sleep in pregnant women. Low stress may buffer the negative effects of low SES on sleep.

N2  - Introduction: In the non-pregnant population short sleep duration is associated with elevated glucose levels. Elevated glucose in pregnancy is linked with poor pregnancy outcomes and emerging data suggest that poor sleep in pregnancy may be associated with increased glucose. The goal of this study was to investigate whether short sleep duration in pregnancy is associated with elevated glucose levels in pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women provided self-report assessments of sleep duration. Results of their clinical 50g-load oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were extracted from their medical records. Elevated glucose levels were considered present when the OGTT was ≥140mg/dl. Women were classiied as having short sleep duration if they reported ≤6 hours of sleep/night, normal sleep duration if 7-9 hours/night, and long sleep duration if ≥10 hours/night. Results: Overall, 1,121 women were included (n=60 short sleepers, n=278 long sleepers, and the remainder reported normal sleep duration). Mean age was 30.0±5.7 years and 25% were obese prior to pregnancy. Compared to those with normal sleep duration (120.6±32.3mg/dl), glucose levels were not different for either short sleepers (120.0±40.6mg/dl) or long sleepers (118.6±35.6mg/dl). Obese women had higher glucose levels than lean women regardless of sleep duration; 135.4±34.2mg/dl vs. 115.9±30.1mg/dl (p<0.001) for those with normal sleep duration, 141.7±58.0mg/dl vs. 109.1±31.7mg/dl (p<0.001) for short sleep duration, and 123.5±34.1mg/dl vs. 116.8mg/dl (p=0.21) for long sleep duration. Compared to lean women with normal sleep duration, only obese women with normal sleep had an increased odds ratio for elevated glucose levels: [OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.5-5.8, p<0.001]. Conclusion: Obesity plays a major role in glucose levels of pregnant women. This study does not support a role for sleep duration in glucose levels of pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Circadian rhythm disruption has been associated with depressed mood in non-perinatal adults. Our aim was to measure circadian rhythms during pregnancy and the postpartum period and to investigate whether circadian phase is related to postpartum depressive symptoms. Methods: As part of an ongoing study, we measured circadian phase using dim light salivary melatonin onset (DLMO) at approximately 33 weeks gestation (3rdT) and 6 weeks postpartum (6wksPP) in 11 women (mean age (SD)=28.8 (5.0) years) with a history of major depression or bipolar disorder (but not in a mood episode during 3rdT). Participants kept sleep diaries for 1 week before DLMO assessment to record bedtimes and wake times. Saliva was collected every 30 min from ∼2.5 h before the predicted DLMO to ∼3 h after predicted DLMO. Light-induced melatonin suppression was avoided by wearing dark welders glasses during saliva collection. Samples were later assayed for melatonin (Alpco, Salem, NH). DLMO time was computed by linear interpolation between the times of the saliva samples before and after melatonin levels reached threshold. Phase shifts were calculated by subtracting the 6wksPP DLMOfrom the 3rdT DLMO. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomotology- Self Report (IDS-SR). Results: Average wake time (SD) delayed significantly from 07:43 (93 min) at 3rdT to 08:20 (78 min) at 6wksPP (t=-2.31, df=10, p=.043). Neither average bedtime (3rdT: 23:36 (71 min), 6wksPP: 23:48 (90 min)) nor average DLMO time (3rd T: 21:56 (83 min), 6 weeks: 22:02 (91 min)) differed from 3rdT to 6wksPP. Circadian phase shifts ranged from a 121 min phase advance to a 133 min phase delay. Later DLMO at 3rdT was associated with higher IDS score at 6wksPP (r=.626, p=.039). Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts across the perinatal period. Later circadian phase during 3rdT was associated with more depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. Perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum depression.

N2  - Introduction: Daytime napping is a common sleep behavior during pregnancy. However, little is known about its inluences on nighttime sleep and insomnia severity in pregnant women. The purposes of this study were to describe daytime napping and nighttime sleep behaviors among irst-trimester pregnant women and compare nighttime sleep and insomnia severity in nappers and non-nappers Methods: Twenty-four healthy irst-trimester pregnant women (31.3 ± 3.6 years of age; 10.2 ± 2.9 weeks of pregnancy) wore a wrist actigragh for 7 consecutive days and completed the Chinese version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI-C). Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used to describe women's sleep patterns. Results: For the entire group, mean actigraphy-derived nighttime sleep duration, nighttime sleep eficiency, daytime nap duration, and 24-hour sleep duration were 439.0 ± 48.2 minutes, 84.3 ± 4.0%, 37.7 ± 26.5 minutes, and 476.76 ± 55.4 minutes, respectively. Eleven women (45.8%) had the ISI-C scores 蠇9, indicating clinically signiicant insomnia symptoms. Only three women did not nap over the entire week. Therefore, 13 women (54.2%) who napped 蠇4 days were arbitrarily deined as nappers, and 11 (45.8%) who napped <4days were deined as non-nappers. Daytime nap duration among nappers was signiicantly longer than non-nappers (52.3 ± 19.8 minutes versus 20.5 ± 23.2 minutes; p=0.001). There were no statistically signiicant differences in actigraphy-derived nighttime sleep duration, nighttime sleep eficiency, and 24-hour sleep duration between nappers and non-nappers. However, mean ISI-C scores among nappers were 9.0 ± 6.4, a score that reaches the criteria for clinical insomnia. Conclusion: Women who nap during the irst trimester of pregnancy are likely napping as a way to compensate for poor nighttime sleep.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnant women are at higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which has been associated with adverse maternal-fetal outcomes including preeclampsia. The mechanism mediating this association has not yet been elucidated although it is understood that preeclampsia may result from placental under-perfusion due to limited angiogenesis. We hypothesize that limited angiogenesis may be a potential shared mechanism in the pathogenesis of both obstructive sleep apnea and preeclampsia. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted to compare second trimester maternal serum markers of angiogenesis, placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGF-R1) and endoglin (s-Eng), between pregnant women with OSA identiied by ICD-9 codes, and controls at low risk for OSA from a convenience sample who scored zero on questions on apnea, snoring and gasping from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index questionnaire. Levels of these markers were determined using manual ELISA reagents (R&D Systems). Groups were compared using t-test analysis, after controlling for gestational age, gestational hypertension, and body mass index. Results: Sample size is limited by availability of stored serum and by women who had second trimester screening. Mean age was similar in cases (n=22) and controls (n=66) (26 +/- 6.2 vs. 28 +/- 6.4, p=0.4). Mean BMI was signiicantly higher in cases compared to controls (42.1 + 8.3 vs. 24.0 + 5.2, p<0.0001). Median PlGF was signicantly lower in cases compared to controls (80.7 vs.118.4 p=0.001), even after adjusting for gestational age, BMI and history of preeclampsia (p=0.0044). There were no signiicant differences in circulating sVEGF-R1 or s-Eng between cases and controls. Conclusion: Levels of the angiogenic marker PlGF are decreased in maternal serum from women with OSA in a similar pattern as preeclampsia. Further studies to explore the shared pathophysiology of these maternal complications in pregnancy will be undertaken.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with maternal and fetal complications. Its recognition may have important implications during pregnancy. Upper airway narrowing is a main determinant of OSA. Its evaluation with other existing objective and subjective tools could be useful for identifying OSA. We aimed to develop a screening tool combining subjective and objective measures to identify OSA in pregnant population. Methods: Data were collected from a completed cohort study of OSA including 108 women in irst trimester and 87 in third. Participants underwent full polysomnography, completed Multivariable Apnea Prediction index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and had OSAHS Score (sum of Mallampati score, body mass index categories and tonsil size). Bivariate regression analyses were performed. Suggestive (p<0.2) and non-correlated predictors of OSA were forwarded into a multivariate analysis to determine the best performing tool/s. The sensitivity, speciicity, and optimal cutoff point of these models were assessed using receiver operating characteristics curves for AHI≥5 in both trimesters. Results: Mean age was 27.4±7.0. Twelve women in irst and 21 in third trimester had AHI≥5. In the irst trimester, the model combining age, BMI and NSaO2 was the best predictor of OSA risk, with 83.33% sensitivity and 77.08% speciicity, and provided the best negative predictive value, 97.37. In the third trimester the model using age and BMI was a better determinant of OSA risk than other models, with 90.48% sensitivity and 63.64% speciicity, and 95.45% negative predictive value. Further analysis demonstrated the irst trimester age, BMI and OSA history are the best determinants of OSA risk in the third trimester. Conclusion: The existing screening tools assessing symptoms and the upper airway are poor predictors of OSA risk in pregnant women. BMI, age, NsaO2 are the most valuable determinants of OSA risk in pregnant population.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbance during pregnancy may serve as a marker of or causal factor in obstetrical risk. Activation of inlammatory pathways may represent the pathophysiological link between sleep disruption and its medical and psychological impact. Despite the importance of sleep in the obstetrical population, there are no published studies deinitively linking objective measures of sleep architecture disruption with maternal and neonatal outcomes. Methods: This is a prospective observational study of healthy pregnant subjects through their entire pregnancy. Subjects wore the Zeo home device headband for 7-10 nights per trimester. Zeo-derived total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), and sleep stage duration, were averaged within trimesters for each subject. Subjective TST and SL were obtained from patient diaries. Trimester differences were tested using One-way ANOVA with a post-test for a linear trend. Results: Out of 17 consented patients, we present results from seven subjects who completed all three trimesters of monitoring. Wake time and SL did not change between trimesters, although we found a trend towards decreased TST (minutes) (p=0.10): 461+/-15 (1st trimester), 433+/-21(2nd trimester) and 415+/-20 (3rd trimester). Interestingly, subjective/diary TST remained stable over the trimesters, indicating overestimation of TST compared to objective data. Absolute duration of REM sleep signiicantly decreased across trimesters (mean +/- SEM in 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester: 136.8+/-8.1 min, 126.2+/-9.9 min, and 97+/- 9.1min; ANOVA p=0.015; post-test for linear trend p=0.005). The percentage of REM sleep similarly decreased over the course of pregnancy (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester: 29.4+/-1.2%, 28.6+/-1.7% and 22.9+/-1.2%; ANOVA p=0.005; post-test for linear trend p=0.0025). In contrast, absolute duration of light NR and deep NR did not change across pregnancy. Conclusion: We report a novel approach to objective sleep assessment during pregnancy, using a home device allowing longitudinal, prospective, objective sleep analysis. Our hypothesis is that severity of sleep disruption during pregnancy correlates with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Preliminary results suggest longitudinal alterations in gestational TST and sleep architecture. Once enrollment is complete we will extend our analysis to the correlation between sleep disturbance and maternal and neonatal outcome, with the aim of identifying sleep-related markers of obstetric risk.

N2  - Introduction: Objective assessments of the association between sleep apnea (SA) and glucose metabolism in pregnancy are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between objectively assessed SA in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a cohort of high risk pregnant women. Methods: This was a planned subgroup analysis of data from a SA and preeclampsia study. Women with chronic hypertension, obesity, twin gestation and/or a history of preeclampsia (i.e., those at high risk of preeclampsia) who were between 6 and 20 weeks were recruited to participate in an overnight SA evaluation with a validated portable monitor. Women with pregestational diabetes were excluded. SA was deined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥ 5. The diagnosis of GDM was abstracted from the medical record and conirmed by a review of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) by study personnel blinded to the sleep study results. The relationship between SA and GDM was explored using univariable and multivariable analysis. Results: AHI and OGTT results were available for 75 of the 80 women recruited. The mean gestational age at the sleep study was 17.1 ± 4.2 weeks. Twenty-six (35%) women had SA and 20 (25%) developed GDM. Women with SA were more likely to develop GDM (46.2% vs. 14.3% p=.003). After controlling for possible confounding factors including BMI, maternal age, and a history of chronic hypertension, SA remained independently and positively associated with the development of GDM (OR 3.7, 95% CI=1.1, 13.3). Conclusion: Among high-risk women, SA during the irst half of pregnancy is an independent risk factor for the development of GDM. Further research is needed to determine whether screening for and treatment of SA during pregnancy can lessen the frequency of GDM.

N2  - Aims: To test the hypothesis that depressed women's (DW) mood during pregnancy or postpartum would improve more with late wake therapy (LWT) vs. early wake therapy (EWT) and correlate with endocrine measures. Methods: 21 DW (7 pregnant, 14 postpartum) and 37 healthy women (HW)(24 pregnant, 13 postpartum), mean age 28 years, were randomized in a cross-over design to EWT (sleep 03:00-07:00 h) vs. LWT (sleep 21:00-01:00 h) followed by a night of recovery sleep (RS-22:30- 06:30 h).Mood ratings (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-HDRS) were administered pre- and post-treatment (after RS). Plasma melatonin and serum cortisol, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were drawn every 30min from18:00-10:00 h in dim light (<50 lux) and serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) at 18:00 and 06:00 h. Results: HDRS scores were reduced by LWT in pregnant (p=.045) and postpartum (.016) DW, and by EWT in pregnant (.007) and postpartum (.022) DW. LWT improved HDRS scores by 56.2 %; EWT by 29.8 % in pregnant and postpartum DW, but the difference was not significant (ns). After LWT, change in HDRS correlated positively with change in melatonin peak and area under the curve in both pregnant and postpartum DW. After EWT, change in HDRS correlated negatively with change in melatonin offset time in pregnant DW; in postpartum DW, change in HDRS correlated negatively with melatonin peak concentration. After LWT, TSH mesor increased in postpartum HW; after EWT, cortisol amplitude and prolactin mesor decreased in postpartum HW. Mean E2 and P4 levels were not different between groups, but in postpartum DW, increased levels of E2 after LWT correlated with improved mood on the HDRS. Conclusion: Both EWT and LWT reduced depressive symptoms as measured by the HDRS in pregnant and postpartum women. The difference between the treatments was ns. Some corrections to melatonin, cortisol, prolactin and TSH rhythms were observed, but there were insufficient data to indicate that these changes consistently correlated with mood measures other than the increased estradiol levels associated with improved mood after LWT in postpartum DW.

N2  - Introduction: Poor sleep in late pregnancy has been related to the development of postpartum depression (PPD), yet the speciic nature of this relationship remains unclear. One of the reasons for the lack of clarity may be due to the complex nature of sleep. Past research has found that subjective sleep is related to PPD, however these studies did not show the same relationship using actigraphy. This suggests that a discrepancy exists between subjective and objective sleep measures. This may be due to the use of actigraphy rather then polysomnography (PSG). In order to better understand the relationship between sleep and PPD, we irst need to understand the relationship between subjective and objective sleep. To the best of our knowledge this is the irst study to use PSG to compare subjective and objective sleep within a pregnant sample. Methods: Women in their third trimester (n=23) underwent one night of PSG. The following morning a subjective sleep questionnaire was administered. These women were part of a larger study investigating the relationship between sleep and PPD. Results: Subjectively, women were relatively accurate at estimating their total sleep time (r=.59, p<.01); sleep onset latency (r=.66, p<.01), and number of awakenings (r=.61, p<.01). Subjective sleep quality was moderately correlated with objective number of awakenings (r=-.49, p=<.05) and percentage of time spent awake (r=-.44, p<.05), but was not signiicantly related to stages of sleep. However, subjective perception of sleep depth was correlated to percentage of time spent in stage one (r=-.42, p<.05). Conclusion: In contrast to previous research using actigraphy, this study shows moderate to strong correlations between women's subjective perceptions of sleep and objective PSG measures. One reason for this may be due to the relatively ine-grained analysis available with PSG. The implications of these indings for future research are discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This condition is associated with signiicant pathophysiologic sequelae, including intermittent hypoxemia and hypertension. Multiple factors present during pregnancy increase the risk for OSA, including increased upper airway resistance, decreased pharyngeal diameter, estrogen-induced nasal congestion, hypocapnia, and greater negative inspiratory pressure leading to an increased tendency for upper airway collapse. The presence of OSA during pregnancy has been associated with untoward consequences to both the mother and fetus. We studied the impact of maternal OSA during pregnancy on a group of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: The study group consisted of postpartum mothers who had delivered an infant admitted to the NICU within the previous 24 hours. Data was collected between 6/09-3/12. Mothers were randomly selected and asked to complete two standardized questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Snoring Symptoms Inventory) to identify symptoms of OSA, speciically, EDS and snoring. Maternal data regarding age, race, health status, pregnancy, labor,and delivery and infant data regarding gestational age, birthweight, andA pgar scores were collected. Results: We enrolled 115 mothers. Their mean age was 34 +/- 5 years. Seventy percent were Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, 6% African American, and 5% Asian. Smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy were reported in 2%. Most deliveries were via elective c-section (42%), followed by NSVD (32%), and emergency c-section in 24%. The relationship between the ESS and the SSI was assessed using a Pearson Correlation Statistic (r), which showed a high correlation between the measures (r= 0.506; p< 0.0001). The relationship of ESS and SSI totals to pregnancy outcomes was analyzed. Elevated scores on the SSI were associated with adverse maternal outcomes, speciically, lower Hb/Hct and preeclampsia. Lower infant Apgar scores were also seen. Conclusion: Pregnant women who demonstrate excessive daytime sleepiness are also likely to have sleep disturbances due to snoring. Elevated scores on the SSI are associated with adverse maternal pregnancy outcomes. We noted symptoms of maternal OSA in a high percentage of infants requiring admission to a NICU. The potential for treatment of OSA using CPAP underscores the importance of early diagnosis in pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disruption is common during pregnancy and an increasing number of studies show that poor sleep is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of insomnia in the non-pregnant population, few studies have investigated the prevalence and correlates of insomnia in pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women completed a battery of sleep-related questionnaires during the third trimester, including the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). The ISQ is a self-report questionnaire that captures a clinically relevant case deinition of insomnia consistent with widely used insomnia classiication criteria. The presence of prenatal depression, other sleep disorders, and demographic information was also obtained. Results: Overall, 321 women were included. The mean age was 29.4±5.9 years, 65% were Caucasian, and 31% were nulliparous. The prevalence of insomnia in this population was 52%. Caucasians were more likely than African Americans to have insomnia (51% vs. 34%, p=0.001). Women with insomnia were more likely than those without to have poor sleep quality (95% vs. 36%, p<0.001), poor daytime function (94% vs. 37%, p<0.001), excessive daytime sleepiness (56% vs. 27%, p<0.001), and symptoms of depression (35% vs. 7%, p<0.001). They tended to have a higher frequency of sleep-disordered breathing (40% vs. 31%, p=0.08) and restless leg syndrome (36% vs. 27%, p=0.11) although these did not quite reach statistical signiicance. Conclusion: Half of third trimester pregnant women report insomnia and this is associated with signiicant daytime impairment. These data further support the need to screen for sleep dificulties during pregnancy.

N2  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies. © 2013 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal movement is an important biological index of fetal well-being. Since 2008, we have been developing a new and original, capacitive acceleration sensor and data recording device that a pregnant woman can easily use to record fetal movement by herself at home during overnight sleep. Since it is based on fetal movement acceleration measurement, we call it an FMAM recorder (Ryo E, Nishihara K, Kamata H, Matsumoto S. Med Eng Phys 34: 566-572). In 2012, we demonstrated that manually counting fetal movements recorded by the FMAM gave the similar results to those given by ultrasonography (in press). However, manual analysis of overnight data is time-consuming, so we have developed an automatic analysis system. In the present study, we compared a manual analysis of fetal movement signals recorded during maternal sleep with an automatic software analysis of the same data. Methods: Six pregnant women (26-36 years; 28-38 gestational weeks) volunteered to participate in the study and successfully recorded data on 61 occasions. All mothers gave written informed consent to the study. They were allowed to take a device home to record fetal movement by themselves during sleep. Fetal movement signals were detected by the software program. Agreements between the manual and automatic detection signals for the same 10-sec epochs were evaluated by prevalence- adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK, 1993). Results: A mean (SD) value of PABAK for all the mothers was 0.82 (0.04), which was interpreted to be almost perfect. Since the FMAM recorder has a maternal movement recording channel, maternal movement overlapping the fetal movement channel can be excluded, even for pregnant women with periodic limb movement. However, maternal respiration could not be completely excluded. Conclusion: The agreement between manual and automatic detection signals was high. The new automatic analysis of fetal movement can be used.

N2  - Introduction: Prior work from our group has demonstrated an increased risk of neonatal morbidity and elevated umbilical cord proinlammatory cytokines associated with short sleep duration. We sought to evaluate the effect of short sleep duration on umbilical cord plasma 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), a marker of oxidative stress. Methods: A nested case cohort study was performed of term pregnancies enrolled in a prospective sleep disorders protocol. Subjects completed validated sleep questionnaires to assess for reported sleep duration during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy; hypersomnolence and symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Berlin Sleep Questionnaire). Short sleep duration (SSD) was deined as ≤5 hours per night of sleep. Levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were measured in umbilical cord blood at delivery. Statistical analysis was performed using chi square, Wilcoxon rank test and spearman correlation; P<0.05 was considered signiicant. Results: The cohort included 63 women. Comorbid conditions included obesity (30%), gestational diabetes (6%) and chronic hypertension (8%). Among the cohort, 28% had SSD. Women with SSD compared to those without had a similar delivery gestational age (38±1.2 weeks vs. 39±1, p=0.21) and birthweight (3301±424 3141±409gm, p=0.36). Women with SSD also had similar levels of umbilical cord 8-OHDG (11,528±2672 vs. 12,953±4688 pg/ml, p=0.68). Neither maternal BMI (r=-.27, p=0.13), gestational weight gain (r=0.01, p=0.9) nor sleep duration (r=-.06, p=0.64) was correlated with umbilical cord 8OHDG. Women undergoing cesarean delivery had a lower level of umbilical cord 8-OHDG (13561±5491 vs.11409±2401pg/ml, p=0.08) but this did not reach statistical signiicance. After controlling for smoking and cesarean delivery, neonatal birthweight was inversely correlated with umbilical cord 8OHDG (r=-.33, p=0.017). Conclusion: Self reported short sleep duration was not associated with elevated umbilical cord 8OHDG. There was an inverse relationship between umbilical cord 8OHDG and neonatal birthweight. Further investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms leading to neonatal morbidity associated with pregnancy sleep disturbance.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that women with a major depressive episode (MDE) during pregnancy or with onset during the first 3 months postpartum have disturbances in the phase (timing) or amplitude of biological rhythms (plasma melatonin, serum cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone-TSH, prolactin and sleep/ activity) compared with normal control women matched for age (within 5 years) and pregnant or postpartum month. Methods: In 58 women, 31 pregnant (7 depressed patients-DP; and 24 normal controls-NC) and 27 postpartum (14 DP; 13 NC), we measured plasma melatonin and serum cortisol, TSH and prolactin every 30 min in dim (<50 lux)/dark conditions from 18:00-11:00 h; reproductive hormones (estradiol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone-FSH, and luteinizing hormone-LH) at 18:00 and 06:00 h; sleep (by polysomnography-PSG and subjective ratings) and activity (by Actillume). Results: In pregnancy, DP vs. NC subjects had lower mean melatonin, somewhat lower peak and area under the curve (AUC); earlier evening cortisol, higher FSH and LH and poorer rest quality. Postpartum DP vs. NC had higher mean morning melatonin, somewhat higher AUC, shorter melatonin duration, somewhat earlier prolactin acrophase and poorer sleep and rest quality. TSH tended to be lower in DP vs. NC in both groups. Conclusions: Differential changes in melatonin, prolactin, cortisol and reproductive hormones characterize pregnant vs. postpartum DP compared with NC women. Further work is needed on how therapeutic interventions might alter these neuroendocrine profiles and thereby mediate their beneficial effects.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common among pregnant women. No study has thus far investigated the effect of maternal SDB on the infant's neuro-behavioral outcome. Our objective were to examine the effect of maternal SDB on neonatal neurobehavioral examination and the Prechtl assessment of general movements (GMs). Methods: Healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated, full-term pregnancies underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (Watch-PAT; Itamar Medical) and categorized into SDB (i.e.:AHI>5) and controls . Neonatal neurobehavioral examination was performed by a pediatric neurologist and included motor, cranial nerves, neonatal relexes, sensory and behavioral items. Infant's GMs were assessed using a videotaped recording for at least 15 minutes in an awake, non-crying state. Recordings were performed at the irst 48 hours (GMs-1), 8-11 (GMs-2) and at 14- 16 (GMs-3) weeks of age and were scored by a certiied examiner who was blinded to all clinical information. Results: Sixty full-term infants were studied (60% males). The mean birthweight percentile was 61.8±24.6. The mean Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 8.8±0.9 and 9.9±0.4 respectively. Twelve women had SDB (i.e; AHI>5). No differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and controls in total neurobehavioral scores (95.4±4.5 vs. 94.5±4.0)and in GMs scores of all 3 evaluations (GMs-1:14.0±4.1 vs 15.0±3.7 ; GMs-2: 23.1±7.2 vs. 22.6±7.5 ; GMs-3: 23.3±7.7 vs. 23.5±6.7). Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal SDB does not impose any impact on their infant's neurobehavioral outcome. The effect of SDB on long term infanst 'development is yet to be deined.

N2  - Objective: Lower income and educational levels, as well as low social support and higher life stress, are associated with depressed mood during pregnancy. Fewer studies have examined links between employment status and antenatal depression. Our objective was to examine the relationship of work status, sleep, and mood during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Methods: As part of an ongoing study of perinatal sleep and mood, we studied 17 women (ages 23-37, mean + SD=29.9+5.6 years) with a history ofmajor depressive disorder or bipolar disorder (but not in a current mood episode) at 33 weeks of pregnancy. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy and daily sleep diaries for 1 week. Actigraphic total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SLEF) were estimated using Action-W software (AMI, NY). Women also were interviewed about their work status and were classified as full-time workers (worked a full day for pay >4 days/ week) or part-time/non-workers. To assess mood, we modified the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report-30 (IDS-SR), excluding the 8 items about sleep, appetite, and weight loss/gain. We used independent sample T-tests to compare the sleep measures and modified IDS mood scores between full-time workers and part-time/non-workers. Results: Our data suggest that women working in full-time jobs may have less depressive symptoms at 33 weeks of pregnancy than their parttime/ non-working counterparts. This trend occurs in spite of the fact that working women may be getting less total sleep and lower quality sleep, factors typically associated with higher depressive symptoms. Our future analyses will examine other factors, such as social support, socioeconomic status and job satisfaction using a larger sample.

N2  - Background: Sleep changes through pregnancy, and poor sleep may have negative effects both on maternal depression and foetal wellbeing. Insomnia may also be a symptom of depression, but both women and health care providers may attribute insomnia to the bodily changes only, and fail to address depression. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of and possible risk factors for both insomnia and depressive symptoms simultaneously in the last trimester of pregnancy in a large population of pregnant women, and to examine the relationship between these two disorders. Methods: A population based questionnaire study of 2816 women was conducted in week 32 of pregnancy in Akershus, Norway. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms. Results: The prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9 %, and mean BIS score 17.5 (SD 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS>=10) was 14.6 %. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with sleep durations <5 or >10 h, sleep efficiency <75 %, daytime impairment and long sleep onset latency. Several pain measures (low back pain, pelvic girdle pain, other chronic pain) were associated with insomnia. Previous depression was associated both with insomnia and depressive symptoms. Stressful life events, fear of childbirth, and younger age were associated with depressive symptoms, but not with insomnia. Conclusions: Insomnia was highly prevalent in the last trimester of pregnancy, and several pain measurements were associated with sleep problems. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher than previously reported among pregnant women in Norway. Daytime impairment and difficulty falling asleep were the insomnia factors most strongly associated with depressive symptoms, whereas pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain were more strongly associated with insomnia.

N2  - Introduction: Longitudinal physiologic datasets are useful for prognosis and neurotherapeutic assessments. Spectral EEG power changes across states and frequencies from 25 weeks to 24 months (CA) were investigated. Methods: The Neonatal EEG Sleep Database (1988-2005) encompasses populations recruited through ive NIH-sponsored studies. Serial multi-hour EEG sleep recordings (1100 studies) on 342 PT neonates (24-37 PMA) were performed monthly until term, compared with 97 FT neonates. Nap studies were subsequently performed at six months or at six month intervals until 24 months. Physiologic datasets (eleven cerebral/ nine non-cerebral channels) were digitally acquired and merged with text-based clinical/demographic information. Visual scores for states, arousals, body and rapid eye movements were synchronized with digital recordings. Neonatal illness severity scores and childhood developmental assessments identiied subjects' risk. Absolute and relative power in four frequency ranges were modeled using a non-linear harmonic mixed-effects longitudinal regression analysis including random subject effects, accounting for non-uniform testing ages, missing data, and differential effects of clinical/demographic factors. Results: Primary regression covariates (descending order effect size): maturational age, state, electrode location, and birth GA. Parameters associated with these covariates signiicantly improve the model it (p<0.001) for all frequency ranges. Linear or low-order polynomial regression models are inadequate for modeling power changes. All model components exhibit multiple inlection points versus maturational age. Largest rates of change are between 40 and 44 weeks. Direction reversals often occur before and after these ages. Absolute power tends to increase with age non-monotonically. State, electrode location and preterm/ full term GA are signiicantly diferent. Conclusion: Frequency speciic changes in EEG power relect developmental shifts in brain circuitries. Transient power changes during neonatal periods relect rapid maturation of thalamocortical circuitries, with slower rates of change during early childhood. Neonatal EEG sleep is a complex phenotype that relects brain connectivity changes with age, health status and demographic factors.

N2  - There is no consensus regarding specific psychosocial or obstetric risk factors associated with recurrences during pregnancy. Unique or specific clinical management strategies to limit risk of recurrences of mood disorders during pregnancy or the postpartum period remain to be defined. This symposium will provide an up-to-date data review and discussion on the clinical predictors and biomarkers of perinatal mood disorders. Dr. Katherine Williams will provide review of clinical characteristics of perinatal mood disorders, with an emphasis on “asking the right questions” in the differential diagnosis of unipolar from bipolar disorders in new onset perinatal depressions. Screening for mood disorders in specific obstetrical populations is especially important, including women with gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, as well as personality dimensions. Specific focus will be on the outcomes of longitudinal clinical monitoring of pregnant depressed women receiving both pharmacological management and psychotherapy at the Stanford Center for Neuroscience in women's Health. Dr. Barbara Parry will review differences in circadian rhythms between depressed women and controls as well as differential changes in neuroendocrine profiles from pregnancy to postpartum between groups. Dr. Katherine Wisner will present results from a prospective observational study of the treatment experience of pregnant women with bipolar disorder to identify appropriate algorhythms of risk-benefit decision making for drug treatment in pregnancy. Dr. Natalie Rasgon will then integrate data from others presentations to delineate specific questions before the clinical and research communities in accomplishing goal of preventative interventions in pregnant women with mood disorders.

N2  - Introduction: Few studies have examined the impact of infant sleep patterns on maternal sleep, stress, and mood. We hypothesized that more disrupted infant sleep would be associated with shorter maternal sleep, more maternal depressive symptoms, and greater maternal stress. Methods: We enrolled pregnant women with a history of major depression who were not in a depressive episode at 3rd trimester. We estimated mothers' total sleep time (“MTST”) at postpartum weeks 2 and 6 from wrist actigraphy data using the Sadeh algorithm in Action-W-software (AMI, NY). We derived 4 infant sleep measures from the “Baby's Sleep/ Wake Chart” completed daily by mothers and averaged for postpartum weeks 2 and 6: (1) # of infant sleep bouts/24 h (“Bouts”); (2) longest bout of infant sleep/24 h (“Longest”); (3) infant total sleep time (“ITST”); (4) infant bedtime (“IBed”): deined as the last time the infant went to sleep with no awakenings before mother went to bed, or if infant went to sleep after mother, the time of irst infant sleep episode > 30 min after mother went to bed. In addition, we calculated the difference between mother and infant bedtimes (“MomBabyBedDiff;” mins; larger values indicate a longer interval of maternal wakefulness after infant bedtime). Participants completed the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS-SR) at the end of weeks 2 and 6 and the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at 16 weeks postpartum. Results: 20 women (mean±SD age: 27.8+5.2 yrs) have completed the protocol so far. Mean±SD infant sleep measures at 2 weeks were: Bouts=7.5±1.9; Longest =185±46 min; ITST=920±172 min; IBed=22:42±65 min; MomBabyBedDiff=33±46 min and at 6 weeks were: Bouts=6.8±1.6; longest =233±73 min; ITST=873±134 min; IBed=22:44±96 min; MomBabyBedDiff=61±36 min. Mean±SD IDSSR score was 17.8±8.6 at 2 weeks and 16.6±8.0 at 6 weeks. Mean±SD CSI score was 5.8±4.4. At 2 weeks, Longest was positively correlated with MTST (r=.58, p=.02), and MomBabyBedDiff was negatively correlated with IDS-SR score (r=-.62, p=.01). Bouts at 2 weeks was positively correlated with CSI (r=.73, p=.02). Infant sleep measures were not related signiicantly to maternal sleep or mood measures at 6 weeks. The association between Bouts at 6 weeks and CSI did not reach statistical signiicance (r=.46, p=.10). Conclusion: These preliminary data indicate that infant sleep patterns during the early weeks following delivery are associated with maternal sleep, mood, and perceived stress in women at risk for postpartum depression.

N2  - Aim: This study was undertaken to test, under real-life conditions, the effects of acupuncture on headaches during pregnancy and compare this with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone. Methodology: Forty-three conventionally treated (lifestyle modifications and stretching) pregnant women were randomly allocated into two groups to routine care or acupuncture. The severity and disability caused by this pain and its affect on mood, sleep and work were assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The main end-point was the mean difference between the first and the last interview after eight weeks of treatment. Secondary end points were the changes over time in the NRS assessments of pain intensity, disturbances in mood, sleep and working and the use of medications. Differences between initial and final sessions were analyzed by a two-sample test. Changes over time in the NRS assessment were analyzed by the Fisher exact test. Mood's test for medians was used and a p-value < 0.05 indicated a significant difference. Results: All women completed the treatment. No important adverse effects related to acupuncture treatment or to pregnancy's outcome were reported. Significant improvements were demonstrated for pain at the end of the trial in the study group, 3.9 vs 1.7 difference in favor to acupuncture group (p < 0.05). This group also used less medication and had a greater improvement in mood and sleep when compared with the control group. Conclusions: This study suggests acupuncture alleviates tension-type headaches during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Postpartum changes to normal sleep duration are experienced by almost all mothers. Sleep changes at this time have been linked with poorer postpartum mood, which can interfere with the development of an optimal mother-child relationship, and also with the onset of life-long poor sleep patterns. Maternal age at childbirth may have an association with sleep duration, with younger mothers tending towards longer total sleep. Average age of parturition may also vary between ethnic groups. Methods: The E Moe Mama, Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study (n=1,189) surveyed a community sample of women during the third trimester of pregnancy, at 4-6 weeks and 12 weeks postpartum. Sleep duration data, from a brief telephone survey conducted at 4-6 weeks postpartum, are presented (n=1,010). Women needed to be 16 years or older to participate (range 16-46 years). Equal numbers of Maori and non-Maori were sought in recruitment, and 36% of women in the inal sample identiied as Maori. Women were asked about their total sleep time (TST) in the 24-hours preceding the telephone call. Results: Mean TST for Maori was 7.73 hours (range 2-16 hours), and for non-Maori mean TST was 7.51 hours (range 3-17). On average, Maori women were signiicantly younger than non-Maori women (Maori 27.9 years versus non-Maori 31.9 years, t(986) p=<.0001). Approximately 30% of both groups reported TST of ≤6 hours. Longer sleepers (>9 hours TST) were twice as likely to be Maori (18%) than non-Maori (10%), χ2(2) = 12.6, p = .002. Conclusion: Given the range of maternal age in this community sample, both age and ethnicity should be considered in any studies investigating sleep duration in peripartum women.

N2  - Introduction: Periodic leg movement during sleep (PLMS) is a common complaint associated with RLS, though not all RLS patients have PLMS. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical characteristics and sleep architecture in the RLS patients with PLMS to the RLS patients without PLMS. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all the PSG data of 155 idiopathic RLS patients in a tertiary hospital sleep center, whose age was 18 years old or higher. There were 64 RLS patients who had PLMS while 91 did not. RLS with PLMS was deined by the PLM index based on the polysomnograhy, which was 15 or higher. In our study, we excluded comorbid secondary RLS patients whose RLS was caused by Iron deiciency anemia, chronic renal failure, and pregnancy. We also excluded those with comorbid sleep disorders such as: sleep apnea, narcolepsy, parasomnia. Individual clinical characteristics were compared using the International RLS Severity scale, the RLS quality of life questionnaire, Korean versions of the SF-36, the Beck Depression Inventory-2, the hospital anxiety scale, the Korean version of the Insomnia Severity Index, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth sleepiness scale, as well as a polysomnograhy. Results: RLS patients without PLMS had signiicantly higher levels of anxiety (8.57±4.16 vs, 7.08±4.28, p=0.039), and depression (18.65±9.59 vs, 15.65±10.84, p=0.045), than those with PLMS. RLS patients with PLMS showed a signiicantly higher total arousal Index (59.92±39.59 vs 45.58±22.45, p=0.005), while RLS patients without PLMS showed a signiicantly longer latency to REM (118.54±63.73 vs, 93.68±65.61, p=0.016) and had a higher spontaneous arousal Index (40.00±20.29 vs, 29.39±21.94, p=0.007). Conclusion: We found RLS patients without PLMS had higher levels of anxiety and depression. And, there were differences in the sleep architecture of the two groups. The RLS patients without PLMS had a higher spontaneous arousal index and longer latency to REM.

N2  - Introduction: Previous studies have suggested differences in sleep quality between preterm and term infants. A number of factors could explain these differences including physiological and psychological factors. Poor sleep may contribute to the developmental problems seen in preterm infants. In this study we evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants comparing with term infants based on the validated modiied Chinese version brief infant sleep questionnaire (CBISQ). Methods: To validate the modiied CBISQ we collected 69 6-months old full term healthy infants and 177 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All parents completed a modiied CBISQ. We irstly, examined the test-retest reliability of the modiied CBISQ. Then, we compared the questionnaire-responses with other subjective (sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) measures of sleep. Finally , we evaluated the validity and potential usage of the questionnaire for diagnostic purposes by comparing results to those obtained with nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square, t-test and correlation-coeficients with SPSS version-16. Results: Test-retest reliability of CBISQ was acceptable. The nocturnal sleep duration and daytime sleep duration had signiicant correlation with actigraphy( r=0.266∗, 0.371∗ ). The total sleep time, night- awakenings, Wake-after-sleep-onset time, time spent with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing correlated signiicantly with PSG( 0.547∗,0.647∗,0.770∗,0.615∗, 0.518∗). The CBISQ showed the nightawakenings, WASO, nocturnal sleep time, time spent mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing were showed signiicantly difference between premature infants and term infants (0.006∗,0.018∗). Conclusion: The CBISQ is a reliable and valid tool for the measurement of sleep problems in infants. Premature infants have more sleep problems compared to term infants.

N2  - Introduction: The development of infant sleep has been associated with parenting factors such as maternal depression, parental sleep-related cognitions and soothing behaviors. The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the links between two parenting factors which have received relatively little scientiic attention (i.e., maternal sleep and paternal involvement in infant caregiving) and infant sleep at 3 and 6 months post-partum. Methods: The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Infant and maternal sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the overall involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. Maternal depressive symptoms and breastfeeding were used as control variables. Results: Statistically signiicant correlations were found between infant and maternal sleep percent at 3 months (r = .51, p < .0005) and at 6 months (r = .59, p < .0005), and between infant and maternal number of night wakings at 3 months (r = .36, p < .01) and at 6 months (r = .62, p < .0005). Structural Equation Modeling revealed that maternal sleep percent at 3 months signiicantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months (β = .48, p < .001). However, infant sleep did not predict maternal sleep. Moreover, greater paternal involvement in infant caregiving at 3 months signiicantly predicted fewer night-wakings in infants (β = -.29, p < .05) and mothers (β = -.34, p < .05), and higher maternal sleep percent (β = .30, p < .05) at 6 months. Conclusion: Our indings suggest that disturbed maternal sleep may predict the development of problematic infant sleep patterns and that encouraging fathers to increase their involvement in caregiving responsibilities might be an important aspect of interventions aimed at enhancing maternal and infant sleep.

N2  - Introduction: We previously reported that a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) exhibits upregulation of hypothalamic GABA A receptors (GABAARs) and elevated response to sedative effect of GABAAR agonist, gaboxadol, during the lights-on (rest) period when tested on postnatal days (PD) 29-52. Using the same rat model, we now investigated whether a moderate early postnatal alcohol exposure (AE) changes sleep/wake behavior in young adult rats. Methods: Alcohol (3.0 g/kg/day) was administered to male rats via intragastric intubations on PD4-9, a period equivalent to human brain development during the third trimester of pregnancy (AE group; N=3). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group; N=3). On PD31-33 rats were instrumented for radiotelemetric recording of sleep/wake behavior. On PD44-47, a 72 h-long recording session started at ∼9AM. Sleep scoring was performed using Somnologica software. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and REMS were distinguished in 10 s epochs and quantiied over 48 h-period starting on the second recording day. For each rat, data averaged from two successive lights-on (7AM-7PM) and lights-off (7PM-7AM) periods were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: During the lights-on phase, REMS was signiicantly elevated in AE rats (17.1%±0.9 (SE) vs. 13.8%±0.4 in S rats; p=0.03), mainly due to an increased number of REMS episodes (69.3±0.4 vs. 51.0±3.0 in S; p=0.02). During the lights-off (active) phase, REMS amounts did not differ signiicantly between the groups, but AE group tended to have reduced REMS (4.2%±0.7 vs. 6.1%±0.4 in S; p=0.08). Differences in SWS and wake were not signiicant during either phase. Conclusion: Pubertal male rats subjected to moderate early postnatal AE have increased amounts of REMS during the lights-off (rest) circadian phase. This may be related to increased levels of GABAARs in the hypothalamic perifornical region that we previously described in this model.

N2  - Introduction: Present-day chronic sleep restriction, compounded by other interferences such as sleep disturbances, constitutes a relevant public health issue. In rodents, the lack of sleep affects the action of sexual hormones and interferes with reproductive capability. The present study investigated the effects of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on the reproductive capability of the offspring. Methods: Sexual behavior during the adult phase was analyzed in F1 offspring of sleep-restricted (SR) females (irst experiment) and males (second experiment; SR or paradoxically sleep-deprived). Results: F1 male offspring of SR females had lower motivation for sex and reduced progesterone concentrations. F1 Female offspring, in contrast, displayed signiicantly enhanced proceptivity when compared to control offspring. F1 female offspring also demonstrated hypersexuality by mounting the males, in the absence of any signiicant hormonal alterations. F1 adult male offspring of SR or paradoxically sleep-deprived (PSD) males presented a decline in the sexual response, accompanied by a reduction in testosterone concentrations. Proceptivity was signiicantly increased among F1 female offspring of PSD and SR males when compared to control offspring. Conclusion: Together, these experiments demonstrate that sleep restriction in progenitors may alter sexual behavior of the F1 offspring in adulthood. Such indings reveal far-reaching consequences of sleep deprivation, and suggest that parental sleep inluences the reproductive capability of subsequent generations, a fact of interest for those who plan on parenting.

N2  - Introduction: Preterm infants are at increased risk of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is thought to involve cardiovascular instability and failure of arousal from sleep. A major SIDS risk factor, the prone sleeping position, is associated with reduced blood pressure and cerebral oxygenation in term infants. We suggest cerebral hypoxia may contribute to impaired arousal in the prone position which would be exacerbated in preterm infants. However, the effect of sleep position on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants is unknown. Methods: 22 preterm infants (27-36 weeks gestation) underwent daytime polysomnography at three post-term ages: 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months and 5-6 months corrected age (CA). Continuous blood pressure (FinometerTM, Finometer Medical Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) (NIRO 200 spectrophotometer, Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Tokyo, Japan) were measured. Data was collected in quiet (QS) and active (AS) sleep and in the prone and supine sleep positions. The effect of sleep position was determined using twoway repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Cerebral TOI was approximately 7% lower in the prone position in QS at 2-4 weeks and 2-3 months CA (p<0.05) and approximately 3% lower in the prone position in both QS (p<0.01) and AS (p<0.05) at 5-6 months CA. Sleep position had no effect on MAP in either sleep state at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months or 5-6 months CA. At 2-4 weeks and 5-6 months CA HR was signiicantly higher in the prone compared to the supine position in QS (p<0.05), but no difference was found in AS or at 2-3 months CA. Conclusion: In preterm infants, cerebral oxygenation is reduced in the prone sleep position despite limited effects of sleep position on cardiovascular parameters. We suggest that impaired cerebral oxygenation may contribute to the increased risk of SIDS in preterm infants in the prone position.

N2  - Introduction: Each day, the normal neonatal brain actively creates sleep for twice as long as wakefulness. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal sleep physiology during infancy is signiicantly associated with adverse neurologic and behavioral outcomes. Yet sleep as a highly regulated brain function has barely been evaluated among critically-ill neonates. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that disordered sleep relects central nervous system dysfunction. We evaluated the mathematical distribution of behavioral states and measured sleep fragmentation in critically-ill neonates. Methods: Newborn infants (≥35 weeks gestation) judged clinically to be at risk for seizures were monitored with 8-12 hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states and the entropy of the sequence of state transitions were calculated. Delta power from the electroencephalogram (EEG) portion of the PSG was also quantiied. The Spearman correlation of these results with standardized neurologic exam (Thompson) scores was calculated. Results: Twenty-two infants requiring neonatal intensive care were monitored for this pilot study (mean gestational age 39.2±1.5 weeks). Increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic exam scores (Spearman rho=0.6, p=0.003), while the proportion of active sleep did not (p>0.1). Lower sleep stage entropy showed a trend toward correlation with higher (worse) exam scores (rho =- 0.38, p=0.09). Decreased EEG delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse exam scores (rho = -0.46, p=0.03). These indings remained statistically signiicant after adjusting for gestational age and postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Conclusion: In this initial sample of neonates at risk for brain dysfunction, increased proportion of quiet sleep and diminished EEG delta power during quiet sleep were associated with more abnormal neurological examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

N2  - There is growing evidence suggesting than sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether diabetic patients share the same sleep breathing pattern than non-diabetic patients remains to be elucidated. For this purpose we designed a case-control study between 119 T2DM patients and 238 non-diabetic subjects closely matched by age, gender, BMI, waist and neck circumferences, and smoking status. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examination included a respiratory polysomnography, oxygen saturation measures as the cumulative percentage of time spent with oxygen saturations below 90% (CT90), and the degree of sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Apnea was defined as cessation of airflow with duration of at least 10 seconds, and an accurate differentiation between obstructive and central apneas was performed. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was defined as the sum of apneas plus hypopneas divided by time in bed. A higher AIH was observed in T2DM patients (34.5±9.3 vs. 26.2±8.1 events/hour; p=0.017). When apnea and hiponea were evaluated separately, a similar incidence of hypopneas events was present in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (18.3±4.2 vs. 16.7±5.3 e/h; p=0.951). By contrast, both the rate of apneas and CT90 were significantly increased in diabetic patients (15.2±2.8 vs. 10.3±1.9 e/h; p=0.048, and 18.0±6.7 vs. 10.3±7.7 %; p=0.042, respectively). No differences between the rate of obstructive and central apneas were observed. In addition, diabetic patients also showed higher daily sleepiness (7.5±3.1 vs 6.0±4.7, p=0.012) than non-diabetic subjects. In conclusion, T2DM patients have a higher rate of apneas than non-diabetic subjects, leading to more severe nocturnal hypoxemia and daily sleepiness.

N2  - Antenatal depression predicts a range of adverse child outcomes, including disturbed infant sleep (O'Connor et al., 2007). Recent gene-environment interaction studies, using this specific polymorphism, suggest that the polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene area (5-HTTLPR) may moderate the effect of negative early life events on a number of phenotypic outcomes. Reactive temperament has also been shown to be a moderator of the effects of a range of negative life events on developmental outcomes. Infant sleep is identified as an important marker of early bio-behavioural development. Serotonin has been extensively linked to the study of sleep and has implicated in both sleep and wake promoting processes. This study examined two moderators, a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene area and infant reactive temperament. Methods: We examined whether the association of antenatal depression at 32 weeks gestation (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and infant sleep at 6 months (measured as total sleep time and number of awakenings) would be moderated a) by the polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene area 5HTTLPR and b) by mother-rated reactive temperament, in a large population cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children, n=5,402). We hypothesized that the association between maternal mood disturbance and infant sleep a) would be stronger in those infants with low activity alleles of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) compared to those with high activity alleles b) would be stronger in infants with reactive temperament. Infants with more reactive temperament would be more susceptible to the effects of antenatal depression and would exhibit less total sleep time and a higher number of awakenings. Results: Depression was not found to predict sleep at 6 months. Regression models did not show evidence of a moderating effect of serotonin x depression. Reactivity however was found to be a moderator of sleep problems and number of awakenings. Conclusion: These findings suggest different developmental trajectories for individuals with different temperamental characteristics. They further support that high reactivity is associated with differential vulnerability to negative life events, such as antenatal maternal depression, even during very early development.

N2  - Introduction: Resistance to weight-gain is associated with enhanced sleep quality and lateral-hypothalamic (LH) orexin sensitivity in obesity- resistant (OR) rats. OR rats exhibit increased central orexin receptor gene expression, indicating enhanced orexin signaling. Functional output from LH orexin system is critical to energy-homeostasis and sleep/ wake behavior. Spontaneous neural-network activity desynchronization implies higher degree of freedom in functional connectivity and inal output from neural ensembles. Thus, we hypothesize that OR rats with higher LH orexin sensitivity will exhibit neural desynchronization in the hypothalamus, and examined hypothalamic network synchronization in cultured (embryonic-day 18; E18) OR and Sprague-Dawley (SD) hypothalamus. Methods: Hypothalamic tissue (E18) was obtained from pregnant OR and SD rats, and cultured in multi-electrode-array (MEA) embedded dishes. MEA recordings were performed twice weekly, beginning on 5th day in vitro (DIV) and continuing up to 30 DIV, with one minute of recording/ session. The signals (local ield potential, LFP) were iltered and analyzed for network synchronization using the simultaneous departure from equilibrium (SDE) method. SDE is deined as the absolute value of the logarithmic ratio of valid electrodes whose LFP is higher or lower than their mean activity at a given time-point. A higher value of SDE represents greater synchrony. The time series of SDEs from OR and SD hypothalamus were compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. Results: The hypothalamic cultures were viable for more than 30 DIV. Good quality recordings could be obtained from hypothalamic neurons for up to 30 DIV. SDE analysis showed that OR hypothalamus exhibit highly signiicantly desynchronized network activity compared to SD hypothalamus for all sessions (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results support that enhanced sleep quality, orexin sensitivity and obesity-resistance in OR rats is associated with desynchronized network activity, indicating a higher degree of freedom in neural network interactions during development in the hypothalamus, an area critical for sleep and energy homeostasis.

N2  - Mastocytosis is a rare disorder caused by the proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in various organs. It has a broad variety of clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular collapse. Diverse stimuli trigger the release of vasoactive substances and parturients with systemic mastocytosis are at high risk for precipitating mast cell degranulation. As a result, women with systemic mastocytosis should have an anaesthetic plan for labour and delivery. Anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, pain and numerous pharmacological agents are all triggers for mast cell degranulation. For pain relief in labour, epidural analgesia is recommended. Pharmacological agents with a high potential for triggering mast cell degranulation should be avoided. This is particularly important in the case of an emergency caesarean section. Resuscitation equipment must be available should life-threatening haemodynamic instability occur during surgery. We report the case of a pregnant woman with systemic mastocytosis who required emergency caesarean section. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal maternal depression (MDD) as well as the medications to treat MDD are associated with less optimal sleep development. However, little is known about early sleep development under these conditions. This longitudinal study examined fetal and newborn behavioral state in relation to prenatal exposure to MDD and serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRIs). Methods: Pregnant women (N=112; 18-40 years old) were enrolled and interviewed for psychiatric diagnoses and treatment using a semi-structured interview. Fetal behavior and heart rate were recorded at 36 weeks gestational age using ultrasound and fetal actocardiograph monitoring for 40-minutes. Fetal behavioral state was determined by fetal heart rate pattern, activity levels, and recorded behaviors. After delivery, newborns were observed directly for sleep-wake states (40 minutes) and completed a neurobehavioral examination. Generalized Linear Models examined the effects of prenatal MDD (N=20) and/or SRI use (N=37) compared to no exposure (CON; N=55) on fetal and newborn behavioral state. Results: MDD-exposed fetuses spent less time in active sleep in the fetal and newborn period compared to fetuses in the SRI and CON groups (M(SE)=34.8(6.2), 53.5(4.7), and 53.2(3.6)%, respectively; X2=14.7, p<.01). In contrast, MDD-exposed fetuses spent more time in indeterminate state than fetuses in the other two groups (24.1(3.6) vs. 10.2(2.7) and 13.4(2.2)%; X2=10.1, p<.01). SRI-exposed fetuses spent less time in fetal quiet sleep than CON fetuses (M(SE)=1.8(.36) vs 8.3(.50), X2=59.3, p<.001). Time spent in fetal active sleep predicted newborn neurobehavioral scores for arousal and regulation (rho= -.28, p<.004 and rho= .23, p<.02, respectively). Conclusion: Maternal depression during pregnancy and the medications to treat MDD have differential effects on fetal and newborn behavioral state. Fetal behavioral state appears to be related to newborn state and neurobehavioral indices. Future studies will examine the trajectory of behavioral state and neurobehavioral development beyond the newborn period to examine the long-term implications of these indings.

N2  - Introduction: Depression is the most common complication of childbearing. Postpartum Depression (PPD) is significantly undertreated, and more accessible and acceptable prevention approaches are needed. Aims: Building on data showing the profound bi-directionality of emotional/behavioral influences between mother and infant, we developed a novel intervention called PREPP (Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum Parenting). PREPP is based on the conceptualization of PPD as a potential disorder of the dyad; we aim to prevent PPD in at-risk women by promoting maternally-mediated behavioral changes in infants. Methods: In an ongoing RCT, 3rd trimester PPD-at-risk pregnant women (n=50) are assigned to PREPP or TAU. PREPP participants undergo three sessions (coordinated with OB/GYN appointments spanning 3rd trimester to 6-weeks postpartum) focused on (1) behavioral techniques shown to increase infant nocturnal sleep and reduce fuss/cry behavior; (2) mindfulness techniques; and (3), psycho-education. TAU participants receive PPD information. Maternal symptoms are repeatedly evaluated via self-report and clinician-ratings, as is infant neurobehavior (Baby Day Diary and Bayley Scales). To characterize basic brain-behavior processes and biomarkers associated with infant behavior and behavior change, we collect heart rate and movement data from the fetus, and EEG recordings at birth and 16-weeks. Results: By fall 2012, data on PREPP efficacy vs. TAU will be available, as will results examining pathways by which women's elicitation of infant behavioral change may be protective against PPD through (1) increased parenting efficacy and resulting diminished negative self-attributions; (2) improved sense of social support; (3) better maternal sleep; (4) more effective parenting leading to a more responsive/rewarding baby; (5) increased mother-infant attachment. Conclusions: PREPP can have a major impact on the research and standard care of PPD because: (1) the intervention will have high rates of compliance as (a) sessions can be incorporated with usual OB/GYN visits, (b) parenting skills will appeal as a non-psychiatric intervention, (c) the approach will have face validity given the dyadic focus of the perinatal period; (2) its aim is prevention; (3) it fosters maternal and child well-being; (4) it will expand the risk factors for PPD to include perinatal neurobehavioral markers.

N2  - Perinatal mood disorders (e.g., ante- and postpartum depression) are the most common complications of childbearing, affecting 1 out of 5 mothers. When women suffer from depression, their children can experience profound consequences, with risks being detectable as early as birth (e.g., low birth weight). The attachment literature has shown that exposure to postnatal depression makes a significant contribution to insecurity in the attachment relationship (Lyons-Ruth et al., 1996). Depressed mothers are more likely to neglect and abuse their children (Chaffin, 1996), perceive their infants as more bothersome (Whiffen, 1989), and tend to parent with more negative and disengaged behaviours (Lovejoy, 2000). In addition to the risk of maternal depression, a number of other risk factors have been found to impact the maternal-infant attachment relationship, including a maternal history of trauma, parental disharmony, difficult birth experiences, infant sleep/feeding difficulties, poverty, teenage pregnancy, as well as insufficient support. A recent initiative at the Ottawa Regional Perinatal Mental Health Program was to undertake a program evaluation of the services offered in the clinic and evaluate the characteristics of women seen during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Aims: (1) Evaluate the characteristics of pregnant and postpartum women seen in our clinic according to sociodemographic variables, as well as clinical domains of mental health, attachment, and level of functioning; (2) Identify predictors of perinatal depression and maternal attachment. Methods: A descriptive profile of the sociodemographic characteristics was conducted across various time points. Regression analyses were performed to determine the potential differences in level of depressive symptomatology, maternal attachment, and the relationship to other study variables (including infant risk factors, level of functioning, sociodemographic factors, and stressors). Results: A number of risk factors were identified for perinatal depression and problematic maternal attachment both antenatally and postpartum, including severity of depression and poor functioning in life roles. PPD was associated with negative cognitions about motherhood. Childcare stress was associated with greater feelings of hostility in the attachment relationship. Conclusions: Perinatal depression causes enormous distress and suffering, affecting not only the mother but her child as well. Detecting depression and risks in the dyadic interaction early is critical for both mothers and their children.

N2  - Located in a specific psychiatric department in Esquirol Hospital center, Limoges, France, and open since 1995, the unit has received more than 1,000 women. Our staff includes 2 psychiatrists, 1 manager, 1 psychologist, 1 midwife, 1 paediatrician, 2 psychomotor therapists, 13 nurses, 3 paediatricnurses and 1 house cleaner. We provide joint hospitalisation for 4 mothers and babies (up to 5 babies under 12 months) and 2 pregnants women. We also receive mothers and infants (less than 30 months) for sequential care every week. During the day fathers and families are welcome to the unit . Women are hospitalized for psychiatric diseases (depression, psychosis, anxiety, phobia). They need chemical treatment, psychological therapy and support in their relationship with the baby. Every baby has specific care. Mostly, food, sleep and psychomotor disorders are infant developmental disorders, linked to mothers diseases. We cooperate with 8 maternity (about 7500 childbirth/year) to help detecting early psychological symptoms worsen during pregnancy and postpartum period. Moreover, 2 nurses can visit mothers and babies at home or at the place of life babies. A real care network was formed. The unit is the resource center for identification and treatment of mental disorders in perinatal care. All the year, in Limousin region, numerous meetings and trainings with perinatality staffs, help us take the best possible care of mothers and babies in order to improve woman's mental health and baby's becoming.

N2  - Introduction: Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is a condition characterized by periodic limb movements in sleep in absence of an underlying sleep disorder and association with daytime dysfunction (e.g. fatigue or sleepiness). We report the irst case of successful treatment of severe hypersomnia related to PLMD with ropinirole. Report of Case: Ms. X is a 30 year old white female resident physician presenting for evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) of 2 month's duration with Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) of 22. Premorbidly a short sleeper, her sleep duration now averaged 9 hours without morning refreshment. She reported cognitive problems causing academic decline, absenteeism and tardiness at work, and driving dificulty. Her history was otherwise negative for any evidence of narcolepsy/ cataplexy, sleep apnea, Klein Levine syndrome, brain infections or injury, or pregnancy. Medications included luoxetine for premenstrual dysphoria, Desogestrel-Ethinyl Estradiol and cholecalciferol. Physical examination revealed a healthy female with BMI 23.6, Friedman airway 2 and neck circumference 13 inches with normal remainder exam. She underwent PSG (off luoxetine for 4 weeks) which revealed AHI 2.5, PLM index (PLMI) 42.8 and PLM arousal index 4.5; and mean sleep latency test (MSLT) the following day showed mean sleep latency of 5.2 minutes and 1 sleep onset REM period. She was diagnosed with PLMD and started on ropinirole trial titrated to 3 mg over 6 weeks. She reported 90% improvement (ESS=13) in her daytime sleepiness after 6 weeks with reduction in leg kicking evidenced by her boyfriend. A repeat PSG revealed reduction in PLMI to 1.2. Conclusion: Treatment options for PLMD are scarce. The practice parameters published in 2012 did not recommend any drug for PLMD due to insuficient evidence. Due to subjective and objective improvement in PLMD with ropinirole, this case report adds to limited literature on therapeutic options for PLMD associated with EDS.

N2  - The perinatal period is a period of mental health concerns. The challenge for obstetricians is to be able to differentiate adaptative symptoms from real psychopathology. After 10 years of daily multidisciplinary collaboration with psychiatrists and psychologists, the obstetrical team has now a real knowledge of perinatal psychiatric disorders, and is therefore able to develop an active prevention, especially regarding mood disorders. The presentation will discuss the main issues of this preventive work developped by obstetricians and midwives, especially the pregnant women's screening of sleep disorders and social support.

N2  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly lifelong disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and potential for a full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and counseling. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aims: About 10-15 % of women experience depressive symptoms during perinatal period: only a small percentage of cases are identified and treated, with negative consequences on development of the baby and on the mother-baby relationship. We compared two samples of women: the first recruited at the first month of pregnancy, and the second at the first month postpartum. Both groups were followed up to 1 year postpartum. The aim was to investigate risk factors of affective disorders in perinatal period, and the impact of depressive and anxiety symptoms on maternal attachment. Methods: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory- Revised (PDPI-R), Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of Axis I Psychiatric Disorders (SCID-I) and Maternal Antenatal and Postnatal Attachment Scale (MAAS, MPAS) were administered. Results: 271 women recruited at the first month of pregnancy and 130 women recruited at the first month postpartum were compared at the first month postpartum. Postpartum data revealed that women enrolled during postpartum showed more vulnerability to risk factors respect to women enrolled in pregnancy, and had the worst attachment. Women enrolled in pregnancy period seem to perceive more partner, familiar and friend support, with lower difficulties in baby's health, temperament and sleep. Conclusions: Early screening can allow to indentify women at risk to develop psychopathology, improving the possibility of management and treatment with positive consequences on the baby's development and the mother-baby relationship.

N2  - Objective To review the literature on the association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression. Sources A review of literature found on MEDLINE/PubMed database. Summary of findings The literature consistently shows that breastfeeding provides a wide range of benefits for both the child and the mother. The psychological benefits for the mother are still in need of further research. Some studies point out that pregnancy depression is one of the factors that may contribute to breastfeeding failure. Others studies also suggest an association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression; the direction of this association is still unclear. Breastfeeding can promote hormonal processes that protect mothers against postpartum depression by attenuating cortisol response to stress. It can also reduce the risk of postpartum depression, by helping the regulation of sleep and wake patterns for mother and child, improving mother's self-efficacy and her emotional involvement with the child, reducing the child's temperamental difficulties, and promoting a better interaction between mother and child. Conclusions Studies demonstrate that breastfeeding can protect mothers from postpartum depression, and are starting to clarify which biological and psychological processes may explain this protection. However, there are still equivocal results in the literature that may be explained by the methodological limitations presented by some studies. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

N2  - Aims: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Center for Women's Mood Disorders is a clinical and research program specializing in reproductive psychiatric illness. The growth of the program strongly supported the creation of a free-standing Perinatal Psychiatry Inpatient Unit to treat the most severely ill patients. The goals of this new unit are to provide assessment and state-of-the-art treatment for women and their infants with severe mood disorders occurring during pregnancy or postpartum. Methods: The multidisciplinary team provides medication management alongside specialized therapeutic interventions. Therapies include: biofeedback, yoga, art therapy, behavioral therapy, Partner- Assisted Therapy (PAT), mother-infant attachment therapy, mindfulness-based group therapy and psychoeducation for patients, partners or other family members. The program encourages extended visiting hours for partners and babies to maximize positive interaction and critical opportunities for mother-infant bonding. Provisions include: skilled nursing staff, protected sleep times, gliders, in-room nursing pumps and supplies, and a dedicated group dayroom. In order to assess the effectiveness of the programming, we created pre- and post-treatment assessment batteries. The patients complete pre-treatment assessments within 24 h of admission and posttreatment assessments are completed on day of discharge. Domains measured include mood, anxiety, trauma/abuse history, mania, social support, attachment, lactation, medication efficacy and adverse effects of treatment. Measures include: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Patient and Partner Versions (EPDS; EPDS-P), Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire (ACE), Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (ASRM), Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Checklist of Parental Thoughts and Behaviors, Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale, Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ), and Lactation Intensity and Efficacy (LEI). Results: Data from the first year of operation of the unit (August 2011- August 2012) will be presented. Conclusion: The UNC Perinatal Psychiatry Inpatient Unit provides intensive psychiatric care in a setting that encourages extensive interaction between mother and baby to promote attachment. Specialized and targeted interventions appropriate for the perinatal period have been developed. Program evaluation is being carried out by pre- and post-treatment assessment instruments to monitor patient treatment response and service satisfaction.

N2  - Aims: This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. Methods: In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. Results: When MDMA was a 'novel psychoactive substance', it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost-benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Conclusions: The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological deficits still emerging. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - This presentation is a reflection on clinical practice in working with depressed parents who find their toddler's behaviour particularly challenging. She works in a community based Perinatal and Infant Mental Health Service (PIMH) where service delivery includes counselling and group programs. Most of the clients experience high prevalence disorders such as depression and/or anxiety. Women usually present in the first year of their infant's life with depression or anxiety to the Community-based PIMH Service. In a subsequent pregnancy they may re-present either to (hopefully) prevent a relapse of perinatal mental illness or because they are symptomatic. Often the firstborn is a toddler and may be identified, by the mother, as having particularly challenging behaviour especially after the birth of another baby. The mother may find it very difficult to parent this toddler with positive emotions. Toddlers have a number of developmental tasks to achieve including independence, mobility, language development, regulation of affect and aggression as well as development of self awareness (Mares et al., 2011). While many parents struggle with this toddler life stage women who are depressed have additional challenges. Depression can result in a range of symptoms including irritability, lack of energy, adhedonia, fatigue, negative thinking, sleep difficulties, sense of worthlessness and slowed thinking. If they also have an infant to care for there may be additional complexities and expectations of the toddler. The combination of depression and toddler life stage are explored in this presentation with reference to the literature and by reflecting on clinical experiences in an Australian PIMH Service. Three case presentations will be included to demonstrate strategies in working with such families.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing of hospital discharge, time to outpatient follow-up, and home care practices (breastfeeding initiation and continuation, tobacco smoke exposure, supine sleep position) for late-preterm (LPT; 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) and earlyterm (ET; 37 0/7-38/6/7 weeks) infants with term infants. METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. x2 Analyses were used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT and ET infants compared with term infants. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants, whereas there was no difference for ET infants (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]). LPT and ET infants were more likely to have timely outpatient follow-up (1.07 [1.06-1.08]; 1.02 [1.02- 1.03]), more likely to experience maternal tobacco smoke exposure (1.09 [1.05-1.14]; 1.08 [1.06-1.11]), less likely to be initially breastfed (0.95 [0.94-0.97]; 0.98 [0.97-0.98]), less likely to be breastfed for $10 weeks (0.88 [0.86-0.90]; 0.94 [0.93-0.96]), and less likely to be placed in a supine sleep position (0.95 [0.93-0.97]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Given that LPT and ET infants bear an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, greater efforts are needed to ensure safe and healthy posthospitalization and home care practices for these vulnerable infants.

N2  - There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype. The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145 (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 ± 4.4 d) than among morning (27.7 ± 2.6 d; p < 0.01) and intermediate (27.8 ± 3.3 d; p = 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p < 0.001) and after limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p < 0.01) as well as a higher odds for difficulties in getting pregnant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.464, 95% CI = 1.118 to 1.917; p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the reproductive function in women. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common childbirth complication, which can have negative effects on both the newly delivered woman and her family. This condition is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, while a biological diagnostic test is not yet available. Furthermore, postpartum thyroid dysfunction is common among new mothers, and some evidence point to an association between PPD and thyroid function disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between serum levels of thyroid hormones at the time of delivery, and the later development of depressive symptoms, using data from a population based cohort of Swedish women. Blood samples were collected during delivery from 347 participating women, delivering at Uppsala University Hospital. The participating women filled in at least one of three structured questionnaires, containing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), at five days, six weeks and six months postpartum. A cut-off of 12 or more was applied on the EPDS, to identify cases of self-reported PPD and controls. Using a binary logistic regression model (adjusting for previous psychiatric contact, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and sleep), having a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level over the clinical cut-off level of 4.0. mU/L was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms at six months postpartum (OR 11.30, 95% CI 1.93-66.11). A ROC analysis revealed that the predictive variable (PV) had significant predictive ability for PPD at 6 months postpartum, given that the AUC was 0.764, and at a PV cut-off value of 6.33, the sensitivity and specificity were 76.2% and 69.4%, respectively. If these findings are replicated in future studies, they can have important clinical implications, since TSH determination is an inexpensive routine blood test, and its inclusion in a biological screening test for PPD involving other parameters would be tempting. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The authors sought to examine the association between sleep disorders and race/ethnicity in both pregnant and non-pregnant women of child-bearing age. Self-reported health and sleep characterestics collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2010 were used to conduct this secondary analysis. The present study sample included 3,875 non-pregnant and 507 pregnant women from 15 to 44 years of age. The association between sleep disorders and race/ethnicity was examined using both univariate and multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age, body mass index, marital status, education, and other confounding variables. In non-pregnant women, the prevalence of trouble sleeping was 22.30% among Mexican-American women, 22.31% among non-Hispanic white women, and 23.05% among non-Hispanic black women; in pregnant women, the prevalences were 17.43%, 29.41%, and 14.55%, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, the significantly decreased risk of trouble sleeping in pregnant Mexican-American and non-Hispanic black women when compared to pregnant non-Hispanic white women persisted, with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 0.415 (95% confidence interval 0.173, 0.993) and 0.204 (0.064, 0.647), respectively. Among non-pregnant women, risk did not differ by race/ethinicity (aORs 1.014 [0.758, 1.357] and 1.006 [0.757, 1.337], respectively).We conclude that trouble sleeping is associated with race/ethnicity among pregnant women, but not non-pregnant women, of childbearing age.

Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to examine the association between sleep disorders and hypertension and to adjust for age, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, and other confounding variables. The overall prevalence of having trouble sleeping, sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea and insomnia), and daily sleep <7 hours was 23.5%, 7.0%, and 29.0% in pregnant women; and 21.9%, 6.7%, and 37.7% in non-pregnant women. In pregnant women, women who had trouble sleeping, sleep disorders, and daily sleep <7 hours were at increased risk of having hypertension, with adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0- 6.3], 4.6 (1.4-14.7), and 1.09 (0.5-2.5), respectively. In non-pregnant women, women who had trouble sleeping, sleep disorders, and daily sleep <7 hours were also at increased risk of having hypertension, with aOR of 2.9 (2.2-3.8), 4.1 (2.5-6.7), and 1.6 (1.2-1.9), respectively. The authors conclude that sleep disorders are associated with an increasd risk of hypternsion in both pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age.

N2  - Background & Objective: There are conflicting reports regarding circadian variation in the onset of spontaneous labor (sPTL) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) leading to spontaneous preterm births (sPTB). We modeled participant reported time of sPTL and PPROM onset leading to sPTB. Methods:We used multiple parametric and non-parametric methods including trigonometric regression and piecewise cubic splines in generalized linear models to model the circadian variation in sPTL and PPROM onset among 476 women with singleton pregnancies in Lima, Peru. Subgroup analyses were performed according to selected maternal and newborn characteristics. Results: A statistically significant morning peak was seen among all sPTB and this was similar for births preceded by sPTL or PPROM. A clear aggregation of SPTL and PPROM onset was noted between 6-10am (42% of cases) with a smaller peak between 5-10pm. The patterns of sPTL and PPROM onset were similar across groupings of gestational age at delivery, fetal gender, parity, maternal prepregnancy weight, educational attainment and maternal age. Discussion: Circadian rhythms modulate physiologic processes and the timing of several medical disorders, including cortisol and oxytocin secretion, myocardial infarction, stroke, and even time of death. The biological rhythm of sPTL and PPROM onset appears to be aligned with the diurnal variation in cortisol secretion. Greater understanding of circadian rhythms in pregnancy and parturition may yield important insights into the pathophysiologic processes underlying the mechanisms of preterm births.

N2  - Use of alternative health practices, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), in the US is prevalent, and women of childbearing age are the most frequent users of CAM. Nearly four million women give birth in the US every year; however, little is known about the extent to which CAM is used by women during pregnancy and childbirth. Limited evidence suggests growth in CAM use as well as alternative approaches to managing perinatal symptoms and conditions, including nausea, sleep problems, and pain during labor. To date, there has been no comprehensive examination of the alternative health practices women choose or the CAM therapies being used by women during pregnancy and childbirth. Our objective was to use existing data to document current knowledge on alternative health practice use, including CAM, during the perinatal period. We assessed the extent to which publicly available survey data could be used for perinatal CAM research. Data sources examined include: National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), and Listening to Mothers Survey (LTM). We highlight strengths and limitations of existing national surveys for examining CAM use among women of childbearing age and specifically during pregnancy and childbirth. Cross-survey comparisons are made for prevalence, types, and reasons for CAM use with respect to availability of public use data, sample size, and variable detail. We also summarize available measures of conventional health services and health outcomes for each survey. Emphasis is on data source tradeoffs between availability of CAM measures, ability to examine integration of conventional medicine and alternative health practices, and potential for perinatal outcomes research. We offer recommendations for alternative health services data collection to enhance understanding of CAM use during pregnancy and childbirth.

N2  - Little is known about immediate causes of spontaneous preterm delivery. We sought to identify triggers using a case-crossover design. We enrolled 50 women with preterm labor (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital between September 2011 and June 2012. We enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as onset of PTL/PPROM (for case subjects) or interview (for control subjects). Detailed information was collected through structured interviews about factors of interest in the 72 hours preceding the index time. We compared the frequency of transient factors from case (0-24 hours before index time) and control (48-72 hours before) windows within case subjects. Both chronic and transient characteristics were compared between case and control subjects. Matched odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with conditional logistic regression. PTL/ PPROM onset appeared to be related to circadian patterns. We confirmed previously hypothesized associations of chronic risk factors with spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, which were more common in cases than controls. Within cases, skipped meals (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.2-15.2), disturbed sleep (4.5; 1.5-13.3), sexual activity (6.0; 0.7- 69.8) and spicy food (7.0; 1.6-30.8) were associated with increased risk in the following 24 hours. For other triggers evaluated, including physical exertion, the OR was close to the null. Due to few discordant pairs, confidence intervals were wide. Lost appetite and disturbed sleep may predict imminent preterm delivery; sexual activity may trigger preterm delivery in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies may adequately assess the impact of modifiable triggers on spontaneous preterm delivery and help guide obstetrical care.

N2  - Introduction: All newborns have crying phases in their first 3 months as an expression of their adaption to extra-uterine life. Symptoms are normally well interpreted by parents and also self limited. Some 10% of otherwise healthy newborns present with extensive crying. Parents are severely concerned and extremely disturbed. The consequence is a change in binding pattern, severe sleep deprivation and eventually harm to the child. Since 5 years we run an interdisciplinary short stay inpatient and ambulatory care program at the Triemli hospital in Zurich in order to unburden and support families with extensive crying infants (TIKSS). Methods: We analyzed the data sheets of parents and children who were participating in the years 2008-2010 in the Triemli program for extensive crying babies (TIKSS) and sent also questionnaires to the parents. We analyzed risk factors including age of parents, number of child, socio-economic status, educational status of the mother, pattern of birth and psychosocial stress factors. Parents were asked also for the immediate and prolonged impact of the intervention. Results: We found 3 major risk factors: 1) Missing familial and social network both for families with migration and highly educated background leading to a golden cage of the nuclear family. Most parents suffered from lack of support and understanding of the their educational problems. 2) Primiparas in their third decade, who planned their child and wanted to just perfectly organize their project. 3) Mothers, who had a lack of sleep in the third trimester of pregnancy or who had an unplanned C- section. All of these factors resulted in a disturbed binding pattern and often in an misunderstanding of the needs of the newborn baby. Conclusion Having this outcome, we developed a semi-structured questionnaire and risk stratification sheet for parents and children at risk.We propose that midwives, nurses and pediatricians should be sensitized to these risk factors. Families at risk should be early detected by using semistructured questionnaires and referred to specialised ambulatory centers in order to avoid unnecsessary suffering for the parents and dangerous situations for the infants.

N2  - Objective: To describe the trends in hospital admissions associated with obesity as a primary diagnosis and comorbidity, and bariatric surgery procedures among children and young people in England. Design: National time trends study of hospital admissions data between 2000 and 2009. Participants: Children and young people aged 5 to 19 years who were admitted to hospital with any diagnosis of obesity. Main outcome measures: Age- and sex-specific admission rates per million children. Results: Between 2000 and 2009, age- and sex-specific hospital admission rates in 5-19 year olds for total obesity-related diagnoses increased more than four-fold from 93.0 (95% CI 86.0 to 100.0) per million children to 414.0 (95% CI 410.7 to 417.5) per million children, largely due to rising admissions where obesity was mentioned as a co-morbidity. The median age of admission to hospital over the study period was 14.0 years; 5,566 (26.7%) admissions were for obesity and 15,319 (73.3%) mentioned obesity as a comorbidity. Admissions were more common in girls than boys (56.2% v 43.8%). The most common reasons for admission where obesity was a comorbid condition were sleep apnoea, asthma, and complications of pregnancy. The number of bariatric surgery procedures has risen from 1 per year in 2000 to 31 in 2009, with the majority were performed in obese girls (75.6%) aged 13-19 years. Conclusions: Hospital admission rates for obesity and related comorbid conditions have increased more than four-fold over the past decade amongst children and young people. Although some of the increase is likely to be due to improved case ascertainment, conditions associated with obesity in children and young people are imposing greater challenges for health care providers in English hospitals. Most inpatient care is directed at dealing with associated conditions rather than primary assessment and management of obesity itself. © 2013 Jones Nielsen et al.

N2  - Objective: Desynchronizations in circadian rhythms are known to be associated with both onset and recurrence of mood disorders [e.g. Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)]. Pregnancy is often marked with changes in circadian rhythms, but no previous studies have investigated the association between alterations in circadian rhythms during pregnancy and development of postpartum depression (PPD). Despite the multitude of studies on psychosocial risk factors for PPD, very little is known about the neurobiology behind PPD. The objective of the present study is to prospectively investigate whether changes in circadian rhythms from late pregnancy to early postpartum are associated with higher risk for PPD. Methods: Twenty-one women have completed the study and were included in this preliminary analysis (6 with MDD, 2 with BD and 13 matched controls; mean age= 28.5, age range= 19-39). All women except one were medication-free (one MDD subject was using citalopram). Circadian rhythms and clinical assessments were carried out during the third trimester of pregnancy (>26 weeks) and between 6 and 12 weeks postpartum. Diagnostic assessment was done using The MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Circadian rhythms were assessed through the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). To assess severity of mood symptoms, the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) were used. Results: Changes in BRIAN scores from late pregnancy to early postpartum (delta) were correlated with changes in EPDS scores (rP = 0.53; p = 0.01). There was no correlation between changes in BRIAN and MADRS (rP = 0.16; p = 0.46) or YMRS scores (rP = 0.06; p = 0.76). Discussion: These preliminary results indicate that circadian rhythm disruption may be associated with increased risk for development of PPD. Considering that PPD is associated with poor health and safety outcomes not only for mothers but also for their babies, more attention should be paid to alterations in circadian rhythms during this vulnerable period of women's reproductive life.

N2  - Introduction The last trimester of pregnancy is marked by deterioration in the state of sleep. Also, a high incidence of insomnia is reportedly observed among hospitalized patients. This study aims to shed light on the influence that being hospitalized has on the quality of sleep by comparing the sleep of pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy living at home and those staying in the hospital. Method Pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy who were hospitalized to receive treatment for threatened premature labor between September and October of 2011 and those who live at home and received prenatal care at a maternity clinic during the same period were asked to complete a questionnaire (attributes, living environment, state of sleep), take a Japanese version of the STAI test, keep a sleep diary, and wear an Actiwatch. The results were collected either in person or by having them mailed by the subjects. Mini Mitter's Actiware ver. 3.4 was chosen for the Actiwatch used in the study to compute sleep parameters. Results Pregnant women who were hospitalized scored significantly higher on the state anxiety score than those who were living at home (p<0.05). Sleep parameters showed a tendency of prolonged latency to sleep onset on the part of hospitalized pregnant women compared to pregnant women who lived at home. Hospitalized pregnant women woke up and got out of bed significantly earlier than pregnant women who lived at home (p<0.05). Furthermore, there were no distinctive differences in the quality of sleep based on a difference in the type of hospital room, nature of treatments given, and the number of days stayed at the hospital. “Sleeping position” and “worries” were named as the reasons for having difficulty falling asleep by both hospitalized pregnant women and those living at home. The reasons given for waking up in the middle of sleep were “to go to the bathroom” and “to change the sleeping position.” Pregnant women who were hospitalized also mentioned “nurses making the rounds” as a reason for having difficulty falling asleep and waking up in the middle of sleep. Conclusion It is conceivable that the abrupt change from daily life, the fear of premature labor, and concerns about the state of fetal growth intensified the anxiety and led to high anxiety scores for hospitalized pregnant women. Further, it is surmised that the intensified anxiety prolonged the onset of sleep. The study results also suggested that the nightly rounds of nurses and temperature measurements early in the morning affected the quality of sleep of hospitalized pregnant women.

N2  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Case A 27-year-old female with BMI of 28.3 was booked under midwifery care. At 37 + 4 weeks, she was admitted with BP 150/ 100 mmHg, episode of reduced fetal movements and increased symphysio-fundal-height. She had gained 31 kg in her pregnancy increasing her BMI to 39.3. A routine CTG while the patient was asleep and snoring showed a decrease in fetal baseline heart rate with audible deceleration to 48 bpm. Patient was woken up and the fetal heart rate recovered to a rate of 120 bpm after 2.5 min and slowly recovered to previous baseline over 8 min. Pulse oximetry showed maternal oxygen desaturation to 86% during this episode increasing to 98% during normal breathing. As the patient was term, Labour was induced due to concerns about fetal well-being. Continuous CTG showed no further significant bradycardic episodes. Patient had a vaginal delivery of a male infant weighing 3.8 kg with umbilical cord arterial pH of 7.15; BE-2.8 mEq/L. Discussion Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the most common sleep-disordered breathing in young and obese women. The existence of this condition in pregnancy is often overlooked. OSA in pregnancy was first reported in 1978. Pregnant women suffering from OSA complain of increased snoring, sudden awakenings with gasping, excessive daytime sleepiness. Reported feto-maternal risks associated with OSA include pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, IUGR, stillbirth and acute events such as fetal heart rate decelerations. Berlin questionnaire and Epworth scales are commonly employed screening methods, while Polysomnography remains the definitive diagnostic tool for OSA. The severity of OSA is assessed by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and there is some evidence that pregnancy complications increase as the AHI rises. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been successfully used on pregnant mothers suffering from OSA. Conclusion We therefore, suggest having a high index of suspicion of OSA in obese pregnant women and formulate a mechanism to identify OSA in the antenatal period to decrease risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

N2  - Objective: Sleep disorders are common complaints of women during pregnancy. These disorders are the result of physiological, hormonal, physical changes, affecting before, during, and right after pregnancy. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of pregnant women with sleep disorders in the second trimester. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, data was collected with continuous sampling method. A total of 100 pregnant women with sleep disturbances in their second trimesters were recruited in this study. The participant referred to two elected health centers in West Azerbaijan University of Medical Science (One and three numbers of health care centers) in order to get prenatal care in the city of Maku, West Azerbaijan, Iran. The data was gathered using the personal information forms and the questionnaires, prepared by the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL: BREF). To analyze the collected data, different statistical methods, like frequency tables, Pearson, Spearman and ANOVA were applied. Results: The results indicate that the mean sleep quality is 8.62 ± 2.81 in pregnant women with sleep disorders or poor quality of sleep in the second trimester. Quality of life (p ≤ 0.03) and one of domains, including psychological health (p ≤ 0.02) related to quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given that a large percentage of women suffer from sleep disorders in pregnancy, we hope during this period, in addition to usual care, codified programs is done to evaluate, detection and Diagnosis of this disorder.

Discovery of some correlation between sleep disorders and complicated pregnancy is one of a new task both for obstetrics and for new perspective directions in medicine - sleep medicine. So, we were studied influence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) to development of pregnancy complications, fetal and newborn status. Patients, Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis on data of 246 pregnant women. Mean of our patients was 30,5 ± 5,3 years. Polysomnography (PSG) was done in all of them in term of 34-37 weeks of pregnancy using GRASSTELEFACTOR Twin PSG system with As 40 booster and integrated sleep module (USA). During each PSG we performed fetal monitoring Touti - 320 device. We used ultrasonography (Philips IU22 (Japan) for studying of placental and fetal circulation. Assessment of the neonatal status was performed by standard methods. All differences were considered significant at p<0,05. Results: Based on PSG conclusions, two patient's groups were formed. The 1st one is the pregnant women with SDB (n-158) and the 2nd one is the ladies with normal PSG (n-88). Fetal monitoring was normal in 48,4 % pregnant women of the 1st group and in 72,7 % of the 2nd one. In the 1st group mean fetal heart rate was 154,20 ± 1,27/min and in the 2nd was 143,61 ± 1,11/min, oscillation amplitude was 6,91 ± 0,51 and 9,24 ± 0,44, oscillation rate was 7,1 ± 0,11 and 8,13 ± 0,35/min and fetal movement amount per 30 seconds were 14,6 ± 1,3 and 11,8 ± 1,1, correspondingly (p<0,05). Placental insufficiency was detected in 55 cases (34,39 %) of the 1st group and in 12 (13,6 %) cases of the 2nd group. Features of chronic intrauterine hypoxia were totally found in 76 (30,61%) of all patients; in 60 (37,58%) women of the 1st group and 16 (18,18%) women of the 2nd group (p<0,05). Premature deliveries were registered in 43 (27,2%) of pregnant women with SDB and in 16 (10,3%) - without SDB (p<0.05). After the first minute Apgar scoring we found in the 1st group 6 (3,8%) newborns with asphyxia. Apgar score 'Seven' had 39 (24,2%) newborns of the 1st group and 8 (9,09%) of the 2nd one (p<0,05). Mean newborn body weight was 2942 ± 187,6 grams in the 1st group and 3618 ± 184,4 grams in the 2nd one (p<0,05). Conclusion: There are a few researches of links between sleep disorders and pregnancy complications. Our study shows possibility such kind of correlations. It should be underline that we found the deviations of fetal monitoring data in every fourth and placental insufficiency and preterm deliveries in every third woman with SDB. It could mean that fetuses were underwent hypoxia during of apnea episodes in mothers. Thus, SDB in pregnancy require timely no-medication correction, individual approaches to pregnancy and delivery management of in this group of women.

N2  - Objectives: To report the efficacy of peripheral nerve blocks in the treatment of short-lasting unilateral neuralgi-form headache with conjunctival injection and tearing(SUNCT). Background: SUNCT is a rare headache syndrome that has been associated with pituitary adenomas, especially those secreting prolactin or growth hormone. The observations of headache resolution following tumor resection and with the use of dopamine agonists suggest a role of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis regulation in the pathophy-siology of the syndrome. No medical treatment has been universally effective and most agents used raise concerns during pregnancy. Cases in the literature of treatment with greater occipital nerve stimulation or blocks show either conflicting results or afford only temporary benefit. Methods: A 32 year old woman with history of migraine since childhood developed amenorrhea and persistent galactorrhea immediately following her first pregnancy. She had elevated prolactin and was diagnosed as having a right-sided pituitary macroadenoma (prolactinoma). Upon initiation of cabergoline (0.25mg) she developed frequent ipsilateral attacks of SUNCT. The tumor was resected with immediate resolution of the headaches. Two weeks later she became pregnant again with almost immediate recurrence of the same, brief (up to 30 seconds) attacks of abrupt onset headache in the right periorbital, frontal and temporal regions with radiation to the neck, associated with conjunctival injection, tearing and nasal congestion. Evaluation for tumor recurrence with non-contrast MRI showed no gross postsurgical changes. The headaches were of increasing frequency and severity and by week l3 of gestation they recurred every 5 minutes and persisted during sleep. A series of peripheral nerve blocks were performed. Results: Consecutive 0.5% bupivicaine nerve blocks ofthe right occipital, supraorbital, supratrochlear and auriculo-temporal nerves, as well as an ultrasound guided occipital nerve block offered temporary (4-5 hours), but almost complete pain relief. Short courses of prednisone and use of oxycodone/ acetaminophen for breakthrough pain decreased the frequency, duration and severity of attacks. She underwent right occipital nerve radio frequency thermo-coagulation (RFTC) (l20 second - 0.5 A pulses). One week later, and while off steroids and opioids, she experienced significant pain relief lasting one week and followed by an exacerbation. She is currently at 23 weeks of gestation and we will follow her clinical course to delivery, expected in May of 20l3. Conclusions: Our patient demonstrates the complex association between hypothalamo-pituitary hormonal changes and SUNCT, as well as the challenges in identifying optimal treatment. This is the first case report of ipsilateral greater occipital nerve pulsed RFTC under ultrasound guidance for SUNCT, offering substantial, but brief benefit.

N2  - Study question: Is there an association between working outside normal working hours and reproductive outcome? Summary answer: Working mixed-shift patterns (evenings, and alternating or changing shifts which may include nights) was associated with an increased rate of menstrual irregularity and an increased rate of subfertility. This was not seen in women who worked only nights, but there was an association with an increased rate of miscarriage. What isknownalready: Themajority ofwomenhave paidemployment and often in shifts; a recognized risk factor for health and social well-being. Shift workers adopt poor sleep hygiene, suffer sleep deprivation and develop activity levels that are de-synchronised from their circadian rhythm. These have been associated with an increased risk of pathologies, including neoplastic disease and metabolic syndrome. Little is known about the impact of shift working on early reproductive health and fecundity. Study design, size, duration: A meta-analysis was performed and included studies published between June 1985 and January 2013. It assessed the impact of non-standard working schedules (including night-shift work and mixed-shift patterns) compared with normal day time work patterns, on reproductive outcome parameters (menstrual regularity, female fertility and miscarriage rates). Participants/materials, setting, methods: We searched and reviewed abstracts of all relevant studies with a cohort or case-control design using Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PUBMED. Sixteen studies were included, reporting on 121929 women. Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated using fixed- or random-effectsmodels.AnalyseswereperformedusingReviewManagerversion5.1. Main results and the role of chance: Compared with those who worked days, women working mixed shift patterns (evenings, and alternating or changing shifts which may include nights) had an increased rate of menstrual irregularity (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.25-1.41) and an increased rate of subfertility as measured by an increased time-to-pregnancy (OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.02-1.24). Women who worked only nights did not have a statistically increased risk of menstrual disruption (OR 1.68, 95%CI 0.71-3.97) nor difficulty conceiving (OR 1.35, 95%CI 0.93-1.97). However, women who worked only night shifts had an increased rate of miscarriage (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.14-1.54). This increased risk of miscarriage was not observed in women who worked nights as part of a mixed shift pattern (OR 0.95, 95%CI 0.87-1.05). Limitations, reason for caution: The vast majority of studies relied upon selfreported data on shift patterns and the reproductive outcome. Confounding cannot be excluded without randomized controlled trials to evaluate the impact of sleep disruption on female reproduction, and these cannot be performed. There may be publication bias towards positive findings. Wider implications of the findings: The adverse health impacts of shift work in early reproductive functioning is novel but in-keeping with findings of later pregnancy outcomes. If replicated, our findings have implications for women attempting to become pregnant as well as employers. The brain and peripheral tissues have an inherent ability to maintain physiological 24-hour oscillations and biological cycling on a systemic and cellularlevel. Future research should investigate ways of modulating the dysregulation of circadian rhythms by disruptive working-patterns.

N2  - Objective: We report on 2 pregnant women, who suffered either from de novo restless legs syndrome (RLS), or had marked enhancement of pre-existing RLS symptoms during pregnancy - both with ferritin values below 50 mg/l at “baseline”. Background: Epidemiological data show a higher prevalence of RLS in pregnancy. A consensus on the treatment of RLS in pregnancy does not exist, as no safety data from large prospective studies in pregnancy for the presently approved pharmacotherapy for RLS are available. Methods: The patients had relevant sleep disorders and daytime symptoms, caused by RLS. They were treated in an open paradigm with intravenous iron sucrose. Results: A few weeks after therapy they experienced a significant reduction or even remission of RLS symptoms. Their quality of life and sleep substantially improved and no treatment related adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: According to our initial experience intravenous iron sucrose administration appear to be an effective therapy in RLS patients with low ferritin values during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction Cushing's Syndrome is an extremely rare condition diagnosed during pregnancy so far only 150 cases have been described worldwide in the literature. Increased secretion of cortisol leads to increase protein catabolism, increase gluconeogenesis, and redistribution of body fat. Hypercortisolism affects ovarian function and may be a cause of infertility. The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is made based on clinical, laboratory and radiological tests. The diagnosis may be difficult due to central obesity, abdominal striae, hypertension and glucose intolerance, which is often observed in physiological pregnancy. For timely diagnosis and adequate treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach to the experts in the field of endocrinology, gynecology, and endocrine surgery. Patient: Twenty year old pregnant woman, grav 2 pairs of 2 hbd 25, arrived from the local hospital to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, because of rapidly developed high blood pressure, swelling of legs and back pain, which occurred a few weeks before admission to the hospital. The patient objectively was hypertensive, obese with severe hirsutism and severe stretch marks on the skin of the abdomen. During hospitalization, the necessary ndocrine and radiological examinations were done in the direction of proving the cause of hypercortisolism. Elevated basal cortisol level, the absence of circadian rhythm of cortisol and ACTH levels decreased indicated the Cushing's syndrome. After abdominal ultrasound and NMR was observed right adrenal adenoma. GYnecologists completed this pregnancy with Cesarean section in 32 GN till endocrine surgegy done right adrenalectomy. Pregnancy women delived live and healthy female infant, with no signs of postpartum hypocortisolism.The patient was a regular postoperative time, discarged from hospital in good general condition. Conclusion: The case shows the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of Syndroma Cushing in pregnancy and to for the successful completion of the pregnancy.

N2  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Over 25,000 epileptic women deliver viable pregnancies each year in the United States. Although medical management is the first line of treatment, many physiological changes associated with pregnancy can make optimal treatment challenging. Medication dosage is adjusted based on side effects and seizure frequency, with the goal being no seizures with the lowest medication dosage(s) and side-effect profile possible. Whenever possible, monotherapy is preferred. Many antiepileptic drugs have teratogenic potential, so preconceptional optimization of medication dosage(s) is recommended. Epilepsy has associated neurological comorbidities, the most common being migraines and sleep disorders. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Introduction In England, obstetric cholestasis (OC) affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multiethnic populations. OC is a multi-factorial condition of pregnancy characterised by unexplained pruritus, absence of skin rash with abnormal liver function tests (LFT's) and/or raised bile acids which resolve after delivery. Other causes of itching and liver dysfunction need exclusion by performing a viral screen for hepatitis A, B, C, EBV, CMV, liver autoimmune screen for chronic active hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis and a liver ultrasound scan. Poor outcome cannot be predicted by biochemistry results, however raised bile acids are linked with fetal death. The clinical importance of OC is the fetal risk of spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth and associated maternal morbidity from intense pruritus with subsequent sleep deprivation. In a hospital setting the risk of stillbirth in OC above that of the general population is likely to be small. Studies between 2001 and 2011 showed a perinatal mortality rate of 4 deaths in 697 pregnancies. Objectives Compliance with RCOG Green top guideline on Obstetric Cholestasis (April 2011). Method Retrospective case note analysis performed during 2008- 2010. Eighty cases with a clinical diagnosis of cholestasis were identified through the database. Sixty-six notes were reviewed for investigations performed, delivery and postnatal management and then collated on a spreadsheet. One patient had chronic fatty liver, and three notes were incorrectly labelled and were therefore excluded from the study. Re-audit was completed 6 months later. Results Sixty-two patients in total. Forty-four percent patients were between 25 and 29 years of age, range 15-44 years. The incidence in primigravida and multigravida was 40% and 60% respectively. Twenty-one percent had previous cholestasis, 44% had ALT >100 IU/L, 16% did not have bile acids performed, 85% had hepatitis serology completed. Forty-nine percent had anti mitochondrial and anti smooth muscle antibody tested, 71% had normal and 2% abnormal liver ultrasound scan. Thirty-two percent had caesarean section, 11% instrumental delivery and 57% spontaneous delivery. Mean gestation was 37-37+6 and 52% birth weight 3-3.5 kg. Thirty-five percent patients had postnatal LFT's, 6% had postnatal counselling. Conclusions Greater awareness of OC is essential for earlier recognition and better management. It is imperative for antenatal and postnatal counselling, postnatal LFT's at 6 weeks to enable pertinent management strategies. Re-audit 6 months later, following training of junior doctors and midwives showed 90% adherence to RCOG guidelines for recommended investigations performed in OC.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the “natural history” of idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS) by means of a structured questionnaire with 17 questions. Methods: One hundred and fifty (150) patients with iRLS attending the Sleep Disorders Center of the San Raffaele hospital of Milan were consecutively enrolled. Eighty-four (56 %) women, 66 (44 %) men, age: 60.3 ± 14.38, age at onset 44.5 ± 17.66, IRLS 23.9 ± 6.42, PLMI 41.0 ± 48.21, ESS 6.7 ± 4.66, ferritin level 98.5 ± 121.14. Secondary forms of RLS were excluded on the basis of clinical history data and neurologic examination. Results: Twenty-one percent of patients reported RLS age onset between 46-55 years, 19 % between 36-45 years and 15 % between 26-35 years. No family history for RLS in 45 % of this sample was recorded, while 42 % of patients reported a parent with RLS. Twentythree percent of RLS patients had never had any problems with sleep, while 21 % had had sleep problems in the past 10 years. Among patients who had had sleep disturbances before the onset of RLS (57 %), 85 % suffered from insomnia. Thirty-seven percent of subjects reported symptoms of RLS to be “sporadic” at onset, 30 % “fluctuating”, and 15 % “intermittent”.At onset, 46 % of subjects reported the severity of RLS symptoms to be “mild”.The frequency of symptoms at onset was reported to be ≤1/week in 65 % of patients, 2-3/week in 23 %, and more than 3 times/week in 12 % of patients. In 73 % of patients symptoms tended to worsen over time and only in 19 % they were stable. In 29 % of patients, approximately 3-5 years occurred between RLS onset and diagnosis/treatment. In 73 % of subjects therapy remained stable. Thirty-five percent of subjects took only 1 drug for RLS treatment, 29 % 2 drugs, ≥3 drugs were used by 22 % of patients. At the time of this study, 69 % of subjects reported RLS symptoms more than 3 times/week. The intensity of the symptoms was “moderate” in 55 % and “severe” in 28 %. Forty percent of women had no pregnancies, 27 % had one pregnancy and 29 % had two pregnancies; 66 % of women reported no variations on RLS symptoms during pregnancy, 10 % a “mild” worsening, another 10 % a “moderate” worsening while 6 % complained a “severe” worsening. Conclusion: Despite the availability of drugs believed to be effective in RLS and their regular use in the majority of patients the RLS symptoms tend to persist. This points to the need of the development of new and more effective therapeutic strategies.

N2  - Background Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological condition producing disruption to normal sleep pattern resulting into excessive daytime somnolence. Approximately 80% of the patients with narcolepsy suffer from cataplexy (involuntary loss of muscle tone). The management of this disorder in pregnancy and mode of delivery is scarce in the literature. We report a case of successful vaginal delivery in a patient with this disorder with uneventful intrapartum and postpartum course. Case Report A 23-year-old nulliparous patient was referred to the antenatal clinic at 6 weeks of gestation. She was diagnosed with cataplexy and narcolepsy in September 2011 following her complaint of excessive day-time somnolence and sudden loss of muscle tone during activity such as laughing and release of emotion. Her symptoms were controlled on Modafinil 400 mg and Venlafaxine 150 mg daily prepregnancy but changed to Clomipramine 10 mg daily during pregnancy. Pregnancy progressed well apart from the increased symptoms of cataplexy. Patient presented to the labour ward at 37 weeks of gestation with history of ruptured membranes and progressed to a spontaneous vertex delivery of a live male baby within 3 h of admission without any complication. NAS scoring was carried out on the baby and with follow-up plan with the Neurology team. Discussion It is worth noting that our patient's symptoms were controlled with Clomipramine and she progressed well in the pregnancy with no complication. Due to the risk of labourinduced cataplexy, it is advisable to discuss the mode of delivery with this patient and offer them elective caesarean section under regional analgesia. However prior to the patient's anaesthetic review and MDT plan she went into labour and progressed to delivery of a normal vaginal delivery at 37 weeks within 3 h of admission. There was no complication in labour or post-delivery. Conclusion It is our view that patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy can have normal vaginal delivery and antenatal counselling should be evidenced based with input from the neurologist, anaesthetist, paediatrician and midwives. The patient and the family should be involved in any decision making process and supported to ensure a favourable outcome.

N2  - Night shift work has been thought to play a role in the etiology of chronic diseases through a disruption of the circadian rhythm, decreased synthesis of melatonin and sleep deprivation. Our aim was to review the epidemiological studies on the association between night shift work and some pathologies in nurses and midwives. We reviewed publications available in the MEDLINE database and published before June 2012, describing the cross-sectional (almost two thirds of all papers) and cohort studies. In total, we identified 26 original papers, including 5 epidemiological studies addressing diseases or disorders of the digestive system, 3 - metabolic syndrome, 2 - type 2 diabetes, 9 - cardiovascular diseases and CVD risk factors, 5 - obesity/overweight, 2 - menstrual disorders and 3 - poor pregnancy outcomes. The analysis of the literature indicates that night shift work of nurses and midwives is most strongly associated with a higher risk of obesity/overweight. In each of the five studies, which we identified this association was observed (confirmed by the statistical significance of the results), also after adjustment for confounders. The results for type 2 diabetes and disorders of the menstrual cycle are also suggestive. Epidemiological data on the other disorders or pathologies discussed in this article seem to be less certain - their results are inconsistent or their number is too small to draw definite conclusions. Further epidemiological studies of nurses and midwives working on night shifts and prospective observations in particular are recommended to find out whether potential association between the night work and discussed health issues is causal. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

N2  - Background: Chronic noise is an environmental pollutant and well-known to cause annoyance and sleep disturbance. Its association with clinical and subclinical adverse health effects has been discussed. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to examine associations between chronic noise exposure during pregnancy or childhood and health outcomes in early and late childhood. Methods: Following a systematic electronic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE), an additional hand search and a critical evaluation of potential articles by 2 independent reviewers, 29 studies were included: 12 on pregnancy/birth outcomes with samples ranging from 115 to 22,761 and 17 on cardiovascular and immune-mediated health outcomes in childhood with samples ranging from 43 to 1542. Evidence levels (3 to 2++) were rated according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Results: Chronic noise exposure during pregnancy was not associated with birth weight, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, perinatal and neonatal death based on 6 cohort, 4 case-control, and 2 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence level 2+). There was some evidence supporting an association of chronic noise exposure with increased systolic blood pressure and stress hormone levels in urine and saliva in children evaluating 2 cohort and 15 cross-sectional studies (highest evidence level 2-). Conclusions: There seemed to be no associations between chronic noise and pregnancy outcomes based on studies with evidence levels up to 2+. Associations between chronic noise and health in children were based mainly on cross-sectional studies. However, the studies included in this comprehensive systematic review showed a high variation in study design, outcome, exposure and confounder assessments. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal exposure to alcohol may negatively affect the developing brain with long term effects on development and behaviour. South Africa has a high prevalence of alcohol abuse and associated fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. A number of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems are being implicated as underlying the association between maternal alcohol, and subsequent negative behavioural outcomes in offspring. In particular, the glutamatergic system, appears to be disrupted in offspring of rodent mothers exposed to stress. There has been relatively little work, however, on the glutamatergic system during early life in humans. This study aims to assess the effects ofmaternal alcohol use on infant neuronal integrity and glutamatergic function, as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Methods: Pregnant mothers in a Cape Town community were consented and further identified using the ASSIST questionnaire. Mothers screening positive for alcohol use in preganacy were administered a more detailed assessment of their alcohol use. Infants of these mothers as well as matched controls were assessed byMRS scan at 2-4 weeks of age performed during natural sleep. The MRS findings of index children were compared to that of the controls. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics committee. Results: Twenty eight infants aged between 2-4 weeks underwent MRS scans (12 controls, 15 alcohol-exposed infants, 1 infant was co-exposed to methamphetamines). Comparisons of group data on the findings from voxels placed over Parietal white matter (PWM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed significantly decreased Glx peak (Glu + Gln, p = 0.009) and significantly increased macromolecules and lipids (MM09 + Lip09, p = 0.007) (PWM nControl = 5, PWM nAlcohol=5).Parietal grey matter (PGM) of infants exposed to alcohol prenatally showed no significant differences (PGM nControl = 7, PWM nAlcohol=10). Discussion: This research advances understanding of the relevant mechanisms resulting in the neurological effects of alcohol and stimulant exposure. This may ultimately drive therapeutic approaches. The study offers an important opportunity to contribute to the protection of child health in South Africa and to further knowledge to benefit children in developing countries exposed to alcohol in pregnancy.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from gestational alcohol exposure and can include neuroanatomical abnormalities and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Currently there are no treatments for the adverse outcomes in children with FASD. Two activity-dependent neuropeptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL)] have been shown to prevent alcohol-induced fetal demise, growth restrictions and postnatal spatial learning deficits in C57BL/6 mice when administered 30 minutes before a 5.8 g/kg dose of alcohol administered via a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection on gestational day 8 (GD8). A recent report by Incerti et al. (2011) using this samemodel indicated that oral NAP and SAL treatment just prior to and during Morris water maze training (40- 49 days old) rescued spatial learning deficits. The goal of this study was to determine whether orally administered D-NAP and D-SAL could rescue spatial learning deficits in alcohol-aected adult ospring in a related mousemodel of heavy binge alcohol exposure, in which the 5.8 g/kg dose on GD8 is separated into two i.p injections of 2.9 g/kg alcohol (23.7%v/v in normal Ringer's solution) or Ringer's vehicle control, four hours apart (Sulik et al., 1981). Thismodel was chosen because it has been shown to produce significant volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, a brain structure critical to spatial learning and memory, while reducing the incidence fetal demise. Beginning on PD 67, mice were given daily gavage treatments with either the peptide treatment (40 lg D-NAPand 40 lg DSAL), or vehicle. On PD70, animals were given 7 consecutive days place training in the Morris water maze (water temperature 25°C). Each training session involved four acquisition trials, in which each mouse was given up to 60 sec to find a 9-cmdiameter escape platform submerged in the same location on every trial. Trials were separated by ∼3 minutes. A 60-sec probe trial was given after the last training trial, in which the platform was removed and search strategy examined. Computer-based video tracking collected path length data during each trial. Gestational alcohol exposure had no significant eect on acquisition of place learning, and peptide treatment did not significantly alter place learning in either treatment group. This contrasts with the significant deficits found by Incerti et al. (2011), suggesting the two prenatal binge models may yield dierent behavioral outcomes.

N2  - Type: Work in Progress. Background: Insomnia is a symptom of most psychiatric disorders, including affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and thought disorders. Pharmacologically, many agents can induce sleep. Benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics are often utilized for sleep, however, they may be habit forming. As a result, non-habit forming agents are used as alternatives. Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, and quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, are among the non-controlledmedications prescribed off label for insomnia in the inpatient psychiatric population. Although they can be associated with severe side-effects, including anticholinergic and orthostatic side-effects, the safety, efficacy, and usage patterns of these two commonly prescribed drugs as “anti-insomnia” medications have not been contrasted. Objectives: 1) Compare the effectiveness of trazodone and quetiapine in inpatient psychiatric patients with regards to total sleep time (TST), number of night-time-awakenings, sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep latency (SL). 2) Identify trends in length of hospitalization, as well as common side-effects of trazodone and quetiapine use and their frequency. Methods: Participants were recruited from St. Helena Hospital Center for Behavioral Health (CBH) in Vallejo, California inpatient population. Inclusion criteria are all patients between 18 to 65 years of age admitted between September 2011 and January 2012 to CBH with a physician's order for trazodone or quetiapine. Patient enrollment target is 50. Exclusion criteria include patients who 1) are diagnosed with primary insomnia, 2) are pregnant, 3) are simultaneously on trazodone and quetiapine, 4) were on either trazodone or quetiapine up to two weeks prior to study and 5) are unable to coherently communicate with the interviewer. Patient demographics, baseline laboratory values, diagnoses, daily dose of study drug, as needed use of temazepam, length of hospitalization and number of past hospitalizations were recorded. Patients were interviewed to subjectively estimate their TST, number of night-time-awakenings, side-effects and sleep quality (Likert Scale 1-4). Nursing sleep records were also used as objective measures of TST, for number and duration of night-timeawakenings, and SL. Outcomes: Investigators hypothesize that the data will help determine the efficacy and safety profiles of trazodone and quetiapine use for insomnia in the inpatient psychiatric setting.

N2  - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are known to be important risks factors for DME. In addition, nephropathy, anemia, sleep apnea, glitazone usage, and pregnancy are also important modifiable risk factors. It is important for physicians of different subspecialties to work together and understand multiple aspects of DME and diabetic healthcare. © 2013.

N2  - Aims The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends the car seat challenge (CSC) is performed when discharging babies of <37 weeks from neonatal units as they are at risk of apnoeas, bradycardias and desaturations when seated in infant car safety seats. This test is not routine in many units however we have been performing the challenge for the last few years in our hospital. We present the results of 18-months experience carrying out the challenge. Methods Babies <2.5 kg or <37 weeks gestation on discharge, or with underlying respiratory or neuromuscular problems undergo a CSC pre-discharge. Baseline observations are monitored lying flat in a cot (30-min) then seated in their car seat (60-min). Desaturation, bradycardias, apnoeas, sleep state, colour and respiratory effort are noted. Babies who fail are re-challenged after repositioning or treatment of the underlying problem. Results Results of 181 babies challenged over 18-months were retrospectively analysed for various variables including sex, and gestational age and weight at birth and testing. 4/181 (2.2%) failed the initial challenge and a further three (total 3.8%) only passed after removal of a chair cushion. All failures were male, birth-weight 1731-4202 g, gestation 31-40 weeks; age at testing 35-45 weeks; weight 2182-5045 g and tested in 2009. One was on anti-reflux medication and another had a neuromuscular problem. All 4 babies passed after repositioning. Six babies discharged on home oxygen, and 13 on anti-reflux medication passed first time. Conclusion The CSC, although time consuming, is well received by parents. Only a few babies failed initially. In our experience, it is useful in identifying babies who may have problems when in an upright position, allowing treatment prior to discharge. There were no failures in 2010 possibly due to more expertise in positioning babies in the seats. However further research into the significance of these events is needed.

N2  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related outcomes in women with RLS. Methods: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study. Results: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4±0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1±0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session (r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes (r=0.64, p<0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's≤0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To identify depressive manifestations in adolescent mothers; to identify personal factors related to mood and eating and sleeping habits; to describe mothers’ emotional relationships with their families, partners and friends. METHODS: Descriptive mainly qualitative exploratory study in 75 adolescents screened by the Edinburgh scale for depression. Socio-demographic information was processed in Excel. Twenty-one random interviews were processed in ATLAS-ti 5.0. RESULTS: Adolescents were 16.5±1.6 years old; they belonged to socioeconomic strata 1 and 2 of 6. Just over half (39) had completed between 10 and 11 of 11 grades of schooling; 29 (38.6%) did not study. Thirty-nine (52%) were single and 35 (46.6%) lived with a boyfriend. They had initiated sex at 14.9±1.1 years. Pregnancy had been planned in 16 (21.3%) cases. Girls reported physical abuse in 11 (14.5%) cases, smoking in 21 (28%) and alcohol use in 25 (33.3%). In the social context, families were reconstituted with more than one adult for sustenance and the adolescent girl was living with boyfriend’s family. Pregnancy was a concern. Birth experience was generally a thankless memory. Changes described in association with pregnancy and childbirth were: limited freedom, confinement to domestic space and limitation to role of caregiver, peer estrangement and alteration in relationships with parents and family. Child rearing generated insecurity, tiredness and guilt. Depressive manifestations detected were: sleep difficulties, concerns about weight and figure, irritability, and sadness. CONCLUSIONS: Elements of depression in teenage mothers can be overt and detected by screening tests; they can also be embedded in everyday life and manifest as changes in behaviour and interpersonal relationships.

N2  - Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common and potentially debilitating syndrome characterized by chronic and widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and physical and psychological impairment. The aetiology of FM remains unknown however, central nervous system (CNS) dysregulation is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the condition. Naltrexone, a competitive antagonist of opioid receptors, is a potential novel treatment for chronic pain. More recently, naltrexone has been shown to attenuate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic superoxides via suppressive effects on CNS microglia cells. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone in the treatment of FM. Methods Seventy-four consecutive FM patients diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 criteria for FM were randomized into 2 groups, the first group(n = 37) received 4.5mg/d of naltrexone and the second group(n = 37) received placebo for 6 months. Patients were excluded from the study if they were taking any opioid analgesic or were pregnant. All subjects underwent a comprehensive clinical examination. Global pain status was assessed separately by the participant and the study physician, who was unaware of the group assignment, with the use of a visual-analogue scale (VAS) (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater pain). The number of tender sites (of 18 sites in total) were also determined according to the standardized protocol. The primary end point was a change in pain. The secondary end point was a change in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms) at the end of 24 weeks. All assessments were repeated at 24 weeks to test the durability of the response. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Results There was a significant reduction in pain in the naltrexone group compared to the placebo group. Mean (±SD) baseline and 24-week VAS scores for the naltrexone group were 65.6± 13.5 and 45.5±14.1, respectively, versus 66.0±13.5 and 55.3±13.9, respectively, for the control group, p<0.001). of the 37 patients assigned to the naltrexone group, 16 had clinically important improvements in the FIQ total score and quality of life. Mean (±SD) baseline and 24-week FIQ scores for the naltrexone group were 63.7±13.2 and 38.5±16.1, respectively, versus 63.0±13.0 and 57.9±15.6, respectively, for the control group, p<0.001). The drug was well-tolerated with minimal side effects in the form of headache (15% vs 5%) and vivid dreams (33% vs 14%) occurring more often in the naltrexone group. Conclusions Naltrexone may be an effective and useful treatment for fibromyalgia. However, long-term larger study population studies are required.

N2  - Reduce of perinatal mortality is one of the most important tasks of healthcare. At present cardiotocography (CTG) is the leading method of examination at evaluation of fetus condition during pregnancy. The meaning and importance of this method especially increased due to application fetal monitors with automatic processing of the CTG. Now fully automatic and computerized fetal monitor (manufactured by “RPT UNICOS”, Moscow) is widely used in Russia. Evaluation of fetus condition at its usage is measured according to the special index IFC (index of the fetus condition) which can vary from 0 to 4. IFC of 0-1 testifies normal fetus condition, IFC of 1.1-2.0 - initial (intermediary) deterioration, IFC of 2.1-3.0 - severe (abnormal) deterioration, IFC of 3.1-4.0 - extreme (preterminal) deterioration. For many years of experience (more than 20 years) of this device usage proved that sensitivity of evaluation of fetus condition is 90.2%, specificity - 91.7% and the average accuracy of diagnostics - 90.9%. Rather reliable results (of average 75.8%) were also received in differential evaluation of fetus condition taken in 4 groups (normal fetus condition, initially, severe and extreme deterioration). Application of these fetal monitors in 23 obstetrics hospitals during the period of 2 to 7 years allowed to reduce the perinatal mortality on average at 33% (18- 46%) and in some hospitals in 2 times. Considerable reduce of perinatal mortality took place in one of the Moscow districts with the population of more than 1000 000 people. Over the 5 year period of examination (2000-2004) the average perinatal mortality reduced from 7.7 to 4.6‰ (40%). The main positive features of this fetal monitor are: 1) higher accuracy (on 15-20%) in comparison to other analogical fetal monitors, 2) fully automatic processing of CTG information, 3) unification of results and absence of subjectivity at CTG interpretation, 4) almost complete elimination of the fetus sleep on the final result of examination, 5) automatic definition of CTG duration, 6) taking into consideration fetus movement, 7) setting up the fact of heart rate registration from the mother aorta (with no use separate device of mother heart rate registration), 8) artifacts elimination in case of temporary signal losing, 9) CTG recording using an office paper (A4), 10) reduction of the examination time,11) possibility of usage of fetal monitor at home setting, 12) acceleration of doctors education in CTG interpretation. The high level of informativity power of this device and its simplicity allows us to recommend it for a wide application in clinical practice.

N2  - BIRTH TRAUMA OF THE CERVICAL SPINE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES At the turn of the second decade of the 21st century, it becomes obvious, that health of the nation is directly dependent on the course of pregnancy and organization of the processes of birthing mothers. Despite the achievements of obstetric science, the discovery of perinatal centres perinatal pathology of newborns remains high, including a proven mechanism of damage to the skull and cervical vertebrae in childbirth (V. Vlasyuk. 2009; Parilov S.L.. 2012, etc.). When all injuries occurring with minimal symptoms the most common is the injury of the cervical spine in the power of his anatomy physiology (Ratner A.YU. 1985; Skoromets A.. 2012, etc.). We held a screening of patients who were on treatment in the neurological Department of City clinical children's hospital?1 for dvuletny the period of 2011-2012?.?. The basis of screening for further examination of patients was taken symptom of peripheral cervical insuf-ficiency, which has been described and is studied in detail the staff of the Department of children's neurology under the guidance of Professor Rutner A.J. in 80-90th years of the last century. In the basis of the reasons for the development of the monitoring station is chronic ischemia of thickening of the cervical spinal cord, which is conditioned by insufficiency of blood circulation in the basin of the branches of the vertebral arteries due to injury to the cer-vical vertebrae in the process of childbirth. In our study, the age of the children, whose screening revealed the syndrome of the monitor-ing station, was from 4-5 to years 17. All were selected 376 patients. The analysis of obstetric anamnesis found that more than half of these various violations (78.7%), which were present-ed: the rapid delivery (less than 3 hours), prolonged labour, maternity benefits in childbirth (pressure on the stomach, application of vacuum), medical sleep, stimulation of the birth, breech presentation, caesarean section, episiotomy. With the purpose of more precise verification of the syndrome of the monitoring station pa-tients conducted research REG, uzdg, inspection of the oculist, x-ray of the cervical verte-brae, electromyography. The methods of rheoencephalography and ultrasonic dopplerography revealed the interest of the vertebral arteries in the form of reduction of volume and high-speed performance, more to the right. Examination of the fundus revealed mainly constriction arterial bed. Radiographic changes were localized on the C0-C2 level or (and) C5-C6. That is suffered segments of the spinal column bearing the maximum load at delivery. The electro-myographic study confirmed mixed palsy light degree in the shoulder belt. Results of treatment with clinical compensation and the improvement was assessed by the subjective scale - visual analog scale. The clinical diagnosis of the study group patients were mainly: dysfunc-tion of vegetative nervous system, tension headaches, pain in the neck, intracranial hyperten-sion, chronic cerebral vascular insufficiency. Thus it can be argued that the patrimonial damage to the Central nervous system, namely the cervical spine, there are and have their own clinical and electrophysiological justification.

N2  - Introduction. Since the 90-s of the XX century autohaemoplasmadonation (HPD) is being actively introduced in obstetric practice, the grounds for which are the proved advantages of this method to reduce the risk of transfusion-based blood and reduce inflammatory complications. However, in the scientific literature there are no data on the safety of this procedure to the fetus and newborn. This is the aspect which was the purpose of the presented work. Materials and methods. Examined 150 patients, who delivered whith the help of a planned cesarean section. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The main group consisted of 80 patients, which were preoperative HPD with the provisional hypervolemic hemodilution. Reinfusion autoblood was conducted after surgical hemostasis. The control group included 70 patients, in whom the operative delivery was carried out without HPD. For anesthesia was used neuroaxial anesthesia. Prenatal examination included Doppler with the definition of the index of resistance arteries of the umbilical cord (IRAP), cardiotography (CTG). Newborns were assessed on a scale Apgar; in the neonatal period were estimated psycho-physical data (dynamics of body weight, the state of sleep, muscle tone and character of the movements, the functional state of organs and systems, nervous and mental development, the analysis of blood; the usefulness of infant feeding). Results.The main and control groups of patients were identical in age, pregnancy, peculiarities of obstetric - gynecological history, the range of extragenital and obstetric pathology, parity, indications for the surgical delivery. Intronatal in the main group of the fetal heart rate amounted to 148±10 beats/min, the indicator of the condition of the fetus (ICF) at the CTG was 0,6±0,25, the IRAP - 0,43±0,07. In the process of blood sampling fetal condition practically has not changed: the fetal heart rate of 140±10 beats/min, ICF - 0,8±0,20, which was not statistically different from the control group. The state of the newborn in the main group evaluated for the 1st minute of the life- 8,2±1.3 points, and in the fifth minute of 8,5±1,2, in the control group, on the 1st minute of the life-8,0 ± 1.1 points, and in the fifth minute of 8,3±1,3. The average body weight of newborns in the main group was 3144,6±165,25g; in the control group-3020,3±185,55g. In the early neonatal period in the main group of newborns were the following indices of peripheral blood erythrocytes -5,53±0,10x1012/l, hemoglobin-208,32±4.2g/l, leucocytes-13,48±1.2x109/l, the Ht-52±3%, platelet count-255±8x109/l. In the control group, the erythrocytes-5,42±0,10x1012/l, hemoglobin- 195,22±3g/l, leucocytes-18,8±2,2x109/l, the Ht-50±2%, platelet count-232±8x109/l. In the study of the psychophysical status noted that in the main group of adaptation occurs in physiological terms; breastfeeding was 85% of infants in the control group - 70% of newborns. Conclusions. The developed method of intraoperation HPD with hypervolemic hemodilution when neuroaxial anesthesia with reinfused autoblood after surgical hemostasis has no negative effect on intra- and neonatal indicators. The advantages of the method include more optimal values of Ht and indicators of the red blood of newborns. The received results allow to apply widely the proposed methods.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Overactive bladder (OAB) defined as urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia is a common urological problemthat strongly affects quality of life, quality of sleep, sexual activity, mental health, work productivity, and health care cost. Althoug conservative and medical treatment, including bladder training and antimuscarinic drugs are often used, a large group of patient present intolerable side effects and insufficient symptom improvement. Further treatment includes major surgery such as bladder augmentation, detrusor myomectomy, or urinary diversion. More recently, options such as botulinum toxin injection in the detrusor or neuromodulation such as posterior percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) have entered clinical practice, in patients non responders to antimuscarinic and anticholinergetic agents. Recent studies supported the hypothesis that efficacy of PTNS is mediated by suprasacral centers of stimulus elaboration involving finally cortical associative areas. (1) The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PTNS in treating the overactive bladder syndrome and evaluation thickness of the detrusor muscle before and after treatment. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: 18 female patients mean age 51,5 years (range 21 to 82) with OAB were enrolled from December 2011 to December 2012. Patients were evaluated at the outpatient clinic for OAB by hystory and physical and urological examination, urinanalysis, urine citology, cistoscopy and tranperineal ultrasound to determine thickness of the detrusor muscle. All patients had urodynamically proven detrusor overactivity. Patients with active urinary tract or recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder or kidney stones, carcinoma in situ, bladder malignancy, interstitial cistitis, uncontrolled diabetes and diabetes with peripheral nerve involvement, neurological disease and pregnancy were excluded from the study. Validated questionnaires including Incontinence specific Quality of Life questionnaire short form (I-QoL- SF) and OAB-q were used to assess the effect of the treatment. We evaluated functional outcomes at week 0, week 6 andweek 12. PTNS is applied according to Stoller'smethods:A 34 gauge stainless steel needle is inserted approximately 3 to 4 cm, about 3 fingerbreadths cephalad to the medial malleolus, between the posterior margin of the tibia and soleus muscle. A stick-on electrode placed on the same leg near the arch of the foot is used for electrical stimulation with adjustable pulse intensity (0-10 mA), fixed pulse width of 200 msec and frequency of 20 Hz. The stimulator contains a battery of 9 V (Urgent PC).The amplitude is slowly increased until the large toes starts to curls or toes start to fan. If necessary the amplitude can be increase during the sessions. Treatment consisted of 12 weekly sessions of 30 minutes each. Patients were offered chronic treatment in case of good response. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of PTNS we obtained a successful treatment rate of 70% (13 patients out of 18). In accordance with previous studies we observed a significant reduction in urgency and frequency. Our study showed a statistically improvement in nocturia (p < 0.01)(Tab.1). Five out of 12 patients complained nocturia at the beginning of treatment (0 week); At 6 weeks three patients out of nine (40%) and all patients reported improvements at 12 week (100%). Eleven patients out of 12with urgency at 0week; 7 patients (36.36%) at 6 week and 4 (63.64%) at the end of treatment. Frequency was present in 9 patients out of 12 at week 0 ; at 6 weeks 4 (55.56%) and 3 (66.67%) at week 12. OAB score showed improvement in 5.7% at week 6 and 15.38% at week 12. I-Qol revealed a general quality of life improvement in regard to physical and social functioning in all patients. After 12 weeks the detrusor muscle thicknesss decrease is not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: The idea of stimulating these nerves was based on the traditional Chinese practice of using acupuncture points over the common peroneal or posterior tibial nerves to stimulate bladder activity. The posterior tibial nerve is amixed nerve containing L5-S3 fibres, originating from the same spinal segments as the parasympathetic innervation that innervate and trigger directly the bladder and urinary sphinter. PTNS was first described in 1983 by McGuire et al.(2) using a transcutaneous electrode. Later on, Stoller adjusted this method by using a percutaneous electrode. It may be used to treat OAB resistant to medical treatment (3). In our study we consider improvement in quality of life scores to be the most appropriate definition of successful treatment. In according with other studies, the most relevant clinical outcome measurement is the patients's perception of the PTNS effect of their overactive detrusor symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrates that PTNS is an effective and very well tolerated treatment for patientswith OAB with particulary improvements in reducing nocturia and it can be proposed as minimally invasive, safe treatment with few complications.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p=0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Study question: Is there an expression of circadian genes present in mouse ovaries, in vivo and in vitro mouse embryos and does this expression oscillates during a 24hour period? Summary answer: Our study showed that all circadian genes are expressed in ovaries without clear oscillation for all genes, while in embryos, oscillation was observed for clock and per1 genes but not for bmal1, per2, cry1 and cry2 and in liver samples genes were expressed with various expression rates. What is known already: There is a significant role of the circadian output from the suprachiasmatic nuclei to the GnRH neurons in the female rat, which is spontaneous ovulator with a 4-day estrous cycle. Light is the key environmental signal which is detected by the retina and its presence or absence is signaled via one direct and various indirect neural pathways to the suprachismatic nuclei. Also, female clock mutant mice display disrupted estrous cycles and inability to produce a gonadotrophin peak. Study design, size, duration: Our study was conducted in two 24-hour periods under standard laboratory conditions with a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle Participants/materials, setting, methods: Female F1 5-6 week old mice were superovulated with pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin and 48 hours later with hCG and were housed individually overnight with male F1 3 month old mice and sacrificed subsequently 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76 and 80 after hCG administration. Total rna was extracted and the expression of genes was assessed by Real-Time PCR. H2Aa gene was used as a control gene. Main results and the role of chance: Clock gene showed high expression rates in ovaries and in in vivo embryos 56 hours past hCG administration.Liver showed various expression rates. In vitro embryos marked high expression 60 hours past hCG. Bmal1 showed high expression in liver samples. Cry1 and cry2 had high expression in embryos and liver and medium to high expression rates in mouse ovaries. Per1 gene was highly expressed in mouse embryos and low in ovaries 80 hours past hCG administration while it had no expression in liver samples. Per2 was not expressed in embryos, had low to medium expression in ovaries at all time-points and was highly expressed in liver samples. Limitations, reason for caution: During our study we used embryos derived from F1 mouse hybrids only. The embryos were grown in vitro and in vivo Wider implications of the findings: With the present study,we demonstrated for the first time that clock gene is highly expressed in mouse ovaries 56 hours after hCG administration. The various oscillation rates suggest a possible interaction between hCG ovulation mechanism and circadian clock machinery. Moreover, since per1 and clock oscillate in embryos, there probably exists an 'embryonic' oscillator mechanism that shifts from per1 to per2 in differentiated tissues. Understanding this mechanism could have an effect in optimizing assisted reproduction protocols in the near future.

N2  - Nutritional state in the gestation period influences fetal growth and development. We hypothesized that undernutrition during gestation would affect offspring sleep architecture and/or homeostasis. Pregnant female mice were assigned to either control (fed ad libitum; AD) or 50% dietary restriction (DR) groups from gestation day 12 to parturition. After parturition, dams were fed AD chow. After weaning, the pups were also fed AD into adulthood. At adulthood (aged 8-9 weeks), we carried out sleep recordings. Although offspring mice displayed a significantly reduced body weight at birth, their weights recovered three days after birth. Enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed in the DR mice over a 24-hour period without changing the diurnal pattern or amounts of wake, NREM, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, DR mice also displayed an enhancement of EEG-SWA rebound after a 6-hour sleep deprivation and a higher threshold for waking in the face of external stimuli. DR adult offspring mice exhibited small but significant increases in the expression of hypothalamic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Pparα) and brain-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1c) mRNA, two genes involved in lipid metabolism. Undernutrition during pregnancy may influence sleep homeostasis, with offspring exhibiting greater sleep pressure. © 2013 Shimizu et al.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy has recently gained medical interest due to its consequences on maternal health and fetal outcome. In fact, although epidemiologic data are still scanty, several reports indicate that snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy are commonly associated with maternal hypertension, morbidly increased body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus and, at child birth, are correlated with an increased percentage of C-sections, preterm births with infants small for gestational age (SGA). OSA is an eminently treatable condition by means of assisted nocturnal ventilation with continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) devices. Diagnosis and treatment of this potential pregnancy complication should be thus more aggressively pursued in order to avoid harmful consequences to both mother and child. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Background: Depression is frequently observed in patients with untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the general population. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems.Methods: A retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were ≥18 years old, pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).Results: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring. Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score ≥10. Significantly more snoring women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score ≥10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1 ± 4.9 vs. 5.4 ± 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score ≥10 (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023).Conclusion: Maternal snoring may be a risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms. Further investigation of the temporal relationship between maternal snoring and depressive symptoms is warranted. © 2013 O'Brien et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - A growing body of evidence suggests that immune alterations, especially those related to inflammation, are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related brain alterations. Much of this work has focused on the prenatal period, because infections during pregnancy have been repeatedly (albeit inconsistently) linked to risk of schizophrenia. Given that most infections do not cross the placenta, cytokines associated with inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) have been targeted as potential mediators of the damaging effects of infection on the fetal brain in prenatal studies. Moreover, additional evidence from both human and animal studies suggests links between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immune-related genes, and schizophrenia as well as brain alterations associated with the disorder. Additional support for the role of altered immune factors in the etiology of schizophrenia comes from neuroimaging studies, which have linked proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms with some of the structural and functional abnormalities repeatedly found in schizophrenia. These findings are reviewed and discussed with a life course perspective, examining the contribution of inflammation from the fetal period to disorder presentation. Unexplored areas and future directions, such as the interplay between inflammation, genes, and individual-level environmental factors (e.g., stress, sleep, and nutrition), are also discussed. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidencebased data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John's wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective. © 2013 Qureshi and Al-Bedah, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

N2  - Background: Numerous studies have reported heightened concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with major depression (MDD). Significant hormonal fluctuations and alternations in circadian rhythms may render pregnant women more susceptible to systemic inflammation. To date, little is known about the relationship between cytokines, circadian rhythms and symptoms of depression in late pregnancy. Methods: Thirty-two pregnant, medication-free women were investigated (mean age= 29.3, mean gestational age= 33.5 weeks). Cytokine concentrations were quantified using Multiplex immunoassays. Lifetime history of depression was assessed using the MINI. Current depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Sleep, circadian rhythms and stress were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: Subjects screening positive for depression (EPDS≥12, n=6) had significantly higher BRIAN, PSQI and PSS scores (all p≤0.003) compared to those who screened negative (n=26); however no significant differences in cytokine concentrations were observed. Subjects with lifetime history of MDD (n=22) had a significantly higher TNF-a/IL-10 ratio (F=4.37, p=0.045) compared to subjects without lifetime MDD (n=10). No significant correlations were observed between cytokine levels and EPDS, PSQI, BRIAN or PSS (all p>0.05). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms in late pregnancy are associated with increased stress, poorer sleep quality and altered circadian rhythms. However, none of these symptoms were correlated with cytokine levels. The positive association between pro/anti-inflammatory ratio and lifetime history of depression suggests that systemic inflammation may be a trait rather than a state marker of depressive illness.

N2  - Introduction: 79% of the pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders. These disorders are the result of physiological, hormonal and physical changes and can affect disorders before, during and after childbirth. In addition this can affect the quality of life for pregnant women. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of behavioral health sleep education on the quality of life in the pregnant women with sleep disorder in the second trimester of pregnancy. Materials and Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial, on 112 pregnant women with sleep disorder (according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality questionnaire). Tools for data collection included demographic questionnaire and summarized in the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL: BREF). Sampling was done in an easy and accessible sampling. They were randomly (simple) divided into control and case groups. In the case group, health behavior Sleep education were presented during a fourhour session in weeks 22, 23, 24 and 25 then followed up by filling the summarized form of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL: BREF) questionnaire in the first meeting on the month after intervention in week 29 of pregnancy and the second follow-up session was done two months later at 33 weeks. Results: A statistically significant change was reported in the quality of life in the intervention group (Case) in comparison to the control group [29 week (p=0.000), in 33 week (p=0.001)]. Conclusion: Behavioral health sleep education improves the quality of life in pregnant women who are experiencing insomnia.

N2  - Background: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state. Objective: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve. Methods: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. Results: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 ± 12.3 vs 2.9 ± 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 ± 5.3 vs 2.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75). Conclusions: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

N2  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD, <37 weeks gestation). We examined the individual and joint associations of pre-pregnancy BMI, second trimester exercise and sleep on PTD. We conducted a nested, population-based case-control study interviewing postpartum 344 cases delivering at <37 weeks, as identified by clinical estimate of gestational age from prenatal screening records, and 698 term controls, excluding term low birthweight. Eligible women participated in California's statewide Prenatal Screening Program, worked during pregnancy, and delivered a singleton birth in Southern California in 2002-2003. Modeled separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.96--per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs. no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.80-1.48 for <7 h; OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.57-1.48 for >8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m(2) (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.

N2  - Purpose: Mounting evidence implicate habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, as an important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Little, however, is known about the determinants of habitual snoring among pregnant women. We sought to assess its prevalence and to identify maternal characteristics associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 1,303) receiving prenatal care provided information about habitual snoring before and during pregnancy in in-person interviews completed in early pregnancy. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) from multivariable models designed to identify factors associated with snoring during pregnancy. Results: Approximately 7.3 % of pregnant women reported habitual snoring during early pregnancy. The odds of habitual snoring during pregnancy was strongly related with maternal reports of habitual snoring prior to the index pregnancy (aOR = 24.32; 95 % CI, 14.30-41.51). Advanced maternal age (≥35 years) (aOR = 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.11-3.68), history of pregestational diabetes (aOR = 3.61; 95 % CI, 1.07-12.2), history of mood and anxiety disorders (aOR = 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.02-3.20), and prepregnancy overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2) (aOR = 2.31; 95 % CI, 1.41-3.77) and obesity (≥30 kg/m 2) (aOR = 2.81; 95 % CI, 1.44-5.48) status were statistically significant risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy (aOR = 2.70; 95 % CI, 1.17-6.26) was associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy. Conclusions: Identification of risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy has important implications for developing strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, promoting improved sleep hygiene and improved pregnancy outcomes among reproductive-age women. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine women's preferences for research results and format, intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women's preferred information to nonstudy participants. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Purpose: Many changes that normally occur during pregnancy disrupt sleep and may lead to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). However, given that pregnancy may also predispose to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), we sought to investigate whether EDS may be associated with snoring, gasping, or apneas, further suggesting SDB. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of women in the immediate postpartum period was conducted. Participants answered questions from the multivariable apnea prediction index regarding snoring, gasping, and witnessed apneas in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Participants were also asked to answer Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questions, and a score 0-24 was calculated (>10 considered abnormal). Medical history and medication use were obtained both by history and review of the medical record. Results: Out of 1,000 women recruited, 990 women answered the ESS questionnaire completely. Mean prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 ± 6.2 with 21.7 % of the sample having a prepregnancy BMI ≥30. Mean ESS score was 7.1 ± 3.9, and 1.7 % of the total sample scored 16 or greater. ESS increased significantly with age, BMI, and neck circumference. All three symptoms of SDB were associated with higher mean ESS scores. In a multiple linear regression analysis, loud snoring, gasping, and apneas were statistically significant independent predictors of mean ESS score. Conclusions: EDS measured by ESS is a common finding in pregnancy. Snoring, gasping, and apneas appear to be independent predictors of mean ESS scores. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - The natural surface of human hair is hydrophobic, consisting of a bilayer of heavily cross-linked proteins toward the cell inside, combined with a layer of fatty acids to the outside. The surface properties can be characterized through the wetting- or Wilhelmy-force in water. Wetting-force curves along segments of hair from female test individuals with lengths equivalent to about 1 month of growth (approx. 10 mm) are presented. In a multi-step analysis, applying curve smoothing, Fourier, and Principal Component Analysis for hair lengths comprising daily and weekly growth (2 mm), a compound circadian rhythm is observed, which through its typical bimodality can be linked to wake and sleep phases. The data set furthermore indicates systematic monthly changes with apparent relations to the menstrual cycle. This view is supported by observations of marked changes of this monthly pattern with the onset of pregnancy. Furthermore, consistent systematic changes on the same time scale are absent for male head hair. These results confirm that the wettability curves are nonstochastic in nature and that hair has a systematically nonhomogeneous, hydrophobic surface, which can be viewed in the context of the fluid mosaic model for cell membranes. This leads to the hypothesis that the hair surface preserves a rather detailed and long-term, individual chronobiological record. This record is ''written'' by the composition of the cell membrane of the cuticle cell before cell death. A practical application of this analytical approach is the determination of the pattern of distribution for cosmetically relevant material on the surface of human hair.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Most physiologic processes exhibit day/night rhythms driven by the circadian clockwork. The central circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and synchronizes peripheral clock systems operative in various tissues. They govern the adjustment of organ functions to daytime at the cellular level. In the kidneys, circadian oscillation of essential renal functions such as the maintenance of water and electrolyte homeostasis has been demonstrated. Recent studies have revealed the circadian expression of numerous genes critical for kidney functions (e.g. αENaC, NHE3 BSC1 AVPR2 AQP2/4, BSC-1 and SGK1). The ontogeny of the circadian expression of clockwork and clock-controlled genes has recently been studied in the SCN and few peripheral tissues in rats. Whereas the central molecular clockwork appears to develop gradually during early postnatal life, little is known about the ontogeny of clock machinery in the kidney. Here, we sought to explore the ontogeny of circadian clock gene expression in the kidneys. Methods: Pregnant SD rats were housed with free access to food and water at constant temperature under 12/12-hour light-dark cycles. Offspring (7 per group) were sacrificed at 4 hour intervals on embryonic day 20 (E20) and postnatal days 7, 30, or 84 (P7 P30, P84). The circadian gene expression patterns in the kidneys were profiled by real-time RT-PCR for the canonical clock genes, Clock, Bmal1 Rev-Erbα, Per1 Per2, Cry1 Cry2 and the kidney specific clock-controlled genes Scnn1α, Scl9a3 Scl12a2, Avpr2 and SGK1. Results: The core clock genes Clock ( p=0.01), Rev-Erbα ( p<0.01) and Per1 (p<0.01) showed significant circadian expression as early as E20. During early postnatal life, rhythmic expression increased in amplitude and showed a significant phase shift. Whereas the expression of Cry1 Cry2 and Per2 showed no circadian variation at E20, circadian rhythmicity had developed by P7 for Cry1 ( p<0.01) and by P30 for Per2 (p=0.05). All genes displayed distinct circadian rhythms at P84 (p<0.001). Among the clock-controlled genes, circadian expression of Scnn1a ( p<0.01), SGK1 (p=0.05) and AVPR2 ( p=0.05) was observed at E20. The phase of the rhythms shifted along the observation time points. Scl12a2 showed rhythmic expression only at P84 (p<0.01), and Scl9a3 only transiently at E20 ( p<0.01). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a complex time course of development of the intrarenal molecular clockwork during pre- and early postnatal life in rats. Environmental factors affecting the maturation of circadian kidney functions during this critical period of development might impact on the organism's postnatal homeostatic adaptation and predispose to abnormal electrolyte and fluid balance and early renal and cardiovascular disease.

N2  - Background: Obesity is present already in childhood, and prevention therefore has to start early. However, among controlled intervention studies in children, less than 25% prevented weight gain (Cochrane 2011). Almost all interventions improved diet and/or activity, but none focused on sleep and stress management. The objectives of the Healthy Start intervention were to prevent development of overweight among normal weight children who all were predisposed to future weight gain. Methods: Children, aged 2-6 years, with high birth weights (>4000 g), maternal pre-pregnancy overweight (BMI>28 kg/m2), or familial low socioeconomic status were selected from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms. Subsequently, children were randomized into intervention (n = 271) and control (n = 272) groups. The intervention consisted of up to 10 optional individual consultations guiding parents in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. Families could also participate in cooking classes and play arrangements. Changes in weight and body composition from impedance, were measures before and after 11/2 years of intervention. Results: In total 156 and 198 children from the intervention (I) and control (C) groups completed the study. Average age at baseline was 4 years. Weight change was not different between groups (p=0.29). However, percentage body fat (BF%) improved in both groups. At baseline BF% was I:22.2+10.1% and C:21.2+8.2%. After the intervention BF% was I:20.3%+7.8 and C:20.7+7.0%. Conclusion: These first results of the Healthy Start study suggest that the intervention was effective in preventing gain in BF% in the intervention compared to the control group. These results are encouraging because they suggest that even among individuals with a strong predisposition for developing obesity, an early intervention may be successful if, in addition to diet and physical activity, it focuses on reducing stressful behavior and improving sleep.

N2  - Introduction : Achondroplasia presents many challenges to the anesthesiologist. Factors that can cause difficult intubation include limited mouth opening, large tongue, cervical spine instability,limited neck extension, sleep apnea and midface hypoplasia. Fertility rate is low in achondroplasia, and pregnancy is complicated by decreased functional residual capacity and severe supine hypotension syndrome. Regional anesthesia may be technically difficult due to severe thoracolumbar kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and vertebral facet spurs. Spinal anesthesia is not routinely considered due to the possibility of a high spinal in view of the short stature. Methods: N/A Challenging Case Report : We present a case of a 22year old achondroplastic woman who was scheduled for elective primary cesarean section for inadequate pelvis. She had multiple limb lengthening proedures under GA without any complications. She is 127cm tall (about 15 cm gain in ht), weighed 66kg and is a Jehovah witness. Her mouth opening was adequate. The patient expressed strong desire to be awake during C/S and be part of the bonding process with the newborn. Preparations for emergency airway management was done. Planned for a combined spinal epidural anesthesia for cesarean section. The suggested dose for intrathecal bupivacaine was 0.06mg/cm height. We were unable to perform epidural due to severe paesthesia. We proceeded with a spinal anesthesia with 25 G Whitacre needle using 0.8 ml Bupivacaine 0.75% and 15 mcg of fentanyl. Pt had no paresthesias during spinal placement. Patient was placed with left uterine displacement and 30 degrees head up. A T2 level of anesthesia was achieved. Surgery was uneventful. Results : The dose of bupivacaine was calculated on height basis. The suggested ED 95 for minimum effective dose was 0.06mg/cm height. The patient's height would have been about 110cm without limb lengthening procedures. Discussion : Regional and general anesthetics can be difficult in achondroplastic patients. Epidural is often preferred due to the option to slowly titrate the local anesthetics for an adequate surgical level. Most people would prefer a definite airway management in these patients especially in pregnancy. The patient's wish to be awake for the procedure, knowing that the baby also inherited the condition amounted to a psychological necessity.

N2  - Background: The term “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) includes several different approaches to treatment, from homeopathy to herbal medicine, acupuncture or spiritual healing; it includes all practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. The boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant health systems are, therefore, not always fixed. In fact, several complementary therapies involve the administration of pharmaceutical-type remedies. Herbal medicines are chemically rich preparations of plant material whereas homeopathic remedies are infinitely dilute preparations of material which may be plant, animal, mineral, chemical or biological in origin. Discussion: A substantial amount of CAM is used worldwide for illness prevention and health promotion purposes, but there is also evidence that CAM is frequently used as an adjunct to biomedical treatment by patients with serious diseases such as diabetes or cancers, and to self-manage long-term health complaints like lower back pain or sleep problems. These types of product are widely available for purchase for self-treatment from pharmacies, healthfood stores, supermarkets and via the Internet. Often in the case of herbal medicines, data are lacking on pharmacology (e.g. active constituents, pharmacokinetics, use in specific patient groups such as children, the elderly or individuals with renal or hepatic disease and in pregnancy and lactation) and toxicology (e.g. adverse effects and their frequencies, interactions with drugs and food). Moreover, the quality of some marketed complementary medicines, including food supplements, is a real concern. First of all, it is important to emphasize that products from different manufacturers are not the same. Herbs are natural products and, thus, do not have a consistent, standardized composition. Different parts of the plant (e.g. roots, leaves) contain a different profile of constituents and the content and concentration of constituents can be influenced by several factors such as climate, growing conditions, storage conditions and processing (e.g. extraction and drying). For these reasons, batch-to-batch and manufacturer-tomanufacturer variation in preparations of the same herb will occur. The quality of plant raw materials can also be influenced by human error or unscrupulous operators. Accidental botanical substitution (misidentification of plant species) or intentional adulteration can occur. An example of this relates to reports of renal failure and renal cancer following the substitution of nontoxic herbs with Aristolochia species in herbal food supplements marketed for reducing body weight.1 Patients suffering anticholinergic toxicity after use of supplements containing Choleus forskollii contaminated with scopolamine, lead poisoning after use of Ayurvedic medicines, or microcystin toxicity were recently described in Italy. Toxicity may also depend on the intrinsic effect of the drug, in the absence of contamination or adulteration. Ephedra has been used for thousands of years in China to treat bronchial asthma and other upper respiratory symptoms. More recently, its main use in the US and many other countries has been in dietary supplements for weight loss. Ephedra sales prospered in the '80s because the product was perceived by consumers as a “natural” and “safe” alternative to prescription weight loss products without the associated risk of harm. Actually, adverse effects associated with Ephedra use include headache, insomnia, anxiety, psychoses, hypertension, seizure and cardiovascular effects such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, stroke and death. In 2004, after 117 deaths and 16,000 reports of adverse effects, all Ephedra sales were banned and the product was no longer legally available via conventional methods.2 The use of several common herbs and dietary supplements has been also associated with hepatotoxicity, varying from asymptomatic elevations in hepatic enzyme levels to fulminant hepatic failure. Supplements with potential liver toxicity are, for example, Garcinia cambogia, Camellia sinensis, Hoodia gordoni and kava-kava.3 In other cases, toxicity data about substances proposed for the treatment of serious diseases are totally lacking. This is the case of the scorpion Rhopalurus junceus toxin distributed in Cuba and around the world as an anticancer drug. In addition to the adverse effects associated with the active principles, the risks associated with the use of dietary supplements come also from their wide availability on the Internet and by illegal trade. Thus patients may have access to products contaminated with toxic botanicals, heavy metals, pathogenic microorganisms, pesticides or adulterated with banned drugs or undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients. In a retrospective study conducted by reviewing all poisoning cases suspected to involve use of illicit slimming products, 66 poisoning cases were encountered and 81 products were analysed.4 Analysis of the products demonstrated the presence of 12 illicit ingredients comprising undeclared or banned drugs, such as sibutramine. The diagnosis of intoxications due to the use of herbal medicines is often complex due to many factors. Investigation of the source of the exposure is difficult because these products are often considered “safe” and patients often do not report the taking of such “natural” preparations. Furthermore, poisonings by herbal principles and metals are not well known by emergency department doctors, so the “alternative” cause is investigated late. Moreover the latency time that may elapse between the beginning of taking these products and the occurrence of clinical manifestations (weeks to months or years) often makes it difficult to identify a causal relationship between taking the product and symptoms. Conclusion: In conclusion, the ethnic background of the patient, the history of the current, recent or past intake of complementary or alternative medicine, and the presence of specific signs and symptoms represent the criteria for a correct and early diagnosis.

N2  - Introduction: Primary vaginismus, which defined as the inability to have penetrative vaginal intercourse during initial sexual contact, is a common cause of sexless and unconsummated marriages. This syndrome affects typically young women between 20 and 30 years of age and is frequently associated with tightness of the pelvic floor muscles leading to a closure of the vaginal introitus resulting in difficult or nearly impossible penetration. Aim: To promote the use of a multidisciplinary team consisting of a pelvic floor muscle specialist, physical therapist and psychotherapist in the treatment of Vaginismus. Methods: We present a case of refractory vaginismus, severe constipation and anxiety, in a 35 year old married patient that was successfully treated with our multidisciplinary approach. After more than ten years of abstinence, her treatment culminated in improvement of constipation, the consummation of her marriage, and pregnancy. The patient was treated utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of pelvic muscle rehabilitation, physical therapy and coadjuvant psychotherapy on a weekly basis. Patient was counseled on nutrition, lifestyle, stress management and sleep hygiene. Initial treatment was focused on regulation of bowel movements and improving her constipation. A bowel regimen and educational information on proper defecatory techniques were given. Treatment was tailored to the patients needs based on notations made during initial evaluation and throughout the course of treatment. Main Outcome Measures: Objective progress was evaluated through self reported attempts at vaginal penetration with finger, tampon or sensor and compliance with the use of vaginal vibrators and dilators. Physiological improvement was evaluated using manometric and electromyographic evaluation of her pelvic floor muscles. Results: After the patients first session, the patient reported frequent and soft bowel movements, indicative of significant improvement of her constipation. Patient began psychotherapy during her second session and after her 4th session she was able to insert a tampon for the first time in her life without pain. Patient progressively improved and after her 6th visit the patient began physical therapy. After her ninth session the patient was able to consummate her marriage and conceive her first child. Conclusions: Treatment of vaginismus with a multidisciplinary team approach has been beneficial in the treatment of refractory vaginismus.

N2  - Background: Detailed associations between physical activity (PA) subcomponents, sedentary time, and body composition in preschoolers remain unclear. Objective: We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration. Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine whether they were independently related to adiposity. Results: VPA was the only intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity [P<0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P<0.077). No associations were shown between the time spent sedentary and body composition (P<0.11). Conclusions: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate-intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity. These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit from prioritizing VPA. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.

N2  - Objective To assess the current state of knowledge regarding sleep disorders and their relationship to obstetric outcomes. Study Design A systematic literature review of the previous two decades (1991 to 2010) was conducted. The exposure was sleep disorders during pregnancy, and the outcomes of interest were feto-infant morbidity and maternal complications. Results Sleep apnea, snoring, and sleep quantity/duration were identified as the most frequently examined sleep disorders among pregnant women. Although our review found that studies examining the impact of sleep disorders on feto-infant outcomes were lacking, previous research indicates that such disorders may enhance the risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the current body of evidence suggests that sleep disorders adversely impact maternal health, increasing the likelihood of preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Conclusion Existing research points to the potentially harmful effects of sleep disorders on obstetric outcomes. The limited research in this arena highlights the need for further studies regarding the nature and strength of this relationship. Given the multiple dimensions of sleep and pregnancy, multivariate research approaches that incorporate biological and psychosocial factors are warranted.

N2  - Data about circadian blood pressure (BP) in normotensive patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are lacking. Thus, we sought to compare dipper and nondipper circadian variation of BP profile between normotensive women complicated with GDM and normal pregnant women. Forty-two women with GDM and 33 normal uncomplicated pregnant women who met the entry criteria for the study were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography to measure the left ventricle mass index and diastolic parameters were performed. Nocturnal blood pressure dipping was calculated as follows: (awake BP-sleep BP) × 100/awake BP. Patients with a nocturnal reduction in average daytime systolic BP and diastolic BP of less than 10% were classified as nondippers. Left ventricle mass index was higher in normotensive pregnant women with GDM group than in normal pregnant subjects (101.98 ± 24 g/m2 vs. 90.67 ± 15 g/m 2, P < .018). Significant nocturnal systolic and diastolic nondippings were observed in GDM groups compared with normal subjects. From diastolic variables, the mitral E velocity and isovolumetric relaxation time were compatible with diastolic dysfunction relaxation abnormalities (P = .003 and P = .015, respectively) in nondipper group. From all confounding factors, only E velocity (P = .002) and diagnosis of GDM (P < .001) were predictive of nondipper circadian variation. This study shows that (i) circadian BP is impaired in normotensive pregnant subjects with GDM, (ii) the left ventricle mass index is higher in pregnant subjects with GDM than in normal pregnant subjects who despite a 24-hour BP are within normal limits, and (iii) in nocturnal nondipper group, the tendency to having diastolic relaxation abnormalities is noted. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Background: Dysregulated cortisol profiles are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep disturbance in non-pregnant individuals dysregulates cortisol profiles. Sleep disturbance is common in pregnancy but the association between sleep disturbance and cortisol has not been prospectively examined in pregnant women. Methods: Women's (n=82) self-reported sleep, negative affect and cortisol were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy (6-14; 22-26; 32-36 weeks gestation). Subjective sleep reports were collected on 2 consecutive week days while affect and cortisol were assessed 5 times each day X 2 days, within each trimester. Data Analysis: Multilevel regression models were used to determine if sleep duration, quality, and disruption were associated with alterations in the cortisol trajectory on the following day, and if these associations were altered by between-person differences in negative affect. Results: Sleep duration, but not sleep quality or sleep disruption, was associated with changes in the cortisol trajectory. Shorter sleep duration was associated with lower waking levels (β=.001, p<.05), but higher levels 30 min post waking (β=-.001, p<.01); a sharper decline over the course of the day (β=-.0005, p<.01), and attenuation of this decline toward the evening (β=.00003, p<.01) compared to longer sleep duration. After controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI and obstetric history, individual differences in negative affect altered the association between sleep duration and cortisol. Women with shorter sleep duration and lower negative affect had the highest cortisol levels 30 min post waking and the flattest daytime trajectories, whereas women with longer sleep duration and higher negative affect had a blunted awakening response and the steepest decline in daytime cortisol (see Figure 1). Discussion: Sleep disruption and negative affect during pregnancy are recognized correlates of adverse obstetric outcomes. We found that short sleep duration was associated with a larger CAR and higher evening cortisol levels, and that negative affect moderated these associations. While these findings are consistent with those reported for non-pregnant individuals, we further contend that they may be particularly relevant in pregnancy. Sleep disturbance and negative affect in pregnancy may dynamically dysregulate cortisol thereby increasing risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Extreme variability in sleep duration and/or fragmentation impacts behavior, affect, physiology, and disease risk. Pregnant women in early gestation are at an increased risk for sleep variability given the profound physiological changes that take place following conception. Extreme variability may act as a psychological as well as physiological stressor impacting risk for adverse outcomes. No investigations have examined the degree to which pregnant women experience sleep variability nor have any examined whether sleep variability results in immunological changes important for a successful pregnancy. Sleep diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep data collected from 78 pregnant women at 10-12 weeks'(T1), 14-16 weeks'(T2), and 18-20 weeks'(T3) gestation were assessed for intra-individual variability, estimated from each subject's standard deviation on diary (D) and actigraphy (A)measures. Morning blood samples for assay of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were collected at the end of each 2-week period. Preliminary analyses indicate that pregnant women do indeed experience substantial variability in their sleep, and that greater variability in both D-and Asleep variables are cross-sectionally associated with higher circulating cytokine concentrations. At T1 greater variability in D-assessed sleep efficiency (r = .29, p = .03) were associated with higher IL-6, while greater variability in TIB was associated with higher IL-6 (r = .26, p = .05) and TNF-α (r = .23, p = .04). At T2 greater variability in Dassessed sleep efficiency was associated with higher TNF-α (r = .23, p = .03), whereas greater variability in A-assessed sleep efficiency (r = .38, p = .03) and WASO (r = .41, p = .02), and percentage of time spent awake (r = .40, p = .02) were associated with higher IFN-γ. At T3 greater variability in D- and A-assessed sleep latency was associated with higher IL-6 (r = .30, p = .01; r = .32, p = 01), while D WASO was associated with lower TNF-α (r = -.24, p = .03). Extreme sleep variability may be another form of stress experienced by pregnant women. Importantly, stress is a recognized correlate of an increase in circulating inflammatory markers and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Mexican Americans are the fastest growing population in the US (Ennis, Rios-Vargas & Albert, 2010). Mexican-American women have high birth rates per capita and adverse perinatal outcomes. It has been suggested that these adverse perinatal outcomes, such as stress and depression, may be related to changes in sleep during pregnancy, but this has yet to be investigated. The present study examined if changes in sleep relate to stress, depression, and other negative perinatal outcomes in pregnant Mexican-American women. It was hypothesized that disruptive changes in the quality and quantity of sleep would alter levels of depression and stress during pregnancy as well as gestational age and birthweight of offspring. Pregnancy specific stress levels and depressive symptoms were measured via the New Prenatal Distress Questionnaire Revised (NUPDQ) and the Edinburg Postnatal Scale of Depression (EPDS) during early, mid, and late pregnancy (15-19, 26- 29, and 32-36 weeks gestation) in 43 Mexican-American women. Across three days at each time point, women also self-reported on quantities of sleep as well as quality of sleep on a 7-point Likert scale in a daily sleep diary. Values were averaged across three days per time point. Correlational analyses revealed that low birthweight was associated with more hours slept in early (r=0.36, p=0.02) and mid pregnancy (r=0.37, p=0.01). In addition, early gestational age was associated with waking less refreshed (r=0.40, p=0.01) and increased pregnancy specific stress in mid pregnancy (r=-.367, p=.01). Changes in sleep and pregnancy specific distress were adversely related throughout pregnancy such that waking less refreshed in early pregnancy was associated with increased pregnancy specific stress in mid pregnancy ( r=-0.33, p=.04) and pregnancy specific stress in early pregnancy was associated increased the hours slept in mid pregnancy (r=0.40, p=.008). Mid pregnancy stress levels were also associated with increased hours slept (r=0.40, p=.009). It was also found that a higher average level of depression was associated with more restful sleep (r=.356, p=.013). This report of stabilized values may be due the stigma of depression in this culture. The data suggests stress may be a better indicator of adverse outcomes than depression, and variations in sleep patterns and sleep quality early in the prenatal period may affect maternal and infant outcomes. It is imperative to examine the underlying culprits of maternal stress and depression as it may have long lasting effects not only on the mother, but also on the unborn child.

N2  - Background: Two recent case-control studies1,2 have reported that maternal sleep position may be associated with increased risk of stillbirth. Questions arising from these studies are (1) Is self-reported sleep position well correlated with actual sleep position? and (2) if a pregnant woman is asked to sleep on her left can she comply? Method: 30 women in their third trimester of an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy were recruited. They were asked to settle to sleep on their left and if they woke overnight to re-settle on their left. Participants also kept a sleep position diary to record perceived left sleeping time, side of bed, bed fellows, and pillow use. Actual sleep position was determined via infra-red video camera. Results: At time of abstract submission, 16 of the 30 participant's video data have been analysed. There was a moderate correlation (sig 0.05 (2-tailed) between subjective left sleep time and actual left sleep time (r = 0.530 n = 16 p = 0.035). Once video data analysis is complete (Dec 2012) other data analysis including correlation between side of bed, presence of bed fellow, and pillows will be conducted and presented at the congress. Conclusions: It appears from the preliminary analysis that women can quite accurately estimate how much time they have spent sleeping on their left. Therefore if further research finds that left sided sleep position is a modifiable preventative factor for stillbirth maternity care providers can be reasonably confident that pregnant women can accurately estimate time spent in the left sided sleep position.

N2  - Background: Modafinil (Provigil) was marketed in the UK in 1998 to promote wakefulness in the treatment of narcolepsy. In April 2004, the licence was extended to include chronic pathological conditions; 2 years later, the prescription of modafinil was restricted to patients with shift work sleep disorder, narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Following a recent review of the safety data, the licence has been further restricted to only treat patients with narcolepsy. The review highlighted the degree of off-label usage of modafinil, including patients with multiple sclerosis. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the safety profile of modafinil in real-world clinical usage and across a range of prescribing indications, including multiple sclerosis. Methods: The study was conducted using the observational cohort technique of Modified Prescription-Event Monitoring. Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions issued by primary care physicians from July 2004 to August 2005. Patient demographics and information on prescribing behaviour were included in the questionnaire sent to the prescribing general practitioner (GP) 6 months after the initial prescription for each patient. The questionnaire sought data on any events that patient may have experienced during that time, reasons for stopping treatment with modafinil, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), potential interaction with contraceptives, and pregnancies. Incidence densities (IDs) were calculated for all events, and stratified according to indication and dose. Specific events were evaluated by requesting further information. Results: Of the 4,023 questionnaires sent to GPs, 2,416 were returned (response rate 60.1 %). Of these, only those patients issued modafinil after April 2004 (with the associated broadening of the indications for treatment) were included in the study, resulting in a final cohort of 1,096 patients: 497 (45.3 %) male, median age of 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41-63), and 599 (54.7 %) female, median age of 47 years (IQR 38-57). Nine patients were aged 16 years or younger; no serious skin reactions were reported in this group. Thirty-four percent of the cohort had an indication of multiple sclerosis. In this study, the majority of the clinical events that were most frequently reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping or that occurred in month 1 have been previously documented with modafinil. The results of the study show that less than half of the women of child-bearing potential were established on a recommended contraceptive programme; three women became pregnant whilst taking modafinil and the oral contraceptive pill. Stratification of IDs by dose revealed certain additional events occurred during month 1 of treatment at the higher dose only. Assessment of individual cases of cardiac, psychiatric and skin events indicated causal associations with modafinil. Conclusions: This study provides important additional safety data on the use of modafinil in patients in 'real-world' use, including those for whom the prescribing indication is outside the terms of licence, as per recent changes to the licensed indications for treatment. In addition to safety data, our study provides useful utilization data. Results from this study indicate that a significant number of women of child-bearing potential had not been commenced on appropriate contraceptive programmes prior to starting modafinil. There were three pregnancies that occurred whilst taking contraception, highlighting the necessity of ensuring effective contraceptive cover for women during and after stopping treatment with modafinil. Analysis of the data showed that the majority of events reported as ADRs or reasons for stopping and ranked events during the first month of treatment had been previously documented with the use of modafinil. Stratification of events according to dose revealed a number of events that occurred at the higher dose only, including serious events such as psychosis. The targeted events for which causality assessments were undertaken confirmed the potential of modafinil to induce certain types of events in individual patients, including cardiac and psychiatric events. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by repeated periods of upper airway obstruction with resulting hypoxia and hypercapnoea. 1 Potential consequences of chronic OSA include hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risk. An association between sleep-disordered breathing (SBD), including OSA, and adverse pregnancy outcomes has recently been noted.2-4 Although the prevalence of OSA in the general female population is between 2 and 5%, there are few data regarding the incidence of OSA in pregnancy. At present, there are no specific guidelines for screening pregnant patients for OSA. Since snoring, daytime fatigue, and non-refreshing sleep are almost universal in late pregnancy, the value of screening questionnaires is questionable. The standard method of diagnosis is spending time in a sleep laboratory (polysomnography), and this is expensive and disruptive. There are also delays in gaining access to sleep laboratories that are incompatible with the short timeframe in pregnancy. Methods: Recently, portable devices designed to screen for OSA have become available on the market. A simple and inexpensive device is the ResMed ApneaLink™ monitor. This device was designed to act as a screening tool to identify patients at risk of OSA. It is a compact device that is easy to use at home, without the need for inpatient sleep study (polysomnography). In addition to flow and snoring, the unit records pulse and pulse oximetry. At the completion of a night's recording, it generates a single-page summary report identifying periods of apnoea and generating a risk profile for OSA. During this ongoing trial, women and their sleep partners are given a standard questionnaire to complete, and are asked to use the ApneaLink™ device for one night during the third trimester. The report is downloaded the following morning and discussed with the women. Results: All participants have found the device easy to use and no technical problems have been encountered. During the initial study period, one woman went on to formal polysomnography and was diagnosed with OSA. She was managed with CPAP for the remainder of the pregnancy, and no adverse outcome was recorded. Conclusions: This ongoing study has revealed that women find the ApneaLink™ home sleep study device acceptable and easy to use. Once this pilot program is complete, we will be seeking partner institutions and funding for a larger formal study.

N2  - The existence of a renal “nongastric” H,K-ATPase (HKA2) has been puzzling for decades. Indeed, whereas its stimulation in response to K depletion is well established, HKA2 null-mice do not display a clear renal phenotype under these conditions. This last result had raised doubts about its physiological relevance until now and we started to revisit this problematic. Recently, we identified progesterone as an adrenal mediator that is produced in response to K depletion and that activates the renal expression of HKA2. In this situation, acutely preventing progesterone from acting abolishes the stimulation of HKA2 and leads to a higher urinary K loss. This finding led us to investigate the role of renal HKA2 during pregnancy. We indeed found that the renal HKA2 is stimulated during gestation and that its absence, in the HKA2-null mice, leads to gestational problems (decreased fertility, increased maternal mortality) that correlate with an impaired K balance. Finally, we identified the renal HKA2 as a component of the renal adaptation to the circadian rhythm, which allows the organism to maintain stable the plasma K levels during rest periods by mediating K reabsorption when K intake is low. These recent results indicate that the renal HKA2 is not an epiphenomenon and plays important physiological roles.

N2  - Aims: To study correlation of anxiety, alertness & excessive day time sleepiness in third trimester of pregnancy & its comparison with pre-pregnancy period. Objectives: Sleep problems in pregnancy are common, with most pregnant women reporting declining sleep quality & increased night waking especially in the third trimester. Insomnia & increased wakefulness after sleep onset can result from various potential causes including gastro-esophageal reflux, discomfort, frequent micturition, dyspnoea & minimally due to Anxiety. Poor sleep quality & lowered sleep duration are associated with a higher incidence of pre-term birth, gestational hypertension as well as gestational diabetes in late pregnancy. Methods: Third trimester pregnant women (n=50) were selected of age group 24-30 years having normal Body Mass Index. Questionnaires were used to calculate score of Anxiety by Hamiltons anxiety rating scale, Alertness by Stanfords sleepiness scale and sleepiness by Epworths sleepiness scale. Results Before pregnancy, the mean reported duration of night-time sleep was 8.1hours (SD 1.1). Only 29% rated their sleep quality in the last week as very good or fairly good, compared with 82% rating their sleep this way before the pregnancy. The main reason for sleeping difficulties were discomfort (64%), Pain (32%), & increased anxiety (2%). Only 4% of women had an abnormal Epworths sleeping scale score (i.e.≥10) prior to pregnancy, whereas in last week 33% scored in abnormal range. Likewise 5% had regularly napped during day time before pregnancy, compared with 41% in last week. Conclusion: Sleep problems are common in women in late pregnancy & increased markedly compared with before pregnancy and are minimally related to anxiety.

N2  - Aim To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally have impaired arousal responses from sleep. Methods The polygraphic nap studies involved 42 infants aged 3 months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds measured. Results Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001). No significant differences in arousal threshold were found between methamphetamine and comparison groups, before or after controlling for other substance use (NREM sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.59 and REM sleep; 1.03, 95% CI, 0.56-1.89). Conclusions These findings suggest that arousal responses of methamphetamine-exposed infants remain intact, providing no support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure could increase their vulnerability to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal deficits. ©2012 The Author(s)/Acta Pædiatrica ©2012 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

N2  - Background: The management of pregnancy in patients with narcolepsy poses many questions regarding therapy, including the risk to the mother and fetus related to the disease, potential risks at the time of conception, the risk to both the mother and the fetus of the medications used to treat narcolepsy, and the risk to the infant from medications that might be secreted in breast milk. There are no detailed practice parameters on the treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy. We surveyed narcolepsy specialists from around the world to determine their clinical approach to the management of patients with narcolepsy at the time of conception, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Methods: Survey invitations were sent via e-mail to 75 clinicians worldwide between 2/2011 and 3/2011 with 34 responses (USA, n= 10; Brazil, n= 3; Czech Republic, n= 2; France, n= 2; Italy; n= 2; Netherlands, n= 2; Canada, n= 1; Denmark, n= 1; Finland, n= 1; Germany, n= 1; Japan, n= 1; Spain, n= 1; unknown n= 7). Responders who completed the survey had 20. years (median range, 5-35) of experience in sleep medicine practice with a median number of five narcolepsy patients seen per week. The number of pregnant narcoleptic patients followed per physician was five (median range 1-40). Results: The survey results indicated that the management of patients with narcolepsy varies greatly from clinician to clinician and from country to country. The majority of the clinicians stopped the narcolepsy medications at the time of conception, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding some reduced the dose and others did not change the dosage, depending on the particular medication. Conclusions: The findings from our survey and literature review suggest that the perceived risks of narcolepsy medication during pregnancy to the mother and the fetus usually are overestimated, as the risk for teratogenic effects from narcolepsy medications in therapeutic doses is essentially nonexistent. However, the potential for rare complications during pregnancy and congenital abnormalities cannot be excluded. Most narcolepsy patients have vaginal delivery without complications. In rare cases patients had cataplexy that interfered with delivery, but if caesarian is required there appears to be no increased anaesthetic or surgical risks. Further prospective information for the appropriate treatment of narcolepsy patients during pregnancy is needed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective To describe the prevalence of, reasons given for, and factors associated with sick leave during pregnancy. Design Longitudinal, population-based descriptive study. Setting Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Population All women scheduled to give birth at the hospital (November 2008 to April 2010). Methods Consenting women were handed a questionnaire at the routine ultrasound check at 17 weeks of gestation. Women returning this questionnaire received a second questionnaire at 32 weeks of gestation. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations with somatic, psychiatric and social factors. Main outcome measures Rates and duration of sick leave. Results By 32 weeks of gestation, 63.2% of the 2918 women included were on sick leave, and 75.3% had been on sick leave at some point during their pregnancy. Pelvic girdle pain and fatigue/sleep problems were the main reasons given for sick leave. Being on sick leave in all trimesters was strongly associated with hyperemesis, exercising less than weekly, chronic pain before or during pregnancy, infertility treatment (all P < 0.001); younger maternal age, conflicts in the workplace (both P < 0.01); multiparity, previous depression, insomnia and lower education (all P < 0.05). Sick leave was associated with elective caesarean section and higher infant birthweight (P < 0.01). Adjustment of the work situation was associated with 1 week shorter duration of sick leave. Conclusions Most women receive sick leave during pregnancy, but sick leave might not be caused by pregnancy alone. Previous medical and psychiatric history, work conditions and socio-economic factors need to be addressed to understand sick leave during pregnancy. © 2012 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2012 RCOG.

N2  - Dysfunction of the circadian clock genes is involved in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and T2D share common genetic and phenotypic features, in the present study, we investigated the status of the circadian clock in a cohort of 40 Greek pregnant women with GDM, four with T2D and 20 normal controls. Peripheral blood mRNA transcript levels of 10 clock genes (CLOCK1, BMAL1, PER1, PER2, PER3, PPARα, PPARD, PPARG, CRY1 and CRY2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. GDM patients expressed significantly lower transcript levels of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD and CRY2 compared to control women (p<0.05). No significant difference was documented between GDM women maintained either under insulin treatment or diet. A positive correlation was found between the expression of BMAL1 versus CRY2 (r=0.45, p=0.003) and BMAL1 versus PPARD (r=0.43, p=0.004). Further investigation on the functional relevance of these clock genes, disclosed that expression of PER3 correlated negatively with HbA1C levels (r=-0.36, p=0.022). These data document for the first time that the expression of BMAL1, PER3, PPARD and CRY2 genes is altered in GDM compared to normal pregnant women and support the notion that deranged expression of clock genes may play a pathogenic role in GDM. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

N2  - Sleep disturbances including insomnia, sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness are common for women during pregnancy. Disturbed sleep has been shown to adversely impact quality of life and daily functioning in various populations. Studies addressing the prevalence and factors associated to sleep disturbances in men during the transition to parenthood are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances in men expecting their first child and to identify factors associated with poor sleep quality. Couples expecting their first child were recruited from local prenatal classes and university affiliated obstetric/gynecology and ultrasound clinics. One hundred and forty-two men (mean age = 34.1, SD= 5.8) completed an on-line survey during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. The survey included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), measures assessing depression, trait anxiety, social support, marital satisfaction, physical activity, and questions about smoking and alcohol consumption. Logistic regression examined correlates of poor sleep. The mean global PSQI score was 3.4 (SD = 1.7) and selfreported sleep duration was 7.7 hours (SD=1.1). The prevalence of sleep problems defined as PSQI ≥ 5 was 24.6% (n=35). Men who reported more depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.42) and with a higher BMI (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.23) had greater odds of reporting poor sleep quality. Physical activity level, smoking and alcohol consumption were not associated to poor sleep quality. Depressive symptoms and elevated BMI are associated with sleep disturbances in men expecting their first child. Given that sleep quality is likely to worsen following the birth of a child, men who are already experiencing sleep disturbances during their partner's pregnancy may benefit from strategies aimed at alleviating depressed mood and sleep hygiene counseling to improve sleep. Future studies to address the temporality of depressed mood and sleep disturbances in men during the transition to parenthood are needed.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is more prevalent among women with preeclampsia than among normotensive controls. Study design: Preeclamptic patients admitted to the hospital for observation and normotensive, gestational age matched controls hospitalized for obstetrical indications other than preeclampsia were recruited for an overnight sleep evaluation. Watch-PAT100, a validated wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SDB, was used to complete all sleep studies. Results: Twenty preeclamptic patients and 20 controls were recruited. Preeclamptic subjects had a higher mean BMI (32.6 ± 9.5 vs. 24.5 ± 3.5, P = 0.001). Preeclamptic subjects had higher mean respiratory disturbance (RDI, mean difference 4.9 events/hour of sleep), apnea hypopnea (AHI, mean difference 5.7 events/hour of sleep) and oxygen desaturation (ODI, mean difference 4.5 events/hour of sleep) indices, however these differences did not reach statistical significance. Preeclamptic subjects were more likely to have more severe forms of SDB compared to controls (ODI ≥ 5, 20% vs. 0%, p =.047). Conclusion: Compared to normotensive controls, preeclamptic subjects experience more SDB events and a greater degree of nocturnal hypoxemia. Further research is needed to determine if SDB, independent of BMI, is a significant contributing factor to the risk of developing preeclampsia. © 2013 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.
