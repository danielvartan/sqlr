N2  - A Private Matter recounts the true story of Sherri Finkbine (Sissy Spacek), host of Romper Room and happily married mother of four, who is in the first trimester of her fifth pregnancy in 1962. Finkbine confronts issues of reproductive choice as she learns that the tranquilizers she took as sleep aids have been shown to cause birth defects when taken during pregnancy. While she does not waiver on the decision to have an abortion, she struggles against the need for secrecy throughout the process. As she waits for the day of the termination to draw near, the media learn of Finkbine's decision to terminate the pregnancy and become a malingering, pervasive presence throughout the film. The Finkbine's must eventually travel overseas to have the pregnancy terminated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Data from our research are reviewed showing limited attentiveness and responsivity to animate stimuli in newborns of depressed mothers. These include face–voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates’ attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy.

N2  - The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD = 4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD = 1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD =33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman’s sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are modulated in a variety of peripheral tissues, including in the uterus where endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) undergo proliferation and differentiation (decidualization) during gestation. Here the authors focused on circadian rhythms in UESCs during implantation and decidualization in rodents. As revealed by analyses of cultured UESCs from pregnant Per2 promoter–dLuc transgenic rats, Per2 oscillation of ∼24h was observed in response to dexamethasone. Per2 oscillation was enhanced in UESCs during implantation, whereas they were attenuated during decidualization. In vivo studies showed that PER2 protein in the uteri displayed a peak at zeitberger time 4 (ZT 4) (day 4.50 of gestation) and a trough at ZT 12 (day 4.83), indicating its circadian rhythmicity. Conversely, no significant circadian rhythm of the PER2 protein was observed during decidualization. Fluorescent immunohistochemical studies also supported circadian rhythmicity of the PER2 protein in its intracellular distribution. In accordance with Per2 mRNA expression, a circadian rhythm of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) gene expression, having several E-box or E-box–like sites at the upstream of the transcription start site, was observed during implantation, showing a peak at ZT 0 and a trough at ZT 12. In contrast, Vegf mRNA expression displayed no circadian rhythm during decidualization. Collectively, the present results prove that Per2 oscillation is down-regulated in UESCs during decidualization. It is strongly suggested that cellular differentiation in UESCs interferes with circadian clockwork. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The current study compared the performances of pregnant women with education- and age-matched controls on a variety of measures that assessed perceptual speed, short-term and working memory capacity, subjective memory complaints, sleep quality, level of fatigue, executive functioning, episodic and prospective memory, and crystallized and fluid intelligence. A primary purpose was to test the hypothesis of Henry and Rendell (2007) that pregnancy-related declines in cognitive functioning would be especially evident in tasks that place a high demand on executive processes. We also investigated a parallel hypothesis: that the pregnant women would experience a broad-based reduction in cognitive capability. Very limited support was found for the executive functioning hypothesis. Pregnant women scored lower only on the measure of verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) but not on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task or on any working memory measures. Furthermore, group differences in COWAT performance disappeared after controlling for verbal IQ (Shipley vocabulary). In addition, there was no support for the general decline hypothesis. We conclude that pregnancy-associated differences in performance observed in the current study were relatively mild and rarely reached either clinical or practical significance.

N2  - Objective: To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). Study design: The data come from the 1692 participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4 years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058). The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these models. Results: PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and 3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power. Conclusions: Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for internalizing problems.

N2  - Introduction: This article is a review of literature data concerning the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed pregnant women. Literature findings: The adverse effects for the foetus, the newborn and the child were evaluated. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is of around 10 to 20% of the population of childbearing women. Depression is often misdiagnosed and underestimated in pregnant women. Starting a pharmacological treatment for depression in these women is not easy because data concerning the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy are still unclear. The non-treated pathology is associated with higher risk of maternal morbidity, including arterial hypertension, which could lead to preeclampsia or eclampsia, ideation and suicide attempts, and postpartum depression. Foetal development is also affected and adverse outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight, irritability, and sleep disorders are frequent. Pharmacological therapy is necessary when non-pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Suicide attempts and relapse of depression have been described when depressive women stopped their pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women diagnosed with depression must be treated. Selective SSRIs are now largely used in this pathology and have replaced tricyclic antidepressants because of fewer side effects. In general, drugs have a low teratogenic potential, only 4 to 5% of malformations are iatrogenic. Teratogenic risk is high between conception until the end of the second month of gestation. Safety of SSRIs treatment during pregnancy and potential risk for the foetus and newborn were unquestioned before publication, in the late 2005, of some alarming data concerning a possible teratogenic effect. Studies showed an increased risk for all congenital malformations with SSRIs and particularly with paroxetin. A few studies after 2005 have also found an association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs (especially paroxetin) and congenital malformations. However, other studies failed to demonstrate this association and the risk for cardiovascular malformations also does not seem to be significantly increased. Numerous studies in pregnant women have shown that SSRI treatments are associated with a significant increase of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of neonatal behavioural syndrome, including signs of withdrawal or serotonin impregnation. Restlessness, poor tone, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia were the most frequent signs. These symptoms occur during the first days of life and are usually brief and not serious. Recent studies have also documented an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and cases of cerebral haemorrhage have been described. Data concerning a possible effect on motor and cognitive development at school age in children prenatally exposed to SSRIs are limited. Discussion: Although a number of studies revealed that SSRIs are not teratogenic, some of them showed congenital malformations associated with use of these antidepressants; in particular an increased risk of cardiac defects with paroxetin. In practice, the potential risk implies that the decision to treat a pregnant woman with SSRIs (notably paroxetin) should be taken carefully; this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits, adverse effects and possible alternatives. Neonatal toxicity seems to be relatively frequent when SSRIs are prescribed during late pregnancy. For all depressed pregnant women, the severity of the depression must be taken into consideration before introducing a pharmacological treatment. When depressive women are already treated, studies have shown that antidepressants must be maintained during pregnancy to prevent relapse and suicide attempts.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how the past experiences of mothers and their potentially traumatic events during pregnancy may have influenced the processes of psychobiological self-regulation and cognitive development in a child born preterm. Eighty children who had a gestational age of < 32 weeks were examined at the 9th month of the corrected age. The mothers and children were divided in two groups: multipara mothers and their children and the primipara mothers and their children. These children were examined on the basis of sleep disorders, nutritional problems and mental development. Perinatal data from clinical observations and data from standardized developmental tests (BSID, II ed.) were used to describe the differences. The children of primipara mothers who had unexpected preterm delivery presented major incidences of sleep disorders while the children of primipara mothers, who programmed preterm delivery, presented a major incidences of nutrition problems. The predictability of preterm delivery has a major influence on the capacity of newborns for self-regulation in the case of primipara mothers.

N2  - Hormone secretion often occurs in a pulsatile manner. In this review, we discuss two rhythms of in vivo prolactin release in female rats and the ongoing research that we and others have performed aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying them. The peptide hormone oxytocin appears to play an important role in both rhythms. One rhythm occurs during the first half of pregnancy, but can also be induced in ovariectomised rats. This is characterised by a circadian pattern with two prolactin surges per day. Two methods for triggering this rhythm are discussed, each utilising a unique physiological pathway that includes oxytocin action, presumably on pituitary lactotrophs. The second rhythm occurs during the oestrous cycle and is characterised by a surge of prolactin on the afternoon of pro-oestrus. We discuss recent findings that oxytocin is more effective at stimulating prolactin release from lactotrophs taken from animals on the afternoon of pro-oestrus than from those of animals on the morning of dioestrus 1, raising the possibility that this hormone plays a physiological role in the regulation of prolactin secretion during the oestrous cycle.

N2  - The aim of the present work was to investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD). 581 women in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers participated again in the study. Insomnia in pregnancy was not a risk factor for PPD (DSM-IV or ICD-10) but was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Women with higher NA were 4.6 (CI95% = 1.69–12.74) and 5.3 times (CI95% = 2.26–12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (DSM-IV/ICD-10, respectively) than women with lower NA. Lifetime Depression was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and ICD-10/PPD (OR = 2.6; CI95% = 1.16–4.38). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be a protective factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR = 1.5; CI95% = 1.20–2.33). Controlling NA, PA and Lifetime Depression, insomnia lost its predictive role, suggesting these variables might work as mediators. Associations between insomnia, NA, PA and Lifetime Depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The study aimed to document self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, and triggers of epileptic seizures and techniques to control seizures for people with epilepsy, and to establish patterns in these self-reported experiences of epilepsy in relation to age, gender and seizure type. Of the 338 people with epilepsy who had registered interest in participating in social research, 225 returned a self-report questionnaire (66% response rate) that contained information regarding demographic characteristics, living with epilepsy, and self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, triggers of seizures and techniques to control seizures. Of 225 respondents, 195 (86.6%) experienced at least one initial symptom prior to a seizure and 202 (89.8%) experienced at least one seizure trigger. Gender analysis of triggers revealed that females differed from males regarding seizures triggered by low blood sugar, dieting, fasting, touch and female specific triggers (menstruation, pregnancy and ovulation). Respondents reported tiredness as the most frequent trigger (65.3%), followed by stress (64%) and sleep deprivation (55.1%). Many respondents (63.6%) reported that they could predict seizure occurrence, with 91 (40.4%) also indicating that family members could predict seizure occurrence. A total of 157 (69.8%) respondents had tried at least one of 12 possible seizure avoidance techniques, with resting and medication the most frequently reported. Finding that respondents were able to recognise warning signs, initial symptoms and triggers of seizures, and some were able to stop seizures provides scope for developing interventions, such as promoting avoidance of high risk triggers, which supplement existing treatments of epilepsy.

N2  - Objectives: To fully ascertain the familial aggregation of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to characterize the clinical features of familial RLS (fRLS) cases. Design: A case series survey with a high response rate. Setting: Academic research center. Participants: Consecutive RLS probands (n = 249) were followed up in a specialized sleep center for 15 years. A total of 671 cases of fRLS met the current standard diagnostic criteria, including 192 probands characterized using multidimensional clinical assessments and 479 affected family members assessed by their responses to a structured questionnaire telephone diagnostic interview. Main Outcome Measures: Sibling and offspring relative risk ratio and clinical and genetic features of patients with fRLS and families. Results: Our data showed that RLS aggregates in families with a familial rate of 77%, a sibling relative risk of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.4), and an offspring relative risk of 1.8 (1.0-2.7). Familial RLS is a chronic disorder with amean (SD) disease duration of 24(16) years and a wide range of age of onset (mean [SD], 28[15] years), with most family members having early-onset disease but mild to moderate RLS symptoms. Our clinical data also indicated that fRLS is more prominent among women who also had increased incidence of anemia/iron deficiency, arthritis, and number of pregnancies. Pregnancy-related RLS seems to be a characteristic feature of fRLS, and afflicted women tend to have a much younger age of onset. Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome significantly aggregated in families with variable phenotypic expressivity, and the siblings of severely affected individuals have an increased risk of developing the disease.

N2  - Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1–10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4 lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7 lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology.

N2  - Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child’s sleep 4–7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ≥20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2009-05631-016). Using a nationwide population-based dataset, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of low birth weight (LBW). This study linked the 2001 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data set with Taiwan’s birth and death certificate registries. In total, 220 465 singleton live births were included. The key dependent variable was whether or not an infant’s father was diagnosed with schizophrenia, while the independent variable of interest was whether an infant had LBW. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of LBW, after adjusting for the infant and parents’ characteristics. The results show that infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were more likely to have LBW than those whose fathers did not (12.6% vs 8.0%). Infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were found to be 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.10–2.52, P < .05) times more likely to have LBW than their counterparts whose fathers did not have schizophrenia, following adjustment for gestational week at birth, parity, paternal age and highest educational level, family monthly incomes, and marital status. We conclude that the offspring whose fathers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia had increased risk of LBW compared with those whose fathers had no schizophrenia. This finding paves the way for further studies and suggests that there may be potential benefit to early intervention to prevent LBW in pregnant women with husbands with schizophrenia.

N2  - All adult mammals examined thus far exhibit sleep bout durations that follow an exponential distribution and wake bout durations that follow a power-law distribution. In altricial rodents such as rats and mice, exponential distributions of sleep bouts are found soon after birth, but the power-law distribution of wake bouts does not emerge until the third postnatal week. Also, both sleep and bouts consolidate across the early postnatal period. It is not known whether similar developmental processes occur in precocial species during the prenatal period. Here we characterize sleep–wake development in a precocial species, the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), from 114 to 148 days gestational age (DGA). Sleep and wake bout durations exhibited exponential distributions throughout the fetal period with some evidence of an emerging exponential-to-power-law transition for wake bouts toward the end of gestation. Both sleep and wake bouts consolidated in an orderly fashion across development and there was little evidence of circadian variation, even in the oldest subjects. These results indicate that similar patterns of sleep–wake organization are found prenatally in a precocial species as are found postnatally in altricial species. Data from more species are needed to fully realize the benefits of a developmental comparative approach for understanding the forces that have shaped the ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian sleep.

N2  - Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits in adolescents and adults that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions. This study investigated whether sleep deprivation during the pre-implantation stage of development alters the physiological, behavioral and oxidative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. One group of dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 6h on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). After sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone concentrations were measured from the experimental mothers and time-matched controls. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At PND 90, behavioral (Activity Box and Elevated Plus Maze) and biochemical parameters were assessed. The dams’ plasma progesterone concentrations decreased in the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol increased in GH 2. Corticosterone levels were found to increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 group. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure to sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissue weight; in particular, there was a decrease in hemilateral epididymal fat weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. Although some of the alterations observed in the mothers (elevated estrogen and corticosterone levels and decreased progesterone) might have played a role in the permanent alterations in the adult offspring, they were not the main cause. The homocysteine changes detected in the sleep-deprived dams may contribute to redox changes, controlling gene expression and shaping epigenetic development.

N2  - Keenan and colleagues (1998) have demonstrated that episodic memory is diminished during pregnancy and returns to baseline in the postpartum period. Given that memory deficits may occur in major depression, possible memory deficits during pregnancy could be exacerbated by major depression. The present study examined memory performance in 37 pregnant women, 14 of whom met clinical criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and 23 normal control (NC) pregnant women who had no current or prior history of depression. Additionally, postpartum groups consisted of 21 postpartum women, 11 of whom met clinical criteria for a MDE, and 10 NC postpartum women. The study utilized a 2 x 2 Multivariate Analysis of Variance design to compare memory performance and sleep of pregnant and postpartum women with and without major depression. The study demonstrated that pregnancy and major depression were both associated with poorer performance in a task involving verbal learning and memory. Specifically, on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), pregnant women learned significantly fewer words from trials one through five; recalled significantly fewer words on trial one, short delay free and cued recall, and long delay free and cued recall; and utilized a semantic clustering strategy significantly fewer than postpartum women. Depressed patients learned significantly fewer words from trials one through five, recalled significantly fewer words on CVLT long delay free recall, and utilized a semantic clustering strategy significantly fewer than NC women. No alterations in outcomes of the above analyses were found when age, education, weeks pregnant/postpartum, or circadian preference were applied as covariates. The present results are consistent with previous investigations of memory functioning of major depressive disorder and healthy pregnant and postpartum women. That is, pregnant and depressed women exhited poorer performance in tasks involving verbal learning and memory compared with postpartum and NC women.

N2  - Study Objectives: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Clinic-based study. Participants: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. Measurements and Results: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (≤6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting ≤6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (≥10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (<5 h) and long (≥10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

N2  - We studied the effects of adverse conditions such as constant light (LL) on the circadian rhythm of malate (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37) and lactate (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) dehydrogenase activities of the testes of male Wistar rats on postnatal day 28 (PN28), anxietylike behavior (elevated plus-maze test) at PN60 and sexual behavior at PN120. The rats were assigned to mother groups on day 10 of pregnancy: control (12-h light/dark), LL (light from day 10 to 21 of pregnancy), and LL+Mel (LL and sc injection to the mothers of a daily dose of melatonin, 1 mg/kg body weight at circadian time 12, from day 17 to 21 of pregnancy). LL offspring did not show circadian rhythms of MDH (N = 62) and LDH (N = 63) activities (cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher). They presented a 44.7% decrease in open-arm entries and a 67.9% decrease in time (plus-maze test, N = 15, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test), an increase in mounting (94.4%), intromission (94.5%) and ejaculation (56.6%) latencies (N = 12, P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test) and lower numbers of these events (61, 59 and 73%, respectively; P < 0.01, N = 12) compared to controls. The offspring of the LL+Mel group presented MDH and LDH circadian rhythms (P < 0.05, N = 50, cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher), anxiety-like and sexual behaviors similar to control. These findings supported the importance of the melatonin signal and provide evidence for the protective effects of hormones on maternal programming during gestation. This protective action of melatonin is probably related to its entrainment capacity, favoring internal coupling of the fetal multioscillatory system.

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between pregnancy physical discomforts experienced during the second trimester and late pregnancy depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effect of sleep quality on antenatal depressive symptomatology. Healthy pregnant women (N = 257) completed the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Inventory at early–mid second trimester, and then again at late third trimester. Physical symptoms and sleep quality at the first time point were both correlated moderately with depressive symptoms at late pregnancy. Discomfort associated with physical symptoms was a better predictor of depressive symptoms than Frequency of symptoms, although a score combining Frequency, Discomfort and Effect of symptoms on life was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses of the mediation model indicated that physical symptoms at early–mid second trimester predicted depressive symptoms in the last trimester both directly, and via poor sleep quality (prospectively), which mediated the relationship. The clinical implications of these findings for antenatal care are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Adult neurogenesis occurs in two privileged microenvironments, the hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricle. This review focuses on accumulating evidence suggesting that the activity of specific brain regions or bodily states influences SVZ cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin have been shown to have long-range effects through neuronal projections into the SVZ. Local γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have demonstrated effects on SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, but an extra-niche source of these neurotransmitters remains to be explored and options will be discussed. There is also accumulating evidence that diseases and bodily states such as Alzheimer’s disease, seizures, sleep and pregnancy influence SVZ cell proliferation. With such complex behavior and environmentally-driven factors that control subregion-specific activity, it will become necessary to account for overlapping roles of multiple neurotransmitter systems on neurogenesis when developing cell therapies or drug treatments.

N2  - CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care pediatrician with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, “I hate having to go to the nurse’s office to take my albuterol!” His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is afraid to “poison his body with so many chemicals.” She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new doctor is “cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician.” Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo’s condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy, she induced her son’s asthma. Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a nonallergenic pillow and bed cover. Gerardo’s mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother reported that he was soaked in water and stated, “He knows that he will get sick with asthma if he gets wet!” She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend’s birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his “weak lungs.” She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Maternal malaria is associated with serious adverse pregnancy outcomes. Established means of preventing malaria during pregnancy include intermittent presumptive therapy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) and sleeping under an insecticide treated net (ITN). We sought to identify determinants of preventive use of SP and ITNs during pregnancy among recently pregnant women in Uganda. Additionally, the schedule for administering SP at antenatal care (ANC) visits was determined as was the degree to which self-reported malaria episodes were treated with a recommended antimalarial Utilizing a population-based random sample, we interviewed women living in Jinja, Uganda who had been pregnant in the past year. Among 500 participants, 99% attended at least 1 ANC visit, and 68% were offered SP at least once for prevention. Among women who were offered SP for prevention, 98% of them used it, compared to only 4% of those who were never offered SP (RR: 25.6; 95% CI: 10.9, 60.6). However, SP was administered as directed by the Ugandan guidelines in only 38.6% of women. ITNs were owned by 384 women (77%), of whom 71% reported they always slept under the ITN during pregnancy. Women who owned more than 1 net were slightly more likely to always use one (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), whereas women living in wealthier households were less likely than those in the poorest households (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.97) to always use a net. These observations suggest that women will use SP if provided during ANC, so improving healthcare providers' knowledge about the proper use and administration of SP ought to improve uptake. In contrast, we were unable to pinpoint why a sizable fraction of Ugandan women did not always adhere to recommendations for use of an ITN during pregnancy. In a separate analysis confined to women who reported being treated for an illness believed to be malaria, an antimalarial drug was used to treat 85% of the 637 self-reported episodes. However, only 5.6% of first trimester episodes and 50.2% of second/third trimester episodes were treated with a recommended antimalarial. A contraindicated antimalarial drug was involved in 70% of first trimester episodes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This book presents the treatment "roadmap" implemented by the University of Michigan Comprehensive Depression Center's Treatment Resistant Depression Program, step-by-step guidance that has long eluded clinicians, patients, and their families. Writing across discipline, modality, lifespan, and patient demographics, the authors have compiled the most current thinking on TRD. The authors believe that early intervention is critical, and they advocate strategies for renewed focus on identifying youths who are at risk or already symptomatic. Similarly, they devote chapters to special populations such as pregnant women, older people, and those with comorbidities. Perhaps most useful to patients and their families, the book has a strong self-care orientation, emphasizing the importance of exercise, nutrition, and healthy sleep guidelines. Patients who are actively engaged in managing their disease often have better outcomes. Treatment Resistant Depression is frequently a lifetime diagnosis. The book acknowledges that fact and offers a systematic course of treatment grounded in evidence-based research that is current and comprehensive. Treatment Resistant Depression: A Roadmap for Effective Care offers a new way of conceptualizing an old enemy, and should prove to be an indispensable weapon in the battle.

N2  - Objective: Animal studies have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables. Method: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2 and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, respectively. Results: Despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and regulation of states NBAS clusters (P = .03 and P = .026, respectively). At 1 year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on generalized anxiety (P = .002), particularly in males (P = .009); activity/impulsivity (P = .042); and sleep problems (P = .023) than controls. Conclusions: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to understanding the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the perinatal period. Changes in sleep and sleep quality are typical throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. However, little is known about relationships between insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in perinatal women. The objective of the present study is to characterize the burden of insomnia symptoms in perinatal women seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment and to examine relationships between insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Data from 257 pregnant or postpartum women who sought outpatient psychiatric treatment at a university hospital-affiliated clinic were extracted from an existing clinical management database. Data included validated self-report measures assessing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and generalized anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]). Results: Fifty-two percent of women reported symptoms of insomnia, 75% reported symptoms of depression, and 61% reported symptoms of generalized anxiety. After controlling for PSWQ, the partial correlation between EPDS and ISI was 0.15 and 0.37 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. After controlling for EPDS, the partial correlation between PSWQ and ISI was 0.20 and 0.12 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. Women with clinically significant ISI scores had significantly higher odds for reporting symptoms consistent with depression (odds ratio [OR] 7.7) and generalized anxiety (OR 2.55) compared to women with lower ISI scores. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affected a significant proportion of the perinatal women in this sample. These symptoms are linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety in treatment-seeking pregnant and postpartum women. Perinatal women seen in psychiatric treatment settings should be routinely screened for sleep problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R).Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Sadness scale.Our findings support previous findings of significant links between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with perceived sadness of the infant.

N2  - The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat, this period lasts from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th day of postnatal development. The circadian system of fetuses and newborn pups is entrained mostly by nonphotic maternal cues during prenatal and early postnatal development. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a restricted feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an entraining cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were entrained to an external light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under conditions when the external timing signal was lacking, i.e., under constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad libitum and the experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during their resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of 1-day-old pups. The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept under LD cycle did not notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of pups. The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression did not exhibit circadian rhythms in pups born to mothers maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due to desynchrony among the pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats kept under LL restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock is dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN. However, under conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking, such as LL, regular food intake of the mothers may also play an important role in synchronization of the fetal SCN clock during prenatal ontogenesis.

N2  - Background: Stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the course of pregnancy and on fetal development. There are few studies investigating the outcome of stress reduction interventions on maternal well-being and obstetric outcome. Aims: This study aims (1) to obtain fetal behavioral states (quiet/active sleep, quiet/active wakefulness), (2) to investigate the effects of maternal relaxation on fetal behavior as well as on uterine activity, and (3) to investigate maternal physiological and endocrine parameters as potential underlying mechanisms for maternal–fetal relaxation–transferral. Study design: The behavior of 33 fetuses was analyzed during laboratory relaxation/quiet rest (control group, CG) and controlled for baseline fetal behavior. Potential associations between relaxation/quiet rest and fetal behavior (fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR variation, FHR acceleration, and body movements) and uterine activity were studied, using a computerized cardiotocogram (CTG) system. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and norepinephrine were measured. Results: Intervention (progressive muscle relaxation, PMR, and guided imagery, GI) showed changes in fetal behavior. The intervention groups had higher long-term variation during and after relaxation compared to the CG (p = .039). CG fetuses had more FHR acceleration, especially during and after quiet rest (p = .027). Women in the PMR group had significantly more uterine activity than women in the GI group (p = .011) and than CG women. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones were not associated with fetal behavior. Conclusions: This study indicates that the fetus might participate in maternal relaxation and suggests that GI is superior to PMR. This could especially be true for women who tend to direct their attention to body sensations such as abdominal activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: The goals of this study were to assess: (a) the involvement of fathers and mothers in overall and nighttime infant caregiving; (b) the links between paternal involvement in infant care and infant sleep patterns during the first 6 months. Methods: Fifty-six couples recruited during their first pregnancy, participated in the study. After delivery (1 and 6 months), both parents completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Results: Mothers were significantly more involved than fathers in daytime and nighttime caregiving. A higher involvement of fathers in overall infant care predicted and was associated with fewer infant night-wakings and with shorter total sleep time after controlling for breastfeeding. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental sleep research. Future studies should explore mechanisms underlying the relations between paternal involvement and infant sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by Annemarie M. Visser et al. (see record 2010-22379-012). In their population based study Visser et al. have sought to provide further information regarding the relative incidence of epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysmal events in infancy, exploring associations with prenatal and perinatal factors. The authors have defined paroxysmal events as 'suddenly occurring, mostly short lasting events, with altered consciousness, altered behavior, involuntary movements, altered muscle tone, and a changed breathing pattern alternating with periods during which the symptoms did not occur'. An interesting finding of this study was that preterm birth and low Apgar scores at 1 minute were significantly associated with these events. However, as the authors indicate, a major confounding factor is the possibility that parents of infants who have had a complicated perinatal course are more likely to report events. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and preterm birth were significantly associated with febrile seizures in the first year of life but numbers were small. Episodes during sleep were included in the study but may be difficult to detect reliably since infants are much more likely to be observed closely while awake. Thus, the paper by Visser et al. gives some insight into various paroxysmal disorders by subdividing the disorders into broad categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Approximately 13% of infants born in the United States each year are delivered prematurely, defined as prior to 37 weeks gestation. Among these premature infants, 84% are born between 32 and 36 weeks gestation (Kelly, 2006). Past research has found that the sleep/wake patterns of late-preterm and full-term infants are different (Gossel-Symank, Grimmer, Korte, & Siegmund, 2004; Ingersoll & Thoman, 1999; Ju et al., 1991). However, little is known about psychosocial factors (i.e., maternal sleep-related cognitions and nocturnal behaviors) that may contribute to differences between late-preterm and full-term infant sleep. Few studies have investigated the relations among infant sleep behavior, mothers’ cognitions about infant sleep, and mothers’ sleep-related behaviors in mothers of full-term and late-preterm infants. Information about these relations might contribute to an understanding of why late-preterm infants might sleep less well than full-term infants. Results of this study indicated that while not extensive, a few sleep differences do exist between late-preterm and full-term infants at 6 months of age, with late-preterm infants sleeping more during the day than full-term infants. However, relations between infant sleep and maternal cognitions and nocturnal behaviors are less clear. The current sample of late-preterm infant mothers did not endorse cognitions nor participate in nocturnal behaviors that had been previously associated with poorer infant sleep patterns. In some cases, full-term infant mothers were more likely to report certain cognitions (e.g., doubt) than late-preterm infant mothers. This could be related to the psychopathology that was reported in the current sample of full-term infant mothers, including depression. However, late-preterm infant mothers were more vigilant at night than full-term infant mothers, supporting the idea of a slight maternal expectation of infant vulnerability. Maternal expectations of premature infants in general were also not different between groups with late-preterm infant mothers actually rating unfamiliar full-term infants less favorably than unfamiliar premature labeled infants. While contradictory to what was hypothesized, the findings are in line with research supporting the idea that positive experiences the mothers have had with their own infants would override any negative beliefs held about premature infants. Finally, maternal expectations of infant development also did not differ as was hypothesized. In fact, mothers in the entire sample tended to be accurate reporters of their infant’s developmental abilities. The development of sleep is one of the most important and dramatic processes of infancy and early childhood. The development of sleep/wake patterns in premature infants as an area of research is one that is sparse and the results incongruent. Research investigating sleep in late-premature infants is even less available. Thus, while the current study did not yield a wide range of significant results it is an important first step in continuing to understand the development of sleep patterns in late-premature infants.

N2  - Objective: To examine the adverse psychology and behaviors in pregnant women with different types of behavior and try to provide evidences for the psychological intervention among them. Methods: Totally 1789 pregnant women were selected by convenience sampling and were classified into different types according to the Type A Behavior Pattern Scale (TABS). Their symptoms of depression and anxiety, and coping style were evaluated with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire ( SCSQ). The life events, suicide related psychology and behaviors, self-harm behaviors, and excessive drinking were assessed with the self-made questionnaires. Results: The rates of type A behavior, partial type A behavior, middle type behavior, partial type B behavior, and type B behavior were 2.9%, 19.2%, 4.9%, 40.8% and 32.2%, respectively. The scores of self-rating working pressure, quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, negative coping style, and the number of adverse life events had positive correlation with the scores of TABS (r = 0.08-0.34, P r = -0.09, P Ps < 0.01). Conclusion: The rates of adverse psychology and behaviors in pregnant women with typical type A behavior or partial type A behavior may be higher than others. More concerns should be strengthened to those pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Pain exhibits temporal variations in intensity due to multiple factors, including endogenous neuroendocrine and various external influences that vary over the 24h. Also, medications can vary in potency and/or toxicity according to the time when they are administered. However, there is no consensus among studies regarding the 24-h pattern of analgesia during labor. Taking into account the time-of-day when labor analgesia is administered, this study aimed to answer two questions: (i) Is there diurnal variation in visual analogue scale (VAS)–rated pain relief and duration of intrathecal analgesia in patients undergoing labor analgesia? (ii) If there is, what is the influence of the duration of labor on the diurnal variation of the level of pain relief and duration of intrathecal analgesia? This prospective cohort included 41 healthy, nulliparous women in the first stage of labor undergoing spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia using fentanyl combined with bupivacaine. Subjects had an epidural catheter fitted for additional, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) if their pain relief was unsatisfactory. The number of VAS assessments (n=558) was divided into six time periods of the 24h. The adjusted coefficient of determination (r²), the proportion of the variance explained by the association between the duration of labor and the temporal pattern of the outcomes variable, was 58% (r²=0.58) for pain relief and 44% (r²=0.44) for duration of intrathecal analgesia. The peak effect of labor analgesia occurred between 02:00 and 05:59h. However, the duration of intrathecal analgesia showed two peaks, i.e., at ∼00:00 and ∼12:00h. These results demonstrate that labor analgesia achieved by fentanyl combined with bupivacaine shows a diurnal pattern in pain relief and duration of spinal analgesia. However, part of these temporal patterns was explained by the association with duration of labor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence. Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N = 56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores ≥15 and clinician interview. Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p < .05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (Χ² = 0.98, p = .32). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.

N2  - Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous. The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential source(s) of pregnant women's problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of cortisol, depressed mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory. Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures to detect objective deficits in pregnant women's memory.

N2  - Aims: To perform a large and detailed epidemiologic study on restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in a European country. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was distributed by the medical staff in different outpatient waiting rooms (obstetrics and gynecology department of the university hospital, obstetrics and gynecology department of a private clinic, private midwives, private obstetrician-gynecologists, radiological centers before fetal ultrasound examination and general practitioners) in a French town and its surrounding area (200,000 inhabitants): A woman was considered affected if she met the International RLS Study Group criteria for RLS diagnosis. Results: 1,022 pregnant women living in a French town were included. 24% of women were affected by RLS during their pregnancy. The disease was strongly related to the third trimester of pregnancy and had a significant impact on sleep leading to severe nocturnal and diurnal consequences with a high consumption of sleep medication. Conclusions: RLS affects one quarter of pregnant women, essentially during the third trimester and represents an important public health issue with sleep medication intake.

N2  - Study Objectives: Because the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. Design: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm³ were evaluated. Measurements and Results: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm³ of renal tissue. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

N2  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2–3 months, 4–5 months, and 6–8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant (P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006–2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002–2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - Relationship between major risk factors of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sleep disorders in the infants is the subject of review and discussion. Improper micro-environmental characteristics (especially poor environmental organisation and lack of developmental stimulation), pre-term delivery and/or infant low birth weight, prone sleep position, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and infant–parent(s) bed-sharing are among well-established risk factors of SIDS. These factors may also be associated with sleep disorders in infants, principally with bedtime problems, abnormal night awakenings, and arrhythmic sleep. As an attempt to fix sleep problems, some inexperienced parents may try infant-rearing practices that may only aggravate sleep troubles and lead to further increased risk of SIDS, thus giving start to a vicious circle. Health care providers need to be aware of such situations as an opportunity to provide parents with guidance with respect for individual infant and family characteristics.

N2  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n = 245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The etiology of excessive infant crying is largely unknown. We hypothesize that excessive infant crying may have an early nutritional origin during fetal development. Aims: This study is the first to explore whether (1) maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological well-being during pregnancy affects these associations. Study design: Women were approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n=8266) and to donate a blood sample (n=4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a postpartum questionnaire (±3months; n=5218). Subjects: Pregnant women living in Amsterdam and their newborn child. Outcome measures: Excessive infant crying, defined as crying ≥3h/day on average in the past week. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622 (folate) women. Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age, parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems (OR[95%CI]: Q1=3.31[1.48–7.41]; Q2=2.50[1.08–5.77]; Q3=2.59[1.12–6.00]; Q4=2.77[1.20–6.40]; Q5 = reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger association among women with high levels of psychological problems during pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying. Conclusions: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms: the methionine–homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep–wake rhythm.

N2  - Sex and gender differences occur during normal sleep and at sleep-wake transitions and may influence the prevalence and presentation of sleep disorders across the lifespan. These differences are influenced by neuroanatomy, hormones, and chronobiological and psychosocial factors. Fluctuations in reproductive hormones influence women's sleep during puberty, across menstrual cycles, and throughout pregnancy and menopause (Paul, Turek, & Kryger, 2008). Levels of testosterone change more slowly over the male lifespan, but they also have an influence on sleep. Although understudied, stress, social roles, and other psychosocial issues also influence sleep and may partially explain some of the observed gender differences; and gender differences in sleep or underlying sleep mechanisms may contribute to disorders such as depression that are more prevalent in women. Understanding gender-related differences in sleep and factors that contribute to these differences and their consequences is necessary to guide gender-specific care related to sleep promotion and prevention and management of sleep disorders. The purpose of this chapter is to describe sex and gender differences in normal sleep throughout the lifespan and hormonal changes that affect sleep in women and men that may underlie risk for the development of sleep disorders. In this chapter, gender refers to gender identity within the context of relationships to the society and culture that may evolve over time. The term "sex" is defined by genetic sex, gonadal sex, and phenotypic sex (Paul et al., 2008). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - During the childbearing phase of life, a woman's sleep can be profoundly altered, with increased risk for physical and mental health problems. Poor sleep can adversely affect labor and delivery, lead to poor maternal-infant interactions or poor relationships with other adults, and even affect the infant's growth and development. Hormonal alterations during early pregnancy, enlargement of the fetus during late pregnancy, and a newborn with random patterns of sleeping and feeding contribute to her disrupted sleep. This chapter briefly reviews normal physiological and anatomical changes that occur during pregnancy and discusses common sleep disorders that can occur during pregnancy as well as postpartum. The adverse effects of poor sleep on labor and delivery outcomes are briefly discussed, and postpartum sleep patterns are reviewed within the context of risk for postpartum depression. Throughout this chapter, the nurses' role in sleep promotion is discussed in relation to sleep hygiene behaviors that can be adapted for pregnant women and new mothers and their families during the first 6 months postpartum. The chapter describes alternative strategies nurses can use to safely promote sleep during the perinatal period. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are discussed as they are two of the most critical causes of disturbed sleep during pregnancy and require urgent assessment and referral for effective and non-pharmacologic interventions. The final section of this chapter describes sleep during the postpartum period, when women's experience with sleep deprivation is expected. Strategies to promote sleep and reduce the risk of excessive daytime sleepiness are discussed. Chronic sleep loss may be a risk factor for postpartum depression. Given the increased risk of postpartum depression, all pregnant and postpartum women should be screened for depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether reduced sleep is associated with differences in body composition and the risk of becoming overweight in young children. Design: Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements. Setting: Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants: 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed from age 3 to 7. Main outcome measures: Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry; dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy) measured with questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced risk of being overweight (BMI ≥85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (−0.43, −0.82 to −0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (−0.21, −0.41 to −0.00). Conclusions: Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep problems across development are common, from infancy through adolescence (Meltzer & Mindell, 2006a). Further, the consequences of disrupted or insufficient sleep are numerous, impacting growth, learning, development, and mood (Fallone, Owens, & Deane, 2002). However, youth do not live in isolation, but rather are a part of a family system that is dynamic and interactive. One consequence of sleep problems in youth that has only recently received increasing attention is how sleep disorders or sleep disruptions in youth affect parent sleep and daytime functioning. The purpose of this chapter is to review the existing literature in this area. We will begin with a review of the relationship between sleep in children and their parents using a developmental framework from pregnancy through adolescence. This will be followed by a review of the complex relationship among a child's illness or developmental disorder, the child's sleep, and both parental sleep and daytime functioning. Throughout we will highlight how the treatment of sleep problems in children is essential, resulting in the improvement of not only the child's sleep but also parent sleep and daytime functioning.

N2  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n = 118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Psychotic disorders have a high rate of relapse in the postpartum period for reasons that are unclear, but may be related to changes in sleep patterns that occur during pregnancy and after birth. Understanding of the influence of sleep on postpartum psychosis presentation is limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in sleep/wake activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with a history of psychosis. Methods: Women with a history of bipolar disorder and/or postpartum psychosis (HxW) were recruited (n = 23) together with a control population (CtW) (n = 15). Data on demographic and psychosocial factors, mental health status, and sleep/wake activity were collected at seven timepoints—the last week of each trimester of pregnancy and four times during the postpartum (weeks 1, 4, and 8, and at month 6). Longitudinal data were analysed using an HLM version 6 repeated-measures multilevel model. Results: No significant differences were noted in sleep/wake activity between HxW and CtW. None of the HxW who were taking a mood stabilizer during their pregnancy, including at delivery, relapsed during the study. Of those taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or no medication, 3 relapsed within the first six months and 2 within the first two months. HxW were more likely to report a poor partner relationship than CtW. Conclusion: Results suggest that during the perinatal period, there is no difference in sleep/wake activity in women with a history of a psychotic disorder. Use of mood stabilizer during pregnancy and at delivery appears important in preventing psychotic relapse in the postpartum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
