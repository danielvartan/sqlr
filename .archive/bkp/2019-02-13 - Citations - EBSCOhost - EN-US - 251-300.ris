AB  - Background: Pregnant women with depression and/or anxiety prior to pregnancy are at higher risk of preterm birth, breastfeeding problems, postpartum depression, and disruption of the mother-infant attachment. It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety.Methods/design: The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women ≥18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1.Discussion: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of depression.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02833519 .

AB  - The majority of pregnancy sleep research has been conducted at sea level and relatively low elevations. Pregnancy at higher altitudes has distinctive physiologic attributes that affect perinatal outcomes and have been correlated with the duration and intensity of altitude. The effect of altitude on adult sleep has been studied at various elevations and has unique characteristics that may impact pregnant women. The effect of altitude on sleep during pregnancy is mostly unknown.This dissertation research explored late pregnancy sleep quantity and quality characteristics at moderate altitude by comparing them to a similar sample at sea level, describing associations between moderate altitude sleep parameters and length of labor by self-report and medical records, and testing associations between sleep and pregnancy outcomes (length of labor and mode of delivery) at moderate altitude. Participants were nulliparous third trimester women (n=50) recruited in Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 6910 feet [2106 meters]). A 3-day sleep diary and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were completed between 35 gestational weeks and one week prior to delivery. Descriptive statistics, unpaired t-tests, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, ANCOVA, multiple regression, and logistic regression were utilized.Results showed that after controlling for education, compared to nulliparous women at sea level, women at moderate altitude reported significantly higher sleep disturbance scores. After controlling for infant birth weight, length of labor was associated with the PSQI self-report measure for sleep onset latency. Together, infant birth weight, maternal weight, age, income, and sleep onset latency, hours of sleep, sleep disturbance, and sleep quality accounted for 51.6% of the variance in length of labor. Mode of delivery was also associated with sleep disturbance.

AB  - Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much of the abuse was 'submerged' until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, 'It has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first.' Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as '19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours.' Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League 'extremely helpful and supportive' during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she 'did not feel safe enough' with the obstetrician and nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and 'incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position.' We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, 'I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped.'

AB  - This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of parenting interventions on parent, infant and parent-infant relationship outcome measures for parents of infants under 12 months old. Parent outcomes examined included competence, and confidence; baby outcomes included infant behaviours of crying, settling, and sleeping problems and parent-infant relationship outcomes included parental responsiveness. Systematic searches of five databases were carried out. In total, 36 randomised controlled trials over the past 35 years were included in the meta-analyses, with a total of 4880 participants. Interventions were carried out either during pregnancy or within the first 12 months after birth and involved teaching specific strategies and provision of information on infant development and behaviour. Mean effect sizes were obtained using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was found on parent responsiveness and infant sleep. Potential moderator variables were assessed for these two outcomes using the SEM approach. Results showed that early parenting interventions are effective in improving parental responsiveness ( d = 0.77), and improving or preventing infant sleep problems ( d = 0.24), but not crying problems ( d = 0.27) possibly due to low power. No conclusions could be drawn in regards to parental competence or confidence. Moderator analysis showed that for interventions aimed at improving responsiveness, briefer interventions were more effective than longer ones; and studies published more recently reported smaller effects than older studies. No other moderators influenced the assessed intervention outcomes. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of early parenting interventions for infants under 12 months of age, however future research is needed to assess intervention effects on parental competence and confidence.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, mortality and neurodevelopmental delay. The development of sleep and cardiovascular control are closely coupled and IUGR is known to alter this development. In the long-term, IUGR is associated with altered sleep and an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood. Melatonin plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental animal studies have shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4) discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.

AB  - Thirteen healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, and gross fetal body movement patterns. All fetuses were stimulated during an episode of low fetal heart rate variability (mean minute range less than or equal to 32 milliseconds for greater than or equal to 5 minutes) lasting at least 5 minutes. There was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term FHR variability, number of FHR accelerations, and gross fetal body movements after stimulation. Fetuses made breathing movements more irregularly after vibratory stimulus. We hypothesize that external low-frequency vibratory stimulus, applied during episodes of low fetal heart rate variability, causes a change from a state of quiet sleep to a state of rapid-eye-movement sleep in healthy term fetuses.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with changes in fetal growth trajectory.Study design: Retrospective review of pregnant women who underwent overnight polysomnography. Fetal growth was estimated using sonographic biometric measurements obtained during routine prenatal care. Customized estimated fetal weight and birth weight centiles were calculated and impaired fetal growth was defined as birth weight <10th centile or a slowing of fetal growth by >33% during the last trimester. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between maternal OSA and altered fetal growth after adjusting for potential covariates.Results: There were 48 women without and 31 women with OSA. There were no differences in the proportion of infants with birth weight <10th centile between women with and without OSA (23 vs. 25%, p = 1.0), However, the presence of maternal OSA was predictive of impaired fetal growth (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.6). Logistic regression models were repeated using only a slowing of fetal growth in the 3rd trimester (excluding birth weight <10th centile) and OSA predicted a slowing in fetal growth across the 3rd trimester (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.4). Fourteen additional women were treated with positive airway pressure during pregnancy; fetal growth was not significantly different in these women compared to controls.Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with altered fetal growth, which appears to be ameliorated with use of positive airway pressure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a history of maternal tobacco smoking affected the maturation of arousal responses and whether sleeping position and infant age alters these relations. DESIGN: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth, (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. RESULTS: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions. In infants of non-smoking mothers, arousal thresholds were elevated in the prone position in AS at 2-3 months (p<0.01) and QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and 2-3 months (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.

AB  - Abstract: Aim: To elucidate the changes in the daily variation seen in the autonomic nervous system during pregnancy brought about by maternity yoga and to evaluate how maternal yoga affects stress and sleep. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014. Pregnant women who were attending maternity yoga classes at Palmore Hospital between 20 and 23 weeks’ gestation were enrolled as the yoga group, and a matched control group was also enrolled. Study participants completed questionnaires, including a perceived stress scale and sleep logs, during their second and third trimesters. Heart rate variability and salivary α‐amylase levels were evaluated as stress indices at 20–23 weeks’ gestation, 28–31 weeks’ gestation and 36–40 weeks’ gestation. Results: A total of 38 women were in the yoga group, with 53 in the control group. At 28–31 weeks’ gestation, heart rate variability during night and late‐night periods was significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control group. At 36–40 weeks’ gestation, variability between the morning, afternoon and late night was significantly higher in the yoga group. Salivary α‐amylase levels decreased significantly immediately after practicing yoga during all evaluation periods in the yoga group. Night‐time sleep duration was significantly longer in the yoga group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that practicing yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system during the third trimester of pregnancy, consolidating sleep during the night and decreasing α‐amylase levels, which indicates reduced stress.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future.

AB  - Prenatal sleep disturbance has been associated with undesirable birthing outcomes. To determine the effectiveness of listening to music at home in improving sleep quality, 121 Taiwanese pregnant women with poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] score > 5) were systematically assigned, with a random start to music listening (n = 61) or control (n = 60) group. Participants in the music listening group self-regulated listening to music in addition to receiving general prenatal care similar to that in the control group for 2 weeks. The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes. ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that 2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants’ journals also implied that the expectant mothers’ choices of musical genres may correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with their unborn child.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effects of a community-based mutual health organization (MHO) on utilization of priority health services, financial protection of its members and inclusion of the poor and other target groups.Methods: Four MHOs were established in two districts in Mali. A case-control study was carried out in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787 non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period. Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as determined through a household survey in 2004.Findings: MHO members who were up to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal visits; and twice as likely, if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P<0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries. Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOs seemed to provide some financial protection for their members.Conclusion: MHOs are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use to increase financial access to -- and equity in -- priority health services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the neurophysiologic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use. The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central nervous system development. METHODS: In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were full-term, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34). RESULTS: Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be detected with quantitative EEG measures.

AB  - Ventilated preterm infants are usually placed supine which might increase energy expenditure due to lowered self-control of infant behaviors in response to environmental stimulation. To determine a better position for ventilated preterm infants, this study was done: (1) to compare the effect of supine and prone position on factors which impact energy conservation, including motor activity, behavioral state, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate (HR); and (2) to examine relationships among these variables.Twenty-eight premature infants undergoing intermittent mandatory ventilation were included. Inclusion criteria were: <36 weeks gestation, <seven days postnatal age, no sedation or congenital abnormalities, and parental consent.A two-period crossover was used. Each infant was randomly assigned to position sequence: supine/prone or prone/supine. Infants were placed supine for two hours and prone for two hours. During the study protocol, care procedures were minimized and ventilator weaning did not occur.Most hypotheses were supported. When infants were prone, compared to supine, they had (a) less motor activity (1.11 vs. 2.16, p < .001), (b) less crying (6% vs. 12%, p < .05), less active sleep (24% vs. 43%, p < .001), and more quiet sleep (68% vs. 40%, p < .001), (c) less signs of behavioral stress (8.9 vs. 27.3, p < .001), (d) higher SpO2 (96.5% vs. 95.7%, p < .01) and (e) fewer oxygen desaturation event, defined as SpO2 <90% and >=20 seconds (.86 vs. 4.47, p < .01). No significant differences were found in HR and frequencies of tachycardia and bradycardia. Motor activity was positively related to HR (r = .3) but negatively related to SpO2 (r = -.2); active sleep, active awake, and crying were associated with higher HR and lower SpO2. However, without severe oxygen desaturation, SpO 2 was not associated with HR.These findings suggest that prone position may reduce oxygen desaturation and assist energy conservation for ventilated preterm infants. Improved energy conservation, in turn, may enhance infant adaptation to extrauterine life and facilitate ventilator weaning.

AB  - BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Preterm infants in mechanical ventilation are vulnerable and may manifest physiological instability and a disorganized behavioural state when responding to external stimuli. Adequate positioning strategies may play an important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week postbirth. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to compare effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. DESIGN/METHODS: The infants were aged 25-36 weeks of gestation, < or = 7 days of age, and without sedation or congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance. FINDINGS: Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of startle, tremor, and twitch. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that prone positioning improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress for ventilated preterm infants during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants' extrauterine adaptation.

AB  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms (p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep (p < 0.01) when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 160 pregnant women at various stages of gestation. Participants were interviewed about their sleep length per night, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), snoring habits, and symptoms of restless legs syndrome during the previous few weeks. Cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state was quantified by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) from short-term electrocardiogram monitoring. The relationship of HRV to diverse covariates was studied by multiple regression analysis.Results: No significant influences were observed of short sleep duration (<7 hours per night), poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5), or restless legs syndrome on HRV measures. Participants with excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score >9) and habitual snorers had a significantly elevated low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio and LF power in normalized units (LF norm). In multiple regression analyses, habitual snoring was strongly and positively associated with LF/HF ratio (P<0.001) and LF norm (P<0.001).Conclusion: Resting cardiac autonomic modulation was found to shift toward a sympathetic predominant state among pregnant women who are habitual snorers.

AB  - Background: During pregnancy, a sedentary lifestyle may have negative consequences on maternal and foetal health status. The main objective of this project is to assess the effects of an exercise intervention in overweight and grade I obese pregnant on maternal and foetal health markers.Methods/design: The present study aims to recruit 60 overweight and grade I obese women interested in participating in an exercise intervention program from the 17th gestational week until delivery. Women will be randomized to either an exercise (three 60-min sessions/week of combined aerobic and strength training and pelvic floor exercises), or usual care (control) group (30 women per group). The primary outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic profile. Secondary outcome measures are: i) perinatal obstetric records; i) body composition; iii) dietary patterns; iv) physical fitness; v) low-back pain; vi) objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; vii) haematology and biochemical analyses; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory markers; x) bone health biomarkers; xi) sleep quality; xii) mental health, quality of life and positive health.Discussion: The findings of this project will help to identify strategies for primary prevention and health promotion based on this exercise-based intervention program among overweight and grade I obese pregnant women.Trial Registration: NCT02582567 ; Date of registration: 20/10/2015.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 15-month intervention on dietary intake conducted among obesity-prone normal-weight pre-school children.Design: Information on dietary intake was obtained using a 4 d diet record. A diet quality index was adapted to assess how well children's diet complied with the Danish national guidelines. Linear regression per protocol and intention-to-treat analyses of differences in intakes of energy, macronutrients, fruit, vegetables, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and diet quality index between the two groups were conducted.Setting: The Healthy Start study was conducted during 2009-2011, focusing on changing diet, physical activity, sleep and stress management to prevent excessive weight gain among Danish children.Subjects: From a population of 635 Danish pre-school children, who had a high birth weight (≥4000 g), high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (≥28·0 kg/m2) or low maternal educational level (<10 years of schooling), 285 children completed the intervention and had complete information on dietary intake.Results: Children in the intervention group had a lower energy intake after the 15-month intervention (group means: 5·29 v. 5·59 MJ, P=0·02) compared with the control group. We observed lower intakes of carbohydrates and added sugar in the intervention group compared with the control group after the intervention (P=0·002, P=0·01).Conclusions: The intervention resulted in a lower energy intake, particularly from carbohydrates and added sugar after 15 months of intervention, suggesting that dietary intake can be changed in a healthier direction in children predisposed to obesity.

AB  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related outcomes in women with RLS. Methods: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study. Results: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4±0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1±0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session ( r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes ( r=0.64, p<0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's≤0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS.

AB  - Maternal morbidity is associated with cesarean deliveries. However, new evidence suggests that short- and long-term neonatal morbidity is also associated. This includes respiratory morbidity with conflicting results. To determine whether mode of delivery has an impact on the long-term risk for respiratory morbidity in the offspring, a population-based cohort analysis was conducted including all singleton term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. A comparison was performed between children delivered via elective cesarean delivery (CD) and those delivered vaginally. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis as were all cases of urgent CDs. Pediatric hospitalizations involving respiratory morbidity of offspring up to the age of 18 years were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity incidence and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. During the study period, 132,054 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 8.9% were via elective CDs (n = 11,746) and 91.1% (n = 120,308) were vaginal deliveries. Hospitalizations of the offspring involving respiratory morbidity were significantly more common in offspring delivered by CDs (5.2 vs. 4.3% in vaginal deliveries, p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity in the elective CD group (log rank p < 0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model, while controlling for maternal age, gestational age, and birthweight, CD exhibited a significant and independent association with long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.22 (CI, 1.12-1.33), p < 0.001).Conclusion: Elective cesarean delivery at term is a significant risk factor for long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring. What is Known: • Cesarean delivery is a major surgery with known possible complications. • Cesarean delivery has possible immediate complications for the newborn including respiratory complications. What is New: • Our study shows more long term respiratory morbidity in the CD group including asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. • Different possible explanations have been proposed including exposure to maternal flora during vaginal delivery and the stress hormones secreted during contractions and delivery.

AB  - We report a patient with pregnancy related obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA]; apnea hypopnea index [AHI] 18/h) early after delivery, with improvement of AHI by 87% following 45-degree elevation in body position compared with the non-elevated position. Improvement associated with this position may be explained, at least in part, by an increased upper airway diameter (as measured during wakefulness). Sleep apnea in this patient resolved at 9 months postpartum. This observation suggests that 45-degree elevated body position may be an effective treatment of pregnancy related OSA during the postpartum period.

AB  - Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 ± 6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 ± 7,990 pg/mL, P< 0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P < 0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P < 0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: During pregnancy, upper airway resistance is increased, predisposing vulnerable women to pregnancy-related OSA. Elevation of the upper body increases upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and improves severity of OSA in a subgroup of nonpregnant patients (positional-dependent sleep apnea). We tested the hypothesis that elevated position of the upper body improves OSA early after delivery.Methods: Following institutional review board approval, we conducted a randomized, crossover study on two postpartum units of Massachusetts General Hospital. Women during the first 48 h after delivery were included. Polysomnography was performed in nonelevated and 45° elevated upper body position. Upper airway CSA was measured by acoustic pharyngometry in nonelevated, 45° elevated, and sitting body position.Results: Fifty-five patients were enrolled, and measurements of airway CSA obtained. Thirty patients completed polysomnography in both body positions. Elevation of the upper body significantly reduced apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 7.7 ± 2.2/h in nonelevated to 4.5 ± 1.4/h in 45° elevated upper body position (P = .031) during sleep. Moderate to severe OSA (AHI > 15/h) was diagnosed in 20% of postpartum patients and successfully treated by elevated body position in one-half of them. Total sleep time and sleep architecture were not affected by upper body elevation. Change from nonelevated to sitting position increased inspiratory upper airway CSA from 1.35 ± 0.1 cm2 to 1.54 ± 0.1 cm2 during wakefulness. Position-dependent increase in CSA and decrease in AHI were correlated (r = 0.42, P = .022).Conclusions: Among early postpartum women, 45° upper body elevation increased upper airway CSA and mitigated sleep apnea. Elevated body position might improve respiratory safety in women early after delivery.Trial Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT01719224; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

AB  - Melnick-Needles syndrome (M-NS) is a rare genetic disorder which primarily affects skeletal developments. M-NS may also affect the cardiorespiratory and renal systems. A 35 kg patient presented complaining of abdominal pain. Following a positive pregnancy test and ultrasound examination, she was diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had a significant background history of M-NS, obstructive sleep apnoea (with narrow gauge tracheostomy in situ), obstructive lung disease and scoliosis. She received fluid resuscitation, and the case was managed using an open salpingectomy and clot evacuation under combined spinal/epidural anaesthesia. Anticipated difficulty in securing a definitive airway was pivotal to choosing a regional anaesthetic technique. The operation was successful and the patient recovered well. This was a unique surgical and anaesthetic challenge due to abnormal facial, spinal and abdominal morphology compounded by the time-critical emergency nature of the case. Individually tailored perioperative management is frequently required for patients with rare syndromes.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development. Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers' capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing. Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers' aversive response to infant crying. Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

AB  - The effects of skin-to-skin contact on three indexes of energy expenditure: heart rate, activity level, and behavioral state, were examined in a pilot study. It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify factors that may predispose women to excess gestational weight gain (GWG).Methods: Seventy-two healthy women with obesity (30 class I, 24 class II, 18 class III) expecting a singleton pregnancy were studied at 13 to 16 weeks gestation. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured during sleep (SleepEE, average EE from 0200-0500 hours) in a whole-room calorimeter, and total daily EE (TDEE) over 7 days using doubly labeled water. Glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were measured.Results: Body composition explained 70% variability in SleepEE, and SleepEE accounted for 67% to 73% of TDEE. Though there was no evidence of consistent low metabolism, there was considerable variability. Low SleepEE was associated with insulin resistance and low triiodothyronine concentrations (both P = 0.01). Physical activity level was 1.47 ± 0.02. For women with SleepEE within 100 kcal/d of their predicted EE, TDEE was significantly less than the estimate (2,530 ± 91 vs. 2,939 kcal/d; P < 0.001) provided from the most recent gestational energy requirement model.Conclusions: Pregnant women with obesity are inactive, possibly predisposing them to excess GWG. Current energy requirement models overestimate activity and may promote excess GWG in women with obesity. Furthermore, the observed large interindividual variability in basal metabolism may be important to consider when assessing the risk for excess GWG.

AB  - Background: Sleep fragmentation during late gestation (LG-SF) is one of the major perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during pregnancy. We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood.Objectives: To investigate the effects of late LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring.Methods: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or sleep control during LG (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. At 24 weeks of age, lipid profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed in the offspring. We performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice per group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks.Results: We detected significant increases in body weight (31.7 vs 28.8 g; P=0.001), visceral (642.1 vs 497.0 mg; P=0.002) and subcutaneous (293.1 vs 250.1 mg; P=0.001) fat mass, plasma cholesterol (110.6 vs 87.6 mg dl(-1); P=0.001), triglycerides (87.3 vs 84.1 mg dl(-1); P=0.003) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values (8.1 vs 6.1; P=0.007) in the LG-SF group. MeDIP analyses revealed that 2148 DMRs (LG-SF vs LG-SC; P<0.0001, model-based analysis of tilling-arrays algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome, such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1 and so on. Overrepresented pathways and gene networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response.Conclusions: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated with the metabolic processes and inflammatory responses in VWAT. LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations may underlie increases in the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

AB  - Abstract: Over 25,000 epileptic women deliver viable pregnancies each year in the United States. Although medical management is the first line of treatment, many physiological changes associated with pregnancy can make optimal treatment challenging. Medication dosage is adjusted based on side effects and seizure frequency, with the goal being no seizures with the lowest medication dosage(s) and side-effect profile possible. Whenever possible, monotherapy is preferred. Many antiepileptic drugs have teratogenic potential, so preconceptional optimization of medication dosage(s) is recommended. Epilepsy has associated neurological comorbidities, the most common being migraines and sleep disorders.

AB  - Purpose: To study the epileptiform discharges (EDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 6-8-year-old children of women with epilepsy (WWE). Materials and Methods: All children born to women with epilepsy and prospectively followed up through the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP), aged 6–8 years, were invited (n = 532). Out of the 254 children who responded, clinical evaluations and a 30-min digital 18 channel EEG were completed in 185 children. Results: Of the 185 children examined, 37 (20%) children (19 males, 18 females) had ED in their EEG. The EDs were generalized in 7 children, and focal in 30 children. The EDs were present in the sleep record only of 16 (43%) children and in the awake record only of 6 (16%) children. Out of the 94 children for whom seizure history was available, 7 children (7.4%) had seizures (neonatal seizures: 4, febrile seizure: 1, and single nonfebrile seizure: 2) and none had history of epilepsy or recurrent nonfebrile seizures. The odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of ED in the EEG was significantly higher for children of WWE [OR = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-6.0] when compared to the published data for age-matched children of mothers without epilepsy. There was no association between the occurrence of ED and the children’s maternal characteristics [epilepsy syndrome, seizures during pregnancy, maternal intelligence quotient (IQ)] or the children’s characteristics [antenatal exposure to specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), birth weight, malformations, IQ]. Conclusion: Children of WWE have a higher risk of epileptiform activity in their EEG when compared to healthy children in the community though none had recurrent seizures.

AB  - Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

AB  - To increase access to safe infant sleep surfaces and reduce risk of sleep-related infant deaths, the Georgia Department of Public Health implemented a portable crib distribution and safe sleep educational program. The aim of this evaluation was to compare parental knowledge and practices related to infant sleep before and after receipt of the safe sleep educational program and crib. A prospective, matched pre- and post-test cohort design with a follow-up survey was utilized to evaluate changes in knowledge and practices. Female participants were recruited through the county health department and met the following criteria: (1) between 32 and 40 weeks pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and (2) demonstrated financial need. Participants completed a survey prior to the start of a group educational program and upon program completion. For those who agreed, a follow-up phone survey was conducted approximately 10 weeks after program completion or after the infant’s birth. McNemar’s Chi square tests were conducted to detect significant differences between specific items on pre-test, post-test, and follow-up surveys, and paired sample t tests were conducted to compare differences in knowledge and practice scores. A total of 132 participants completed matched pre- and post-test surveys and 76 completed follow-up surveys. Knowledge of recommendations regarding position, surface, environment, smoking, breastfeeding, and pacifier use increased significantly between pre- and post-test, with most participants maintaining knowledge at follow-up. The proportion of recommended practices also increased significantly. A group-based safe sleep educational program can be effective in reducing risky infant sleep practices.

AB  - Aim: Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) rates for Māori and Pacific infants remain higher than for other ethnic groups in New Zealand and bed-sharing is a major risk factor when there is smoking exposure in pregnancy. Sleep space programmes of education and Pēpi-Pod baby beds require evaluation.Methods: Two hundred and forty Māori and Pacific women and infants were randomised 1:1, to the Pēpi-Pod sleep space programme, or to a control group with 'usual care'. When infants were under 2 weeks of age, baseline interviews occurred, followed up by interviews at 2 and 4 months of age to assess safe sleep knowledge, infant care practices and Pēpi-Pod use and acceptability. All participants were offered a New Zealand Standard approved portable cot.Results: At baseline, 25% of babies did not have a baby bed. Knowledge of smoking and bed-sharing as SUDI risks improved at follow-up in both groups. One quarter regularly bed-shared at follow-up in both groups. Intention to bed-share was a strong predictor of subsequent behaviour. Pēpi-Pods were regularly used by 46% at 2 months and 16% at 4 months follow-up.Conclusions: Bed-sharing and knowledge improvement were similar irrespective of group. It is likely that the impact of the intervention was reduced because the control group received better support than 'usual care' and all participants had a baby bed. New Zealand SUDI rates have declined since sleep space programmes have been available. Sleep space programmes should be prioritised for those with modifiable SUDI risk.

AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease which is estimated to be undiagnosed to a large extent. Hence, the prevalence of OSAS in pregnant women is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with chronic diseases.Methods: In the study, 97 pregnant women with chronic diseases and 160 healthy pregnant women were included. A form questioning socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy characteristics, Epworth scale and the Berlin questionnaire to evaluate the risk of OSAS were applied to participants.Results: It has been determined that 10-12.5% of healthy pregnant women, 34-45.4% of pregnants with chronic diseases and 20.6-23.3% of all pregnant women had a high risk of OSAS, the pregnants with chronic disease compared to healthy pregnant women had statistically significant higher risk of OSAS. The risk of OSAS was found to be significantly higher especially in pregnant women with hypertension and diabetes.Conclusions: OSAS can lead to the adverse consequences in pregnancy, should be questioned for all pregnants especially those with chronic diseases. Pregnant women with OSAS should be monitored more carefully in terms of diabetes and hypertension in antenatal care.

AB  - Background: Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological option to relieve pregnancy-related complaints.Objectives: To critically appraise the best available evidence for the use of acupuncture in outpatient care.Search Strategy: The MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched for English-language and German-language papers published from January 1980 to March 2017 using search terms related to pregnancy combined with 'acupuncture'.Selection Criteria: Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-pharmacological treatments in unselected or low-risk pregnant women.Data Collection and Analysis: Quality was assessed using a checklist (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were also performed.Main Results: High-quality systematic reviews (n=5) and RCTs with low risk of bias (n=3) were identified. The systematic reviews were based on single studies, with small sample sizes, that showed a benefit of acupuncture for evening pelvic pain; pelvic and low-back pain; nausea; functional disability; and sleep quality. Contradictory results were found in the RCTs regarding cesarean delivery; time to delivery; spontaneous labor; fetal distress; and Apgar score. Data pooling emphasized the heterogeneity of results.Conclusions: Evidence to support the use of acupuncture for relief of pregnancy-related conditions was limited.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N=215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

AB  - Background: Although both expectant mothers and expectant fathers complain of fatigue during the last trimester of pregnancy, studies have focused exclusively on mothers. This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or evening fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of fatigue. Methods: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples, who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary. Results: Expectant mothers but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers and mothers did not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained. Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers. Conclusions: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and postpartum experience.

AB  - Pregnancy usually is an exciting and joyous time, however it is accompanied by some common and unpleasant conditions referred to as minor disorders of pregnancy. The disorders are not life threatening, just a normal part of pregnancy but they can be troublesome. The study assessed the experience and coping measures of minor discomforts of pregnancy (nausea, vomiting and back-pain) among pregnant women. A cross sectional analytical design was employed for the study and simple random sampling technique was used to select 300 pregnant women proportionally from Primary Health Care Centre, Idi-Ogungun and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Yemetu. Structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics and chi square were used for analysis. More than two-third of the women experienced nausea and vomiting (79.9%) and back-pain (77.7%) in pregnancy. The respondents coped well with the selected discomforts of pregnancy as majority scored above the average rating score of 5. The commonly used coping measures for nausea and vomiting among the respondents are licking sweets 193(92.3%) and ginger 72(34.5%) and the mostly used coping measures for backpain in pregnancy are asking for assistance with task (95.1%), sleep/rest 123(85.4%) and massage 97(67.4%). There is significant association between severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and degree of coping, p value< 0.05. Nausea, vomiting and back-pain are common complaints in pregnancy. Finding unveiled that the women coped well with the selected discomforts. Midwives continuous assessment and education on every visit to antenatal clinic is recommended to enhance coping and prompt management in extreme cases.

AB  - Aims To explore the experiences of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, and the relationships between perceptions of glucose control, attitudes to technology and glycaemic responses with regard to closed-loop insulin delivery. Methods We recruited 16 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes [mean ± sd age 34.1 ± 4.6 years, duration of diabetes 23.6 ± 7.2 years, baseline HbA1c 51±5 mmol/mol (6.8 ± 0.6%)] to a randomized crossover trial of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs automated closed-loop therapy. Questionnaires (Diabetes Technology Questionnaire, Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey) were completed before and after each intervention, with qualitative interviews at baseline and follow-up. Results Women described the benefits and burdens of closed-loop systems during pregnancy. Feelings of improved glucose control, excitement and empowerment were counterbalanced by concerns about device visibility, obsessive data checking and diminished attentiveness to hyper- and hypoglycaemia symptoms. Responding to questionnaires, eight participants felt less worry about overnight hypoglycaemia and that diabetes 'did not run their lives'; however, five reported that closed-loop increased time thinking about diabetes, and three felt it made sleep and preventing hyperglycaemia more problematic. Women slightly overestimated their glycaemic response to closed-loop therapy. Most became more positive in their technology attitudes throughout pregnancy. Women with more positive technology attitudes had higher degrees of overestimation, and poorer levels of glycaemic control. Conclusions Women displayed complex psychosocial responses to closed-loop therapy in pregnancy. Perceptions of glycaemic response may diverge from biomedical data.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions. Design Repeated measures. Setting Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation. Methods Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals. Results Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future. Conclusions Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To identify the effectiveness of 'facilitated tucking,' a nonpharmacologic nursing intervention, as a comfort measure in modulating preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses to minor pain. Design: Prospective, repeated measure, random sequencing, and experimental. Setting: Level III neonatal intensive-care unit of a tertiary care university pediatric hospital. Participants: Thirty preterm neonates, 25-35 weeks gestation. Interventions: Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and sleep state were recorded 12 minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after two heelsticks, one with and one without facilitated tucking. Hypothesis: Premature neonates will have less variation in heart rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, shorter crying and sleep disruption times, and less fluctuation in sleep states in response to the painful stimulus of a heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Results: Neonates demonstrated a lower mean heart rate 6-10 minutes post-stick (p < 0.04), shorter mean crying time (p < 0.001), shorter mean sleep disruption time (p < 0.001), and fewer sleep-state changes (p = 0.003) after heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Conclusion: Facilitated tucking is an effective comfort measure in attenuating premature neonates' psychologic and behavioral responses to minor pain.

AB  - Objective:This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum.Background:A woman’s preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour.Method:At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire.Results:Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother–infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation.Conclusions:Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories.

AB  - Mother-infant bed-sharing has been associated with a higher risk of sleep-related infant deaths, which affects African Americans at a disproportionately higher rate. Although 'separate but proximate sleep surfaces' for infants has been recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007-2010 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806 African Americans and 1,680 Whites ( N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) and maternal education of 13-15 years (OR 2.0: 1.2-3.4) or ≥16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1-6.3) was associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1-1.8), breastfeeding (OR 2.5: 1.9-3.1), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2-2.3), being unmarried (OR 1.5: 1.1-2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1-2.3), and non-supine sleep (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should ask families about their infant's sleeping environment and address safety issues within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for bed-sharing.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISI≥10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS≥9 and 9% with EPDS<9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS≥9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS<9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research.

AB  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≥9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≥9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

AB  - Objective: To quantify insomnia and their components in a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women and factors associated with insomnia.Study Design: A prospective cohort of 486 healthy singleton pregnancies assembled before the 14th gestational week (February 2013 to March 2016). Insomnia data were collected pre-gestationally, in each trimester and six months post-partum, analysing five different moments. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of determinants of insomnia in each trimester, defined using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) as score ≥8.Results: Insomnia prevalence was 6.1% (3.9-8.9) pre-gestational, 44.2% (39.3-49.6) in first trimester (T1), 46.3% (41.9-51.3) in second (T2) and 63.7% (57.7-67.8) in third trimester (T3). Post-gestational insomnia was 33.2% (28.2-37.9) (p < 0.001 pre-gestational vs T1, T2 vs T3 and T3 vs after pregnancy). There was worsening mean AIS score, from: 2.34 before pregnancy to 9.87 in T3 because the deterioration of nighttime sleep, in absolute terms, but daytime impact was higher in T1. Previous trimester insomnia was associated with insomnia in T2 (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI 2.78-6.37) and T3 (aOR = 4.43, 95% CI 2.77-7.08). Pre-gestational insomnia was determinant of insomnia in T1 (aOR 12.50, 95% CI 3.58-43.60) and obesity was associated with insomnia in T3 (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI 0.99-5.32). On the contrary, moderate physical activity reduced the odds of insomnia in T3 (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40-1.03).Conclusions: Insomnia prevalence was high from the beginning of pregnancy, associated with pre-gestational insomnia. In late pregnancy, two out of three pregnant women suffering insomnia. Insomnia prevention should be targeted particularly to those with high body mass index and pre-gestational insomnia.
