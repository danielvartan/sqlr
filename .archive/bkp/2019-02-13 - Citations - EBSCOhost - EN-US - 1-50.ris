AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blunted nocturnal dip of blood pressure (BP) and reversed circadian rhythm have been described in preeclampsia (PE). Non-dipper status and preeclampsia are both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Complete recovery of BP in PE is reported to occur over a variable period of time. Twenty-four hours-ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the post-partum follow-up after a PE has not been described. The aim of this study was to assess 24h-ambulatory blood pressure pattern after a PE and to determine the prevalence of non-dipper status, nocturnal hypertension, white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. METHODS: This is an observational, prospective study on women who suffered from a preeclampsia. A 24h-ABPM was done 6 weeks post-partum at the Hypertension Unit of the University Hospitals of Geneva, concomitantly with a clinical and biological evaluation. RESULTS: Forty-five women were included in a preliminary analysis. Mean age was 33±6years, 57.3% were Caucasian, mean BMI before pregnancy was 24±5kg/m(2). Office and ambulatory BP are shown in Table 1. Prevalence of nocturnal hypertension was high and half of the women had no nocturnal dipping. The diagnosis of hypertension based on office BP was discordant with the diagnosis based on ABPM in 25% of women. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of increased nighttime BP and abnormal BP pattern is high at 6weeks post-partum in preeclamptic women. Early assessment of BP with ABPM after preeclampsia allows an early identification of women with persistent circadian abnormalities who might be at increased risk. It also provides a more accurate assessment than office BP. DISCLOSURES: A. Ditisheim: None. B. Ponte: None. G. Wuerzner: None. M. Burnier: None. M. Boulvain: None. A. Pechère-Bertschi: None.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a symptom of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Several studies have found that SDB during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between self-reported snoring and neck circumference, weight gain and BMI. METHODS: 2306 pregnant women answered a questionnaire which included 'Do you snore?' among the questions. The women were asked their pre pregnancy weight, current height and weight were used to calculate BMI and change in BMI from pre pregnancy to trial entry, neck circumference was measured, and the Epworth questionnaire for daytime sleepiness was administered. The data from women who answered 'Yes' to the snoring question were compared to that of women who answered No. RESULTS: Pre pregnancy BMI, current BMI and the increase in BMI from pre- pregnancy to current were all highly significantly increased in the women who reported snoring during pregnancy (p<0.0001, <0.0001 and 0.003, respectively). The Epworth sleepiness score, calculated from the Epworth questionnaire, was significantly higher i.e. more daytime sleepiness, in women who reported snoring (p<0.0001) and the neck circumference measurements of women who reported snoring were also highly significantly higher (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Women who report snoring during pregnancy have higher pre pregnancy and current BMI, increase their BMI more during pregnancy, have larger neck circumference and are sleepier during the day. Therefore women who intend to become, or are pregnant, should be encouraged to reduce their BMI and maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy. DISCLOSURES: A.J. Robertson: None. P. Johnson: None.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Why only some women are affected by CVD after severe preeclampsia is not known. The objective of this study was to examine the presence of CVD among women after severe preeclampsia, and illuminate any differences between the women with present CVD and women without CVD. METHODS: Women admitted to Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden with the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (O141 A, B, C and X) in 1999-2001 were invited to participate. Out of 60 women where the diagnosis was correct, 36 women agreed to participate. Blood pressure, lipids waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) were registered. Participants filled in a form concerning family history, diseases, tobacco, reproduction, physical activity, sleeping patterns, weight change, and marital stress. Family history of CVD was defined as having one first degree relative with stroke, myocardial infarct, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes type 2 before the age of 55 (men) and 65 (women). Stress in relation was measured with Stockholm Marital Stress Scale (SMSS) and sleep with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). RESULTS: Ten women were already affected by CVD and 26 were not. Affected women had significantly higher systolic (p=0.001) and diastolic (p=0.001) blood pressure (in spite of medication), BMI (p=0.022) and waist circumference (p=0.003) as well as higher levels of apoB (p=0.017) and lower levels of apoA1 (p=0.015). A difference was also seen in family history of CVD, number of preeclamptic pregnancies, sleep and marital stress but results were not significantly different in this small pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutional differences when becoming pregnant, number of preeclamptic episodes, obesity, as well as lifestyle may all influence the risk for later CVD. DISCLOSURES: E.G. Andolf: None. C. Iacobaeus: None. I. Nord: None.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common in women and reported at 14-45% in pregnancy. SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia, and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke, and heart attack. There is no depth of knowledge examining the association between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between self-reported snoring and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) within a larger cohort from a prevalence of SDB in pregnancy study. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to women attending an outpatient's antenatal clinic. Objective measurements were undertaken. The self-reported snoring is a component of the Epworth scale. Overnight recordings of sleep were attained using SonoMat[TM] (Home Sleep Testing). Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and analysed by IBM SPSS v.20[TM] utilizing chi-square analysis, student T test and logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ (2009) criteria. RESULTS: Questionnaires were administered and outcomes collected on 2309 pregnancies. Snoring was reported in 45.5% of women. Objective measures were attended on 202 women, snoring was recorded at 61%. HDP affected 10.1% of the cohort, 3.3% of whom had preeclampsia. Of the pregnancies affected by self-reported snoring, HDP occurred in 13.4% in comparison to 7.6% of those who do not report snoring (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This indicates an association between self-reported snoring and HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential cofounders such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other co-morbidities. DISCLOSURES: A.J. Robertson: None. P.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Snoring is common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester. Most investigators of snoring during pregnancy had utilized questionnaires to determine the presence and severity of snoring. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of questionnaires to determine the presence of snoring in pregnant women compared with objectively measured snoring. METHODS: Berlin questionnaires were administered to 202 pregnant women. One question asked 'Do you snore?' Snoring was then recorded in the woman's home using a SonoMat[TM] device, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was determined. The results from the questionnaire were compared to recorded snoring and AHI results. RESULTS: 124 women answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you snore?' and 78 women answered 'No' and 'I don't know' for score purpose were included in 'No'. The average gestation was 28 ± 7 weeks. Women who reported 'No' were just as likely to report >20% snoring as those who reported 'Yes' (35.5%, p=ns). CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that questionnaire results are not always a reliable method of determining whether snoring is present, and overnight monitoring should be used to rule out sleep disordered breathing. .

Of the pregnancies affected by HDP recorded snoring (>20% of the night) occurred in 50% in comparison to 30% who do not have HDP (p<0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This would indicate that there is an association between measured snoring and HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential risk factors such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other co morbidities. the causal relationship between HDP and snoring should be further explored.

AB  - The widely accepted association of the prone sleeping position with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rests largely on studies that were conducted outside the United States where there are different populations and cultural practices. For this reason, the authors carried out a population-based case-control study in 11 California counties with ethnically diverse residents. Experienced interviewers spoke in person during a 3-year period in 1997-2000 with the mothers of 185 SIDS cases and 312 randomly selected control subjects. The groups were matched for race/ethnicity and age. The interviewers were trained in grief counseling related specifically to SIDS. Mothers of SIDS cases were more likely than control mothers to be less than 25 years of age, to lack a complete college education, to be unmarried, and to have a lower income. In addition, they had more previous live births, smoked more heavily during the index pregnancy, began prenatal care later, and were likelier to have been physically abused during or after the index pregnancy. Low birth weight, premature birth, and postpartum fever all were more frequent in SIDS infants. After adjusting for known confounding factors and demographic variables, both the prone and side sleeping positions were associated with more than twice the risk of SIDS compared with infants sleeping supine (on their backs). The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were 2.6 and 2.0, respectively, for the prone and side sleeping positions. This association was evident in all racial/ethnic groups. The risk of SIDS was particularly increased for infants placed in an unstable side position and later found to be prone (AOR, 8.7). Infants who usually were placed on their backs but had last been put down in the prone or side position also had a significantly high risk of SIDS (AORs, 8.2 for the prone position and 6.9 for the side position). Infants placed in an unaccustomed prone or side sleeping position were at higher risk than those who always were placed in these positions. This experience with a culturally diverse U.S. population, which follows the 'Back to Sleep' public education campaign, indicates that more emphasis needs to be placed on avoiding an unstable side sleeping position as well as unaccustomed prone and side positions.

AB  - The used of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed parturients has raised concern over possible teratogenic effects on the fetus. These drugs readily cross the placental barrier, exposing the fetus to increased serotonin levels early in development. This prospective study evaluated infant neurobehavior 14 to 39 hours after birth; all were normal-birth infants. Half the mothers were taking an SSRI. The users and nonusers were matched for cigarette smoking, maternal age, and socioeconomic status. Infants were monitored for behavior, startles, and tremulousness for 1 hour between feedings. Motor activity and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded during a 15-minute sleep period. Behavioral assessment was based on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. The SSRI-exposed infants had shorter gestational ages. They exhibited more motor activity and tremulousness than did unexposed infants and had fewer rhythms in HRV. They also had fewer changes in behavioral state and fewer such states. Peak behavioral state was lower in the exposed infants. These infants also had significantly more rapid-eye-movement sleep and tended to have more spontaneous startles and sudden arousals. After adjusting for gestational age, the only significant differences were in tremulousness and measures of state and sleep organization. Adjusted mean motor activity and spectral peaks in HRV no longer differed significantly between the SSRI-exposed and nonexposed infants. These findings do not support the view that using an SSRI during pregnancy has little effect on the developing fetus. It is possible that the observed changes in motor activity, startles, and HRV are mediated by the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age.

AB  - This cross-sectional study in six German public health offices was undertaken after a recent cohort study suggested that maternal smoking during pregnancy might increase the risk of childhood obesity. Data on 6483 Bavarian children 5 to 7 years of age were collected in 1999-2000. A self-administered questionnaire concerning maternal smoking was used. The criterion for overweight was a body mass index (BMI) above the 90th percentile, and for obesity, a BMI greater than the 97th percentile. The study population included 3847 children whose mothers reported never having smoked; 638 whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy; and 1998 whose mothers smoked at some time but not during pregnancy.The frequency of overweight children was 8.1% in the never-smoked group, 14.1% when the mother smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day while pregnant, and 17% at a higher level of smoking. The respective figures for childhood obesity were 2.2%, 5.7%, and 8.5%. On bivariate analysis, a high BMI for either parent was the strongest predictor of overweight/obesity, followed by high birth weight and then maternal smoking during pregnancy. Other risk factors included high weight gain in the first year of life, watching TV more than 1 hour per day, snacking while watching TV, early introduction of solid foods, and giving a bottle of milk or tea with carbohydrates to encourage the infant to sleep. Eating alone also increased the risk. Adjusting for parental education lowered the risk associated with watching TV and snacking. On logistic regression analysis, maternal smoking during pregnancy remained a significant risk factor for child overweight and obesity. The respective crude odds ratios were 1.43 and 2.06.In addition to discouraging frequent TV viewing (and video game playing) by children and frequent snacking, it seems reasonable to attempt to persuade pregnant women not to smoke in the interest of their children maintaining normal body weight.

AB  - Since pediatricians were alerted to the need for infants to be in a safe environment when sleeping, prone sleeping has declined to less than 20%, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has declined 40%. The 'Back to Sleep' campaign emphasizes, in addition to a supine sleeping position, a safe crib, firm bedding, and avoiding overheating. Nevertheless, the drop in SIDS incidence has been leveling off in recent years. Because a further decline might be possible by altering other risk factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke before and after birth, a physician survey was carried out to clarify knowledge about SIDS and attitudes toward risk reduction. Of 3717 physicians contacted in North Carolina or Washington, DC, 835 (23%) responded. The sample included family and general practitioners, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists.Nearly 80% of the respondents correctly identified maternal smoking during pregnancy, second-hand exposure to smoke, and prone sleeping as risk factors contributing to SIDS. Only 7% of the group failed to advise a back or side sleep position, and only 5% did not recommend a firm mattress. When asked whether infants required a warmer sleep environment than adults, 26% responded positively. Pediatricians were especially likely to acknowledge the importance of a supine sleep position. A large majority of pediatricians (79%) reported routinely discussing SIDS with parents. The figure for family and general practitioners was only 56%, and for obstetrician-gynecologists, 18%. Only 35% of pediatricians and 15% of family and general practitioners, however, provided written information.Further educational efforts are needed to ensure that physicians who care for infants are aware of the several ways in which the risk of SIDS may be lowered.

AB  - Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a condition found in fewer than 1% of pregnant women in most countries. ICP typically develops in the second half of pregnancy as the result of defective bile acid transport, which leads to the release of liver enzymes and bile acids into the maternal circulation. Itching-the commonest symptom-may interfere with sleep, but in other respects the maternal disorder is benign and does not predispose to liver failure. The fetus, however, is at increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine demise or stillbirth, and mecomium aspiration.This study compared two drugs, given separately and in combination. Both S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) enhance the excretory function of hepatocytes, stimulate choleretic activity, and dilute toxic bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. UDCA also reduces the accumulation of bile acids in the fetus, and SAMe increases trans-sulfuration of bile acids, which increases their excretion. One or both of these drugs were given to 78 women with singleton pregnancies at less than 36 weeks' gestation who had moderate or severe ICP as evidenced by high self-reported symptom scores. One group of 25 patients received SAMe at a dose of 500 mg twice daily by slow running infusion for 12 days, followed by 500 mg daily by mouth until delivery. Another 26 women received UDCA orally in a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day. The remaining 27 women received both these treatments. The treatment groups were similar obstetrically at the outset.Although all 3 treatments resulted in improvement of maternal symptoms, more women had a favorable response to UDCA alone or in combination with SAMe than to SAMe alone. UDCA given alone or combined with SAMe resulted in greater decreases in the concentrations of bile acids and transaminases compared to SAMe alone, and a favorable response in most women (85% to UDCA alone and 89% to combined therapy). Monotherapy with SAMe did not significantly alter biochemical parameters. Only one patient, treated with UCA alone, became worse. The response was also more rapid-within 7 days of initiating treatment-with UDCA alone or in combination than in SAMe alone, but was fastest with combination therapy. However, by two weeks of therapy there was no difference between the two UDCA groups. There were no significant group differences in the duration of treatment, which ranged from 1 to 12 weeks. All treatments were well tolerated and no adverse side effects were recorded. No perinatal deaths occurred, but premature deliveries before 36 completed weeks of gestation exceeded the population average in all treatment groups. Birth weights below the 10th centile of national growth curves were, however, within the limits of the population average in all groups.UDCA, alone or combined with SAMe, appears to be an effective treatment for ICP. Antepartum and intrapartum monitoring of the fetus should be routine when severe ICP is present.

AB  - Infant mortality--especially postneonatal deaths occurring 1 to 12 months after birth--is increased in American Indians. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the major cause of postneonatal death, was up to recently the leading cause of infant deaths in American Indian populations. Risk factors for SIDS were sought by reviewing findings from a population-based case-control study of 33 infants who died of SIDS and 66 matched living control infants (the Aberdeen Area Infant Mortality Study). All participants were American Indians living in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa in the years 1992-1996. The study group included infants dying before 12 months of age but excluded those who died while still hospitalized after delivery.The mean age at death in the SIDS group was 109 days. Univariate analyses showed that parents of SIDS infants had fewer years of education and more often reported fewer than seven prenatal visits. More case mothers had smoked and taken alcohol just before and during pregnancy, and more of them engaged in binge drinking in the first trimester. There was no difference in the use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. Comparable numbers of infants in the case and control groups were put to sleep on their stomachs in the 2 weeks before death. Infants given two or more layers of clothing were at increased risk of SIDS. Those having fewer than three well-baby visits had a nearly 14-fold greater risk of SIDS. Breast-feeding was not a significant factor. On logistic regression analysis, periconceptional drinking remained associated with SIDS (adjusted odds ratio, 6.2). Infants who usually had two or more layers of clothing were also at increased risk, with an identical odds ratio.These findings suggest that controlling alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy could lessen the risk of SIDS in this American Indian population. Attention also should be given to infant clothing, and efforts should be made to promote regular public health nurse visits.

AB  - Little is known about how women perceive the onset of labor. It is possible that the way in which labor onset is experienced influences the duration of labor and other aspects of labor dynamics. The authors administered a semistructured questionnaire to 235 women who were admitted at term in spontaneous labor. They were asked about when labor had begun, how they became aware of it, and whether and when the membranes had ruptured. Two investigators independently subdivided women's experience of labor onset into 369 sampling units corresponding to 8 predefined categories. Each unit consisted of a sentence, phrase, or expression embodying a single meaning. Interrater agreement on categorizing sampling units was 0.91. Nearly two thirds of all units related to recurrent or nonrecurring forms of pain. Most women experienced the onset of labor as regular or irregular recurring pain. Multiparous women reported recurrent pain more often than nulliparas. For most parameters, including watery fluid, gastrointestinal symptoms, and altered sleep, the number of women was identical to the number of sampling units. Sixteen women reported 22 units relating to emotional reactions. One third of women (33.6%) had membrane rupture before being admitted but only 21.6% associated it with the onset of labor. Women describe a wide range of symptoms and signs as heralding the onset of labor. No standardized experience of labor onset was found in this inquiry. A woman's perception of labor onset could well be as reliable as any surrogate measure. Rather than asking parturients about when contractions began and when they became regular, caregivers should ask them when labor began and how they knew.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus can be controlled and its complications prevented, provided clients take part in self-care actions. The objective of the present study was to identify self care deficiencies in pregnant women suffering from diabetes, and to provide inputs for their educational support. This descriptive study included 12 pregnant women cared at a diabetes and hypertension reference institution in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, in April and May, 2007. Data were collected using a semistructured interview. Analysis was based on Orem's Nursing General Theory. Self-care deficiencies were related to eating habits, physical activities, sleep and rest, and social interaction. Nurses must provide educational support to these patients, evaluate their self-care capacity, and propose actions that involve the family, as well as group activities in health services.

AB  - The notion that ‘older’ mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother’s health, and her newborn’s health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent studies suggest that shift workers who experience exposure to light at night could be at increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes. METHOD: Defined by cyclical patterns of circulating hormones, the reproductive system is vulnerable to shifts in circadian rhythms, either through sleep disturbances, altered melatonin production, exposure to light at night, or some other mechanism. Several occupational groups, including health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters, and manufacturing workers are required to work night shifts. Worldwide, millions work at least one night per month. RESULTS: Research will be reviewed on shift work and reproductive outcomes, including menstrual cycle patterns, fertility, pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and birth weight. The limitations of current research will also be discussed: is there a dose response effect from the number of years of shift work, or can the effects be reversed once shift work stops? Are there different effects from permanent night shift versus rotating shift involving nights? CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs will be identified, including the need for validation of self-reported shift work data and the mechanisms by which shift work affects reproductive health. Recommendations for shift workers and employers will be explored.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Flight attendant occupational exposures include cosmic ionising radiation and circadian disruption. We wanted to determine whether these and other occupational exposures were associated with spontaneous abortion among female flight attendants. METHOD: Female flight attendants from three US airlines in three cities were interviewed. Company records of over 1.9 million individual flights during the study period were assessed for exposure to galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle event radiation, and circadian disruption. Measures of physical job demands and other occupational factors were obtained from the interview. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, parity, and nonflying status. RESULTS: Among 2273 women interviewed, 840 pregnancies among 673 women met inclusion criteria. There was evidence to suggest that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion in weeks 9-13 of the first trimester (odds ratio (OR)=1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-3.20). The risk of a first trimester spontaneous abortion was significantly increased with 15 h or more of flying during home base normal sleep hours (OR=1.54; 95% CI 1.07-2.21) and with high physical job demands (OR=2.49; 95% CI 1.49-4.16). CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous abortion was associated with several flight attendant occupational exposures. This is the first report of these associations based on a quantitative assessment of distinct exposures generated from individual flight records.

AB  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 thirdtrimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0% for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression. Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.

AB  - It has been assumed that women recover from pregnancy and childbirth within 6 weeks. Recent research shows that women's fatigue levels are the same, or higher, at 6 weeks postpartum as at the time of delivery. This study determined the differences in primiparous women's fatigue and energy Levels at 6 weeks and 14 to 19 months postpartum. Determinations of how some contributing factors and outcomes of postpartum fatigue relate to each other and to fatigue and energy at 14 to 19 months postpartum were also made. Analyses revealed that women are more fatigued and less energetic at 14 to 19 months than they were at 6 weeks postpartum. Quality of sleep did not correlate with fatigue or energy. At 14 to 19 months postpartum return to full functional status is almost complete, household and infant care responsibilities being most complete. The women re experiencing mild life crises of various sorts, were somewhat depressed, were gratified in the mothering role.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the grief responses and physical health changes of Caucasian and African-American women following a third trimester stillbirth. Data were collected by mailed questionnaires: (a) the Demographic Data Form; (b) the Bereavement Experience Questionnaire; and (c) the Health Change Questionnaire. Subjects were 32 Caucasian and 16 African-American women who had delivered a stillborn infant between 32 and 44 weeks gestation. The two groups were compared according to obstetrical history, general health change, number of physician visits, presentation of physical health problems and somatic symptoms, drug usage, sleep problems, appetite and weight changes, exercise patterns, and grief responses following their stillbirth experience. The findings indicated that more of the Caucasian subjects were married and living with their husbands, employed and reported more years of education as compared to the African-American subjects. There were no statistically significant differences between the Caucasian and African-American subjects in their responses to grief. The two groups did not differ significantly according to reported overall health changes, physical health problems and somatic symptoms. However, the African-American women reported significantly more sleep problems, greater severity of health problems and an increase in the usage of recreational drugs. The African-American women also reported a greater percentage of changes in appetite and weight however there were no reported differences in exercise patterns between the two groups.

AB  - Background: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy.Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables.Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance.Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.

AB  - Background: Being overweight constitutes a health risk, and the proportion of overweight and obese children is increasing. It has been argued that road traffic noise could be linked to adiposity through its influence on sleep and stress. Few studies, to our knowledge, have investigated whether noise and adiposity are associated. Most of them were on adults, and we are not aware of any longitudinal study using repeated measures.Objectives: The present longitudinal study investigated whether road traffic noise exposures in pregnancy (N = 6,963; obs = 22,975) or childhood (N = 6,403; obs = 14,585) were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children.Methods: We obtained information on BMI and covariates from questionnaires used in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Statistics Norway, and Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We modeled road traffic noise for the most exposed façade of children's present and historical addresses at 6 time points from pregnancy to age 8. We investigated effects on BMI trajectories using repeated measures and linear mixed models.Results: The results indicated that BMI curves depended on road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy, but not on exposure during childhood. Children in the highest decile of traffic noise exposure had increased BMI, with 0.35 kg/m more than children in the lowest decile, from birth to age 8 years.Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy may be associated with children's BMI trajectories. Future studies should investigate this further, using anthropometric measures such as waist-hip ratio and skinfold thickness, in addition to BMI.

AB  - Background: Both short and prolonged sleep duration have been linked to impaired glucose metabolism. Sleep patterns change during pregnancy, but prospective data are limited on their relation to gestational diabetes.Objective: We sought to prospectively examine the trimester-specific (first and second trimester) association between typical sleep duration in pregnancy and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes, as well as the influence of compensatory daytime napping on this association.Study Design: In the prospective, multiracial Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, 2581 pregnant women reported their typical sleep duration and napping frequency in the first and second trimesters. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes (n = 107; 4.1%) was based on medical records review. Adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for gestational diabetes were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy body mass index, and other risk factors.Results: From the first and second trimester, sleep duration and napping frequency declined. Sleeping duration in the second but not first trimester was significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes. The association between second-trimester sleep and gestational diabetes differed by prepregnancy obesity status (P for interaction = .04). Among nonobese but not obese women, both sleeping >8-9 hours or <8-9 hours were significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes: 5-6 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.99); 7 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68); or ≥10 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.67). Significant effect modification by napping frequency was also observed in the second trimester (P for interaction = .03). Significant and positive association between reduced sleep (5-7 hours) and gestational diabetes was observed among women napping rarely/never (adjusted relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.13), whereas no comparable associations were observed among women napping most/sometimes.Conclusion: Our data suggest a U-shaped association between sleep duration and gestational diabetes, and that napping and prepregnancy obesity status may modify this association.

AB  - Background: Mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment might lessen both patients' discomfort and multiple births, with their associated risks. We aimed to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs.Methods: We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist co-treatment combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12.5%), total costs per couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970.Findings: The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term livebirth after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI was -9.8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy outcomes was 0.5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13.1% (p<0.0001) with standard treatment, and mean total costs were 8333 euros and 10745 euros, respectively (difference 2412 euros, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences between the groups in the anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, or sleep quality of the mother.Interpretation: Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the influence of analytical design on the variability of published results in studies of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: The results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622 control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period. RESULTS: As additional variables are added, previously published SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, > or =3 previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation, being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period caused > or =3 previous live births and a reduced birth weight to become significant. CONCLUSION: The variables found to be significant in a case-control study, depend on what is included in a multivariate model.

AB  - Introduction: Benzodiazepines are prescribed inappropriately in up to 40% of outpatients. The purpose of this study is to describe a collaborative team-based care model in which clinical pharmacists work with primary care providers (PCPs) to improve the safe use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleep disorders and to assess the preliminary results of the impact of the clinical service on patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients were eligible if they received care from the academic primary care clinic, were prescribed a benzodiazepine chronically, and were not pregnant or managed by psychiatry. Outcomes included baseline PCP confidence and knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine use, patient symptom severity, and medication changes. Results: Twenty-five of 57 PCPs responded to the survey. PCPs reported greater confidence in diagnosing and treating generalized anxiety and panic disorders than sleep disorder and had variable knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Twenty-nine patients had at least 1 visit. Over 44 total patient visits, 59% resulted in the addition or optimization of a nonbenzodiazepine medication and 46% resulted in the discontinuation or optimization of a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety symptom severity scores significantly improved (−2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): −3.57 to −0.43). Conclusion: Collaborative team-based models that include clinical pharmacists in primary care can assist in optimizing high-risk benzodiazepine use. Although these findings suggest improvements in safe medication use and symptoms, additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

AB  - Objectives.- To provide a guide to the use and limitations of continuous opioid therapy (COT, or daily scheduled opioids) for refractory daily headache, based on the best available evidence and expert clinical experience. Background.- There has been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring. Methods.- A multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December 2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American Headache Society. Results.- The guide identifies factors that would qualify or disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy, neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric disorders. Conclusions.- Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%) of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety.

AB  - Objectives: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) is the most common sleep-related movement disorder in pregnancy. We designed a prospective longitudinal study to investigate the correlates of WED/RLS during and after pregnancy.Design: A total of 138 pregnant women with WED/RLS and a control group of 251 age-matched pregnant women were enrolled prospectively. A questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview at first evaluation during pregnancy and three months after delivery.Results: Among all women in the first trimester, 15.6% were diagnosed with WED/RLS, whereas 32.8% of those in the second trimester and 38.8% of those in the third trimester were diagnosed with WED/RLS (p = 0.032). In regression analysis, later gestational age [p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.054] and previous history of WED/RLS (p = 0.001; OR 2.795) were positively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS, while ferritin levels (p = 0.001; OR 0.956) were negatively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS. Ferritin levels were also negatively correlated with the International RLS Study Group severity index (p = 0.041). Forty-eight patients (34.8%) experienced WED/RLS symptomatology after delivery. The ferritin levels were lower, and the mean number of pregnancies was higher, in women with residual WED/RLS (p = 0.008).Conclusion: Our survey showed that WED/RLS was more common in the second and third trimesters. Emergence of WED/RLS during the second trimester was strongly associated with residual WED/RLS. Lower ferritin levels were associated with both WED/RLS in pregnancy and residual WED/RLS after delivery. A higher number of pregnancies were also associated with a greater likelihood of having residual WED/RLS after delivery.

AB  - Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ≥ 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) ≥ 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group ( n = 176) and control group ( n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor ( p < .05). At 42 days after delivery, only 5.1% of participants were lost to follow-up, and the intervention group had significantly less minor and major depression, more sleep time, more satisfaction with their husband and other family members, less concern about taking care of baby, and less breast milk insufficiency than the control group ( p < .05). A prenatal psychological intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-15006433), (retrospectively registered).
