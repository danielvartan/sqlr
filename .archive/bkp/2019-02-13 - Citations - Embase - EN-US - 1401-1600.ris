N2  - Objective / Background Antenatal depression has been associated with poorer cognitive and language development and an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in the offspring. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and child development. The aim was to examine whether treatment of depression in pregnant women leads to changes in infant sleep and temperament. Methods 36 women with antenatal depression were allocated to CBT or Care as usual of which 25 completed the postnatal follow-up. Maternal depression was measured using the EPDS at baseline (16 weeks gestation), post-treatment (15 week follow-up) and 2 months postnatal. Infant temperament and sleep were measured at 2 months of age via maternal report using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire and the Brief Infant sleep Questionnaire. Results No differences were found by treatment arm. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy (irrespective of treatment arm) was associated with easier temperament (r=-.48, p=.024) and shorter sleep duration over the night (r=-.58, p=.003). When the analysis was stratified by treatment arm the associations were only apparent in the CBT group (r=-.69, p=.006 & r=-.69, p=.006). Conclusion / Discussion This is the first trial for women with antenatal depression examining infant outcomes. This pilot RCT has demonstrated that improvement in depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the mother and her infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly due to changes in mother-infant relationship remains to be determined.

N2  - Background: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with increased risk of prematurity and neurodevelopmental impairment. FGR also alters sleep state distribution in utero and delays circadian rhythm maturation in infancy. Currently, limited data on the long-term effects of FGR on childhood sleep exist. Given that sleep is important for neurodevelopment and that poor sleep can lead to impairments in neurocognition, we assessed the effect of FGR on sleep in children aged between 5 and 12 years. Method: 11 children born preterm and FGR (gestation at birth: 30 ± 1 wks, birthweight: 1117 ± 125 g), 6 children born preterm but appropriately grown (AGA) (gestation at birth: 30 ± 1 wks, birthweight: 1627 ± 331 g) and 10 term-born, appropriately grown children (controls) were studied using overnight polysomnography. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) were scored in the following stages NREM1, NREM2 (N2), NREM3 (N3) and REM sleep. There were no differences in age or weight at the time of testing between the three groups. Results: Compared to term and preterm AGA children, FGR children had a higher amount of N2 (p < 0.05) and a lower amount of N3 (p < 0.05). Preterm AGA children had reduced sleep efficiency compared to IUGR and term children (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Prematurity and FGR have long-lasting effects on childhood sleep. N3 sleep is important for brain maturation and memory consolidation. Sleep disturbance and its impact on neurodevelopment in FGR and preterm children warrants further investigation as a means of mitigating neurodevelopmental impairment in preterm children, whether born FGR or not.

N2  - Study Objectives: Our investigation aims to assess the impact of symptoms of maternal sleep disordered breathing, specifically sleep apnea risk and daytime sleepiness, on fetal leukocyte telomere length. Participants and Setting: Pregnant women were recruited upon hospital delivery admission. Interventions: Sleep exposure outcomes were measured using the Berlin Questionnaire to quantify sleep apnea and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure daytime sleepiness. Participants were classified as 'High Risk' or 'Low Risk' for sleep apnea based on responses to the Berlin, while 'Normal' or 'Abnormal' daytime sleepiness was determined based on responses to the Epworth. Design: N eonatal u mbilical c ord b lood s amples ( N = 67) were c ollected a nd g enomic D NA was i solated f rom c ord b lood l eukocytes u sing Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical procedures were employed. Measurements and Results: On the Berlin, 68.7% of participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value < 0.05), and the T/S ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual snorers (P value < 0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.

N2  - Background: Sleep loss during pregnancy is an emerging health concern as developing fetal neural networks are highly vulnerable to maternal sleep loss and are at a high risk predisposition to various anxiety disorders/ learning disabilities in growing children. Objectives: In strictly controlled experiments in animal model, we aimed to investigate role of different components of sleep in modulating the neural plasticity in the developing brain. Material and methods: The effects of sleep deprivation (Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep of 20 h or total sleep of 5h) in female Wistar rats during third term of pregnancy were tested on the cognitive development in their offspring. Results: The REM sleep deprivation during third trimester of pregnancy impaired the maternal behavior during first post-partum week. Litters born to these dams showed significant lower body weights during entire development and had lesser vocalizations in comparison to control pups. However, neonates from total sleep deprivation of 5h in dams displayed increased vocalizations and high risktaking behavior during adolescence. The ontogenetic profiles of sleep-wakefulness in these neonates provided further evidences on altered neural development. Conclusion: The alterations in emotional and sleepwakefulness profile in the neonates indicated that maternal sleep is an important factor in modulating the cognitive development of infants.

N2  - Objective / Background Pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways: There are hormonal, physiological and behavioral changes as well as physical factors. These may affect the sleeping pattern, duration and quality of sleep and can lead to a variety of sleep disorders. The spectrum ranges from an increased incidence of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and parasomnias like restless legs syndrome to snoring and excessive sleepiness. Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Furthermore, sleep disturbances are a common symptom of diseases like depression, frequently diagnosed in pregnancy. Methods Poor sleep quality and -quantity in pregnancy is one of the most frequent complaints in our pharmacological consultation “medication in pregnancy and lactation”. Sleep deprivation can worsen the mothers condition and pose a risk to mother and unborn. Therefore severe sleeping disorders have to be treated in pregnancy. Results Pregnant women suffering from sleep disorders are treated with a large variety of drugs which are often prescribed or administered over-the- counter without a proper benefit/ risk analysis. A treatment can be problematic due to possible adverse effects to mother and embryo or fetus. Conclusion / Discussion Despite our understanding of the various sleep problems and their high incidences in pregnancy, suitable treatment recommendations are sparse and inconsistent. Given that limitation, we present an up-to-date review of the current pharmacological treatment options, e.g. neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics and phytotherapeutic preparations and their known risks for mother and unborn based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties as well as teratovigilance data.

N2  - Background & Aims Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is defined by pruritus, elevated total fasting serum bile salts (TBS) and transaminases, and an increased risk of adverse fetal outcome. An accurate diagnostic marker is needed. Increased serum autotaxin correlates with cholestasis-associated pruritus. We aimed at unraveling the diagnostic accuracy of autotaxin in ICP. Methods Serum samples and placental tissue were collected from 44 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 105 with pruritus and/or elevated serum transaminases. Autotaxin serum levels were quantified enzymatically and by Western blotting, autotaxin gene expression by quantitative PCR. Results Serum autotaxin was increased in ICP (mean ± SD: 43.5 ± 18.2 nmol ml-1 min-1, n = 55, p <0.0001) compared to other pruritic disorders of pregnancy (16.8 ± 6.7 nmol ml-1 min-1, n = 33), pre-eclampsia complicated by HELLP-syndrome (16.8 ± 8.9 nmol ml-1 min-1, n = 17), and pregnant controls (19.6 ± 5.7 nmol ml-1 min-1, n = 44). Longitudinal analysis during pregnancy revealed a marked rise in serum autotaxin with onset of ICP-related pruritus. Serum autotaxin was increased in women taking oral contraceptives. Increased serum autotaxin during ICP was not associated with increased autotaxin mRNA in placenta. With a cut-off value of 27.0 nmol ml-1 min-1, autotaxin had an excellent sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing ICP from other pruritic disorders or pre-eclampsia/HELLP-syndrome. Serum autotaxin displayed no circadian rhythm and was not influenced by food intake. Conclusions Increased serum autotaxin activity represents a highly sensitive, specific and robust diagnostic marker of ICP, distinguishing ICP from other pruritic disorders of pregnancy and pregnancy-related liver diseases. Pregnancy and oral contraception increase serum autotaxin to a much lesser extent than ICP.

N2  - In postpartum maternal sleep disturbances are common. Though, partly physiological, sleep alterations may also be symptoms of distress and psychopathology. Moreover, non-restoring sleep impairs the mothers' resources of stress coping. This may result in a vicious cycle of maternal exhaustion, depression and poor role performance. Besides, impairment of the mother may affect the infant's well-being and vice versa. Infant's crying and insomnia may have an immediate effect on maternal sleep and her mental health. In this symposium we will explore the multiple facets of maternal and infants' sleep in postpartum. The presentations will highlight new findings such as the use of haircortisol assessments in women pre- and postpartum. Result of a study using biomarkers such as sleep-EEG and haircortisol in the prediction of postpartum depression will be reported. Furthermore the impact of maternal anxiety and depressive disorder on infant insomnia disorders and the importance to identify mother-infant dyads at risk and provision of preventive intervention will be presented. Psychopharmacology might be indicated in severe cases of insomnia during pregnancy, the benefits and risks for the fetus are the focus of one of the presentations. The investigation of the link between infants crying and the consequence to mothers sleep and well-being will be explored. The symposium joins researchers in order to shed light on sleep in mothers and infants, the use of biomarkers and present important work regarding prediction and prevention of maternal and infant psychopathology as well as psychopharmacology in sleep disorders of pregnant women.

N2  - The goal of this symposium is to present new data utilizing complementary biopsychosocial approaches to examine stress and health during pregnancy and postpartum, with a primary focus on race and sleep as predictors of cardiovascular and inflammatory processes. There are marked racial disparities in cardiovascular disorders as well as adverse birth outcomes. Novel data presented in this symposium by our first speaker demonstrate that cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy is impaired among African Americans versus European Americans, and racial discrimination has moderating effects. In addition, data presented by the second speaker from a racially diverse sample of 128 pregnant women show that associations between poor sleep quality and elevations in serum proinflammatory cytokines, as well as poor birth outcomes, are more robust among African Americans compared to Whites. Related are new data presented by the third speaker showing that daytime napping may provide a useful countermeasure to sleep disruption during pregnancy. Our final speaker will present biopsychosocial associations in postpartum using data on stress and inflammation from a racially diverse low income sample of over 1,200 women assessed across the first year after childbirth. In sum, this symposium will provide an overview of a set of novel, interrelated, and clinically meaningful research on psychosocial stress and perinatal health in high risk populations. Ample time for questions is planned to highlight connections among presentations and frontiers in perinatal biopsychosocial research including translational directions.

N2  - Objective / Background During perinatal transmission maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis functioning and sleep regulation undergo profound physiological alterations, which may partly explain vulnerability to postpartum depression (PPD). The aim of this study was therefore to explore haircortisol and variables of sleep-EEG to predict PPD. We supposed that women with PPD differed in haircortisol levels and presented with increased sleep impairment. Methods A total of 130 postpartum mothers with regular pregnancies and deliveries were assessed 3 months post partum (p.p.). Haircortisol was analysed in two hair segments, retrospectively representing cortisol production of third trimenon and of 3 months p.p. Sleep was assessed by sleep-EEGs at home. Additionally, questionnaires related to PPD, subjective sleep quality, parenting stress and postpartum bonding were completed. Twenty-one mothers with depressive symptoms (“PPDGroup”) were compared to a control group. Results The following results in haircortisol levels will be presented: Differences in haircortisol between pre- and postpartum segment, differences in haircortisol between depressive vs. euthymic mothers and correlations between perinatal decrease of haircortisol and severity of depression, sleep quality and parenting stress. In the PPD-group sleep efficiency index was decreased and percentage of NREM sleep stage 3 was smaller. Total sleep time was correlated with severity of depression. Number of awakenings correlated with more difficulties in postpartum bonding. Conclusion / Discussion This is the first study applying haircortisol analysis to investigate differences of mothers with PPD vs. a control group. Although sleep disturbances are common in postpartum, these issues are more severe in PPD and are associated with impairment of mother-infant-relationship.

N2  - There are gender differences in the upper airway function and respiratory stability in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Hormones are implicated in some gender-related differences, and these differences between men and women appear to mitigate as age increases. In addition, changes in the airway and lung function during pregnancy can contribute to snoring and OSA that might have an adverse effect on the mother and fetus. The limited data available suggest that although the prevalence and severity of OSA may be lower in women, the consequences of the disease are similar, if not worse. Women with OSA may have greater risk for hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, be more likely to develop comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression and have increased mortality. Therefore, treatment options specifically targeting female presentations and pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are expected to result in improved outcomes in women.

N2  - An adequate rhythm of progesterone (P4) is crucial for determining the physiological duration of the estrous cycle and for achieving a successful pregnancy. Tumor necrosis factor is a pleiotropic cytokine and TNF receptor p55 (TNFRp55) mediates most of the TNF effects. We previously showed that P4 levels and its synthetic enzyme (3β- HSD) exhibit a circadian rhythm in the ovary in diestrus. In this work we investigate the consequences of the lack of TNFRp55 in the P4 metabolism at the end of pregnancy, in C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and TNFRp55-/- (KO) mice. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle, at 24±2°C, with irradiated food and water available ad-libitum. Five days before the experiment mice were kept under constant darkness conditions. Ovaries were isolated every 6 h (24-48 h before delivery) during a 24h period. P4 and 3β-HSD protein levels were determined by RIA and Western blot, respectively. Similar to that we previously observed in diestrus, P4 levels are circadian in the ovary of WT mice (p<0,01) at late pregnancy; TNFRp55 deficiency abolished that circadian pattern. On the other hand, the expression of 3β-HSD protein is arrhythmic in the ovary of WT and TNFRp55-/- mice at the end of pregnancy. These results suggest that the absence of the signaling system TNFRp55 affects rhythmicity of P4 levels at the end of pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Excessive sleep fragmentation (SF) is common in pregnant women. Adult-onset metabolic disorders may begin during early development and exhibit substantial sex dimorphism. We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction induced by gestational SF in male mice would not be apparent in female littermates. Methods: Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in male and female offspring after late gestational SF or control sleep (SC). At 20 weeks, plasma leptin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, and insulin and glucose tolerance tests were assessed. Leptin and adiponectin, M1, and M2 macrophage messenger RNA expression and polarity were examined. Adiponectin gene promoter methylation levels in several tissues were assessed. Results: Food intake, body weight, visceral fat mass, and insulin resistance were higher, and adiponectin levels lower in male but not female offspring exposed to gestational SF. However, dyslipidemia was apparent in both male and female offspring exposed to SF, albeit of lesser magnitude. In visceral fat, leptin messenger RNA expression was selectively increased and adiponectin expression was decreased in male offspring exposed to gestational SF, but adiponectin was increased in exposed female offspring. Differences in adipokine expression also emerged in liver, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. Increased M1 macrophage markers were present in male offspring exposed to SF (SFOM) while increased M2 markers emerged in SF in female offspring (SFOF). Similarly, significant differences emerged in the methylation patterns of adiponectin promoter in SFOM and SFOF. Conclusion: Gestational sleep fragmentation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in male but not in female offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Thus, sleep perturbations impose long-term detrimental effects to the fetus manifesting as sex dimorphic metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

N2  - Objective / Background Although maternal mental health problems have often been discussed as relevant conditions for infant insomnia disorders (ID), the role of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy has been widely neglected. This study examines the prospective-longitudinal associations from maternal lifetime DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders to ID. Methods In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study (Martini et al. 2013; n=306), anxiety and depressive disorders (CIDI-V, Martini et al. 2009) were repeatedly investigated from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum. ID were assessed using a structured diagnostic interview (Baby-DIPS) with the mothers. Analyses comprise all mother-infant dyads who were retained in the study after delivery (N=286). Results In this sample, n=35 cases of ID were identified (12.2 %). As compared to mothers with no anxiety nor depressive disorder prior to pregnancy, infants of mothers with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders were at higher risk for ID (OR=3.3, 95 %CI=1.3-8.1, p=0.009). When considering anxiety and depressive disorders independently from their comorbid presentation, ID was significantly predicted by maternal depressive disorders (OR=2.2, 95 %CI=1.1- 4.5, p=0.030) and the association with anxiety disorders slightly failed to reach significance (OR=1.9, 95 % CI=0.9-4.0 p=0.083). Conclusion / Discussion The relation between maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders and ID may be explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy and a lack of knowledge on adequate sleep management in mothers with prior depression. Comorbid anxiety disorders may additionally compromise maternal co-regulatory parenting.

N2  - Objective / Background The scientific literature on postpartum psychopathology refers almost exclusively to women. Paternal “postpartum” mood disorders have attracted far less attention and some studies suggest that these are relatively rare. However, a recent meta-analysis reported that the prevalence of paternal depression in the period between the first trimester of pregnancy and the first year post-partum is estimated at 10 %, with higher rates of 25 % during the 3- to 6-month post-partum period. Bipolar disorder (i.e., the occurrence of mania, hypomania, and mixed states next to depression) is rarely addressed in the current research on paternal perinatal psychopathology. In women, risk factors for developing postpartum mood disorders are primiparity, obstretic complications, night time deliveries, recent life events. Some of these risk factors may also apply to men. There is a significant temporal relationship between sleep disruption and mood change, especially between loss of sleep and the occurrence of a hypomanic or manic episode. Methods literature review on etiology of bipolar paternal postpartum psychopathology, especially loss of sleep peripartum Results An overview of the literature of bipolar paternal psychopathology will be given, especially loss of sleep as risk factor Conclusion / Discussion There is a well-known correlation between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode in general. The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the days around childbirth and the weeks thereafter may also negatively impact the course of bipolar disorder in the father. When the spouse of a male bipolar patient becomes pregnant, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be planned in advance.

N2  - Melatonin is an essential hormone, which regulates circadian rhythms and has antioxidative and anticarcinogenic effects. As melatonin secretion is suppressed by light, this effect was examined on the offspring of the Wistar rat females exposed to continuous light (500 lux) during the second half of the pregnancy (day 12 to 21). Control rats were kept under a 12:12 light-dark cycle. The resulted male offspring have been behaviorally assessed for depression after postnatal day 60 by using Forced Swim Test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST). Animals resulted from the melatonin deprived pregnancies have developed an abnormal response in the TST, but a normal FST behavior. Also, TST active movement was different in the melatonin suppression group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that intrauterine melatonin deprivation might be linked to the depressive like behavior in adult male offspring.

N2  - Objective / Background Factors associated to depression in men during the transition to parenthood are poorly understood. This study reports the rate of depressed mood in first-time expectant fathers during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy and examines associated risk factors Methods As part of a prospective study examining depressive symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 540 men (mean age= 34 years, ± 5 years) completed questionnaires measuring depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy (study entry). Partners also completed the measure of depressed mood in the third trimester. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) was used to assess depressed mood, with the cut-off score≥10 used to indicate elevated depressive symptoms. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations between depressive symptoms and demographic, behavioral and psychosocial factors. Results About 13 % of expectant fathers exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with depressive symptoms in men were unemployment, poorer sleep quality, lower perceived social support, more stressful life events, greater financial stressors and depressed mood in their partners, together accounting for 34 % of the variance. Conclusion / Discussion A significant number of expectant fathers experience elevated depressive symptoms during their partner's pregnancy. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in screening and early prevention efforts targeting perinatal depression.

N2  - Background: Despite increases in obesity among children under 2 years, few interventions have targeted this age group. Mothers and Others (M&O) will close this gap by testing the efficacy of a multi-component obesity prevention intervention versus an attention control (child safety) in promoting healthy weight gain patterns among African-American (AA) infants. The current study describes the design process and formative research findings. Methods: Formative data came from 3 sources: existing literature; preliminary longitudinal cohort of 217 AA mother-infant dyads; and, 20 semi-structured interviews with AA moms, dads and grandmothers. Results: The trial will be conducted among 468 AA mothers recruited through antenatal clinics. Intervention mothers will identify a study partner to participate with her. Delivery channels include face-to-face peer counseling through 6 home visits, support from a lactation consultant, 6 newsletters, and twice weekly text messages. Outcomes include differences in weight-for-length z-scores at 18 months (main outcome) and breastfeeding, healthy complementary feeding, age-appropriate sleep duration and lower levels of television and electronic media exposure (secondary outcomes). Formative feedback was generally positive, with target participants also requesting information on postpartum weight loss, depression, maternal sleep, father-infant bonding and maintaining intimate relationships. Discussion. M&O contains several innovations, including beginning during a 'teachable' moment, pregnancy; active engagement of multiple caregivers; and use of text messaging. If successful, M&O will have high public health relevance for future obesity-prevention efforts aimed at children less than 2 years.

N2  - Introduction A two year old girl presented with prolonged bleeding following a fall. A strong family history of haemophilia was ignored during visits to health professionals due to the misconception that female carriers are unaffected! She was extensively investigated and was found to have Factor VIII deficiency which did not respond to Tranexamic acid and Desmopressin. This was discovered three weeks prior to her preoperative assessment for an adenotonsillectomy. Routine pre op checks, which do not always involve clotting and the above misconception, could have affected her severely perioperatively. This case highlights the importance of detailed history taking including family history and remembering that Haemophilia can, and does affect females. Case report AG was born without complication, at term by forceps delivery. Mother had heavy postpartum bleeding. She developed obstructive sleep apnoea, and adeno-tonsillectomy was planned. Three weeks before her pre-operative assessment she fell, tearing her frenulum. Persistent bleeding led to a paediatric assessment. Initial investigation revealed her haemoglobin was 88, APTT 1.5 and APTT ratio 45 and rest normal. Further investigation revealed low Factor VIIIc levels (36), 72% of expected. Other factors were normal. Detailed history taking revealed a family history of Factor VIII deficiency (maternal grandmother: carrier, maternal aunt: affected). AG received Tranexamic Acid and a Desmopressin infusion, followed by a Factor VIII infusion at the Haematology unit due to persistent bleeding. Communications between ENT a haematology is ongoing to carry out a safe surgery. Conclusion This was a near miss event which will require ongoing care from a consultant haematologist. Clinicians need to be aware that Haemophilia can, and does, affect females. 28% of female carriers of Haemophilia A are known to have Factor VIII levels consistent with mild Haemophilia. This case should raise our awareness about thorough history taking, and updating our knowledge about Haemophilia, to avoid future catastrophes. There are also important implications for her mother. We recommend checking Factor VIII activity levels in all haemophilia carriers before haemostatic challenge, such as pregnancy.

N2  - Objective / Background The relationship between depression/anxiety and obesity is bidirectional. Obesity, depression and excessive gestational weight gain are associated with poor outcomes for mother and baby. We are studying the relationship between weight gain, obesity and mental health in pregnancy. Methods The Nutrition in Pregnancy Clinic is a multidisciplinary prenatal care program for obese women. The clinic has implemented a study to look at weight gain, associated factors, and the effects of increasing attention on weight management and nutrition. In order to gauge the prevalence of psychiatric illness in this population a chart review was undertaken. Weight measures and obstetric outcomes were monitored. The chart review assessed engagement in mental health care, social work recommendations and willingness for mental health care. Results Between May 2011 and January 2014, 225 women with BMI over 30 at the initial intake (and six additional women with BMI just below30) engaged in the clinic and consented to the study. Of those there is complete data on 124 women including data about delivery. A third of women had psychiatric illness noted in their medical record. Over one fifth of women with psychiatric illness had a history of suicide attempt. Only 13 women were receiving mental health care initially. Social work referred over 20 % of the 231 women to mental health services and additional support. A third of those referred said they declined or were unable to use the referral. Of those who delivered, a history of psychiatric illness was associated with poorer sleep at intake, history or current alcohol abuse, smoking, lack of support from the father, and history of abuse. Higher pre-pregnancy weight was associated with history or current alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, and history of abuse. There was a trend that those who had a psychiatric history were just as likely to attend their postpartum visit but were more likely to have gained weight postpartum compared to prepregnancy. Conclusion / Discussion History of psychiatric illness is common in this group of obese women and most are not engaged in mental health care. There were similar factors associated with both those with higher prepregnancy weight and those with psychiatric history. It may not be lower engagement in the OB clinic but other factors leading towards a trend of those with psychiatric history being more likely to have net weight gain. There is on-going need for work to engage the obese gravida with mental health care needs and to understand the unique needs of women with psychiatric illness in improving their health through nutrition and weight management.

N2  - Introduction: Point mutations or copy number variations in the FOXG1 gene result in developmental encephalopathy, also called congenital variant of Rett Syndrome (MIM 613454). Clinical features include severe mental retardation, absent speech, autistic behavior, and epilepsy. Furthermore, deletions of 14q12 including FOXG1 or intragenic mutations are associated with severe postnatal microcephaly, dyskinesia, and malformations of the corpus callosum. Patients carrying duplications of 14q12 show in contrast normal head size and corpus callosum morphology. Case Report: The boy was born at term to healthy parents after normal pregnancy with 3,530g birth weight (P41), 52 cm (P39) height, and 33.5 cm (P5) head circumference. During the first 3 months, irritability and a poor sleep pattern appeared; later poor eye contact and decelerating head circumference were noticed. On examination at 12 months of age, hypotonia and dystonic hand movements were observed. Psychomotor development was significantly retarded. At the age of 2.5 years, he was able to grasp, to turn, and to crawl. He could speak four to five single words. He never had epileptic seizures. Multiple EEGs revealed no epileptic activity. His brain MRI displayed an agenesis of the corpus callosum and a delayed myelination. Routine chromosome analysis and array CGH as well as metabolic diagnostic yielded normal results. By sequencing FOXG1, a pathogenic mutation (c.256delC, p.Q86Rfs∗106) in the heterozygous state was detected. Discussion: Even in the absence of epilepsy, a FOXG1-related disorder should be considered for children showing a severe postnatal microcephaly, severe mental retardation, dyskinesia, and malformation of the corpus callosum. In these cases, a detailed genetic analysis including sequencing of FOXG1 is required.

N2  - Objective / Background Background: There appears to be a bidirectional relationship between perinatal depression (PND) and obesity with each being a causal factor for the other. Objective: A comprehensive review of current literature and innovative new interdisciplinary research examining the associations between PND, obesity, and postpartum weight retention in cohorts of perinatal women will be presented and discussed. Methods Examination of biological factors, lifestyle changes and psychosocial factors that may contribute to both depression and obesity in the perinatal period. Results Obesity and postpartum weight retention appear to increase the risk for postpartum depression; however, the relationship between obesity and antenatal depression is less clear. Complex biological changes including inflammation, HPA axis dysregulation and the hormonal changes that are associated with pregnancy, labor, and delivery may play a significant role in this relationship. Psychosocial issues including body image perceptions about overweight status, poor self-esteem, and self-directed cognitions concerning eating behaviors, weight and shape likely have significant contributions. Additionally, the influence of sleep dysregulation, associated fatigue, varying energy levels during pregnancy and postpartum, and decreased physical activity might also influence the risk of prenatal obesity and depression. Conclusion / Discussion PND is complex and requires further attention. Elucidating biomarkers to facilitate early identification and intervention could improve the perinatal and long-term mental health of both mother and baby. Future studies might include larger cohorts of women with longitudinal assessment recruited pre-pregnancy and followed through the postpartum period using a valid and reliable assessment of PND and tracking weight and BMI in order to eliminate selection bias.

N2  - Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is the underlying pathophysiological condition seen in individuals with sleep apnea. Exposure of pregnant females to CIH results in offspring that are hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and have impaired earlystage glucose tolerance. However, the underlying mechanisms for these changes remain elusive. This study was done to determine changes in glucoregulatory function of the liver in offspring as a result of CIH exposure during gestational development. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were mated and exposed daily to CIH from gestational day-1 to day-20. Offspring were sacrificed at postnatal day-1 or 6-weeks of age to determine immediate and long-term changes in liver function. By 6 weeks of age, male CIH offspring had higher plasma corticosterone concomitant with higher hepatic protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and this was associated with lower hepatic Liver X Receptor (LXR) expression, the nuclear receptor involved in suppressing glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (11β-HSD1) expression. Analysis of both GR and LXR-direct target genes in gluconeogenesis showed that hepatic G6Pase and 11β-HSD1 were higher in the CIH offspring, while no changes in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase protein levels were observed. These data suggest that gestational exposure to CIH results in long-term alteration of glucose homeostasis via increased glucocorticoid signaling and augmented expression of gluconeogenic enzymes due in part to LXR signaling in the liver.

N2  - Objective / Background Previous research on PTSD following childbirth has mainly focused on its etiology and thus established a number of risk factors that are associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, much less is known about postpartum factors that maintain PTSD symptoms. Methods This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort (ABC), a prospective cohort study which targeted all women scheduled to give birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Recruitment took place from November 2008 to April 2010. For the present study, we used questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum. One thousand four hundred seventy-three women completed all these three questionnaires and thus were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. In the first regression model, PTSD symptoms at 2 years postpartum were regressed on each potential maintaining factor separately and adjusted for PTSD symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum. In the second model, all maintaining factors were entered simultaneously in the regression analysis. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to posttraumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum. ResultsWe found several low to moderate associations between potential maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. However, adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Furthermore, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. Conclusion / Discussion Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments.

N2  - LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: To recognize acute cannabis intoxication as a cause of myocarditis in young patients. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: To learn about the various newer toxic effects of contemporary forms of street cannabis on the human heart. CASE: A 21-year-old African American woman with no past medical history and on no medications came with nausea and vomiting that started a few hours after smoking marijuana. She was seen in the ER and sent home with pantoprazole. The patient returned 8 h later with severe mid-chest tightness, 10/10 in intensity, which woke her up from sleep. The pain radiated to both shoulders and jaw with some shortness of breath, sweating, nausea and clear vomitus. There were no aggravating or relieving factors. No history of trauma. No history of previous chest pain/heart attacks. No family history of premature MI or CVA. She used occasional alcohol but no binge drinking. She admitted to smoking marijuana for the last 2 years. Physical exam: BP 124/77, heart rate 90, respirations 14, temperature 98.1, 100 % O2 saturation on room air. Heart was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Lung and abdominal exams were normal. She had normal distal pulses, no calf tenderness, no leg edema, and no skin rash. Laboratory: normal WBC and differential, Hgb 13.4. Electrolytes, liver function and lipase were all normal. Troponin was high at 0.78 and 2 h later was 1.56. Urine toxicology was positive for only cannabis. Alcohol level was zero. Pregnancy test: negative. Chest X-ray was normal. The first EKG was normal sinus rhythm but a few hours later she developed diffuse ST depressions and multiple ventricular ectopic beats. Later, she developed runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Hospital Course: The patient was initially treated as acute coronary syndrome with full dose heparin, beta blockers, nitroglycerine and amiodarone drip for her NSVT. Echocardiogram showed normal LV EF of 60 %, mild ventricular enlargement, small pericardial effusion and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Left heart catheterization showed normal coronary circulation. Her HIV, hepatitis, Coxsackie, West Nile virus, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia testing were all negative. In light of acute cannabis abuse with positive troponins, with negative cardiac cath and diffuse ST changes on EKG the patient was finally diagnosed with acute cannabis induced myocarditis. Her condition was stabilized and she was discharged in good condition three days later. DISCUSSION: Cannabis sativa or marijuana has been known to man since 800 A.D, as a substance that alleviates pain and cures insomnia. Over time cannabis developed into one of the most widely misused recreational drugs. It has a dose-dependent acute effect on the autonomic nervous system. At low doses it causes an increase in sympathetic activity and a decrease in parasympathetic activity. This causes tachycardia and increased cardiac output. High doses of cannabis inhibit sympathetic activity and increase parasympathetic activity leading to bradycardia and hypotension. Acute cardiac effects occur commonly in the first 2-72 h of intoxication. Cannabis has also been linked to acute coronary vasospasm manifesting as acute coronary syndrome. Peripheral arteriopathy (cannabis arteritis) has also been reported. Reversible EKG abnormalities including ST-T segment changes with increased ectopy has been seen. There are also case reports of cardiac muscle damage manifesting as myocarditis, myopericarditis and serious cardiac arrhythmias including sudden cardiac death, especially if combined with alcohol. The severity of myocarditis is variable with occasional permanent damage leading to heart failure with one report of a patient requiring a left ventricular assist device. Myocardial biopsy pathology has shown sparse lymphocytic myocardial infiltrates, subendocardial and interstitial fibrosis with normal vasculature. The reason more cardiovascular effects are being reported in the recent times may relate to the increased content of marijuana in each smoked joint (100- 150mg per joint compared to 10mg/joint in the 1960's). Another concern is that the street cannabis available today is known often contains additives intended to increase the psychotropic effects. These substancesmay have concomitant cardiac side effects. Typical additives include industrial etchants, solvents, micro glass beads, pesticide derivatives and chemical sugars. Cannabis has classically not been considered to the medical community as a possible fatal substance of abuse. Hence its association with deaths is often underreported. However, coroner autopsy studies in Ireland and addict surveillance programs in France have raised concerns about cannabis as a lethal agent over the last 8 years. Our case reminds physicians of a rare but potentially serious toxic effect of cannabis use which may be seen more and more as legalization is granted or considered in various states in the US.

N2  - Mother-infant bed-sharing has been associated with a higher risk of sleep-related infant deaths, which affects African Americans at a disproportionately higher rate. Although "separate but proximate sleep surfaces" for infants has been recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007-2010 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806 African Americans and 1,680 Whites (N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) and maternal education of 13-15 years (OR 2.0: 1.2-3.4) or ≥16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1-6.3) was associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1-1.8), breastfeeding (OR 2.5: 1.9-3.1), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2-2.3), being unmarried (OR 1.5: 1.1-2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1-2.3), and non-supine sleep (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should ask families about their infant's sleeping environment and address safety issues within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for bed-sharing.

N2  - Case Study: Connatal nutritional deficiency of vitamin B12 in a newborn with early neurologic symptoms. Case: The sixth child of a nonvegetarian German mother (GIX, PVI) and a Moroccan father, born in Germany with 36+5 weeks of gestation, birth weight 2,730g, Apgar 9/10/10, NapH 7.38 was presented. Postnatal phototherapy. From birth on hyperexcitability in wakefulness, not in sleep. Breastfed newborn under triple antihypertensive therapy of the mother. Hospitalization at calculated delivery date. Lying on her back, she showed cloni and shivering of arms and legs, left more than right; sometimes facial myocloni. We saw a megaloblastic anemia, which gave the hint toward a deficit of vitamin B12. Methylmalonic acid was slightly elevated as a typical sign of nutritive vitamin B12 deficit. Other examination as an MRI scan of the brain, cerebral fluid, etc., were normal. The EEG showed frontal and parietal spikes, not correlated with myocloni. After substitution of vitamin B12, the neurologic symptoms improved, even they did not resolve completely. Discussion: A nutritive deficiency of vitamin B12 usually shows symptoms between 4 and 6 months of age. If the deficiency is because of intrauterine lack of vitamin B12, there might be neurological symptoms from birth. In our case, the high parity, the small amount of consumed meat, and the lack of substitution is probably the cause for the substantial deficiency. Conclusion: Even in newborns of nonvegetarian mothers with neurological deficit connatal nutritional deficiency of vitamin B12 should be considered.

N2  - It is well documented that problematic sleep patterns in children are related to maternal mental health issues, such as stress, depression and anxiety. Although it is not clear whether it is the sleep patterns that predict maternal mental health or vice versa. Studies have called for the use of transactional models to allow for the contextual representation of the complexities of the interaction between mother and child. The current paper examines the potential bi-directional relationship between infant sleep patterns and maternal negative affect. Maternal negative affect was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. Infant sleep was measured using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and maternal ratings of infant sleep. Structural equation modeling suggests relationships are bi-directional but appear to weaken after 8 weeks, although there is some re-emergence of the relationship again at 9-12 months. Moreover, the results indicate poor maternal negative affect during pregnancy predicts poorer infant sleep at birth to eight weeks and two to six months, and poor infant sleep at birth to eight weeks predicts poorer maternal negative affect at 8 weeks old. The results indicate the relationship between maternal negative affect and infant sleep is bi-directional. Clinically, this has important implications for assessment and treatment, advocating the need for both constructs to be considered in the context of each other. They also highlight the importance of screening and treatment for maternal mental health during pregnancy and potential intervention for infant sleep problems in the early postnatal period.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate in non-depressed perinatal women, which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) scores and proportions of symptomatic items significantly differ through the perinatal period. Methods: 273 women were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, BDI-II and the PDSS at the third trimester of pregnancy/T0(mean age =29.42±7.159 years; mean weeks gestation=32.6±3.61), three/T1, six/T2 and twelve/T3 months postpartum. Results: Significantly higher scores in T0 than in T1/T2/T3 and in T1 than in T2/T3 were found for: Total PDSS, Sleeping-Eating Disturbances, Emotional Liability, Total BDI-II and its dimension Somatic-Anxiety. Only T0 and T1/T2 did not significantly differ in Anxiety/Insecurity, Mental Confusion, and Loss of Self. In Guilty/Shame only T1 was significantly higher than T3. Suicidal thoughts were significantly higher in T0 than T1 and lower in T1 than T2/T3. The proportions of symptomatic items systematically and significantly decreased fromT0 to T3 in changes of sleep, loss of interest in sex, feeling overwhelmed. Significantly higher symptomatic proportions in T0 than in all post-partum moments were found for: loss of energy, irritability, fatigue, changes in appetite, crying, indecisiveness and worthlessness (these last three also higher in T1 than inT3). Agitation was significantly higher in T1 than in T0. All the cognitive-affective symptoms from BDI-II and PDSS did not differ. Conclusion: From pregnancy to the twelfth month postpartum the depressive symptomatology, particularly somatic-affective symptoms, significantly decreased. However even for the women who are not clinically depressed, the perinatal period requires considerable psychological adjustment.

N2  - Objective: This cross-sectional study was aimed to investigate the factors associated with bipolar disorder in pregnant female, including sociodemographic parameters, social support, social conflict, suicidal idea and sleep. Methods: A total of 84 pregnant female were recruited. They filled out self-completing questionnaires on sociodemographic factors, obstetric history, depressive symptoms and bipolarity. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Korean version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Bipolarity was assessed using the Korean version of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (K-MDQ). Results: Nineteen participants (22.6%) had positive K-MDQ scores, suggesting the present of bipolarity. Positive EPDS group had twenty subjects (25%) who had depressive symptoms. The diathesis of bipolar disorder was associated with marital dissatisfaction, social conflict, depression and sleep. The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the only poor sleep was a risk of bipolarity. Conclusions: Pregnant female with bipolarity were more depressed and sleep problems than those without bipolarity. The results showed that the most important factor of influencing bipolarity was sleep. KEY WORDS: Pregnant female, Bipolar diathesis, Associated factors.

N2  - Circadian genes are expressed in virtually all cells and tissues, and circadian rhythms influence many bodily processes, including reproductive physiology. The expression of hMTNR1B is suppressed during pregnancy until late in term (much like the oxytocin receptor), at which time it is up-regulated to allow for the nocturnal melatonin/oxytocin synergy, which promotes strong nocturnal contractions. Little is currently known about the regulation of hMNTR1b, nor about its functional significance in the myometrium.We, therefore, aimed to elucidate some of the transcription factors that regulate hMNTR1b gene expression in the human myometrium and to determine if hMNTR1b is under circadian control. In this study,we used immortalized and primarymyometrial cells thatwere assessed for circadian gene expression rhythms using real-time bioluminometry and quantitative PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation examined the binding of the clock gene product brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like protein 1 (BMAL1) to the promoter of the hMTNR1B gene. Overexpression studies tested the role of circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and its partner BMAL1 in regulating hMTNR1B expression.We confirmed circadian clock gene expression in both immortalized human myometrial cells and primary myometrial cell cultures.We further showed that the hBMAL1 protein binds to an E-box motif in the proximal promoter of the hMTNR1B gene. Overexpression studies demonstrated that the BMAL1/CLOCK complex activates expression of hMTNR1B leading to a circadian rhythm in phase with the E-box driven clock gene hPER2 (Period 2). These results indicate, for the first time, the presence of a functional circadian clock in the human myometrium with the hMTNR1B gene as a clock controlled target. Further investigations could open new vistas for understanding the regulation of uterine contractions and the timing of human labor.

N2  - Introduction: Short and long sleep durations are associated with heightened risk for cardiovascular disease and vascular risk factors. Elevated homocysteine is also associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease; however, studies have yet to investigate the relationship between sleep duration and homocysteine. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that short and long sleep duration would be associated with clinical levels of homocysteine. Methods: Adults (n=2,469; ≥20y) from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were assessed for habitual sleep duration (coded as <5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and ≥10hrs) and fasting plasma homocysteine levels (<10 [normative], 10 to <15 [pre-clinical] and ≥15 [clinical] μmol/L). Participants were excluded if pregnant, lactating, missing data on the primary variables, or if they had a history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, or diagnosed sleep disorder. Population weighted, multinomial logistic regression analyses assessed the relationship between sleep duration and homocysteine after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital and menopausal status, shift work, dietary folate, alcohol intake, cotinine levels, reported physical activity, hypertension, and reported frequency of cessation of breathing at night. Results: Pre-clinical and clinical levels of homocysteine were present in 13.7% and 2.5% of the sample, respectively. The mean sleep duration was 6.9 ± 1.4 hours. In adjusted analyses, sleep duration was significantly related to homocysteine (p < 0.001). See Table. Very short sleepers (<5hrs) were more likely to have clinical levels of homocysteine (OR: 3.01, 95%CI: 1.38, 6.57) compared to 7-hr sleepers. Conclusions: In a U.S. representative sample of adults without cardiovascular disease or other major conditions, short sleepers were at greater odds for clinical levels of homocysteine Findings suggest that homocysteine may be one mechanism linking short sleep duration to cardiovascular disease.

N2  - Background: Cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are potential reproductive hazards for flight attendants.
Methods: Flight attendants from 3 US airlines in 3 cities were interviewed for pregnancy histories and lifestyle, medical, and occupational covariates. We assessed cosmic radiation and circadian disruption from company records of 2 million individual flights. Using Cox regression models, we compared respondents (1) by levels of flight exposures and (2) to teachers from the same cities, to evaluate whether these exposures were associated with miscarriage.
Results: Of 2654 women interviewed (2273 flight attendants and 381 teachers), 958 pregnancies among 764 women met study criteria. A hypothetical pregnant flight attendant with median firsttrimester exposures flew 130 hours in 53 flight segments, crossed 34 time zones, and flew 15 hours during her home-base sleep hours (10 pm-8 am), incurring 0.13 mGy absorbed dose (0.36 mSv effective dose) of cosmic radiation. About 2% of flight attendant pregnancies were likely exposed to a solar particle event, but doses varied widely. Analyses suggested that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of miscarriage in weeks 9-13 (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.95-3.2]). Risk of a first-trimester miscarriage with 15 hours or more of flying during home-base sleep hours was increased (1.5 [1.1-2.2]), as was risk with high physical job demands (2.5 [1.5-4.2]). Miscarriage risk was not increased among flight attendants compared with teachers. Conclusions: Miscarriage was associated with flight attendant work during sleep hours and high physical job demands and may be associated with cosmic radiation exposure.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Most people have a reduction in their nighttime blood pressure (BP) of >10%, these individuals are known as 'dippers'. In the pregnant population loss of the nocturnal dip has been associated with pre-eclampsia (PE). 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is routinely used in the non-pregnant population as a confirmative diagnostic tool. It provides valuable additional information over standard BP measurement including circadian variation in BP. Despite these advantages there is no current defined role for 24-hour ABPM in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to compare the 24-hour BP profiles of women at high risk of developing PE. METHODS: Nineteen women <20 weeks gestation attending the Manchester Antenatal Vascular Services (MAViS) research clinic who required antihypertensive medication, or had a standard BP close to target or treatment threshold underwent 24-hour ABPM. ABPM was recorded half hourly during the day and hourly at night with a SpaceLabs 92017a-1. Wake, sleep and drug ingestion times were self-reported. RESULTS: Of the 19 women examined 15 had essential hypertension, 9 had uncomplicated pregnancy outcomes, 9 developed PE and 1 pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR). Women who developed PE had a significantly higher median daytime systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to women who did not: 140 (IQR: 132-151) vs 130 mmHg (125-137) p=0.028. Non-significant higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 90 (85-97) vs 87 mmHg (79-91) p=0.278 and mean arterial pressure (MAP): 107 (99-112) vs 100 mmHg (90-105) p=0.95 was also observed. Nocturnal BP was significantly higher for women who developed PE: SBP 132 (119-141) vs 117 mmHg (109-120) (p=0.008), DBP 81 (72-89) vs 74 mmHg (65-75) (p=0.08) and MAP 96 (90-105) vs 87 mmHg (79-89) (p=0.008) respectively. Nocturnal dipper status was also significantly different between pregnancies complicated with PE and those that were not: MAP 3/9 vs 9/10 (p=0.02) and DBP 5/9 vs 10/10 respectively (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the diurnal BP variation were observed in women who developed PE compared to those who did not. The absence of a nocturnal dip and higher nocturnal MAP levels <20weeks gestation might be a useful adjuvant test to identify women at increased risk of PE.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine the utility of screening maternal echocardiograms (ECHOs) in pregnancies among women with a BMI of greater than or equal to 40. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all pregnancies of women with a BMI ≥ 40 who delivered at a tertiary care center from October 2005 to February 2014. During this time, screening ECHOs were ordered as a part of a clinical protocol for all women in this weight class. Women who completed this screening were identified and their findings were characterized. RESULTS: 267 women underwent screening ECHOs. ECHOs were classified into the following categories: no abnormalities (44.2%), findings associated with pregnancy (39.3%), findings associated with hypertension (13.5%),findings associated with obstructive sleep apnea (2.2%), cardiac dysfunction (1.5%), and incidental findings of unknown clinical significance (11.6%) or some combination of these findings. ECHO abnormalities were present among patients with known cardiac disease (69%) hypertension (74.2%), pre-gestational diabetes (72.7%), gestational diabetes (56.3%), and sleep apnea (65%). Nearly half of patients (49.7%) without comorbidities had abnormal ECHO findings. Only 4 women had findings of clinically significant left ventricular dysfunction; of these, 2 had a known history of peripartum cardiomyopathy after a prior pregnancy, 1 had a history of chronic hypertension, and 1 had no additional known cardiac risk factors. Considering that 10 women had cardiac histories that would have indicated an ECHO in pregnancy, among pregnant women with a BMI ≥ 40, the number needed to screen to identify clinically significant left ventricular dysfunction is 520. CONCLUSIONS: While screening ECHOs may identify mild diseasespecific abnormalities in obese women, unexpected clinically significant findings are rare.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Assessment of FHRV by CTG is an important, noninvasive tool to assess the fetal condition (Parer et al. Obstet Gynecol 114: 136, 2009), but has relatively poor intra- and inter-subject comparability (Figueras et al. J Perinat Med 33: 241, 2005). Power spectral analysis of FHRV may help estimate appropriate autonomic development, however there are few longditudinal prenatal studies. A study in healthy fetal sheep reported modest differences in the frequency distribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic power with advancing gestational age (Koome et al. Exp Physiol. 99:80, 2014), but alterations in FHRV power spectra in complicated pregnancy are unknown. We have designed isolators able to maintain pregnant sheep under controlled significantly hypoxic conditions for prolonged periods, and a bespoke wireless data acquisition system to record continuous fetal cardiovascular data during hypoxic pregnancy. We used this system to establish the longditudinal effect of chronic fetal hypoxia on FHRV power spectra in late gestation sheep for the first time. METHODS: 10 ovine pregnancies were instrumented with fetal vascular catheters at 117±1d GA (term∼145d); 5 days postoperatively fetuses underwent a 10 day exposure to normoxia (n=5) or hypoxia (n=5, ↓ fPaO2 21±1 to 12±1mmHg). Fetal heart rate (FHR) was sampled in 6x5 min blocks at a consistent time of day. FHR power spectra in active sleep were compared before and after exposure to normoxia or chronic hypoxia. RESULTS: Advancing gestation in normoxic pregnancy decreased FHR and increased the SDANN, an index of total FHRV (Fig.1). Advancing gestation in hypoxic pregnancy led to a greater fall in FHR, a fall in the LF/HF ratio (index of sympathetic dominance), an increase in the RMSSD (an established parasympathetic index) and a loss of total HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic significant fetal hypoxia is associated with a loss of total power and increased parasympathetic dominance in the FHRV power spectra. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: To investigate the relation between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnea symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of diagnostic criteria of restless legs syndrome, demographic characteristics, personal behavior, muscle cramps during pregnancy, past medical illnesses, family history of RLS, and the major symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was administered during a face-to-face interview. Pregnant women with and without RLS were compared in terms of serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, calcium, phosphor, iron, folate, vitamin B12 levels, and obstructive sleep apnea symptoms. Results: There were statistically significant differences between two groups in terms of two of the obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (witnessed apnea and fatigue) (p < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found with regard to serum calcium, magnesium, iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamin B12, phosphor, and folate levels; however, there were significant differences in terms of total iron-binding capacity. Conclusions: Increasing awareness of restless legs syndrome among obstetricians is essential as it might be related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine inflammation is a known risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in preterm neonates. Corollary to that, we have demonstrated that exposure to in utero inflammation resulted in significantly altered EEG-based circadian cycles in a murine model. In the current study, we sought to investigate mechanisms involved in disturbance of the circadian rhythms. METHODS: We utilized a mouse model of intrauterine inflammation to recapitulate elements of human disease with exposure to infectious pathogens in utero and long-term neurologic outcomes, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pregnant CD1 mice were randomly allocated to either normal saline (NS) or LPS (50 mcg/mouse) intrauterine infusion at E17. Somatosensory cortex was derived from offspring male mice on postnatal days (PND) 30 and 90 at time-specific points in the day. We performed QPCR for message expression of circadian rhythm genes: CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput), MTNR1A/1B (melatonin receptor 1A and B), GRIN1 (glutamate receptor subunit zeta-1, CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone), GABRA1 (gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1), DBP (D site of albumin promoter binding protein), PRNP (major prion protein) and PER2 (period circadian protein homolog 2). The protein products of these genes were utilized in ELISA for confirmation of changes in mRNA. In addition, melatonin levels in somatosensory cortex were investigated with ELISA. Student t-tests were run with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: On a protein level, ELISA revealed an increased level of melatonin in LPS-treated male mice between 2 and 4 pm, an abnormal finding not present in controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to intrauterine inflammation leads to a long-term disruption of circadian rhythms which might be regulated by a life-long abnormal production and timing of melatonin. Our data may explain mechanisms of behavioral phenotype in children born preterm. (Figure Presented).

N2  - During the perinatal period, compromises in sleep duration and quality are commonly reported by women and confirmed by objective measurements of sleep. Self-reported poor sleep has been associated with concurrent mood disturbance and with increased risk for future mood problems during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Findings on the relationship between objectively measured sleep and mood in perinatal women have been mixed. This article reviews the literature on the nature of and contributing factors to perinatal sleep disturbance, the relationship between sleep and mood, and intervention studies that aim to improve maternal sleep.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The link between maternal obesity and adverse pregnancy outcomes is well established; however the specific mechanisms that underlie obesity-induced pregnancy complications remain unclear. Circadian rhythms are integral to metabolic homeostasis and undergo substantial adaptations in both pregnancy and obesity. Disturbances to circadian rhythms may provide a mechanistic link between obesity and negative pregnancy outcomes. This study examined the impact of obesity on clock gene expression in maternal metabolic tissues. It was hypothesised that obesity disturbs clock gene expression and alters key maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were fed either a control diet of standard chow (CON) or chow supplemented with a cafeteria diet (CAF) for 8 weeks to induce obesity. Rats were then mated and maintained on the diets throughout gestation. Maternal liver and adipose tissue samples were collected at four-hourly time points (ZT1, ZT5, ZT9, ZT13, ZT17, ZT21) across days 15 and 21 of gestation. Expression of key clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per, Cry, Reverb-α and Ror-α) was analysed by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: CAF animals exhibited a 58% increase in body fat compared to CON as measured by DEXA analysis (P<0.001). All clock genes displayed rhythmic expression in liver and adipose tissue (each P<0.001). Dietary-induced obesity altered clock gene expression in a tissue, ZT and gestational day dependent manner (as assessed by ANOVA). CAF consumption suppressed peak expression for Reverb-α in liver (P<0.001) and RP (P<0.005), Per1 and Per2 in liver (each P<0.01) as well as a prolonged suppression for Bmal1 in RP (P<0.001) and Cry2 in liver (P<0.005). Cosinor analysis showed that the CAF animals displayed decreased mesor and amplitude in several genes including Bmal-1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and Reverb-α (all P<0.05). CAF consumption also caused a phase advance of approximately 1.5 hours in the hepatic expression of Bmal-1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Reverb-α (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary-induced obesity resulted in marked changes in clock gene expression rhythms in maternal metabolic tissues. These effects may lead to altered maternal metabolic function during pregnancy and could thus influence substrate supply to the fetus. This could act as a potential mechanism for altered fetal growth rates observed in obese pregnancy.

N2  - Lumbopelvic pain is common in pregnancy but the sensitization factors underlying the condition are largely unknown. This study characterized the somatosensory profile of pregnant and nonpregnant women and the relationship between pain, hypersensitivity, and commonly used manual clinical tests. Thirty-nine pregnant and 22 nonpregnant women were included. Although lumbopelvic pain was not an inclusion criterion, the pregnant women were divided into low- and high-pain groups following data collection. The sensitivity to light brush, pin-prick, and pressure pain was assessed bilaterally at 3 sites in the lumbopelvic region, at the shoulder, and in the lower leg. Responses to the active straight leg raise test and pain provocation tests of the sacroiliac joint were recorded. Participants completed questionnaires addressing emotional and physical well-being and rated disability using the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire. Compared with controls, the high-pain group rated the active straight leg raise test as more difficult (P <.05), and both pain groups had more positive pain provocation tests (P <.05). The pregnant groups demonstrated significantly lower pressure pain thresholds at most assessment sites compared with controls (P <.05), but self-reported disability and pain were not correlated with pressure pain thresholds within pregnant participants. The high-pain group reported worse emotional health and poorer sleep quality than controls (P <.05). Perspective This article presents the somatosensory profile of a healthy pregnant cohort. The results indicate that pain sensitivity increases during pregnancy possibly owing to the physical changes the body undergoes during pregnancy but also owing to changes in emotional health. This should be accounted for in clinical management of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a sleep hygiene coaching program at a community pharmacy, and determine whether participation in this coaching program can reduce non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonistic modulator (nBZD) use and improve sleep quality. Methods: The benefits of sleep hygiene coaching services have been demonstrated in primary care settings by nurses and counselors. However, a pharmacist-provided intervention has not been studied. Pharmacy staff at two sites of a grocery store chain pharmacy will identify patients ≥18 years old using nBZDs during the dispensing process. Patients will be excluded if they are pregnant. The initial appointment will consist of a pharmacist delivering an educational program to a group of patients covering general sleep and insomnia education, as well as nonpharmacological techniques for improving sleep quality. The pharmacist will follow up with patients individually up to four times via phone call or in the pharmacy every 2 to 4 weeks. During follow-up, pharmacists will continue to coach and motivate patients to make behavioral changes, and collect sleep quality data using patient recall, sleep diaries, and the validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Each intervention patient will be matched with two or more controls based on age, gender, dose, and type of nBZD. The validated Medication Possession Ratio will be used to estimate the amount of sedative medication patients use during the intervention period. A two-tailed t test will be used to determine if there is a significant change in nBZD use among intervention patients compared with controls. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze changes in sleep quality and number of hours slept (from PSQI or sleep diary), and number of awakenings (from sleep diaries or patient recall) in the intervention group.

N2  - The aims of this longitudinal study were to examine (a) development of infant sleep and maternal sleep from 3 to 6 months postpartum; (b) concomitant and prospective links between maternal sleep and infant sleep; and (c) triadic links between paternal involvement in infant caregiving and maternal and infant sleep. The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months. Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Implantation is dependent on synchronized interactions between the conceptus and surrounding decidual cells but the involvement of circadian clock genes in this process is not well understood. Circadian oscillations are predicated on transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which balances the activities of transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1 and repressors PER and CRY. In this study, we investigated the role of core clock proteins in the decidual transformation of human endometrium. METHODS: Human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) isolated from mid-luteal timed biopsies from 57 patients were used to examine PER2 expression during decidual transformation. Additionally, 70 further biopsies were taken from a cohort of miscarriage patients for correlative studies. Core clock gene expression and overall circadian oscillations were measured by q-RT-PCR and western blotting. Regulation of the PER2 gene at the promoter level was assessed via ChIP-RT-PCR. Triplicate timed samples transfected with PER2 siRNA were subjected to RNA-Seq. RESULTS: Down-regulation of PER2 was preceded by reduced CLOCK binding to a noncanonical E-box enhancer in the PER2 promoter and occurred between 12 - 24 h after exposure of HESCs to a deciduogenic stimulus. RNA-sequencing revealed that premature inhibition of PER2 by siRNA knockdown leads to a grossly disorganised decidual response. Gene ontology analysis highlighted a preponderance of cell cycle and proliferation regulators amongst 1,121 genes perturbed upon PER2 knockdown. Congruently, PER2 inhibition abrogated mitotic expansion and proliferation of differentiating HESCs by inducing cell cycle block at G2/M. In vivo, endometrial PER2 transcript levels rise rapidly after ovulation, are maintained during the mid-luteal phase of the cycle, and then fall in concert with decidual transformation of the endometrium. Analysis of 70 timed mid-luteal biopsies showed a negative correlation between PER2 expression and the number of previous pregnancy losses in recurrent miscarriage patients. CONCLUSIONS: PER2 synchronizes initiation of the decidual programme with mitotic expansion of endometrial stromal compartment; uncoupling of these events predisposes for persistent pregnancy failure. These findings may be particularly relevant to night/shift workers with disrupted circadian rhythms, who show an increased risk of reproductive complications.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Perception and cerebral processing of environmental stimuli are major features of postnatal life. It is unclear to what extent the fetus perceives environmental stimuli. Major intrauterine environmental stimuli are noises and vibrations. Cortical processing of acoustic stimuli requires signal transmission via central parts of the auditory system while stimuli that arouse the fetus are transmitted via the unspecific ascending reticular activating system. We examined from which gestational age noises are processed by the fetal auditory cortex as a requirement for conscious perception and from which age vibroacoustic stimuli (VAS) arouse the fetus. METHODS: 15 sheep fetuses were chronically instrumented with catheters and EEG electrodes. Processing of acoustic stimuli in the auditory cortex was determined in 6 fetuses. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (cAEP) were induced at 105±1, 112±1, 119±1 and 126±1 days gestation (dG, term 150 dG) using a tone of 500Hz, 100dB SPL and 50ms duration with inter-stimuli intervals of 0.8-1.2sec applied at the maternal abdominal wall for 5min. To induce a fetal arousal, VAS were applied to 9 sheep at 120±2, 127±2 and 130±1dG using an electronic artificial larynx (12 stimuli for 30sec with a peak frequency of 250-750Hz producing an intrauterine sound pressure of 125-35dB). The cochlea was ablated in 3 fetuses to discriminate the role of the peripheral auditory and proprioceptive system in perception of VAS. Fetal arousal was detected by spectral analysis of the EEG. RESULTS: cAEP were already detectable in 5/6 fetuses at 110dG. Latency of cAEP peaks decreased continuously until 125dG and amplitudes started to increase at 125dG reflecting cortical maturation (p<0.05). During NREM sleep, cortical arousal in response to VAS was firstly detectable at 127dG revealed by fast activation of the EEG within 32ms. At 131dG, arousal prolonged or induced a sleep state change. At this age, unspecific changes of cortical activity without a fast arousal response developed during REM sleep. Bilateral cochlea ablation prevented fetal arousal. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical processing of acoustic stimuli begins in the early third trimester and precedes arousability of the fetus which starts in the middle of the third trimester. The fetus is especially sensitive to acoustic but not vibratory stimuli.

N2  - Preterm infants (PIs) have to undergo rapid neurodevelopment to qualify for discharge from hospitalization. Immediately after birth, the PI is hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This environment is strikingly different from womb ecology: light, sound and visual stimulation are abundant, and the PIs experience a great deal of stressful events mainly in the form of medical interventions. The consequences of such constant stress are associated with decreased neurodevelopment as well as down-regulation of homeostatic mechanisms via sympathetic nervous system activation. As early as the 28th week of gestation, the olfactory system of the fetus is mature enough to allow chemoreception. Exposure to different odors from this age and on alters PI behavior, reducing stress, pain and apnea. Several odors, including body odors (BO), are known as effectors of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Shortly after birth, a newborn is able of recognizing its mother's BO, but the natural exposure of PI to its mother's BO is reduced significantly while in NICU. We hypothesize that long-term exposure of a PI to its mother's BO can reduce stress levels through PNS activation and thus improve physiological status, eventually resulting in a shorter period of hospitalization (POH). To test this hypothesis, we are currently exposing PIs to maternal odors. We asked mothers of PIs to wear a breast pad in direct contact with the body for a 24-hour period, while keeping their regular diet routine. Pads were then placed inside the incubator of the matched PI for a 24-hour period. This process is repeated for 5 consecutive days per week, until the PI is discharged from NICU. We make use of the routine hospital medical checks for respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and blood-oxygen saturation. In addition, we collect metrics such as amount and type of medical interventions, POH and weight gain rate. Sleep quality measurements are evaluated by actigraphy. In order to estimate effects on PNS we measure salivary cortisol levels. Samples of breast pads are analyzed by GCMS in order to identify volatile components that may be the mediators affecting the PIs. The results of this ongoing effort will be presented.

N2  - Background: Amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity is abnormal in adults with schizophrenia, as well as in adolescents at clinical risk for psychosis. Given evidence that altered brain circuitry associated with schizophrenia may arise very early in brain development, we sought to determine if abnormalities of amygdala functional connectivity were present in neonates at genetic high risk for schizophrenia. Methods: Mothers with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar illness (BP), and no major psychiatric illness were recruited during pregnancy. After birth, offspring underwent resting state functional MRI on a 3T scanner during natural sleep. The bilateral amygdala were defined using a probabilistic subcortical atlas and seed-based whole brain functional connectivity analyses were carried out. Quality scans were obtained on 15 neonates of mothers with schizophrenia, 20 with BP, 20 with Mood DO NOS, and 20 control mothers. Results: In neonates, connections exist between the amygdala and medial temporal cortex, pre-/post-central gyrus, medial visual cortex, anterior/middle cingulate cortex, lateral temporal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and insula. Compared to controls, all three at-risk groups demonstrate common hyper-connectivity with bilateral thalamus and hypo-connectivity with bilateral medial visual cortices for the right amygdala, without significant between-risk-group differences. The left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) shows common hyper-connectivity with the left amygdala for SCZ and BD but not for MD-NOS; left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) demonstrates hyper-connectivity with the left amygdala for both SCZ and MD-NOS but it is most severe in SCZ. Conclusion: We found that abnormalities of amygdala functional connectivity are already present in neonates at genetic risk for schizophrenia, as well as in neonates at risk for bipolar illness and mood disorder NOS. Both common and disorder-specific abnormality profiles were detected which could discriminate between at-risk and control neonates. These findings indicate that functional connectivity abnormalities associated with genetic risk likely arise during prenatal and early neonatal brain development. This study also suggests that it may be possible to develop imaging-based early identification of risk for later psychiatric illness at the earliest stages of postnatal life.

N2  - Asia's slow (Nycticebus) and slender (Loris) lorises make up one of the most fascinating primate radiations, yet until the 1990s, virtually nothing was known about their behaviour in the wild. I review data from my 20 years of fieldwork, including long-term studies in India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia. I show that lorises have relatively large home ranges averaging 12 ha (range= 2-32). Despite similarity in home ranges, no patterns occur in number of sleeping sites used by lorises (x=7, range 3-47), yet all species sleep in groups of a male and female and 1-3 offspring; this uni-male uni-female social grouping is complemented by promiscuous mating systems. In the wild and captivity, lorises are not seasonal breeders, and can give birth to one litter per year, with average gestation lengths of 165-170 days (Loris) and 192-203 days (Nycticebus), making their breeding patterns incredibly slow for such smallbodied primates. Lorises exhibit extreme dietary specialisations, with slender lorises being on average 97% insectivorous (5 studies), and Nycticebus being on average 66% exudativorous (8 studies). Lorises also show high tolerance to foods containing secondary compounds - insects (Loris) and exudates (Nycticebus). Loris is one of few primates to exhibit anting behaviour, whereas Nycticebus is the only primate known to be venomous. Despite these fascinating adaptations all species of slow and slender loris are threatened on the IUCN Red List and urgent action is required to understand this lineage more fully.

N2  - Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is of unknown etiology and is the most common cause of retinopathy after age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. Vision loss results from fluid leakage and serous detachment in the macula. Five percent of patients develop chronic CSCR. It is predominantly found in middle-aged men (age-adjusted rates per 100,000: 9.9 for men and 1.7 for women) and is usually unilateral and reversible. Three-quarters of CSCR patients resolve within 3 months but 45% have recurrences, usually with only minor visual acuity changes. Risk factors include type A personality, emotional stress, elevated catecholamines, hypertension, pregnancy, organ transplantation, increased levels of endogenous cortisol, psychopharmacologic medication, use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, obstructive sleep apnea, Helicobacter pylori infection, or treatment with corticosteroids. Five percent of patients develop chronic disease as a result of subretinal fibrin formation within the blister. CSCR is often bilateral, multifocal, and recurrent, and may be associated with subretinal fibrin formation within the blister. Permanent loss of vision may result from subretinal fibrin-fibrosis with scarring of the macula. Corticosteroid-associated CSCR occurs bilaterally in 20% of patients. Steroid-associated therapy may begin days to years after therapy with any form of drug delivery. We present three atopic patients who presented at various times after oral, inhaled, intranasal, and topical corticosteroid therapy. One patient developed CSCR after three separate types of administration of corticosteroids, which, to our knowledge, has not been observed in the literature.

N2  - Immunonutrition is an emergent and interdisciplinary subject, since it comprises several aspects related to Nutrition, Immunity, Infection, Inflammation, and Injury or tissue damage, what is known as Nutrition and 4 “Is”. Within these interactions the endocrine, nervous and immune systems are involved, microbiota being a part of the last one. Nowadays, gut microbiota has been shown to play an essential role, not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also into the nervous system, because of its bilateral connection. There are several methods to study Immunonutrition, which allow measuring different immunological biomarkers to provide information about the nutritional status. However, it should be taken into account that there is not a single gold standard parameter to evaluate the cause- effect relationship between nutrition and the immune system. On the contrary, a combination of biomarkers have to be assessed depending on the different nutritional situations. Since Immunonutrition is a multidisciplinary matter as mentioned above, the study on the interactions between nutrition and the immune system has not been exclusively focused as such, but bearing in mind other systems of the organisms as well as a wide range of confounding factors and determinants coming from idiosyncratic features, genes and lifestyle of each individual. Therefore, Immunonutrition allows to study the following research fields: 1) Evaluation of nutritional status in presumably healthy people with risk of malnutrition (children, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, elderly, and sportspeople); 2) Assessment of the evolution and progress of patients with nutrition and immune-related diseases, such as food allergies, eating and metabolic disorders; 3) Evaluation of the effects of nutrients, bioactive compounds and both conventional and functional foods on the immune system; 4) Evaluation of impact of lifestyle determinants on the immune system, such as diet, food behaviour, physical activity, sedentariness, sleep quality and quantity, and as a key factor, stress.

N2  - Background: Physical activity (PA) interventions designed to prevent prenatal complications have focused on increasing moderate PA yielding conflicting results. Minimal attention has focused on the evaluation of sleep, sedentary behavior (SB), light activity or total daily PA during pregnancy. The purpose of this prospective, longitudinal study was to 1) objectively quantify and compare habitual PA and SB during the 2nd and 3rd trimester; and 2) evaluate differences in activity patterns for women meeting prenatal PA guidelines versus those that did not. Methods: Forty-six participants wore 2 PA monitors (SenseWear® Mini and activPAL™) during week 18 and week 35 of pregnancy. We compared differences in sleep duration, postural allocation, daily steps, and PA between the 2nd and 3rd trimester and for women who met and did not meet PA guidelines. Results: During the 2nd trimester, 30% of the women's day (24-hours) was total sleep; 52% SB; 13% light; 3% moderate; and 0% vigorous PA. Light (P = 0.05), vigorous (P = 0.02), and moderate-vigorous PA (MET-minutes; P = 0.02), decreased with a trend in increased SB (P = 0.07). Activity of other intensities and sleep duration did not significantly change. Only 39% and 37% of participants slept between 7-9 hours/night at week 18 and 35, respectively. Forty-six percent (n = 21) and 28% (n = 13) of participants met prenatal PA guidelines during the 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. At week 18, no differences in total sleep, SB, or light PA existed for women who met PA guidelines versus those who did not; total PA was significantly greater for women who met guidelines. At week 35, women that met PA guidelines had significantly less SB (P < 0.005) than women who did not. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that pregnant women spend the majority of their day in SB. Significant reductions in total activity across pregnancy may be attributed, in part to shifts in light PA and increased SB. Based on the lifestyle of our sample, regardless of meeting PA guidelines in mid-pregnancy, no significant difference exists in time spent in SB, however meeting PA recommendations in late pregnancy may reduce SB. Future interventions should target reducing SB by increasing light and moderate PA beyond volitional exercise.

N2  - There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2 <17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n = 9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n = 9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n = 9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1 ± 0.6 vs. 26.0 ± 1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033 ± 412 vs. 5,261 ± 238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect.

N2  - Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rodent pups are analogous to cries in human babies. There is reduction in USVs in pups after experimental deprivation of rapid eye movement sleep of dams during pregnancy. However, the effects of total sleep deprivation on the USVs of newborns and their emotional development are not documented. Male pups born to the rats that underwent total sleep deprivation for 5. h during the third trimester made higher vocalizations, when tested on early postnatal days (pnds) in an isolation-paradigm. Their anxiety-related behaviors during pnds 25-28, were tested using elevated plus maze (EPM). In comparison to the control pups, weanlings of sleep-deprived dams made increased entries into the open arms and higher mobility in the EPM. Enhanced distress calls during early pnds and reduction in risk assessment in weanlings indicate a link between the two behaviors. The USVs during ontogeny may provide early signals about altered emotional development.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with adverse fetal outcomes in some studies. Second trimester Down syndrome screening markers reflect fetal and fetoplacental wellbeing. We aimed to compare markers of fetal and feto-placental wellbeing in women with OSA and low risk controls. Methods: A retrospective case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and available second trimester markers was performed. Controls were screened for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) at the time of delivery using a questionnaire. Women at low risk for OSA were selected. Marker levels were adjusted for gestational age and race and reported as multiples of median and later adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Results: Twenty-four OSA cases and 166 controls were identified. Women with OSA had a higher mean BMI when compared to controls (37.1±12.7 versus 24.1±5.1, p=0.03). Estriol (uE3) multiples of the median (MoM) levels were lower in women with OSA compared to controls, even after adjusting for BMI, 0.74 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.45) versus 1.06 (IQR 0.38), respectively, p=0.026. Once adjusted for BMI, alpha feto-protein (AFP) MoM levels were no longer significantly different in women with OSA compared to controls. Conclusion: OSA is associated with reduced serum uE3 levels, independently of BMI, possibly indicating fetal distress.

N2  - Splenic infarctions secondary to vaso-occlusion are common in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA); however massive splenic infarction (MSI) that involves more than 50% of the spleen size is a very rare complication observed in sickle cell disease (SCD), sickle cell trait, and Saudi sickle cell anemia patients. MSI in hemoglobinophaties is associated with stress factors including: unpressurized air travels, high altitude, sleep apnea, sepsis, vaso-occlcusive crisis, post-operative and strenuous exercise; where hypoxia induced sickling and vaso-occlusion seem to be the main mechanism in the pathogenesis. The treatment is conservative unless the presences of complications (persistent abdominal pain, abscess formation or hemorrhage) that may require surgical treatment. We report the case of a 23-year-old woman with sickle cell β thalassemia who presented with severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain 20 days after cesarean section delivery. The patient was regularly treated with prophylactic antibiotics, folic acid, Hydroxycarbamide (from age 15 ys. stopped before pregnancy and during lactation), blood transfusion every 4 weeks during pregnancy, and LMWH during pregnancy and 8 weeks post-partum. At admission abdominal tenderness and a 20 cm palpable spleen were found. The diagnosis of MSI was confirmed by computed tomographic scan. The patient was treated conservatively with analgesics, fluids and antibiotics; splenectomy was considered but after significant improvement during follow up wasn't preformed. Conclusions: Massive splenic infarction is a rare complication in Sickle Cell β Thalassemia. Awareness of this condition in SCD women during puerperium is necessary for early diagnosis, adequate treatment and prevention of further complications.

N2  - Heart disease remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in women in the United States and worldwide. This review highlights known and emerging risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in women. Traditional Framingham risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, as well as lifestyle habits such as unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle are all modifiable. Health care providers should be aware of emerging cardiac risk factors in women such as adverse pregnancy outcomes, systemic autoimmune disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and radiation-induced heart disease; psychosocial factors such as mental stress, depression, anxiety, low socioeconomic status, and work and marital stress play an important role in IHD in women. Appropriate recognition and management of an array of risk factors is imperative given the growing burden of IHD and need to deliver cost-effective, quality care for women.

N2  - Background and objective: Insomnia and sleep disorders are common health problem of the modernized society. Studies show the percentage of women suffering from sleep disorder is higher than men. In particular, women may suffer from insomnia secondary to menopause, pregnancy, or the use of oral contraception. The effectiveness of female hormone replacement therapy as an insomnia treatment in menopausal women and women with hysrectomy/ oothectomy is still debatable. In addition, there is currently no specific study in Taiwan investigating the prevalence of insomnia in menopausal women and the drug utilization pattern of hypnotics in this population group. Setting and method: This study uses data collected from the National Health Insurance Research Database to examine the drug utilization of hypnotics in the menopausal women in Taiwan, to estimate the occurrences of insomnia in the menopausal women, and women with hysterectomy/oophorectomy and the drug utilization pattern of sedatives in this population and to analyse the relationship between the occurrences of insomnia and the use of female hormone replacement therapy. Results: Data were collected from a total of 70,565 women which were further divided into the control group (n = 18,632), the naturally occurring menopause group (n = 46,048) and the surgical menopause group (n = 5,885). The percentage of confirmed insomnia diagnosis in the control group, the naturally occurring menopause group and the surgical menopause group are 21.2, 37.9 and 30.3 % respectively. The percentage of confirmed insomnia diagnosis and treated with sedatives are 14.9 % in the control group, 77.6 % in the naturally occurring menopause and 7.5 % in the surgical menopause group. The most frequently prescribed sedatives in the group confirmed insomnia diagnosis are Zolpidem, Lorazepam and Alprazolam in descending order. Conclusions: The results revealed whether natural menopause or surgical menopause, may more prone to insomnia problems, and more will be used to insomnia drugs. Clinical recommendations for postmenopausal insomnia can be more aggressive. Zolpidem is the most widely used sedatives currently. Although this drug has less likely to cause withdrawal or rebound symptoms and less addictive, but should also pay attention to the clinical use of central nervous system side effects.

N2  - Background Previous research has established a number of risk factors that are associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms. Methods This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum. Results We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. Limitations Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments.

N2  - Study Objectives: To assess whether daytime naps negatively impact nocturnal sleep. Design: Longitudinal, prospective cohort design. Participants: 161 pregnant women recruited and evaluated in early gestation (10-20 weeks). Measurements and Results: Daily sleep information was collected in three 2-week periods (10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation) with a daily sleep diary and an actigraph. The average number of naps, as well as the average length of each nap, were calculated from sleep diaries. Women were categorized first as non nappers (0 naps/2-week period), moderate nappers (1-3 naps/2-week period), or frequent nappers (≥ 4 naps/2-week period). Then, based on the average nap length, they were categorized as short (< 90 min) or long (≥ 90 min) nappers. Nocturnal sleep parameters included SOL, WASO, SE, and TST. SAS procedure MIXED was used for modeling the main effects of nap group and time, and time by nap group interactions. Women who took naps had a decrease in diary-assessed nocturnal TST, but not actigraphy-assessed TST. This observation was group- and time-specific. There were no other group differences. Women who napped ≥ 90 min had poorer diary-assessed SE and lower diary-assessed TST than those who took shorter naps. Length of nap was not associated with any other sleep measures. Conclusions: The number of daytime naps have minimal impact on nocturnal sleep parameters; however, long nappers did exhibit modestly impaired sleep continuity and sleep quality. Overall, we propose that daytime naps provide a beneficial countermeasure to the sleep disruption commonly reported by pregnant women. This may be clinically beneficial given that sleep continuity and quality are important correlates of pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:: To identify potentially modifiable risk factors for late-pregnancy stillbirth. METHODS:: This was a population-based matched case-control study of pregnant women at 32 weeks of gestation or greater booked into tertiary maternity hospitals in metropolitan Sydney between January 2006 and December 2011. The case group consisted of women with singleton pregnancies with antepartum fetal death in utero. Women in the control group were matched for booking hospital and expected delivery date with women in the case group. Data collection was performed using a semistructured interview and included validated questionnaires for specific risk factors. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for a priori-specified risk factors using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS:: There were 103 women in the case group and 192 women in the control group. Mean gestation was 36 weeks. Supine sleeping was reported by 10 of 103 (9.7%) of women who experienced late-pregnancy stillbirth and by 4 of 192 (2.1%) of women in the control group (adjusted OR 6.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-34). Women who experienced stillbirth were more likely to: have been followed during pregnancy for suspected fetal growth restriction, 11.7% compared with 1.6% (adjusted OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.36-22.5); not be in paid work, 25.2% compared with 9.4% (adjusted OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.6); and to have not received further education beyond high school, 41.7% compared with 25.5% (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5). None of the deaths to women who reported supine sleeping were classified as unexplained. CONCLUSION:: This study suggests that supine sleep position may be an additional risk for late-pregnancy stillbirth in an already compromised fetus. The clinical management of suspected fetal growth restriction should be investigated further as a means of reducing late stillbirth.

N2  - Study Objectives: Evaluation of Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires in detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) across trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women from a high-risk pregnancy clinic were recruited to complete sleep evaluations including Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires. Overnight testing with Watch-PAT200 for diagnosis of OSA (cutoff point of apneahypopnea index ≥ 5 events/h) was performed. Results: Seventy-two singleton pregnant women participated in the study. Enrollment consisted of 23, 24, and 25 women during first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Of 72 pregnancies, 23 patients (31.9%) had OSA. Prevalence of OSA classified by trimesters from first to third was 30.4%, 33.33%, and 32.0%, respectively. Overall predictive values of Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires were fair (ROC area under curve, AUC 0.72 for Berlin, p = 0.003; 0.75 for Stop- Bang, p = 0.001). When categorized according to trimesters, predictive values substantially improved in second (AUC: 0.84 for Berlin; 0.78 for Stop-Bang) and third trimesters (AUC: 0.81 for Berlin; 0.75 for Stop-Bang), whereas performances of both questionnaires during first trimester were poorer (AUC: 0.49 for Berlin; 0.71 for Stop-Bang). Multivariate analyses show that pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) in first trimester, snore often in second trimester, and weight gain and pregnancy BMI in third trimester were significantly associated with OSA. Conclusions: In high-risk pregnancy, Berlin and Stop- Bang questionnaires were of limited usefulness in the first trimester. However their predictive values are acceptable as pregnancy progresses, particularly in second trimester. OSA in pregnancy seems to be a dynamic process with different predictors association during each trimester.

N2  - Study Objectives: Although a substantial number of pregnant women report symptoms of insomnia, few studies have used a validated instrument to determine the prevalence in early gestation. Identification of insomnia in pregnancy is vital given the strong connection between insomnia and the incidence of depression, cardiovascular disease, or immune dysregulation. The goal of this paper is to provide additional psychometric evaluation and validation of the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ) and to establish prevalence rates of insomnia among a cohort of pregnant women during early gestation. Methods: The ISQ was evaluated in 143 pregnant women at 12 weeks gestation. The internal consistency and criterion validity of the dichotomized ISQ were compared to traditional measures of sleep from sleep diaries, actigraphy, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using indices of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR) tests. Results: The ISQ identified 12.6% of the sample as meeting a case definition of insomnia, consistent with established diagnostic criteria. Good reliability was established with Cronbach α = 0.86. The ISQ had high specificity (most > 85%), but sensitivity, PPV, NPV, and LRs varied according to which sleep measure was used as the validating criterion. Conclusions: Insomnia is a health problem for many pregnant women at all stages in pregnancy. These data support the validity and reliability of the ISQ to identify insomnia in pregnant women. The ISQ is a short and cost-effective tool that can be quickly employed in large observational studies or in clinical practice where perinatal women are seen.

N2  - Background Migraine is associated with sleep disturbances in men and non-pregnant women. However, relatively little is known about sleep disturbances among pregnant migraineurs. We investigated sleep disturbances among pregnant women with and without history of migraine. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy. Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Migraineurs were more likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (<6.5 hours) (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.02), poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.12-2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20-2.42). Associations were generally similar for migraine with or without aura. The odds of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight migraineurs. Conclusion Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common comorbid conditions among pregnant women.

N2  - Background: About 79% of the pregnant women experience sleep disorders and 70% of pregnant women experience some symptoms of the depression. Physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes of pregnancy can predispose mothers to depression these disorders before, during, and after childbirth and might be aggravated by neglecting health behavior. Health behavior education might be useful for the management of depression in pregnant women. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sleep health behavioral education on the improvement of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders. Patients and Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial, performed on 96 pregnant women with sleep disorder diagnosed according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Tools for data collection included demographic questionnaire and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Easy and accessible sampling was done. Participants were randomly (simple) allocated to intervention and control groups. In intervention group, sleep health behavior education was presented during a four-hour session held in weeks 22, 23, 24, and 25; then the patients were followed up to fill out the BDIQ in follow-up session at weeks 29 and 33 of pregnancy. The control group received no intervention and only received routine prenatal care. The results were assessed by Chi-square tests, independent-samples t-test, and Fischer’s exact-test by SPSS 16. Results: A statistically significant change was reported in the severity of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders in the intervention group in comparison to the control group at weeks 29 (P < 0.000) and 33 (P < 0.00). Conclusions: Sleep health behavioral education improves depression in pregnant women who are experiencing insomnia. Findings from this study add support to the reported effectiveness of sleep health behavioral education in the prenatal care and clinical management of insomnia in pregnancy.

N2  - Study Objectives: We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among pregnant Peruvian women. Methods: A cohort of 642 women were interviewed at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation. During interview, we ascertained information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ- 9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment scales, respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and confi rmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used. Results: Both exploratory and confi rmatory factor analyses indicated a three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep effi ciency, and sleep medication. We observed signifi cantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42), the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had signifi cantly increased odds of experiencing stress-induced sleep disturbance (odds ratio, OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.40, 5.31), depression (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 3.58, 8.37), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.57; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.76). Conclusions: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three, factor-specifi c scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.

N2  - Objective: To investigate factors affecting general sleep pattern and sleep quality in pregnant women. Materialds and Methods: We assessed all pregnant women applied to Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Training and Research Hospital, School of Medicine, Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam University between 01 January 2014 and 01 March 2014. The participants were informed prior to the study and 100 pregnant women who gave their informed consent were included in the study. Questionnaires consisting sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy history and the Epworth sleepiness scale were applied to the patients. Factors affecting general sleep pattern and sleep quality in pregnant women were compared. Results: The mean age of 100 pregnant women was 27.9 years (min=16, max=42). The mean gestational age of participants was found to be 24.8 weeks (min=5, max=40). In obstetric history, 9% of women previously had a stillbirth and also 25% of women previously had curettage performed. There were tobacco use in 6% of participants and 6% of patients previously had been to the hospital due to a sleep disorder. The mean excessive daytime sleepiness scale score of pregnant women were found to be 4.56. There were no significant difference among the patients regarding regular exercise (p=0.137), tobacco use (p=0.784), accompanying disease (p=0.437) and excessive daytime sleepiness scale score. Conclusion: In our study, patients who had a complaint of sleep disorder before and who were previously admitted to a health center for this problem, were also found to suffer from the same problem during pregnancy. Treatment of sleep disorders in preconception period for women planning pregnancy is important in terms of mother and the baby’s health. Pregnant women should be informed about factors reducing sleep quality during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: The quality and duration of sleep is impaired during pregnancy. Our study aimed to determine whether maternal sleep deprivation occurring during the second and third trimester of pregnancy could alter fetal well-being with respect to birth weight and APGAR score by altering the inflammatory status and oxidative stress in the mothers. Method: Sleep adequacy was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We investigated the inflammatory status and oxidative stress at term in the blood of pregnant subjects with and without sleep deprivation by measuring the levels of proteinbound sialic acid (PBSA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO). Homocysteine (Hcy) and its vitamin determinants were also measured. Fetal outcome with respect to birth weight and APGAR score were compared between study subjects. Results: A significant increase was observed in the levels of hsCRP, PBSA, Hcy, MDA, and PCO, in the sleep-deprived group when compared to the control group. Fetal outcome at birth showed a significant difference between the cases with high sleep deprivation and those with low sleep deprivation. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation in pregnancy leads to an increase in the inflammatory parameters, oxidative stress, and Hcy levels. Fetal outcome at birth was affected more in mothers with high sleep deprivation than those with low sleep deprivation. Follow-up in these babies are needed to reveal any differences in their growth and development.

N2  - Objectives: To explore associations between features of sleep during pregnancy and adverse outcomes for the infant. Setting: E Moe, Ma¯ma¯ is a cohort study in Aotearoa/New Zealand that investigates self-reported sleep and maternal health in late pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants: Women (N=633; 194 Ma¯ori) reported detailed information on their sleep duration, quality, disturbances, disorders (snoring, breathing pauses, twitching legs, restless legs) and daytime sleepiness between 35 and 37 weeks gestation. Outcome measures: Birthweight and fetal distress during labour were extracted from medical records. Associations between each sleep variable and small or large for gestational age (SGA/LGA) using customised birthweight centile or fetal distress were estimated using multinomial/logistic regression, controlling for potential confounders. Secondary analyses considered differences in associations between Maori and non-Maori women. Results: There was some indication that breathing pauses (a measure of sleep apnoea) were associated with both SGA (OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 9.0, p=0.08) and LGA (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 5.7, p=0.20), with the association for LGA being stronger when only pregnancy-onset breathing pauses were considered (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 9.6, p=0.01). There was also some evidence that pregnancy-onset leg twitching (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 10.0, p=0.03) and frequent sleep disturbance due to feeling too hot or too cold (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.6, p=0.13) were associated with higher risk of fetal distress. Other sleep measures, including snoring, were not associated with SGA, LGA or fetal distress. Many of the associations we observed were considerably stronger in Ma¯ori compared with non-Maori women. Conclusions: We did not find evidence of previously reported associations between snoring and SGA. Our findings tentatively suggest that self-reported breathing pauses and leg twitching in late pregnancy are associated with infant outcomes, and highlight ethnic inequalities.

N2  - Objective The objective of the Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is to determine whether sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Study Design NuMoM2b is a prospective cohort study of 10,037 nulliparous women with singleton gestations that was conducted across 8 sites with a central Data Coordinating and Analysis Center. The Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy recruited 3702 women from the cohort to undergo objective, overnight in-home assessments of sleep disordered breathing. A standardized level 3 home sleep test was performed between 6<sup>0</sup>-15<sup>0</sup> weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again between 22<sup>0</sup>-31<sup>0</sup> weeks' gestation (visit 3). Scoring of tests was conducted by a central Sleep Reading Center. Participants and their health care providers were notified if test results met "urgent referral" criteria that were based on threshold levels of apnea hypopnea indices, oxygen saturation levels, or electrocardiogram abnormalities but were not notified of test results otherwise. The primary pregnancy outcomes to be analyzed in relation to maternal sleep disordered breathing are preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth. Results Objective data were obtained at visit 1 on 3261 women, which was 88.1% of the studies that were attempted and at visit 3 on 2511 women, which was 87.6% of the studies that were attempted. Basic characteristics of the substudy cohort are reported in this methods article. Conclusion The substudy was designed to address important questions regarding the relationship of sleep-disordered breathing on the risk of preeclampsia and other outcomes of relevance to maternal and child health.

N2  - Drivers of maternal adiposity are complicated and constitute more than just an energy imbalance(1). Personal choices and environmental factors also contribute to the rising rates of obesity. The obesogenic environment refers to factors that influence individuals to become excessively overweight(2). They are classified as microenvironments (school, workplace, home, neighbourhood or macro-environments (education and health systems, government policies, societies attitudes and beliefs). We sought to assess the obesogenic microenvironment, sleep patterns and metabolic profiles in an overweight and obese pregnant cohort. This is a prospective cohort study. Women with BMI >25 kg/m2 were recruited from the antenatal clinic and a lifestyle questionnaire assessing obesogenic risk factors, food behaviors and sleep patterns was administered. Serum samples taken in the first trimester were analyzed for fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA index and lipid profiles. Fifty women were included in the analysis 36 (72 %) overweight, 14 (28 %) obese. Over 80 % of the group lived adjacent to green space ± gym facilities however all women reported having easy access to fast food outlets. More obese patients left their workplaces at lunch or break times during the week compared to overweight women 36·6. % vs. 42·9 % p = 0·037. The majority reported poor access to work canteen facilities (71·05 %). Obese pregnant women were also less likely to use public transport on their commute to work. Analysis of sleep duration revealed women in the sample slept on average 6·5 hours per night. Metabolic profiling showed significant higher levels of, insulin, c-peptide and HOMA index in the obese when compared to the overweight group. This study has highlighted deficiencies in the physical, workplace and personal microenvironments that could contribute to maternal adiposity. Government, public health measures and local hospital policies should strive to limit convenience food outlets in the community, strive to improve work based environments and improve sleep hygiene amongst pregnant women. Metabolic derangement is also evident from early pregnancy and may impact on fetal growth and metabolism.

N2  - Objective: Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular complications and preterm delivery (PTD). Insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations and increased inflammation, both known to contribute to placental abruption (abruption), a determinant of PTD. We examined associations of abruption with sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion. Methods: The study included 164 abruption cases and 160 controls in a multicenter study in Peru. Data on habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (≤6, 7-8 and ≥9h); and frequency of feeling exhausted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased odds of abruption. The ORs of abruption in relation to short (≤6h) and long (≥9h) sleep duration were 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-4.1), compared with normal sleep duration (7-8h). Complaints of vital exhaustion were also associated with abruption (OR=2.37; 95% CI 1.46-3.85), and were independent of sleep duration. Conclusion: We extend the existing literature and support the thesis that maternal sleep habits and disorders should be assessed among pregnant women.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. The purpose of this study was to describe cytokine profiles which could be involved in such etiopathogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective, longitudinal multicenter study of women with a singleton gestation. Maternal serum and cervicovaginal (CV) fluid were collected during each trimester. Cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, CRP and MMP-8) were measured using multiplex beadlyte assay on a Luminex IS-100. In each trimester, patients completed questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed evaluating changes in cytokine levels among patients reporting poor sleep quality and/or disturbances on the PSQI. RESULTS: 396 patients underwent assessment in the 1st trimester, 314 in the 2nd and 297 in the 3rd. 27.2% patients reported poor sleep quality in the 3rd trimester: greater than the 2nd (16.8%, p <.001) and 1st trimester (19.4%, p =.011). Sleep disturbance scores were higher in the 3rd vs other trimesters (p <.001 each). Patients with poor sleep quality had an increased pro-inflammatory state (3rd trimester serum IL-8, p =.042), and a decreased anti-inflammatory milieu (CV IL-10, p =.01). Patients with higher sleep disturbance scores had higher 3rd trimester serum IL-8 (p=.014), and 2nd trimester CV IL-8 (p=.013). In the multivariate analyses, poor sleep quality was associated with decreased - 1st trimester serum IL-10 (p=.046), and CV IL-10 (p=.001), and increased - 2nd trimester serum IL-1β (p=.042), 3rd trimester CV IL-1α (p=.042), adjusting for sleep disturbances, socio-demographics, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy can result in an increased pro-inflammatory state at multiple biological sites. Such immunologic changes could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Few studies have investigated the impact of alterations in gravity on mammalian transcriptomes. Here, we describe the impact of spaceflight on mammary transcriptome of late pregnant rats and the effect of hypergravity exposure on mammary, liver, and adipose transcriptomes in late pregnancy and at the onset of lactation. RNA was isolated from mammary collected on pregnancy day 20 from rats exposed to spaceflight from days 11 to 20 of gestation. To measure the impact of hypergravity on mammary, liver, and adipose transcriptomes we isolated RNA from tissues collected on P20 and lactation day 1 from rats exposed to hypergravity beginning on pregnancy day 9. Gene expression was measured with Affymetrix GeneChips. Microarray analysis of variance revealed alterations in gravity affected the expression of genes that regulate circadian clocks and activate mechanotransduction pathways. Changes in these systems may explain global gene expression changes in immune response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Expression of genes that modify chromatin structure and methylation was affected, suggesting adaptation to gravity alterations may proceed through epigenetic change. Altered gravity experiments offer insights into the role of forces omnipresent on Earth that shape genomes in heritable ways. Our study is the first to analyze the impact of alterations in gravity on transcriptomes of pregnant and lactating mammals. Findings provide insight into systems that sense gravity and the way in which they affect phenotype, as well as the possibility of sustaining life beyond Earth’s orbit.

N2  - Objective We sought to examine the effect of maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) on infant general movements (GMs) and neurodevelopment. Study Design Pregnant women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies and their offspring were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low-risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire on second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index >5) and controls. Infant GMs were assessed in the first 48 hours and at 8-11 and 14-16 weeks of age. At 12 months of age the Infant Developmental Inventory and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered. Results In all, 74 women and their full-term infants were studied. Eighteen (24%) women had SDB. Mean birthweight was 3347.1 ± 423.9 g. Median Apgar score at 5 minutes was 10 (range, 8-10). In adjusted comparisons, no differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and controls in GM scores in all 3 evaluations. Low social developmental score was detected at 12 months in 64% of infants born to SDB mothers compared to 25% of infants born to controls (adjusted P =.036; odds ratio, 16.7). Infant snoring was reported by 41.7% of mothers with SDB compared to 7.5% of controls (P =.004). Conclusion Our preliminary results suggest that maternal SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal and infant neuromotor development but may affect social development at 1 year.

N2  - Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was composed by 143 depressed (n = 77) and non-depressed (n = 66) pregnant women who completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep during the night and the entire 24 h period. Present findings point out the effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety.

N2  - Study Objectives: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing ∼1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women. Design: Observational. Measurements: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review. Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (r<inf>s</inf> = -0.35, P = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (r<inf>s</inf> = -0.34, P = 0.002), sleep latency (r<inf>s</inf> = -0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (r<inf>s</inf> = -0.27, P = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate -0.029; 95% confidence interval -0.06, -0.002). Conclusions: The data provide novel evidence that African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.

N2  - Introduction. Changing anatomy and physiology of women during pregnancy can result in the development of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Increased risk of OSAS isconnected mainly with abnormally increased body mass and also hypertension. Irregular airflow through the upper respiratory tract manifested by snoring can lead to more complex pathologies such as postpartum depression, preeclampsia and ischemic placenta. Aim. Assessing the level of risk of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy. Material and methods.147 pregnant women from the Perinatology Department of Medical University of Łódź were interviewed to assess their sleep alterations. By means of the Berlin Sleep Questionnaire (BSQ) the risk of development of OSAS and its relation with abnormal daytime sleepiness (verified by Epworth Sleepiness Scale - ESS), trimester and the most popular addictions were evaluated. Results.34,7% of questioned women in the third trimester of pregnancy revealed an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea. The connection between BSQ and ESS scores was not confirmed statistically. Conclusions.Due to the fact that OSAS can exacerbate organic causes of some pathologies it is vital to underline the necessity of minimalizing its risk factors by the control of body mass and blood pressure in this group of patients.

N2  - Pregnancy and sleep disorders are strongly correlated. Sleep disorders commonly experienced in pregnancy include insomnia, restless legs syndrome, excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing, for example sleep apnea. Causes can be physical discomfort, hormonal changes, alterations in respiratory physiology and psychological and emotional upheaval. Incidence of the different types of sleep disorders varies depending on pregnancy trimester. The first trimester is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, although this can continue throughout pregnancy. Physical factors such as nausea and vomiting and hormonal changes are important causes. By the second trimester, hormonal changes are stabilising but women may still suffer sleep problems due to enlarged abdomen causing low back pain, abrupt fetal movements, heartburn and nocturia. In the third trimester, the majority of women suffer from sleep problems. Incidence of insomnia and restless legs syndrome reach their maximum. Sleep disordered breathing issues including sleep apnea, snoring and hypoventilation are also more common, influenced by rising progesterone levels, disordered and periodic breathing, excessive weight gain and altered neck circumference. Sleep disorders in pregnancy have been associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Treatment options include improving sleep hygiene, exercise, positional therapy, continuous positive airway pressure, behavioural therapies and, where the sleep disorders are refractory to these types of interventions, short-term pharmacological treatment with suitable hypnotics. Postpartum, many of the pregnancy-associated sleep disorders resolve, however many women continue to experience excessive daytime sleepiness and both pre-and post-partum sleep disorders have been linked to incidence of post-natal depression.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common in women and reported at 14-45% in pregnancy. SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia and has been found to be associated with hypertenison, stroke and heart attack. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of objectively measured snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between recorded snoring and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) within a larger cohort from a prevalence of SDP in pregnancy study. Methods: Objective measurements were attended following Epworth scale questionnaire administered to pregnant women attending an outpatient's antenatal clinic to ascertain the self reported snoring is a component. Overnight recordings of sleep were attained using SonoMat ™ (Home Sleep Testing). Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and analyze by IBM SPSS v.20™ utilizing chi-square analysis, student T test and logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ (2009) diagnostic criteria. Results: Objective measures were attended on 202 women, snoring was recorded for >20% of the night for 34%. HDP affected 26.2% of the cohort, 49% of whom had preeclampsia. Of the pregnancies affected by HDP recorded snoring (>20% of the night) occurred in 50% in comparison to 30% who do not have HDP (p < 0.003). Conclusions: This would indicate that there is an association between measured snoring and HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential risk factors such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other co morbidities. the causal relationship between HDP and snoring should be further explored.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)is prevalent in type 2 diabetes patients, between 58-86% from several studies, with its severity associated with glycemic control. The data in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM) are lacking. We hypothesized that OSA is prevalent and has an impact on glucose metabolism in women with GDM. We conducted a cross sectional study in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM [pre-pregnancy BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (cutoff in Asians)] between gestational age of 24 and 34 weeks. Sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed by sleep questionnaires [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)]. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight, in-home monitoring device, Watch-PAT200, which detects changes in peripheral arterial tone in response to changes in oxygen saturation levels. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) were collected. Of the 25 participants (mean gestational age 27.9±3.4 weeks), 14 or 52% had OSA (Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5); with 85.7% had mild (5≤ AHI <15) and 14.2% had moderate OSA (15≤ AHI <30), respectively. Those with OSA tended to have a higher pre-pregnancy BMI than those in the No-OSA group, but this difference was not statistically significant (31.2±4.1 vs 29.0±2.6 kg/m2, p=0.14), while there were no differences in age, neck circumference, gestational age, PSQI score, ESS score, FPG or HbA1c between groups. As expected, those in the OSA group had a significantly higher median(IQR) AHI, oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and median percent of sleep time spent under oxygen saturation of 90% (T90) than those in the No-OSA group; 9.9(8.4-13.0) vs.1.4(0.4-3.4) events/hour (p<0.001), 4.7(3.5-6.9) vs. 0.5(0.2-1.0) (p<0.001), and 0.1(0.0-0.3) vs. 0.0(0.0-0.0) (p=0.012), respectively. Median minimum oxygen saturation (MinO2) was significantly lower in the OSA group than in the No-OSA group [87.0% (84.7-89.0) vs. 92.0% (91.0-94.0), p<0.001]. Analyses revealed that indices of OSA severity tended to correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI [AHI correlation coefficient(r)=0.34 (p=0.09); ODI r=0.36 (p=0.08); T90 r=0.38 (p=0.06) and MinO2 r= -0.37 (p=0.06)]. For glycemic parameters, MinO2negatively correlated with FPG, even after adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI (r= -0.42, p=0.04), and ODI tended to correlate with FPG (r=0.35, p=0.09). There were no correlations between sleep parameters and HbA1c. There was no relationship between subjective sleep quality (as measured by PSQI) and objectively measured sleep parameters. However, daytime sleepiness (ESS) significantly correlated with T90 (r=0.49, p=0.01) while it was negatively correlated with MinO2 (r= -0.43, p=0.03). In conclusion, OSA is prevalent in obese GDM women, similarly to those with type 2 diabetes. Lower oxygen saturation is associated with more daytime sleepiness and higher fasting plasma glucose levels in these women.

N2  - Menstrual disturbance due to hypercortisolism in Cushing's syndrome(CS) often leads to infertility so that pregnancy during CS is extremely rare with only a few cases reported. Notably, cortisol producing adenoma (CPA) are more commonly found in pregnant CS cases. Once diagnosed, treatment could be consisted of conservative therapy, surgical treatment and medical treatment, depending on the plasma cortisol level, severity of complications, gestational weeks and the patient's general state. There is still no confirmative evidence to ascertain the optimal approach with maternal and fetal morbidity reduction. Here, we report a case of a gravida with CPA , who was conservatively treated during the third trimester of pregnancy until delivery. Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed postpartum. Clinical case: A 27-year-old gravida (G2P0A1) woman was referred to our hospital at 28 week 2 day weeks of pregnancy for mild hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia and mild edema of lower legs. Physical examination revealed cushingoid features-moon face, buffalo hump, striaes in abdominal and lower limb. Her blood pressure was 146/84 mmHg and body mass index was 26.8kg/m2. Endocrinological tests revealed exceeding cortisol production and abnormalities in circadian rhythm of cortisol: 8am 924nmol/L(118nmol/L<n<618nmol/L), 4pm 733.26nmol/L, 12mn 959.39nmol/L; mid-night salivary cortisol were 61.95 nmol/L and 48.89 nmol/L(0 pmo/L<n<10.4 pmo/L); basal urinary free cortisol were 2611 nmol/24h, 2590 nmol/24h and 2554 nmol/24h (153 nmol/24h <n<789 nmol/24h); plasma ACTH was consistently suppressed below detection limit (5 pg/mL). There was no suppression of cortisol with both 1mg and 8mg overnight dexamethasone test. Serum potassium level was 3.12mmol/L. Obstetrical laboratory tests were normal except 75g oral glucose screening test (FPG 4.4mmol/L, 1h PG 12.0mmol/L, 2h PG 9.5mmol/L). Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a left adrenal mass measuring 2.0cm in diameter, which was confirmed by MRI scanning of the adrenal glands while pituitary MRI scanning was normal. Respecting the patient's wishes, conservative therapy was applied to carry her pregnancy to full-term (38 weeks): blood pressure was strictly monitored and blood glucose was well controlled by insulin. No maternal and fetal complications occurred during gestation and delivery. As scheduled, left adrenalectomy was conducted 2 months after delivery. Shortly after operation, she was asymptomatic and achieved the normalization of blood pressure, blood glucose, serum potassium and cortisol level. Conclusion: In pregnant CS cases with mild hypercortisolism and mild complication, conservative symptomatic therapy and postpartum surgery may avoid unnecessary adverse effect and contribute to uneventful gestation and delivery.

N2  - Aims: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with placenta-mediated adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed at comparing placenta-secreted proteins, such as first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers which have been linked to preeclampsia, and markers of angiogenesis in pregnant women with OSA, and pregnant controls at low risk for OSA. Methods: A case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and controls at low risk for OSA was performed. Levels of first and second trimester markers were reported as multiple of median (MoM), and adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Stored samples were tested for markers of angiogenesis and adjusted for gestational age, BMI, and chronic hypertension. Results: A total of 24 women with OSA and 166 controls had screening markers. BMI was higher in cases compared to controls, P=0.01. MoM levels of placenta associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were significantly lower in cases versus controls, even after adjusting for BMI (0.52 IQR 0.48 vs. 1.01 IQR 0.63, P=0.009). The ratio of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 to placental growth factor was significantly higher in cases than controls, even after adjusting for confounders (4.42 IQR 2.52 vs. 2.93 IQR 2.01, P=0.009). Conclusion: Circulating placenta-secreted glycoproteins and markers of angiogenesis are altered in pregnant women with OSA.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sleep disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: 3702 women were recruited to undergo objective, overnight in-home assessments of SDB in early pregnancy (6-15 weeks) and again in mid-pregnancy (22-31 weeks). Assessments were scored by a central Sleep Reading Center. SDB was defined using an Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) cut-off of ≥ 5; an AHI of 5e<15 is mild SDB, and ≥15 moderate-severe SDB. The primary outcome measures were hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational diabetes (GDM). Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, BMI and presence of chronic hypertension in early pregnancy analyses, and in addition, weight gain between visits for the midpregnancy analyses. RESULTS: Adequate data were obtained in early pregnancy on 3261 women (88.1% of studies attempted) and in mid-pregnancy on 2511 women (87.6% of studies attempted). The prevalence of SDB in early and mid-pregnancy was 3.3% and 8.1%, respectively. Outcome rates by SDB status are shown in the Table. SDB in mid-pregnancy was associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (aOR 1.62; 95% CI 1.10, 2.39). SDB in early (aOR 3.62; 95% CI 2.01, 6.53) and mid-pregnancy (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.62, 4.81) was associated with GDM. Dose-response relationships were observed between AHI and hypertensive disorders (mid-pregnancy) and GDM (early and midpregnancy). CONCLUSION: SDB during pregnancy is associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and GDM. Further research should help to establish whether screening for and treating SDB in pregnancy can lessen the risk of these outcomes. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background: Evidence indicates that sleep may be affected by using vitamins and minerals or lack of them. This study aimed to determine the effects of vitamin D and calcium-vitamin D in the treatment of sleep disorders in pregnant women with leg cramps. Methods: This triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial took place on 126 pregnant women referred to Tabriz health centers, Tabriz, Iran, in 2013-2014. Subjects were allocated in to three groups, using block randomization. The groups received vitamin D, calcium-vitamin D and placebo pills daily for 60 days. Sleep score was measured before and after the intervention, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. ANCOVA test was used for data analysis. Findings: Controlling baseline score before the intervention, there was no significant differences in the sleep quality score after intervention between the group receiving calcium-vitamin D and the control group (adjusted difference: -0.3, 95% confidence interval: -1.4 to 2.1), the group receiving vitamin D and controls (adjusted difference: -0.007, 95% confidence interval: -1.7 to 1.7) and between the two groups receiving calcium-vitamin D and vitamin D (adjusted difference: -0.3, 95% confidence interval: -1.4 to 2.1). Also, there was no significant difference between the groups in sleep quality subscales (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The results show that calcium-vitamin D and vitamin D does not effect on improving the sleep quality in pregnant women with leg cramps.

N2  - Objectives: Snoring is common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester. Most investigators of snoring during pregnancy had utilized questionnaires to determine the presence and severity of snoring. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of questionnaires to determine the presence of snoring in pregnant women compared with objectively measured snoring. Methods: Berlin questionnaires were administered to 202 pregnant women. One question asked “Do you snore?” Snoring was then recorded in the woman's home using a SonoMat ™ device, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was determined. The results from the questionnaire were compared to recorded snoring and AHI results. Results: 124 women answered “Yes” to the question “Do you snore?” and 78 women answered “No” and “I don't know” for score purpose were included in “No”. The average gestation was 28 ± 7 weeks. Women who reported “No” were just as likely to report >20% snoring as those who reported “Yes” (35.5%, p = ns). Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that questionnaire results are not always a reliable method of determining whether snoring is present, and overnight monitoring should be used to rule out sleep disordered breathing. .

N2  - Background:Sleep fragmentation during late gestation (LG-SF) is one of the major perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during pregnancy. We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood.Objectives:To investigate the effects of late LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring.Methods:Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or sleep control during LG (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. At 24 weeks of age, lipid profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed in the offspring. We performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice per group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks.Results:We detected significant increases in body weight (31.7 vs 28.8 g; P=0.001), visceral (642.1 vs 497.0 mg; P=0.002) and subcutaneous (293.1 vs 250.1 mg; P=0.001) fat mass, plasma cholesterol (110.6 vs 87.6 mg dl-1; P=0.001), triglycerides (87.3 vs 84.1 mg dl-1; P=0.003) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values (8.1 vs 6.1; P=0.007) in the LG-SF group. MeDIP analyses revealed that 2148 DMRs (LG-SF vs LG-SC; P<0.0001, model-based analysis of tilling-arrays algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome, such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1 and so on. Overrepresented pathways and gene networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response.Conclusions:Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated with the metabolic processes and inflammatory responses in VWAT. LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations may underlie increases in the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the predictive ability of current obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening tools and the individual questions in these tools at identifying pregnant women who have OSA. Methods: A total of 293 third-trimester patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2012, and 248 patients had sleep monitor results. Recruited participants completed a questionnaire consisting of six OSA screening tools and overnight portable sleep monitoring. Predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA compared with results of the diagnosis from overnight sleep monitoring was estimated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: Two hundred eighteen (88%) of the patients were OSA-negative, and 30 patients (12%) were OSA-positive based on sleep monitoring results. Compared with OSA-negative patients, OSA-positive patients had greater body mass indices and neck circumferences as well as significantly higher rates of hypertension (chronic and gestational), pregestational diabetes mellitus, asthma, and preeclampsia. The overall predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA was modest (area under receiver operating characteristic curves 0.62-0.695). However, individual components of the questionnaire were strongly associated with OSA. Conclusion: We found that none of the studied OSA screening tools accurately detected OSA in pregnant women in the third trimester. We have identified proposed elements of a new screening tool based on promising components from several tools that may more accurately detect patients with OSA.

N2  - Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on-and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.

N2  - Sleep habits have not been studied systematically in infertile women. Yet PCOS, a common cause of infertility, has been associated with increased sleep disturbances. PCOS is frequently accompanied by obesity and metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, which have been implicated as risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Objective: To evaluate sleep parameters in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and unexplained infertility (UI) and assess risk factors for OSA and disturbed sleep. Methods: 1603 infertile women who were participants in the Reproductive Medicine Network's randomized clinical trials Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II (PPCOS II; N=739) and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS; N=864) completed the Sleep Habits questionnaire prior to initiation of treatment. PCOS was defined by Rotterdam Criteria and women with UI by definition were ovulatory. Females in both cohorts were 18-40y, had at least 1 patent fallopian tube and normal uterine cavity, and a male partner with sperm concentration of at least 14 million/ml. Self-reported responses were compared by cohort (PCOS or UI). Multivariate logistic regression was conducted with sleep responses as outcome adjusted for BMI, Ferriman-Gallwey score, testosterone, measures of insulin resistance, smoking, alcohol consumption and history of heart disease, hypertension, waist circumference, ethnicity, SHBG, AMH and total antral follicle count. Results: Women with PCOS were more likely to report short duration of sleep <6 hours (6.1% vs. 2.7%; P<.001), habitual snoring (37.8% vs. 19.0%; p<.001), and had more subjective sleepiness (12.0% vs. 8.6%; P<0.026) than those with UI; and had 4.54 (2.07-9.97) increased odds ratio (OR, 95%CI) of a previous diagnosis of OSA, 2.59 (1.87-3.60) OR of habitual snoring, 2.39 (1.43-3.98) OR of sleeping less than 6 hours and 4.71 (1.08-20.56) OR of breathing pauses (sleep apnea). After adjustment, PCOS and fasting insulin level >10 mIU/ml were associated with a diagnosis of OSA, whereas PCOS, insulin >10 mIU/ml, waist circumference >88 cm and current smoking were associated with self-reported habitual snoring. Conclusions: Infertile women with PCOS more commonly report sleep disturbances than those with UI. Measures of insulin resistance are associated with previous diagnosis of OSA, habitual snoring and shortened sleep duration of <6 hours per night. Obesity and increased waist circumference are associated with snoring/habitual snoring, and measures of hyperandrogenism are associated with perceived sleepiness.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Studies have demonstrated that sleep restriction adversely affects appetite regulating hormones, insulin sensitivity, inflammation and autonomic function. However, data regarding the clinical consequences of short sleep durations during pregnancy are limited. Our objective was to determine whether insufficient sleep is associated with increased risks of gestational hypertension (GHTN), preeclampsia (PE), and/or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). STUDY DESIGN: Women enrolled in a multi-center prospective cohort study of adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparous women with a singleton gestation were recruited at the 2nd study visit (16 0/7-21 6/7 weeks') to wear an actigraph (ActiWatch, Phillips Respironics) to record objective sleep activity for 7 consecutive days. Women with pregestational diabetes and chronic hypertension were excluded. Short sleep duration (SSD) was defined as average sleep of < 7 hours per night. RESULTS: Actigraphy and outcome data were obtained for 760 women. Median sleep duration was 7.4 (IQR 1.0) hours, and 28% of women had SSD, averaged over the 7 days. 5.1% of women developed GHTN, 5.1% developed PE and 4.1% developed GDM. Outcome rates stratified by SSD status are shown in the Table. SSD was associated with an increased rate of GDM even after adjusting for age and BMI (aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.02-4.41), but was not associated with GHTN and/or PE. CONCLUSION: SSD during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable factor, is associated with the development of GDM after controlling for maternal age and BMI. Further research can establish if screening for sleep disturbances and education to modify sleep patterns in women with SSD can lessen the risk of GDM. (Table presented) .

N2  - Aim Although sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) might impose an underlying health threat upon some pregnant women, the influence of SDB on the health status of most pregnant women is not discernible. In order to find out which pregnant women should be evaluated for clinically meaningful SDB during the second trimester, the present study aimed to determine which overnight oximetry findings significantly affect maternal resting cardiac autonomic modulations. Material and Methods Overnight arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was monitored at home using pulse oximetry by 64 women with uncomplicated pregnancy between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. We then determined the impact of the findings on maternal resting heart rate variability (HRV) using 5-min photoplethysmography. Results A relatively increased oxygen desaturation index (number of oxygen desaturation events where SaO2 fell >3% below the baseline saturation/h) of ≥3.0 in five women did not significantly impact HRV. On the other hand, events associated with profound oxygen desaturation (minimum SaO2 ≤ 90%) in three women were associated with decreased HRV, including high- and low-frequency powers. Conclusion Parasympathetic activities of cardiac autonomic modulations might be attenuated in women who experience profound night-time oxygen desaturation, even if the incidence of significant events is quite low. The oximetry finding of minimum SaO2 ≤ 90% might be a valuable criterion for clinically meaningful sleep-disordered breathing among women with early uncomplicated pregnancy.

N2  - Insomnia and sleep deficiency in pregnancy are very common with most women reporting sleep disturbances during pregnancy. Insomnia and sleep deficiency are also more prevalent as pregnancy progresses, possibly related to pregnancy-related physical symptoms or discomfort. There is increasing evidence indicating that these sleep problems may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as depressive symptoms, increased pain during labor, more Caesarean sections, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Treatment of insomnia remains challenging as some of the more commonly used sleep inducing medications such as benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy are available but the data in pregnancy is often lacking.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Data from non-pregnant populations suggests that sleep disruption can impact glucose metabolism. Moreover, several studies have found associations between shortened sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism in pregnancy. However, interpretation of the pregnancy data is limited by the lack of objective sleep measures. Our goal was to describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration and post-prandial blood glucose in women recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM). STUDY DESIGN: Women recently diagnosed with GDM were enrolled immediately following a GDM education class. None of the subjects were on insulin or glyburide, and all received the same teaching by diabetic educators. They were instructed in use of a glucometer, timing of glucose testing, and principles of a GDM diet. Women wore an actigraph (ActiWatch, Phillips Respironics) and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Blood glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data from the night before. Linear mixed models estimated the effect of sleep duration on one hour postprandial blood glucose levels. RESULTS: 37 participants provided 188 nights of sleep data and blood glucose values. Participants had a mean age of 31.1 years (IQR 25.7- 36.5), mean gestational age of 26.3 weeks (IQR 20.2-32.4), and mean BMI of 31.2 (IQR 22.7-39.7). Median sleep duration was 6.8 hours (IQR 5.2-8.4). Sleep duration was significantly associated with decreased one-hour postprandial blood glucose levels (Table). A 1- hour increase in sleep time was associated with a reduction of 3.06 mg/dL in post-breakfast glucose, 4.62 mg/dL in post-lunch glucose, and 6.06 mg/dL in post-dinner glucose when adjusting for age, gestational age, and pre-pregnancy BMI. CONCLUSION: Longer sleep durations are significantly associated with lower post-prandial blood glucose in women with GDM. Educating women on healthy sleep as well as screening for and treating sleep disorders during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in gestational diabetes.

N2  - The mammalian circadian system develops gradually during ontogenesis, and after birth, the system is already set to a phase of the mothers. The role of maternal melatonin in the entrainment of fetal circadian clocks has been suggested, but direct evidence is lacking. In our study, intact or pinealectomized pregnant rats were exposed to constant light (LL) throughout pregnancy to suppress the endogenous melatonin and behavioral rhythms. During the last 5 days of gestation, the rats were injected with melatonin or vehicle or were left untreated. After delivery, daily expression profiles of c-fos and Avp in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and Per1, Per2, Rev-erbα, and Bmal1 in the liver were measured in 1-day-old pups. Due to the LL exposure, no gene expression rhythms were detected in the SCN of untreated pregnant rats or in the SCN and liver of the pups. The administration of melatonin to pregnant rats entrained the pups' gene expression profiles in the SCN, but not in the liver. Melatonin did not affect the maternal behavior during pregnancy. Vehicle injections also synchronized the gene expression in the SCN but not in the liver. Melatonin and vehicle entrained the gene expression profiles to different phases, demonstrating that the effect of melatonin was apparently not due to the treatment procedure per se. The data demonstrate that in pregnant rats with suppressed endogenous melatonin levels, pharmacological doses of melatonin affect the fetal clock in the SCN but not in the liver.

N2  - Sleep deprivation in women resulting from their modern lifestyle, especially during pregnancy, is a serious concern as it can affect the health of the newborn. Anxiety disorders and cognitive deficits in the offspring are also on the rise. However, experimental studies on the effects of sleep loss during pregnancy, on emotional development and cognitive function of the newborn, are scanty in literature. In the current study, female rats were sleep-deprived for 5 h by gentle handling, during the 6 days of the third trimester (days 14-19 of pregnancy). The effects of this sleep deprivation on anxiety-related behaviors of pups during their peri-adolescence age were studied using elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to body weights of dams and offspring, the maternal behavior was also monitored. The weanlings of sleep-deprived dams showed heightened risk-taking behavior as they made increased explorations into the open arms of EPM. They also showed higher mobility in comparison to the control group. Though the body weights of sleep-deprived dams were comparable to those of the control group, their newborns had lower birth weight. Nevertheless, these pups gained weight and reached the control group values during the initial post-natal week. But after weaning, their rate of growth was lower than that of the control group. This is the first report providing evidences for the role of sleep during late pregnancy in shaping the neuropsychological development in offspring.

N2  - Objectives: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a symptom of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Several studies have found that SDB during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between self-reported snoring and neck circumference, weight gain and BMI. Methods: 2306 pregnant women answered a questionnaire which included “Do you snore?” among the questions. The women were asked their pre pregnancy weight, current height and weight were used to calculate BMI and change in BMI from pre pregnancy to trial entry, neck circumference was measured, and the Epworth questionnaire for daytime sleepiness was administered. The data from women who answered “Yes” to the snoring question were compared to that of women who answered No. Results: Pre pregnancy BMI, current BMI and the increase in BMI from pre- pregnancy to current were all highly significantly increased in the women who reported snoring during pregnancy (p < 0.0001, <0.0001 and 0.003, respectively). The Epworth sleepiness score, calculated from the Epworth questionnaire, was significantly higher i.e. more daytime sleepiness, in women who reported snoring (p < 0.0001) and the neck circumference measurements of women who reported snoring were also highly significantly higher (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Women who report snoring during pregnancy have higher pre pregnancy and current BMI, increase their BMI more during pregnancy, have larger neck circumference and are sleepier during the day. Therefore women who intend to become, or are pregnant, should be encouraged to reduce their BMI and maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common in women and reported at 14-45% in pregnancy. SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia, and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke, and heart attack. There is no depth of knowledge examining the association between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between self-reported snoring and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) within a larger cohort from a prevalence of SDB in pregnancy study. Methods: Questionnaires were administered to women attending an outpatient's antenatal clinic. Objective measurements were undertaken. The self-reported snoring is a component of the Epworth scale. Overnight recordings of sleep were attained using SonoMat™ (Home Sleep Testing). Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and analysed by IBM SPSS v.20™ utilizing chi-square analysis, student T test and logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ (2009) criteria. Results: Questionnaires were administered and outcomes collected on 2309 pregnancies. Snoring was reported in 45.5% of women. Objective measures were attended on 202 women, snoring was recorded at 61%. HDP affected 10.1% of the cohort, 3.3% of whom had preeclampsia. Of the pregnancies affected by self-reported snoring, HDP occurred in 13.4% in comparison to 7.6% of those who do not report snoring (p < 0.01). Conclusions: This indicates an association between selfreported snoring and HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential cofounders such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other comorbidities.

N2  - Aim: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <. 32. weeks gestation spending a greater proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). Methods: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP post-extubation had sleep and wake activity measured by actigraphy for 72. hours post-extubation. Activity diaries were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling. Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the analysis. Results: 28 infants with mean gestation of 28.3. weeks (SD 2) and birth weight 1074. g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those on NCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8) p = 0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean activity score than those on NCPAP (p = 0.003, p. = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion: Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The primary study aim was to develop a validated short form, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) pregnancy-specific questionnaire (SFSPQ) in a large, prospective cohort of gravidae. Two screening tools were developed: one that evaluated SDB only (SF-SPQ) and another that included a comorbid condition associated with SDB (SF-SPQ+C). A secondary aim was to examine whether these tools predicted preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: The study sample included 1,153 gravidae who completed the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ), an existing SDB screening tool, and had outcomes data. BQ items were evaluated by confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in Mplus v5.0. Adjusted relative-risks for preeclampsia were estimated in Stata v10.0. RESULTS: Based upon selection criteria and CFA results shown in Figure 1, the SF-SPQ consisted of 4 items: snoring loudly, frequent snoring, cessation of breathing during sleep, and sleeping while driving. The SF-SPQ+C included the aforementioned items and a comorbid condition, pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI>30). For both screening tools, CFA results indicated item factors loadings were significant (P<0.05) with a good model fit (CFI≥0.90, TLI≥0.90, RMSEA≥0.06). In adjusted regression models, a higher score on the SF-SPQ was associated with preeclampsia among non-obese, obese, and all gravidae. The SF-SPQ+C was associated with preeclampsia among all gravidae (Table 1). CONCLUSION: The SF-SPQ and SF-SPQ+C are validated screening tools for SDB during pregnancy and potentially allow physicians to quickly and effectively screen gravidae at risk for SDB and preeclampsia. Unlike previous screening tools which include comorbid conditions a priori, the SF-SPQ demonstrated that SDB items alone were associated with preeclampsia among non-obese gravidae. Additional research is needed to validate these screening tools against polysomnography to confirm SDB diagnosis and to evaluate their efficacy in early detection of preeclampsia. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background: Diabetes is a well-known obstetric risk factor. Sleep apnea is an emerging risk factor for diabetes and may affect gestation as well. Apnea symptoms such as snoring, tiredness and observed apneas predict the risk for sleep apnea. Hypertension, age and obesity are predictors of apnea, diabetes and gestational complications. Objective: To associate risk for apnea detected by questionnaire with delivery complications, controlling for diabetes and classical obstetric risk factors. Materials and methods: In a prospective cohort design, 158 women answered a version of the STOP-Bang questionnaire adapted for pregnant women using age cutoff at 35 yrs. and excluding male gender (STOP-Ban); risk for sleep apnea was considered present when score>2. Obstetric history and physical examination were obtained. Both gestational and pregestational diabetes were considered for the analyses. The hospital records were reviewed for delivery outcomes. Preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, non-elective cesarean section, low birth weight, and nonreassuring fetal condition were considered adverse delivery outcomes. Seven classical gestational risk factors were used to adjust the multivariate models. Results: Delivery data was obtained from 144 women with a mean (±SD) age of 29±6.6 yrs., gestational age of 24±8.9 weeks; body mass index 28.7±6.5 kg/m2, blood pressure 113±16/69±9 mmHg. In this sample, 13 women (8%) had diabetes and 41 (28%) had a positive STOP-Ban. In univariate analysis, diabetes increased 12% (relative risk: 1.12; 95% CI 1.03-1.22) while positive STOP-Ban increased 3.84 (1.48-9.9) times risk of delivery complications (P=0.004). The other significant risks in this sample were previous cesarean section and nulliparity. In multivariate analysis, previous cesarean delivery and nulliparity remained significant. The risk introduced by diabetes increased to 8.7 (1.02-74) while positive STOP-Ban maintained the relative risk at 3.79 (1.33-10.8). The R squared for the model increases from 0.23 to 0.28 when STOP-Ban is included. Conclusion: In our study, diabetes in pregnant woman is associated with adverse delivery outcomes, even controlling for classical gestational risk factors. When positive questionnaire for sleep apnea is added to the model, the predictive value increases. Identifying symptoms of sleep apnea in pregnant woman may potentiate the preventive influence of prenatal care in minimizing maternal-fetal morbidity.

N2  - Sleep disorders are highly prevalent during late pregnancy and can impose adverse effects, such as preeclampsia and diabetes. However, the consequences of sleep fragmentation (SF) on offspring metabolism and epigenomic signatures are unclear. We report that physical activity during early life, but not later, reversed the increased body weight, altered glucose and lipid homeostasis, and increased visceral adipose tissue in offspring of mice subjected to gestational SF (SFo). The reversibility of this phenotype may reflect epigenetic mechanisms induced by SF during gestation. Accordingly, we found that the metabolic master switch Foxo1 was epigenetically misregulated in SFo livers in a temporally regulated fashion. Temporal Foxo1 analysis and its gluconeogenetic targets revealed that the epigenetic abnormalities of Foxo1 precede the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Importantly, regular physical activity early, but not later in life, reversed Foxo1 epigenetic misregulation and altered the metabolic phenotype in gestationally SF-exposed offspring. Thus, we have identified a restricted postnatal period during which lifestyle interventions may reverse the Foxo1 epigenetically mediated risk for metabolic dysfunction later in the life, as induced by gestational sleep disorders.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories. Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period. Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period. Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

N2  - This abstract also was presented at the 15th annual Rachmiel Levine Diabetes and Obesity Symposium on March 2, 2015, Levine Poster Number: 56. Background: Obesity is increasingly recognized as a cause of infertility in men. One of the underlying mechanisms is the inhibition of gonadotropin production by estrogens aromatised from androgens in adipose tissue. Testosterone levels and sperm quality can be restored with the use of aromatase inhibitors, the most potent being Letrozole. Some series suggest that a low dose (one tablet of 2.5 mg weekly) is sufficient to normalize testosterone levels(1,2). However, data on spermatogenesis and fertility are lacking. Objective: To review the efficacy of low-dose letrozole to normalize testosterone, sperm count, and fertility in men with obesity-related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (OrHH). Method: Retrospective observational study of 12 men consulting for infertility, and diagnosed with OrHH. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2. All patients had a total testosterone below the lower limit of normal with normal to low FSH and LH, and/or decreased sperm count as defined by the World Health Organisation. After excluding other causes of hypogonadism, patients were given low-dose letrozole. Results: At baseline, mean age was 35.3 ± 5.9 years and mean BMI was 43.0 ± 7.0 kg/m2. Three subjects were diabetic and two were treated for sleep apnea. Mean duration of infertility was 2.9 ± 2.0 years. Eight had primary infertility and four, secondary infertility. Partners' mean age was 31.1 ± 5.1 years and five were treated for polycystic ovary syndrome. After starting low-dose letrozole, estradiol decreased from 119.5 ± 57.2 to 72.2 ± 35.1 nmol/L. Mean FSH increased from 4.4 ± 2.0 to 8.0 ± 2.5 IU/L, mean LH increased from 4.4 ± 1.8 to 6.6 ± 1.1 IU/L, and mean total testosterone increased from 7.4 ± 1.7 to 21.1 ± 6.9 nmol/L. Mean sperm count rose from 14.8 ± 16.2 to 64.5 ± 67.2 x 109/L. Discussion: Three response patterns were identified: full responders (increase in testosterone and sperm count; three patients), mixed responders (increase in testosterone but not in sperm count; two patients), and non-responders (one patient). Six patients' sperm counts are pending, but testosterone levels normalized in eleven patients (92%). Three couples conceived: two spontaneously and one with in vitro fertilization. Four pregnancies ensued: two reached term, successfully; the other two were a spontaneous abortion and an ectopic pregnancy. Conclusion: Letrozole seems to be an effective treatment to help restore fertility in obese infertile men, with an interesting safety profile and some great advantages in term of route of administration and cost when compared to the use of gonadotropins injections for spermatogenesis induction. More studies are needed to determine which patients might benefit most from this treatment, as well as to compare it with other treatments such as gonadotropins and clomiphene citrate.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the joint effect of prepregnancy body-mass index (BMI) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on the association with preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies delivered in all Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals between 2006-2012 (n=180,626). Preeclampsia and OSA were ascertained from clinical diagnosis codes from electronic health records. BMI (kilograms per square meter) was categorized as normal (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or greater). Data were analyzed using logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Compared to women with normal BMI in their pregnancy, overweight women (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.6, 1.8) and obese women (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.7, 2.9) were at increased risk of preeclampsia. Compared to a pregnancy without OSA, a pregnancy with OSA was associated with increased risk of preeclampsia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.0, 13.3) independent of prepregnancy BMI. Compared to women with normal BMI without the diagnosis of OSA in their pregnancy, overweight women (OR 7.1, 95% CI 4.5, 11.2) and obese wmen (OR 13.4, 95% CI 4.8, 37.3) with the diagnosis of OSA were at increased risk of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: The joint effect of obesity and OSA on the risk of preeclampsia was stronger than was the sum of the independent effects of each factor. Women at-risk of preeclampsia should be advised of a markedly stronger risk for preeclampsia when both conditions occur together. Weight management as well as diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea in obese women may reduce risk for developing preeclampsia.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO4) is often administered in cases of TPL, PIH, or FGR to suppress uterine contraction, prevent eclampsia, or protect fetal brain. When diagnosing NRFS, CTG is utilized as the indicator of the fetal oxygenation. Administration of MgSO4 possibly influences it. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of MgSO4 on fetal baroreflex in dirrefent fetal oxygenation status (normoxemia vs. hypoxemia) and in different fetal sleep status (NREM vs. REM). STUDY DESIGN: Chronically instrumented lamb fetuses were obtained on 8 pregnant sheep at 120 ± 0 days of gestation. We monitored the fetal arterial blood pressure and fetal arterial blood gas analysis, electrocardiogram, and electrlocorticogram to evaluate the fetal sleep statuses. Tracheal catheter was inserted to the dam to induce hypoxemia. We administered phenylephline to induce the fetal baroreflex, and assessed it by the ratio DFHR(fetal heart rate)/DMAP (mean arterial pressure). We assessed normoxemia group (saline/MgSO4 administered, NREM/REM) and hypoxemia group(saline/MgSO4 administered, NREM/REM). RESULTS: Phenylephline administration was performed 121 times. In the normoxemia group with saline, fetal baroreflex was stronger in NREM than in REM, which was consistent with previous report. However, following MgSO4 administration, no difference in baroreflex between REM and NREM phases was observed. In addition, MgSO4 administration reduced the baroreflex as a whole. In the hypoxemia group with saline, there was no difference in baroreflex between REM and NREM phases. Hypoxemia with saline administration group significantly increased the baroreflex but MgSO4 administration strongly suppressed baroreflex. CONCLUSION: MgSO4 and/or hypoxemia suppressed the fluctuation of baroreflex during sleep cycles. Administration of MgSO4 suppressed baroreflex, and such tendency was further strengthened by hypoxemia. It is very interesting that our results suggest MgSO4 administration may clinically lead to underestimation of fetal deceleration.

N2  - The secretion of the stress hormone cortisol follows a diurnal circadian rhythm. There are indications that this rhythm is affected by stress early in life. This paper addresses the development of the cortisol circadian rhythm between 1 and 6 years of age, and the role of maternal stress and anxiety early in the child's life on this (developing) rhythm. Participants were 193 healthy mother-child dyads from a community sample. Self-reported maternal stress and anxiety and physiological stress (saliva cortisol), were assessed prenatally (gestational week 37). Postnatally, self-reported maternal stress and anxiety were measured at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 72 months. Saliva cortisol samples from the children were collected on two days (four times each day) at 12, 30, and 72 months of age. The total amount of cortisol during the day and the cortisol decline over the day were determined to indicate children's cortisol circadian rhythm. Multilevel analyses showed that the total amount of cortisol decreased between 1 and 6 years. Furthermore, more maternal pregnancy-specific stress was related to higher total amounts of cortisol in the child. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal anxiety were associated with flatter cortisol declines in children. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal daily hassles were associated with steeper child cortisol declines over the day. These results indicated developmental change in children's cortisol secretion from 1 to 6 years and associations between maternal stress and anxiety early in children's lives and children's cortisol circadian rhythm in early childhood.

N2  - Background: Fundal growth during pregnancy can lead to unremitting discomfort and skin breakdown in patients with extensive abdominal scarring. CASE: A 31-year-old primigravid woman at 30 weeks of gestation presented to the department of dermatology with constant abdominal discomfort, itch, and sleep disturbance secondary to increasing tension associated with existing abdominal scars. An outpatient course of ablative fractional laser resurfacing was initiated in consultation with the dermatology department, resulting in immediate and durable symptom relief and visible abdominal expansion. No complications were observed, and the patient delivered a healthy newborn at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ablative fractional laser resurfacing is a minimally invasive therapeutic alternative for treating pregnant patients with symptoms related to restrictive scarring of the abdomen.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal stress may influence pregnancy and birth outcomes. These effects may be mediated by immune/inflammatory processes. The objective of this study, therefore, is to determine whether self-report measures of maternal stress and related factors, are associated with immune/inflammatory state in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study enrolled participants from 4 geographically- and racially-diverse study sites. Between 12'0- 20'6 weeks gestation participants provided blood for measures of systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein (CRP)) and cell-mediated immunity (Epstein-Barr Virus antibodies (EBV)) and completed 11 validated self-reported measures of stress and stress-related processes. The associations between these self-report measures and biomarkers were evaluated in univariable and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: CRP and EBV levels were obtained in 709 and 712 women, respectively. In univariable analysis the following psychosocial measures were significantly associated with higher CRP: the Abuse Assessment Scale (beta = 0.21 [0.09, 0.32], p < 0.001), Childhood Questionnaire (beta = -0.03 [-0.06, 0], p = 0.02), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (beta = 0.007 [0, 0.01], p-value = 0.009), Social Problems Questionnaire (beta = 0.01 [0, 0.03], p = 0.007), and Sleep Quality Index (beta = 0.04 [0.01, 0.06], p = 0.001). These associations persisted after accounting for race/ethnicity, education, and income, but not after accounting for BMI. Only 1 maternal self report measure, the Abuse Assessment Scale (beta = 28.6 [2.1, 55.0], p = 0.03) was associated with higher EBV. However, after adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, this relationship was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Measures of maternal exposure to stressful circumstances in childhood and during pregnancy are associated with higher CRP, but not EBV. This effect on biomarkers of maternal inflammation may be mediated, in part, by maternal biophysical characteristics such as BMI.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the self-reported prevalence and impact of low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy in primiparous and multiparous women, and their treatment-seeking rationales and experiences, including their use of physiotherapy. METHODS: A sample of 105 post-partum women was recruited. All participants answered a questionnaire; women who experienced LBP during pregnancy (n=71) continue in the study and later they were also interviewed. Content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Reports of LBP were common (n=71; 67.6%) and slightly more frequent in primiparous (n=40; 56.3%) than multiparous (n=31; 43.7%) women. Multiparous women with LBP were significantly older (p< 0.001) and reported more sleep disturbances (p=0.026) than primiparous women with LBP. LBP prevented women performing their daily activities (n=41; 57.7%) and worsened with the advance of pregnancy (n=55; 77.5%), yet 93.0% (n=66) of these women received no treatment. CONCLUSION: LBP is a prevalent and important clinical condition affecting the daily life of many pregnant women. Nevertheless, few women seek any treatment and physiotherapy is rarely considered. Given the significant impact on quality of life, health professionals need to be proactive in asking women about LBP.

N2  - Despite the potential adverse effects of maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) on physiological and behavioral aspects of offspring, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study was intended to investigate the roles of microglia on neurodevelopment and cognition in young offspring rats with prenatal sleep deprivation. Pregnant Wistar rats received 72 h sleep deprivation in the last trimester of gestation, and their prepuberty male offspring were given the intraperitoneal injection with or without minocycline. The results showed the number of Iba1(+) microglia increased, that of hippocampal neurogenesis decreased, and the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were impaired in MSD offspring. The classical microglial activation markers (M1 phenotype) IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, CD68 and iNOS were increased, while the alternative microglial activation markers (M2 phenotype) Arg1, Ym1, IL-4, IL-10 and CD206 were reduced in hippocampus of MSD offspring. After minocycline administration, the MSD offspring showed improvement in MWM behaviors and increase in BrdU(+)/DCX(+) cells. Minocycline reduced Iba1(+) cells, suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and reversed the reduction of M2 microglial markers in the MSD prepuberty offspring. These results indicate that dysregulation in microglial pro- and anti-inflammatory activation is involved in MSD-induced inhibition of neurogenesis and impairment of spatial learning and memory.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Childhood sleep problems have been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, but there is limited knowledge as to the temporal association between sleep problems and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in young children. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether sleep problems in toddlers aged 18 months are related to both concurrent and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in preschool children aged 5 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A large population-based longitudinal study was conducted in September 2014 using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health from June 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008. A total of 32 662 children or pregnancies were included. EXPOSURES: Sleep was assessed by mother-reported child sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Emotional and behavioral problems were measured with items from the Child Behavior Checklist and operationalized according to recommended clinical cutoffs, corresponding to T scores of greater than 65 (93rd percentile). Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using negative binomial regression, controlling for emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months and other relevant covariates. RESULTS: Short sleep duration (≤10 hours) in 556 children (1.7%) and frequent nocturnal awakenings (≥3 times) in 1033 children (3.2%) at 18 months significantly predicted both concurrent and later incidence of emotional and behavioral problems at 5 years. The longitudinal RRs were generally larger for internalizing problems, with adjusted RRs of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23-2.08) for both short sleep duration and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.28-1.93) for nocturnal awakenings; RRs for externalizing problems were 1.77 (95% CI, 1.37-2.30) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.00-1.58), respectively. Additional adjustment for emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months slightly reduced the strength of these associations, and all RRs remained significant in the fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early sleep problems predict later development of emotional and behavioral problems. Intervention studies are needed to examine whether sleep programs targeting early childhood may avert the onset of later adverse outcomes.

N2  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the clinical group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy period. The problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head, poor coordination, low intelligence, especially behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected more commonly have trouble in school going age , are involved in hyper sexual activity, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs. Slow-wave sleep means the deeper sleep during which the brain turns each day's events into permanent memories - is fragmented in adulthood in people exposed to high levels of alcohol in the womb. There is no any specific treatment plan for FASD. Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual to individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone. Psychoactive drugs are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably ADHD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is no treatment for preeclampsia other than delivery. Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, but it is not known whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves perinatal outcomes. CASE: We report a 35-year-old primigravid woman diagnosed with preeclampsia at 30 weeks of gestation. A sleep study confirmed severe sleep-disordered breathing, and CPAP treatment was started. After CPAP treatment, both clinical and biochemical markers of preeclampsia improved. In addition, circulating angiogenic markers of preeclampsia improved. As a result, the pregnancy safely continued for 30 days, allowing the fetus to gain gestation. CONCLUSION: Continuous positive airway pressure may be a novel treatment for women with early-onset preeclampsia associated with sleep-disordered breathing.

N2  - Background: The objective of our study was to determine demographic characteristics, health and sexual behaviors, and psychological health associated with pregnancy ambivalence. We used a cross-sectional design for our study. Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August 2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent females. Results: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger (p=0.03), had fewer children living at home (p<0.01), and were less likely to have been previously pregnant (p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more likely to smoke (p<0.01), sleep poorly (p=0.02), have had more sexual partners in the past month (p<0.01) and in their lifetime (p=0.01), not used contraception at last sex (p=0.01), be a victim of violence (p=0.01), and have experienced pregnancy coercion (p<0.01). In addition, these women exhibited higher scores on scales measuring depressive symptoms (p=0.01) and perceived stress (p<0.01). Conclusions: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive education through contraceptive counseling.

N2  - Extensive research defines the impact of advanced maternal age on couples' fecundity and reproductive outcomes, but significantly less research has been focused on understanding the impact of advanced paternal age. Yet it is increasingly common for couples at advanced ages to conceive children. Limited research suggests that the importance of paternal age is significantly less than that of maternal age, but advanced age of the father is implicated in a variety of conditions affecting the offspring. This review examines three aspects of advanced paternal age: the potential problems with conception and pregnancy that couples with advanced paternal age may encounter, the concept of discussing a limit to paternal age in a clinical setting, and the risks of diseases associated with advanced paternal age. As paternal age increases, it presents no absolute barrier to conception, but it does present greater risks and complications. The current body of knowledge does not justify dissuading older men from trying to initiate a pregnancy, but the medical community must do a better job of communicating to couples the current understanding of the risks of conception with advanced paternal age.

N2  - Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a burdensome sensorimotor disorder that has been linked to diabetes and obesity. However, the relationship of RLS to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common pregnancy complication strongly associated with obesity and a harbinger of diabetes, remains unknown. In this study, we examined the association of RLS to history of GDM in a sample of older female primary care patients. Methods: Participants were community-dwelling women aged ≥ 40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia adult primary care patients. Data gathered included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, reproductive history, sleep patterns, and medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or had missing data on key variables were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 498 participants included in the fi nal analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms at least once/week). After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, body mass index, diabetes and other comorbid conditions, parity, and other factors, those reporting history of GDM were almost three times as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% confi dence interval [CI] = 1.3, 5.3). This association increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS symptoms ≥ 3×/week = 4.8, CI 2.1, 11.2, p for trend = 0.004). Conclusions: History of GDM was strongly and positively related to RLS in this study of older female primary care patients, offering further support for a possible role of metabolic dysregulation in RLS development.

N2  - Uterus circadian rhythms have been implicated in the gestation processes of mammals through entraining of the clock proteins to numerous downstream genes. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), having clock-controlled regulatory sites in their gene promoters, are expressed in the uterus during decidualization, but the regulation of the Bmp gene expression is poorly understood. The present study was designed to dissect the physiological roles of the uterus oscillators in the Bmp expression using the uterus endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) isolated from Per2-dLuc transgenic rats on day 4.5 of gestation. The in vitro decidualization of UESCs was induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate and 2-O-dibutyryl cAMP. A significant decline of Per2-dLuc bioluminescence activity was induced in decidual cells, and concomitantly, the expression of canonical clock genes was downregulated. Conversely, the expression of the core Bmp genes Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp6, and Bmp7 was upregulated. In UESCs transfected with Bmal1-specific siRNA, in which Rev-erbα expression was downregulated, Bmp genes, such as Bmp2, Bmp4, and Bmp6 were upregulated. However, Bmp1, Bmp7, and Bmp8a were not significantly affected by Bmal1 silencing. The expression of all Bmp genes was enhanced after treatment with the REV-ERBα antagonist (SR8278), although their rhythmic profiles were differed from each other. The binding of REV-ERBα to the proximal regions of the Bmp2 and Bmp4 promoters was revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis. Collectively, these results indicate that the Bmp genes are upregulated by the attenuation of the cellular circadian clock; in particular, its core component REV-ERBα functions as a transcriptional silencer in the Bmp gene family.

N2  - Circadian clocks play essential roles in the timing of events in the mammalian hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The molecular oscillator driving these rhythms has been localized to tissues of the HPO axis. It has been suggested that synchrony among these oscillators is a feature of normal reproductive function. The impact of fertility disorders on clock function and the role of the clock in the etiology of endocrine pathology remain unknown. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating fertility disorder, affecting 5%-10% of women at childbearing age with features including a polycystic ovary, anovulation, and elevated serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, marked by hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. It has been suggested that developmental exposure to excess androgen contributes to the etiology of fertility disorders, including PCOS. To better define the role of the timing system in these disorders, we determined the effects of androgen-dependent developmental programming on clock gene expression in tissues of the metabolic and HPO axes. Female PERIOD2::luciferase (PER2::-LUC) mice were exposed to androgen (dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) in utero (Days 16-18 of gestation) or for 9-10 wk (DHT pellet) beginning at weaning (pubertal androgen excess [PAE]). As expected, both groups of androgen-treated mice had disrupted estrous cycles. Analysis of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants revealed that excess androgen produced circadian misalignment via tissue-dependent effects on phase distribution. In vitro treatment with DHT differentially affected the period of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants and granulosa cells, indicating that androgen has direct and tissuespecific effects on clock gene expression that may account for the effects of developmental programming on the timing system.

N2  - Background: Although the WHO recommends that complementary feeding in infants should begin at 6 mo of age, it often begins before this in developed countries. Objective: Our objective was to determine whether lactation consultant (LC) support, with educational resources given at 4-mo postpartum, can delay the introduction of complementary foods until around 6 mo of age. Methods: A total of 802 mother-infant pairs were recruited from the single maternity hospital serving Dunedin, New Zealand (59% response rate) and randomly assigned to the following: 1) usual care (control group); 2) infant sleep education intervention (Sleep); 3) food, activity, and breastfeeding intervention (FAB); or 4) combination (both) intervention (Combo). Certified LCs delivered 3 intervention sessions (late pregnancy and 1-wk and 4-mo postpartum). The 4-mo contact used educational resources focused on developmental readiness for complementary foods. Age when complementary foods were introduced was obtained from repeated interviews (monthly from 3- to 27-wk postpartum). Results: A total of 49.5% and 87.2% of infants received complementary foods before 5 and 6 mo of age, respectively. There was evidence of group differences in the number of infants introduced to complementary foods before 5 mo (P = 0.006), with those receiving support and resources (FAB and Combo groups combined; 55.6%) more likely to wait until at least 5 mo compared with controls (control and Sleep groups combined; 43.3%) (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.16). However, there was no evidence they were more likely to wait until 6 mo of age (P = 0.52). Higher maternal age, higher parity, and a less positive attitude toward breastfeeding were positively associated, and drinking alcohol during pregnancy was negatively associated, with later age of introduction of complementary foods. Conclusions: Providing an LC and educational resources at 4-mo postpartum to predominantly well-educated, mainly European, women can delay the introduction of complementary foods until 5 mo of age, but not until the WHO recommendation of 6 mo.

N2  - Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Adults born preterm have higher blood pressure (BP) than those born at term. Most studies have focused on preterm birth, and few have assessed BP variability, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP, measured by an oscillometric device, in 42 young adults born early preterm (<34 weeks), 72 born late preterm (34-36 weeks), and 103 controls (≥37 weeks). Sleep was confirmed with accelerometry in 72.4% of subjects. The 24-hour systolic BP of adults born early preterm was 5.5 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3), awake systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 2.8-10.1), and sleeping systolic BP was 2.9 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval 0.3-7.5) when adjusted for age, sex, and use of accelerometry. The differences remained similar when adjusted for height, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, parental education, maternal body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus and attenuated slightly when adjusted for maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Adults born early preterm also had higher BP variability as indicated by higher individual standard deviations of systolic BP and diastolic BP. Although our results were consistent with a dose-response relationship between shorter gestation and higher BP, the difference between the late preterm and term groups was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that the higher BP in adults born early preterm is present during both waking and sleeping hours, may be more pronounced during waking hours, and is accompanied by higher individual BP variability.

N2  - Circadian systems express biological rhythms that display an entrainable oscillation of about 24 h. It is set by the intrinsic transcriptional activity of a group of genes called clock genes which are rhythmically expressed in the brain, at the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues like lung and liver. At the cellular level, these rhythms are controlled by transcriptional feedback loops that produce oscillations in gene expression. We asked whether adverse experiences like perinatal malnutrition affect the expression of clock genes leading changes in circadian regulation in mice. CF1 dams were fed a normal protein diet (NP) with 20% of protein or low protein diet (LP) with 8% of protein during pregnancy and lactation, and the male offspring was analyzed. We hypothesize that perinatal malnourished may also modulate the SCN activity in mice. We observed that Bmal1, Per1 and Per2 expression, oscillating genes in SCN, were phase delayed (NP vs LP). Moreover, Creb1, a key gene in cognition and memory was also delayed. Therefore, these results imply that the effects of fetal environment on adult health would include alterations in the function of the systems governing the control and regulation of circadian rhythms in behavior and metabolism. These findings show that perinatal stress like protein restriction has an important role on regulation of gen expression of the clock system.

N2  - Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women's movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women's health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women's health and birthing practices, doctor-patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy is a major life event in a woman's life. Still some women may avoid it due to pathological fear of childbirth- Tokophobia. This fear can be primary in nulliparous women or secondary. We are presenting a case of a young married woman who was being treated as a case of depression for 2 years, who on further exploration turned out to be a case of secondary Tokophobia. Patient had a traumatic instrumental first delivery with perineal tears, post which she started experiencing disturbed sleep, sadness of mood, decreased interaction with family members, reduced appetite and some anxiety symptoms. Patient used to appear a little restless but could take care of her child. Patient started dreading childbirth but could not share with anyone considering sociocultural limitations. Patient started avoiding getting pregnant by using contraceptives and even avoided sexual activity sometimes. She also got a medical termination of pregnancy after an accidental delivery. After second such pregnancy patient worsened and came to AIIMS, wherein on detailed evaluation she reported her intense fear of childbirth and her avoidance of pregnancy due to that. She also expressed a strong preference for caesarean section in this pregnancy. She also reported difficulty in bonding with her baby after first delivery and her anticipated fears from this pregnancy. Patient also had moderate depressive features. With low dose Sertraline and psychotherapy addressing her fears patient started improving. Plan to involve her obstetrician for prenatal and antenatal education for holistic management has been done. Many females may have Tokophobia that may masquerade as anxiety, depression insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder and thus remain untreated like in this case. A close liaison with obstetrics may help identify and alleviate distress of many women suffering from Tokophobia that is a multidisciplinary problem.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether depressive symptoms predict anxiety and stress or whether anxiety and stress precede depressive symptoms in fathers during the antenatal period. Background: The findings of previous studies suggest that there is an association between paternal depression, anxiety and stress during the antenatal period. However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated. Method: Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks’ gestation. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner’s depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers. Conclusion: Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety.

N2  - Objectives: Women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Why only some women are affected by CVD after severe preeclampsia is not known. The objective of this study was to examine the presence of CVD among women after severe preeclampsia, and illuminate any differences between the women with present CVD and women without CVD. Methods: Women admitted to Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden with the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (O141 A, B, C and X) in 1999-2001 were invited to participate. Out of 60 women where the diagnosis was correct, 36 women agreed to participate. Blood pressure, lipids waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) were registered. Participants filled in a form concerning family history, diseases, tobacco, reproduction, physical activity, sleeping patterns, weight change, and marital stress. Family history of CVD was defined as having one first degree relative with stroke, myocardial infarct, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes type 2 before the age of 55 (men) and 65 (women). Stress in relation was measured with Stockholm Marital Stress Scale (SMSS) and sleep with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Results: Ten women were already affected by CVD and 26 were not. Affected women had significantly higher systolic (p = 0.001) and diastolic (p = 0.001) blood pressure (in spite of medication), BMI (p = 0.022) and waist circumference (p = 0.003) as well as higher levels of apoB (p = 0.017) and lower levels of apoA1 (p = 0.015). A difference was also seen in family history of CVD, number of preeclamptic pregnancies, sleep and marital stress but results were not significantly different in this small pilot study. Conclusions: Constitutional differences when becoming pregnant, number of preeclamptic episodes, obesity, as well as lifestyle may all influence the risk for later CVD.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of childbearing with a 13% prevalence rate. Sleep disturbances are also common, particularly during early postpartum. In theory, l-tryptophan could improve sleep and reduce depressed mood in early postpartum; however, the first step in clinical development of tryptophan for use in postpartum is to measure the effect of oral l-tryptophan on its concentrations in breast milk, which is presently unknown.The aims were to investigate the effect of oral l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin, a protein with high tryptophan concentration, on total and free tryptophan levels in breast milk and plasma, and to compare free tryptophan levels in breast milk with those in common infant formulas.Thirty healthy breastfeeding women were randomly allocated to receive 2. g or 4. g of l-tryptophan, or, 20. g or 40. g of alpha-lactalbumin or no supplement. Free tryptophan levels were also measured in 12 different infant formulas.Total tryptophan in breast milk was unaffected by oral administration of l-tryptophan or alpha-lactalbumin (repeated measures of ANOVA (rANOVA), group effect: p=0.93). Both l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin were associated with greater free tryptophan levels in breast milk (rANOVA, group effect: p<0.001) (representing 2% of total tryptophan), but these concentrations were within the range of commonly used infant formulas.In contrast to most sleep inducing medications, l-tryptophan does not affect its total concentration in breast milk. These results support further investigation of dietary l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin as part of a dietary supplementation approach to address sleep disturbances in postpartum and reduce risk of PPD.

N2  - Pregnancy is accompanied by several haemodynamic, biochemical and haematological changes, which may lead to severe problems, if they are not suitably addressed. The current study highlights the haematological and biochemical differences observed in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP), in the 2nd trimester, in a north Indian population. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the body weight and body temperature of NAP compared with AP. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in haematological parameters including haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, MCH and MCHC, was observed in AP; however, MCV was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.038). Many biochemical parameters viz. potassium, albumin, total protein and calcium levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in AP, except alkaline phosphatase whose level was found significantly increased (p < 0.01). The findings of the study suggest that haematological and biochemical changes take place in anaemia during pregnancy. Further, the results obtained should be used for establishing normative values for similar populations.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the risk and protective factors related to premature ovarian failure (POF). Methods: A total of 168 patients with POF in Funing County Hospital of TCM were selected as POF group, and another 42 POF-free patients served as control group at the same term. The patients in both groups were inquired in details by investigators in the form of questionnaire, and the relevant risk questionnaires for POF and A-type behavior scale were filled. The risk and protective factors related to POF were analyzed after database was established via input of qualified raw data into 2007 Excel Table. Results: The incidence of POF in patients at the age of 35-40 was dramatically higher than those at the age of 17-24, 25-29 and 30-34, and there existed statistical significance (P < 0.01). No significant difference was presented between two groups in terms of age of menarche, menstrual cycle, menstrual period, dysmenorrhea and active smoking (P > 0.05), but there was statistical significance by comparison to gravidity, times of artificial abortion, history of mumps, history of ovarian surgery, passive smoking, physical exercise, intake of bean products, sleep quality, A-type character and self-felt much stress (P < 0.05). Multi-factor Logistic regression analysis further revealed that artificial abortion, history of mumps, passive smoking, poor sleep quality and A-type character were all independent risk factors for POF (OR=5.555, 3.906, 4.031, 3.723, 5.912), and physical exercise belonged to the protective factor for POF (OR=0.102). Conclusion: Artificial abortion, history of mumps, passive smoking, poor sleep quality and A-type character pertain to risk factors for POF, and physical exercise to the protective factor for POF.

N2  - Women with epilepsy are exposed to social stigma, and they have anxiety and lose self-confidence in their social role as a woman. Psychiatrists, especially female psychiatrists, are able to support them. Important considerations are: 1) Pre-pregnant counseling; Physicians give appropriate advice and guidance. We need to provide the latest information on the teratogenicity of AEDs, and replace them with a safer combination of AEDs BEFORE pregnancy. Folate supplementation is also recommended. 2) Management during pregnancy: Patients are advised to adhere to taking AEDs as instructed, which prevents not only seizures during pregnancy but also reduces the risk of miscarriage and premature delivery. Doses of AED are to be increased after the second trimester. 3) Collaborating with obstetricians at delivery: Obstetricians are also nervous when faced with women with epilepsy. Basically, patients can deliver spontaneously, and the correct way to deal with unexpected seizures during labor should be fully understood. 4) Parental care: women with epilepsy can breastfeed. Physicians advise other family members on how to bottle feed at night to help mothers avoid a lack of sleep due to breastfeeding. Childcare is one of the most precious experiences in life. Patients with epilepsy, especially women, have a lower self-esteem; however, once they experience delivery, they act positively and become even-tempered. Physicians should be aware that childcare fosters a profound insight into their lives, allowing them to mature as a person.

N2  - Objectives: Blunted nocturnal dip of blood pressure (BP) and reversed circadian rhythm have been described in preeclampsia (PE). Non-dipper status and preeclampsia are both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Complete recovery of BP in PE is reported to occur over a variable period of time. Twentyfour hours-ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the post-partum follow-up after a PE has not been described. The aim of this study was to assess 24 h-ambulatory blood pressure pattern after a PE and to determine the prevalence of non-dipper status, nocturnal hypertension, white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. Methods: This is an observational, prospective study on women who suffered from a preeclampsia. A 24 h-ABPM was done 6 weeks post-partum at the Hypertension Unit of the University Hospitals of Geneva, concomitantly with a clinical and biological evaluation. Results: Forty-five women were included in a preliminary analysis. Mean age was 33 ± 6 years, 57.3% were Caucasian, mean BMI before pregnancy was 24 ± 5 kg/m2. Office and ambulatory BP are shown in Table 1. Prevalence of nocturnal hypertension was high and half of the women had no nocturnal dipping. The diagnosis of hypertension based on office BP was discordant with the diagnosis based on ABPM in 25% of women. Conclusions: The prevalence of increased nighttime BP and abnormal BP pattern is high at 6 weeks post-partum in preeclamptic women. Early assessment of BP with ABPM after preeclampsia allows an early identification of women with persistent circadian abnormalities who might be at increased risk. It also provides a more accurate assessment than office BP. (Table presented) .

N2  - The central alveolar hypoventilation of Ondine's curse is a disorder characterized by absent or diminished ventilatory response to hypercapnia, hypoxia or both, with parallel decrease in saturation to 50%. The secondary form may begin mainly after insult that affects the brain stem. We present a case of a 24-years old primipara in the 41st gestational week with an uncomplicated course of pregnancy and with secondary non-obstructive sleeping hypoventilation which occurred after eclamptic seizure. This obstetric case provides evidence for the benefit of home BiPAP use for patients with secondary Ondine's curse.

N2  - During fetal development, different control systems mediated by the autonomic nervous system form functional connections over a wide range of time scales. Using multiscale multifractal analysis (MMA) of fetal heart rate variability (HRV), we describe fundamental relationships in the developing scale-wide adjustments within fetal behavior states as well as across state changes.MMA yields the local Hurst exponent surface h(q,s) with q as the multifractal parameter and s as the scale. In 30-minute recordings of healthy fetuses between 24 and 36. weeks of gestation (n. =. 25 in quiet sleep, n. =. 29 in active sleep, n. =. 30 changing sleep state) we investigated the dependency of h(q,s) on gestation age.In univariate models, we found a decreasing persistence for short scales and small amplitudes in the quiet (s<inf>1</inf>=39, q<inf>1</inf>=-0.7, R<sup>2</sup>=0.52) and in the active (s<inf>1</inf>=69, q<inf>1</inf>=-1.4, R<sup>2</sup>=0.23) sleep in contrast to an increasing persistency for long scales and large amplitudes (s<inf>1</inf>=147, q<inf>1</inf>=2.4, R<sup>2</sup>=0.29) in the mixed state. Bivariate models (additional scales considered) presented increased coefficients of determination R<sup>2</sup>=0.56, 0.4, and 0.43, respectively. Persistency increasing with age in connection with the sleep state changes (independent of the age related short range dependencies within the separate homogeneous sleep states) is reported here for the first time. The MMA indices obtained for the fetal HRV represent characteristics of the maturating scale-wide cardiovascular control in the context of the evolving sleep state dynamics, which have so far not been considered. They should be incorporated in the search for HRV indices for prenatal diagnosis of developmental disorders and risk assessment.

N2  - Background: Many modifiable risk factors in early infancy have been shown to be associated with childhood overweight and obesity. These risk factors have not been studied within children of South Asian origin in the UK. The aims of this paper are to describe differences in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors for childhood obesity between children of White British and Pakistani origin and investigate the association between these risk factors and childhood BMI measured at age 3 years. We used data from a sub-study of the Born in Bradford birth cohort with detailed follow-up visits throughout early childhood. 987 participants with a BMI measurement at age 3 were included; 39% were White British, 48% were of Pakistani origin and 13% were of other ethnicities. Linear and Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between risk factors and two outcomes at age 3; BMI z-scores and child overweight. Results: Compared to Pakistani mothers, White British mothers were more likely to smoke during pregnancy, have higher BMI, breastfeed for a shorter duration and wean earlier, while Pakistani mothers had higher rates of gestational diabetes and were less active. There was no strong evidence that the relationship between risk factors and BMI z-score differed by ethnicity. There were associations between BMI z-score and maternal smoking (mean difference in BMI z-score 0.33 (95% CI 0.13, 0.53)), maternal obesity (0.37 (0.19, 0.55)), indulgent feeding style (0.15 (-0.06, 0.36)), lower parental warmth scores (0.21 (0.05, 0.36)) and higher parental hostility scores (0.17 (0.01, 0.33)). Consistent associations between these risk factors and child overweight were found. Mean BMI and the relative risk of being overweight were lower in children of mothers with lower parental self-efficacy scores and who watched more hours of TV. Other risk factors (gestational diabetes, child diet, child sleep, child TV viewing and maternal physical activity) were not associated with BMI. Conclusions: Whilst the prevalence of risk factors that have been associated with childhood greater BMI differ between White British and Pakistani the magnitude of their associations with BMI are similar in the two groups.

N2  - Background: The prolactin concentration displays diurnal-nocturnal biorhythm i.e. it shows a decrease during the course of the day and increase during sleep with maximal value in the early morning hours. The aim of this study was to determine percentage of decrease in prolactin values and the time of reaching waking-baseline levels. Materials and methods: The study enrolled 31 healthy subjects (25 women and 6 men). Samples were drawn at 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 and 11:00 hours after 15 minutes of resting period. Prolactin had been determined by electrochemiluminiscence method performed on Cobas e601 (Roche Diagnostics). Expected values (2.5-97.5th percentiles) with this method for non-pregnant women and men are 102-496 mIU/L and 86-324 mIU/L respectively. Results: In 11 of 31 subjects (35.5%) we found prolactin levels above upper normal limit at 7:00. All of those subjects were found to have normal prolactin levels at later sampling times. Mean values at 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 and 11:00 for women were 485 (171-1346), 300 (115-627), 194 (85- 379) and 188 (89-369) respectively. Mean values at 7:00, 8:00 and 9:00 for men were 338 (172-1009), 127 (85-187) and 101 (65-130) respectively. Percentage of decrease in individually prolactin values 7/8h and 7/9h for women were 43.1% and 56.2% respectively. Percentage of decrease in individually prolactin values 7/8h and 7/9h for men were 54.1% and 53.9% respectively. Difference between mean value at 9:00 (194) and 11:00 (188) was not significant. Conclusions: Regarding the significant decrease in prolactin levels in samples drawn at 8:00, 9:00 and 11:00 and the fact that waking-baseline levels are mostly only reached 1-2 h after waking, the blood collection should be carried out 3-4 h after waking, i.e. between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.

N2  - Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) can severely affect quality of life and disturb sleep, so that pharmacological treatment is necessary, especially for elderly patients. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole or the rotigotine transdermal patch, all approved in most countries) or α-2-δ ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, approved in the USA and Japan), depending on the country and availability. Where approved, opioids (prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone, approved in Europe) are also recommended as a second-line therapy for severe RLS. Several iron formulations can be effective but are not yet approved for RLS therapy, whereas benzodiazepines and other anticonvulsants are not recommended or approved. Less is known about effective management of RLS that is associated with other conditions, such as uraemia or pregnancy. Furthermore, very little data are available on the management of RLS when first-line treatment fails or patients experience augmentation. In this Review, we summarize state-of-The-Art therapies for RLS in the context of the diagnostic criteria and available guidelines, based on knowledge ranging from Class I evidence for the treatment of idiopathic RLS to Class IV evidence for the treatment of complications such as augmentation. We consider therapies, including combination therapies, that are used in clinical practice for long-Term management of RLS, despite a lack of trials and approval, and highlight the need for practical long-Term evaluation of current trials.

N2  - Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases remain the first cause of death in women. To improve women's health cardiologists and gynaecologists should work together on women's specific cardiovascular risk factor. Method: Our study evaluated a care pathway named "heart, arteries and women". One hundred and ninety-one women were included for vascular (n= 55) or hypertensive (n= 136) explorations from January the first to December the 31st of 2013. We studied their clinical presentation and medical management. Results: All women were at high cardiovascular risk (38% of them at very high risk). The average age was 52 years old. A woman on three had experienced high blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy. One on two was postmenopausal woman. We stopped twelve estrogen-progesterone contraceptions; 60% didn't have gynaecological follow-up; 146 had high blood pressures (73% at night, 50% had no dipping blood pressure profile and 15 were newly diagnosed for hypertension). Sleep apnoea syndrome was suspected in half women. Medical therapies were optimized especially for women with atheroma in which 30 to 46% were properly treated (. P=. 0.0005). Only 18% of the gynecologists received conclusive reports. Conclusion: At one year, our care pathway "heart, arteries and women" allowed to optimize medical therapy and clinical management. Everyone should be aware of this program.

N2  - Objectives To assess the effect of prone sleeping, the major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome, in the control of blood pressure (BP) in preterm infants born across a range of gestational ages. Study design Daytime polysomnography was performed at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months, and 5-6 months postterm age. The participants were 21 very preterm (mean gestation 29.4 ± 0.3 weeks), 14 preterm (mean gestation 33.1 ± 0.3 weeks), and 17 term (mean gestation 40.1 ± 0.3 weeks). BP was measured via a Finometer cuff (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) placed around the wrist. Data were recorded both supine and prone. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated via cross-spectral analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in BP. Results BRS was lower in the prone position in very preterm infants at 2-4 weeks in active sleep (P <.05). Maturation of BRS was delayed in very preterm compared with both preterm and term infants. Conclusions Maturation of BRS after term-equivalent age is altered in very preterm infants. Reduced BRS may result in an impaired ability of very preterm infants to respond to cardiovascular stress during infancy and may predispose them to cardiovascular disease later in life.

N2  - Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone) are the most frequent group of epilepsies with onset during adolescence and constitute 15 to 20% of all epilepsies. These syndromes have overlapping clinical features and genetic origins as well as similar electroencephalographic findings. There are primarily three seizure types that occur with these epilepsy syndromes: generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and myoclonic seizures. Standard neurologic examination and neuroimaging studies do not generally reveal any abnormality. Potential precipitating factors are many, including sleep deprivation, fatigue, alcohol use, photic stimulation, and menstruation. The characteristic electroencephalographic abnormality consists of diffuse, bilateral, symmetric, and synchronous 4 to 6 Hz polyspike and wave complexes. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies are generally associated with low mortality and typically respond well to treatment. The most effective antiepileptic drug for these disorders is sodium valproate, but it should be used with caution in adolescent females who are of childbearing age. Levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, and zonisamide can also be used as effective monotherapy. Carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, and vigabatrin may exacerbate myoclonic and absence seizures in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

N2  - The term Hydrotherapy refers to a process which uses water at any temperature or forms to relieve pain and treat illness. This review describes about various conditions of water treatments. Hydrotherapy may help treat various conditions, including arthritis, stomach issues, sleep disorders, stress and depression. The theory behind hydrotherapy is that water has healing properties that can relieve various ailments and conditions. In its different forms-ice, liquid, and steam-water is a versatile treatment method. Water cure therapies includes enema therapy, gel therapy etc, which includes colonic hydrotropy, sitz bath, hydro-massage, wraps and compress methods. Recently we have a number of hydrotherapy treatments available which includes personal infrared sauna rooms and peat bath rooms. These are useful in pregnancy, heart or lung conditions, diabetes, neuropathy, high fever, acute headache, surgical implants, seizure disorders etc. Cryotherapy, cold water immersion or ice bath is a new form of hydrotherapy used by physical therapists, sports medicine facilities and rehab clinics.

N2  - Rationale: Isodicentric chromosome [idic(15)] is a rare chromosomal abnormality that occurs due to inverted duplication of chromosome 15q. It is associated with many clinical findings including early central hypotonia, developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, autistic behavior and epilepsy. We report a case of Idic(15) and characterstic Electroencephalogram [EEG] findings which can allow for early diagnosis. Methods: Retrospective chart review and literature search utilizing Pubmed and Medline. Results: We report a case of a 17 year old girl with Idic(15) who was referred for her refractory epilepsy, global developmental delay and autistic behavior. She was born at term by normal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy. There was no significant past and family medical history. Initial metabolic evaluation was normal. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed prominent ventricles and sulci with periventricular leukomalacia. A Positron Emission Tomography of brain was normal. Genetic analysis showed inverted duplication of Chromosome 15q. She had recurrent seizures from the age of 7 years and of varying types including asymmetric tonic, atonic, focal, and generalized tonic-clonic that were refractory to Valproic acid, Lamotrigine and Rufinamide. Multiple routine Electroencephalogram recordings were consistent with symptomatic generalized epilepsy with interictal findings of slow background activity with multifocal sharp waves of variable hemispheric predominance and paucity of sleep spindles and K-complexes in sleep. In addition, excessive diffuse 13-30 Hz beta activity was noted. Long-term video monitoring showed similar interictal characteristics with excessive beta activity. Clinical seizures correlated with ictal EEG findings, consisting of 9-14 Hz bilateral frontally-dominant high amplitude sharp wave discharges lasting 5-10 seconds, at times followed by diffuse 1.5-3 Hz delta slowing. Conclusions: 63% of the patients with Idic(15) have seizures and 81% have multiple seizure types. Diagnosis is typically dependent on Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). The Electroencephalogram in this patient showed features of generalized epilepsy, however a specific pattern of interictal and ictal abnormalities can distinguish this syndrome from other symptomatic epilepsies. In our patient we identified excessive 13-30 Hz beta activity interictally despite the lack of common causative agents. The excessive diffuse beta activity and ictal 9 -14 Hz frontally-dominant high amplitude sharp wave discharges seen on this patient's EEG are pathognomonic and consistent with similar EEG findings that have been reported in earlier published studies (Urraca et al. 2014 and Thibert et al, MGH dup15q center). Awareness of such EEG characteristics may aid in timely recognition and diagnosis of Idic(15) syndrome, and also lead to more appropriate early treatment of epilepsy in this patient population.

N2  - Rationale: Much is still unknown about underlying aetiologies, risk factors and clinical characteristics of childhood epilepsy. Population-based, prospective epilepsy cohorts with suitable controls can provide a valuable resource for identification of causes, phenotypes, and clinical and developmental trajectories. Methods: EPYC is a sub-study of The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa), a nationwide child cohort study. MoBa includes 114 500 children and their parents, who have been prospectively followed through questionnaires and registry linkages since pregnancy. The children were born from 1999-2009 (current age range 4-14 years, mean 8 years). Blood samples were obtained from both parents during pregnancy and from the mother and child (cord blood) immediately after birth. In EPYC, children with potential epilepsy are being identified through: (1) positive answers in MoBa questionnaires about children ever having epilepsy or (2) a diagnosis of epilepsy (ICD-10 G40∗) in the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR). The NPR collects data on all diagnoses assigned by Norwegian specialist health services (in- and outpatient) (Figure 1). All potential cases are being validated and classified according to seizure types, aetiology, and epilepsy type by two paediatric neurologists. The conclusions are based on medical record reviews, clinical telephone interviews, and specialist reviews of EEGs and MRIs (Figure 1). Differences in opinion are resolved through consensus discussions. Results: 895 children with possible epilepsy diagnoses have been identified. 554 of 895 (62%) potential cases have been validated, of whom 379 (68%) met the criteria for an epilepsy diagnosis. There were substantial differences between counties in the proportion who met the criteria (38%-94%, median 72%). Among the 379 children with epilepsy, 212 (56%) had a focal type of epilepsy, 115 (30%) had a generalised type of epilepsy, and 52 (14%) had epilepsies not classifiable as focal or generalised. Aetiology of the epilepsy was known in 118 (31%) of the children, and unknown (including idiopathic and cryptogenic) in 261 (69%). Among the 175 children incorrectly coded as having epilepsy, most had a single EEG as part of investigations for developmental disorders such as learning disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorder (21%); febrile seizures (15%); sleep disturbances (6%); spells, syncope or other potential symptoms of epilepsy (38%); or other medical/behavioural problems (20%). Conclusions: Routine administrative data can provide a useful resource for studying childhood epilepsy. However, regional variations in the accuracy of such data occur. Validation of all suspected cases is ideally needed rather than none, or a subset, as has been done in other studies. Despite advances in neuroimaging, genetics, biochemistry and immunology, the cause of epilepsy is unknown in the majority of cases. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Agonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) induce a reversible hypoestrogenic state through the down-regulation of LHRH receptors and desensitization of the pituitary. Since endometrial implants are estrogen sensitive, LHRH agonists have frequently been used for medical treatment of endometriosis. Nowadays, LHRH agonists can be considered in general as a second-line medical treatment for endometriosis-related symptoms, as oral therapy with dienogest is as effective and has fewer side effects. However, therapy with LHRH agonists for 3-6 months prior to in vitro fertilization remains the treatment of choice in patients with endometriosis, as it significantly increases pregnancy rates. LHRH agonists are used prior to surgery and as an adjuvant after an operation to prevent recurrence or prolong disease-free intervals. Adverse effects of LHRH agonists are due to hypoestrogenism and include hot flushes, vaginal dryness, loss of libido, sleep disturbances and a diminished bone density which limits the duration of their administration to 6 months. For long-term treatment, add-back of estrogen and/or progestin,/or progestin only with or without bisphosphonates, can be used, but existing studies only cover a 12-month period of treatment. LHRH antagonists competitively block the pituitary receptors for LHRH. Consequently, a partial pharmacological hypophysectomy with a reduction of the estrogen levels to a desired level is possible if LHRH antagonists are adequately dosed. As endometriotic implants require relatively high levels of estrogen, partially lower plasma levels of estrogens are sufficient to prevent the loss of bone density. A long-term treatment without add-back therapy is also possible.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Sleep problems (SPs), mainly insomnia, occur in up to 80% of children with neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs). We observed that children/adolescents with NDCs and SPs often experience sensory processing abnormalities (SPAs), the inability to integrate and respond to sensory stimuli appropriately. The specific aim of this study was to investigate presentations and interconnections between Willis Ekbom Disease (WED), the most frequent neurologic cause of insomnia, and SPAs in children/ adolescents with NDCs. Methods Used: 28 eligible children/adolescents with NDCs and insomnia due to familial WED (mothers had symptoms of WED and/or iron deficiency during pregnancy) were assessed. Clinical presentations and symptoms were (a) captured in reports that utilized the concept of therapeutic emplotment and (b) recorded retrospectively in a clinical phenotyping database. A case report of a 10-year old representative patient framed and highlighted our hypothesis from a clinical perspective. Summary of Results: 100% of the children in the cohort presented with WED, insomnia and SPAs. When stratified based on the type of SPA, 96% of patients had tactile sensitivity (including high pain tolerance), 21% auditory, 21% visual, and 21% oral sensitivity. The case analysis of the 10-year old male patient with WED and NDCs supported the database findings; he scored 135/190 on the Sensory Profile, experiencing difficulties with touch, textures, loud noises, bright lights, and taste. Conclusions: This is the first description of SPAs in a group of children with mixed NDCs and insomnia due to familial WED. We suggest that SPAs may serve as useful 'behavioural observations' indicating that a child should be investigated for WED. Future studies need to focus on further elucidating the interconnections between SPAs and WED, and looking into sensory-based treatments to address sleep in children with NDCs.

N2  - Rationale: Spike-wave discharges have been reported in rodents without epilepsy and also in animal models of epilepsy. To determine whether the discharges in normal animals are similar or different from those in epileptic animals, we examined animals with spike-wave discharges before and after induction of epilepsy. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, s.c.) or kainic acid (12 mg/kg, s.c.) at 2-3 months of age to induce status epilepticus (SE). Pentobarbital (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to decrease the severity of SE. After 4 weeks, animals were implanted with 4 subdural frontal and occipital screws and 2 twisted bipolar depth electrodes in each dorsal hippocampus. A subdural screw over the cerebellum at the midline served as reference and a screw over the left olfactory bulb was ground. After 1-2 weeks they were recorded in their home cage using digital telemetry (Pinnacle Technologies) with a commutator to permit free movement. Animals were recorded during periods of spontaneous exploration, grooming, feeding, behavioral arrest, and sleep. Animals that had SE were also recorded during spontaneous seizures, which were typically convulsive. Females were also studied during pregnancy, because pilot studies showed that spike-wave discharges often increase in duration at this time. Results: Spike-wave discharges were observed in a subset of control female rats as previously described. The discharges were similar in behavioral associations (frozen behavior) and other characteristics (e.g., frequency) before and after SE. Animals that had SE and exhibited convulsive seizures did not show spike-wave discharges during the seizure. However, when interictal spikes occurred, they often initiated spike-wave discharge. During pregnancy, spike-wave discharges fluctuated greatly in duration, sometimes occuring for minutes. During this time, animals exhibited the typical frozen stance that accompanies spike-wave discharges under other conditions. Conclusions: Spike-wave discharges in female rats are present before and after induction of SE. Convulsive seizures were readily distinguished from spike-wave discharges in their EEG characteristics. However, interictal epileptiform discharges were sometimes associated with spike-wave discharges. In pregnancy, spike-wave discharges lengthened, suggesting that a long duration of spike-wave discharge is not necessarily a characteristic of epilepsy. The results provide additional insight to guide investigators interested in animal models that simulate temporal lobe epilepsy and absence epilepsy.

N2  - The rhythmic expression of clock genes in the uterus is attenuated during decidualization. This study focused on Ptgs2, which is essential for decidualization, as a putative clock-controlled gene, and aimed to reveal the functions of clock genes in relation to Ptgs2 during decidualization. We compared the transcript levels of clock genes in the rat uterus on days 4.5 (D4.5) and 6.5 of pregnancy. The transcript levels of clock genes (Per2, Bmal1, Rorα, and Rev-erbα) had decreased at implantation sites on day 6.5 (D6.5e) compared with those on D4.5, whereas Ptgs2 transcripts had increased on D6.5e. Similar observations of Rev-erbα and Ptgs2 were also obtained in the endometrium on D6.5e by immunohistochemistry. In the decidual cells induced by medroxyprogesterone and 2-O-dibutyryl-cAMP, the rhythmic expression levels of clock genes were attenuated, whereas Ptgs2 transcription was induced. These results indicate that decidualization causes the attenuation of clock genes and the induction of Ptgs 2. Furthermore, in the experiment of Bmal1 siRNA, the rhythmic expression of clock genes and Ptgs2 was attenuated by the siRNA. Transcript levels of Ptgs2 and prostaglandin (PG)E<inf>2</inf> production were increased by treatment with the Rev-erbα antagonist, suggesting the contribution of the nuclear receptor Rev-erbα to Ptgs2 expression. Moreover, Rev-erbα knockdown enhanced the induction of Ptgs2 transcription and PGE<inf>2</inf> production by forskolin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis revealed that Rev-erbα could directly bind to a proximal RORE site of Ptgs2. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the attenuation of the circadian clock, especially its core component Rev-erbα, contributes to the induction of Ptgs2 during decidualization.

N2  - Mother's voice seems to have an important role in neurological development of the fetus and the newborn. Numerous studies have shown that the fetus perceives sounds and reacts to them since 26th-28th week of gestation and that he has the ability to discriminate between the maternal voice and other voices, showing a marked preference to the first [1,2]. The fetus within the uterus is in a sound environment, called "noise floor", resulting from the combination of "internal noise", such as the sound of maternal heartbeat, breathing and gastrointestinal activity, and "external noise", principally the mother's voice. Premature birth abruptly stops prenatal learning experiences and it causes a sudden transition from the quiet and lovely environment of the maternal womb, towards the noisy world of the NICU, often hostile and aggressive [3]. During the months in NICU, the baby is deprived of the biological maternal sounds and this could interfere with his neurodevelopment, in particular speech and language acquisition. The Developmental Care programs aim to provide an extra-uterine environment similar to the maternal womb: control of light, noise, pain, postural care, kangaroo mother care are examples. Few studies addressed the beneficial effects of the early exposure to the mother's voice and recently some researches have shown that this sound can increase cardiorespiratory stability and growth, improve deep sleep, and shorten length of hospital stay [4-8]. In 2013 Loewy [9], using several acoustic stimuli, has shown that exposure to "intrauterine" stimuli and in particular to the mother's voice, meant an increased attention span and alertness, associated with a marked reduction in heart rate, increased stability of behavioral states and sleep quality and improved nutritional behavior and caloric intake. Chorna et al. [10], using mother's voice played through a Pacifier-Activated Music player (PAM) during non-nutritive sucking, have demonstrated an improvement of the development of sucking ability and oral feeding skills in preterm infants. Finally Picciolini et al. [3] have shown that early exposure to maternal voice, administered by bone conduction, according Tomatis' method, exerts a beneficial effect on preterm infants autonomic system and neurobehavioral development. They have found a better neurofunctional assessment score at 3 months of corrected age vs a control group. In conclusion, studies show encouraging results about mother's voice ability to promote optimal neurological development of preterm babies. We are studying the effects of the voice on mother-child attachment and its correlations with neurodevelopment outcomes.

N2  - Background: The impact of growth restriction on perinatal morbidity is well known, but electroencephalographic (EEG) data on its influence are still scarce. Objectives: We aimed to analyze the influence of being born small for gestational age (SGA; defined as a birth weight <10th percentile) on the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) score in the first 2 weeks of life in preterm infants born before 30 weeks of gestation, and its impact on later outcome. Methods: aEEG data obtained within the first 2 weeks of life on preterm infants born SGA and before 30 weeks of gestational age (GA) were analyzed retrospectively using a combined score [including background activity, occurrence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC) and suspected seizure activity]. Neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated at 24 months by means of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and a standardized neurological examination. Results: One hundred and thirty-six patients were included (47 SGA and 89 controls). Infants with SGA had abnormal aEEG scores significantly more often (57 vs. 24%, p = 0.002) than infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). They also displayed SWC less frequently (65 vs. 96%, p = 0.001), were more likely to develop seizure activity (15 vs. 4%, p = 0.013) and had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at the age of 2 years less frequently (36.2 vs. 59.6%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Preterm infants born SGA and before 30 weeks of GA had less optimal scores on early aEEG and a poorer neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months than the AGA controls.

N2  - Objective To investigate whether the expression patterns of periphery clock genes were influenced by menstrual cycle in a monkey model. Study design In this preliminary study, the expression patterns of four clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1 and Per2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 6 female Macaca fascicularis in menstrual, late follicular and mid luteal phases of menstrual cycle were determined by qrt-PCR. Results Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA levels were found to exhibit significant diurnal rhythms in all phases of the menstrual cycle. The expression of Cry1 mRNA was statistically rhythmic in late follicular and mid luteal phases. A main effect of menstrual cycle existed on the rhythms of Bmal1, Cry1 and Per2 expression, but not Clock expression. No significant differences were detected between menstrual phase and late follicular phase in all clock genes. Significant differences were found on the expression of Bmal1, Cry1 or Per2 mRNA between late follicular phase and mid luteal phase, when no difference existed in estrogen level, indicating the role of progesterone on biological clock gene expression. Furthermore, the peak of Bmal1 mRNA level slightly advanced in mid luteal phase compared with that in menstrual and late follicular phases. Conclusion The expression patterns of clock genes in PBMCs were influenced by menstrual cycle, potentially by the change of progesterone levels, and this effect maybe correlated with early pregnancy.

N2  - Background Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasingly believed to originate from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current reviews exploring the neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an inadequate proxy. Objective We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood. Search strategy Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published after 1970. Selection criteria The analysis included studies that identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years of age. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted for cognitive, behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were summarised separately for children born at <35 and ≥35 weeks gestation. Main results Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR children born ≥35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born <35 weeks of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone. Conclusions IUGR increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected. Tweetable abstract IUGR is associated with an overall risk for neurodevelopmental delay in a range of neurodevelopmental domains.

N2  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named "mixed)", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

N2  - Background and objective Non-invasive techniques for measuring lung mechanics in infants are needed for a better understanding of lung growth and function, and to study the effects of prenatal factors on subsequent lung growth in healthy infants. The forced oscillation technique requires minimal cooperation from the individual but has rarely been used in infants. The study aims to assess the use of the forced oscillation technique to measure the influence of antenatal exposures on respiratory mechanics in unsedated infants enrolled in a birth cohort study in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods Healthy term infants were studied at 6-10 weeks of age using the forced oscillation technique. Respiratory impedance was measured in the frequency range 8-48 Hz via a face mask during natural sleep. Respiratory system resistance, compliance and inertance were calculated from the impedance spectra. Results Of 177 infants tested, successful measurements were obtained in 164 (93%). Median (25-75%) values for resistance, compliance and inertance were 50.2 (39.5-60.6) cmH2O.s.L-1, 0.78 (0.61-0.99) mL.cmH2O-1 and 0.062 (0.050-0.086) cmH2O.s2.L-1, respectively. As a group, male infants had 16% higher resistance (P = 0.006) and 18% lower compliance (P = 0.02) than females. Infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had a 19% lower compliance than infants not exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy (P = 0.005). Neither maternal HIV infection nor ethnicity had a significant effect on respiratory mechanics. Conclusions The forced oscillation technique is sensitive enough to demonstrate the effects of tobacco smoke exposure and sex in respiratory mechanics in healthy infants. This technique will facilitate assessing perinatal influences of lung function in infancy.

N2  - Epidemiological reports describe a child population increase in BP level and an increase in prevalence of hypertension, that is largely, but not entirely, driven by a concurrent increase in childhood obesity. Given current estimates, 10% of adolescents have hypertension or prehypertension. In addition to obesity, dietary salt intake and waist circumference, a marker of visceral obesity, are found to be independently associated with the rise in BP among children and adolescents. Dietary salt intake in urban children is well above recommended levels largely because of consumption of processed and fast foods. Childhood exposures, such as stress,52 salt, and fructose, as well as lifestyles, including food sources, sleep patterns, and reductions in physical activity may have a role in obesity high BP associations. In addition, clinical and translational evidence is mounting that intrauterine exposures alter can effect changes in fetal development that have an enduring effect on cardiovascular and metabolic function later in life. These effects can be detected even in children who are products of a term otherwise normal pregnancy. Hypertension in childhood has been defined statistically (BP=95th percentile) because of lack of outcome data that links a BP level with heightened risk for future cardiovascular events. Therefore, primary hypertension had been considered a risk factor for later hypertension in adulthood. Intermediate markers of TOD, including cardiac hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and increases in cIMT, are detectable in adolescents with primary hypertension. Evidence that vascular injury is present in the early phase of hypertension and even in prehypertension warrants consideration on the current definition of pediatric hypertension. With further studies on TOD and other risk factors in addition to high BP, it may be possible to shift from a statistical definition to a definition of childhood hypertension that is evidence based. Preventing or reducing childhood obesity would have substantial benefit in countering the documented increase in BP levels and prevalence of high BP in childhood. Weight control in overweight and obese children, along with dietary changes53 and increases in physical activity,54 has benefit on BP levels in childhood. Prevention of childhood obesity and BP risk will require multiple levels of intervention, including public health, health policy, and attention to food supply to foster the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.

N2  - Objective: Although binge eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating disorder, the impact of untreated BED is underappreciated. This review describes the relationship of BED to physical and mental health, quality of life, and functionality. Data Sources: PubMed searches were conducted on March 21, 2014; searches were limited to English-language research articles, meta-analyses, and reviews published between January 1, 2003 and March 21, 2014. Search terms included (binge eating OR binge-eating OR binge eating disorder) AND (cardiovascular OR metabolic OR metabolic syndrome OR gastrointestinal OR health OR rehabilitation OR recovery OR sleep OR pregnancy OR quality of life OR functional impairment OR activities of daily living OR QoL OR SF-12 OR ED-5D OR SF-36 OR psychosocial OR depressive OR anxiety OR self-esteem OR suicidality OR suicide OR productivity OR family). Study Selection/Data Extraction: Of 326 identified publications, 43 were relevant to the topic and reported on the association of BED with psychiatric and medical comorbidities, quality of life, and functional outcomes. Results: Individuals diagnosed with BED have increased rates of mental health comorbidities (eg, depression and anxiety) and more pronounced medical impairments (eg, cardiovascular disorders) compared with individuals without BED. BED is also associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Conclusions: Binge eating disorder is associated with impairments in physical and mental health, which can decrease quality of life and functionality and lead to increased health care utilization and decreased productivity. However, some caution is warranted in interpreting these findings because it remains unclear whether BED is an antecedent condition, a complication associated with a comorbid psychiatric condition, or an unrelated feature that occurs concurrently with these comorbidities and impairments. Much of the research on BED is based on observational or epidemiologic studies. Controlled studies are needed to clearly define the long-term impairments associated with BED.

N2  - Background: There is emerging research to suggest that supine maternal sleep position in late pregnancy may adversely affect fetal wellbeing. However, these studies have all been based on maternal report of sleeping position. Before recommendations to change sleep position can be made it is important to determine the validity of these studies by investigating how accurate pregnant women are in reporting their sleep position. If avoiding the supine sleeping position reduces risk of poor pregnancy outcome, it is also important to know how well women can comply with the instruction to avoid this position and sleep on their left.
Method: Thirty women in late pregnancy participated in a three-night observational study and were asked to report their sleeping position. This was compared to sleep position as recorded by a night capable video recording. The participants were instructed to settle to sleep on their left side and if they woke overnight to settle back to sleep on their left.
Results: There was a moderate correlation between reported and videodetermined left-side sleep time (r50.48), mean difference53 min (SD53.5 h). Participants spent an average of 59.60% (SD516.73%) of time in bed on their left side (ICC across multiple nights50.67). Those who included left side among their typical sleep positions reported significantly longer sleep during the study (p,0.01).
Conclusions: On average participant reports of sleep position were relatively accurate but there were large individual differences in reporting accuracy and in objectively-determined time on left side. Night-to-night consistency was substantial. For those who do not ordinarily sleep on that side, asking participants to sleep on their left may result in reduced sleep duration. This is an important consideration during a sleep-critical time such as late pregnancy.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether poor sleep quality of third-trimester pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression.
Material/Methods: Third-trimester pregnant women (T0, n=293) were tested using the first socio-demographic, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale assessments, and received a diagnosis of depression. Three months (T1, n=223) after delivery, scale filling was finished and the structured interview was performed again.
Results: We found that 73 persons (32.7%) were low income, 84 persons (37.7%) were middle-income, and 66 persons (29.6%) were higher income. The overall prevalence of postpartum depression was 9.4% (21 persons). After controlling for other factors, age, household income, marital satisfaction, and sleep quality were significantly related to postpartum depression, in which age and sleep quality scores (a higher score was associated with poorer sleep quality) were positively related to postpartum depression, and household income and marital satisfaction were negatively related to postpartum depression. Moreover, third-trimester sleep quality score was positively related to postpartum depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: Poor third-trimester subjective sleep quality is a risk factor for postpartum depression.

N2  - Background: Non-supine infant sleep positions put infants at risk for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Disparities in safe sleep practices are associated with maternal income and race/ethnicity. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a nutrition supplement program for low-income (≤185% Federal Poverty Level) pregnant and postpartum women. Currently in Massachusetts, approximately 40% of pregnant/postpartum women are WIC clients. To inform the development of a SUID intervention strategy, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) investigated the association between WIC status and infant safe sleep practices among postpartum Massachusetts mothers using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey. Methods: PRAMS is an ongoing statewide health surveillance system of new mothers conducted by the MDPH in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PRAMS includes questions about infant sleep position and mothers’ prenatal WIC status. Risk Ratio (RR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for infant supine sleep positioning by WIC enrollment, yearly and in aggregate (2007–2010). Results/Outcomes: The aggregate (2007–2010) weighted sample included 276,252 women (weighted n ≈ 69,063 women/year; mean survey response rate 69%). Compared to non-WIC mothers, WIC mothers were less likely to usually or always place their infants in supine sleeping positions [RR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.81)]. Overall, significant differences were found for each year (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), and in aggregate (2007–2010) by WIC status. Conclusion: Massachusetts WIC mothers more frequently placed their babies in non-supine positions than non-WIC mothers. While this relationship likely reflects the demographic factors associated with safe sleep practices (e.g., maternal income and race/ethnicity), the finding informed the deployment of an intervention strategy for SUID prevention. Given WIC’s statewide infrastructure and the large proportion of pregnant/postpartum women in Massachusetts that are enrolled in WIC, a WIC-based safe sleep intervention may be an effective SUID reduction strategy with potential national application.

N2  - Background: Poor sleep contributes to the developmental problems seen in preterm infants. We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6 months of post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with that of full-term infants. Methods: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time, all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7 days. Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and objective measures of sleep. Results: The sleep problems indicated in the subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: "the nocturnal sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing" had significant correlations with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of premature infants with AHI > 1 event/hour as indicated by the questionnaire. Conclusion: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants, including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ).

N2  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common illness, but due to the underlying processes and the diversity of symptoms, some variability is exhibited. The risk of postpartum depression is great if the mother has previously suffered from depression, but there is some evidence that a certain subgroup of women only experience depression during the postpartum period. Methods: The study group consisted of 104 mothers with postpartum major depression and a control group of 104 postpartum mothers without depression. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was used for data collection. The severity of depression and other mental symptoms were assessed using several validated rating scales. Results: A history of past depression (82%), including depression during pregnancy (42%) and during the postpartum period (53%), was very common in those with current PPD. Eighteen per cent of mothers with current PPD had previously not had any depressive episodes and four per cent had experienced depression only during the postpartum period. Therefore, pure PPD was rare. The onset of PPD was usually (84%) within six weeks of childbirth. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, depressed mood, diminished pleasure/interest, decreased energy, and psychomotor agitation/retardation were common with all kinds of depression histories. Pure PPD was the most similar to the first depressive episode. Nevertheless, the severity of depression, the level of hopelessness, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation were lower, appetite changed less, and concentration was better than in other recurrent depressions. Conclusions: According to this study, PPD is not a homogenous disorder. The time of onset, severity, symptoms, level of hopelessness, and the course of depression vary. Recurrent depression is common. All mothers must be screened during the sixth week postpartum at the latest. Screening alone is not effective; it is also important to give mothers information about PPD and to discuss the symptoms with them in order for them to recognise this disorder and possible new episodes in the future.

N2  - Background: The goal of this study was to identify the prevalence and clinical correlates and severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in mainland China. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 1584 women (18–40 years old) who came to a prenatal outpatient clinic to consult an obstetrician. Pregnant women were studied in each trimester, and assessments included interviews about RLS symptoms and related questions. Standardized questionnaires include the International Restless Syndrome Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire. Blood tests included levels of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume. Results: RLS was diagnosed in 177 of 1584 women (11.2 %); 4.2 % were categorized as having pre-existing RLS and 54.8 % reported onset of RLS symptoms after the 24th week. Multivariate analysis revealed that anemia was positively correlated with RLS. For the participants who first experienced RLS in pregnancy, RLS severity in the third trimester was more severe when compared with the first and second trimesters. Sleep disorders occurred more frequently in the third trimester. Conclusions: In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant Chinese women, and anemia was identified as an independent predictor of the disease. Further, most participants reported their symptoms during the third trimester, and the severity of RLS and sleep disorders of participants was more prominent in the third trimester.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the prevalence of self-reported abnormal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy among Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and non-Māori women versus the general population, and to examine the influence of socio-demographic factors. Methods: Self-reported total sleep time (TST) in 24-hrs, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and socio-demographic information were obtained from nullipara and multipara women aged 20-46 yrs at 35-37 weeks pregnant (358 Māori and 717 non-Māori), and women in the general population (381 Māori and 577 non-Māori). Results: After controlling for ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women average 30 min less TST than women in the general population. The distribution of TST was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short sleepers (≤6 h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (>9 h). In addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Pregnant women >30 years of age experienced greater age-related declines in TST. Identifying as Māori, being unemployed, and working at night increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women population in this study. EDS also more likely occurred among Māori women and women who worked at night. Conclusions: Pregnancy increases the prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and EDS, which are also higher among Māori than non-Māori women and those who do night work. Health professionals responsible for the care of pregnant women need to be well-educated about the importance of sleep and discuss sleep issues with the women they care for.

N2  - Background: Perinatal distress has largely been conceptualised as the experience of depression and/or anxiety. Recent research has shown that the affective state of stress is also present during the perinatal period and thus may add to a broader understanding of perinatal distress. Aim: The aims of the present study were to investigate the changes in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms across pregnancy, and to explore the prospective relationships between these symptoms. Methods: Two-hundred and fourteen pregnant women were recruited when they were less than 16 weeks gestation. Women completed depression, anxiety and stress measures on a monthly basis, from 16 weeks gestation through to 36 weeks gestation. The covariate measures of sleep quality and social support were assessed bi-monthly at 16, 24 and 32 weeks gestation. Findings: Levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were all shown to change over time, with women experiencing fewer symptoms during the middle of their pregnancy. Higher symptoms early in pregnancy predicted higher symptom levels throughout the rest of pregnancy. Higher depression scores early in pregnancy were also shown to predict higher anxiety and higher stress scores in late pregnancy. Increased stress scores during mid pregnancy also predicted higher anxiety scores in late pregnancy. Conclusion: Current findings indicate that symptom levels of depression, anxiety and stress vary over the course of pregnancy. Increased depression in early pregnancy seemed to be particularly pertinent as it not only predicted later depression symptoms, but also increased anxiety and stress in late pregnancy. Collectively, these results further highlight the importance of emotional health screening early in pregnancy.

N2  - Background/Aims: Early life experiences are homeostatic determinants for adult organisms. We evaluated the impact of prenatal immune activation during late gestation on the neuroimmune-endocrine function of adult offspring and its interaction with acute stress. Methods: Pregnant Swiss mice received saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 17. Adult male offspring were assigned to the control or restraint stress condition. We analyzed plasmatic corticosterone and catecholamine levels, the monoamine content in the hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex, and the sleep-wake cycle before and after acute restraint stress. Results and Conclusion: Offspring from LPS-treated dams had increased baseline norepinephrine levels and potentiated corticosterone secretion after the acute stressor, and no effect was observed on hypothalamic monoamine content or sleep behavior. The offspring of immune-activated dams exhibited impairments in stress-induced serotonergic and dopaminergic alterations in the striatum and frontal cortex. The data demonstrate a distinction between the plasmatic levels of corticosterone in response to acute stress and the hypothalamic monoamine content and sleep patterns. We provide new evidence regarding the influence of immune activation during late gestation on the neuroendocrine homeostasis of offspring.

N2  - Background: Sleep spindles occur in concert with other the network signatures of non-REM sleep, namely slow-waves (0.1-4 Hz) reflecting synchronized windows of cortical activity and fast (140-200 Hz), brief (o200 ms) hippocampal ripple oscillations associated with CA1 pyramidal neuron population bursts. Quantifying the interrelationships between spindles, slow-waves and ripples provides direct insights into the mechanisms and functions of limbiccortical interactions during sleep. Our previous work (Phillips, Bartsch et al. 2012, Neuron 76: 526-33) characterised decoupling of limbic-cortical activity during non- REM sleep in the MAM-E17 rat neurodevelopmental model of Sz. We have now assessed whether the source of spindle abnormalities in the MAM-E17 model might lie in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We have also extended analyses of sleep neurophysiology into mice harbouring mutations in a Sz risk allele, with a view to linking genetic and neurophysiological features of the disease. Methods: All procedures were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rat dams (Charles River UK) were injected intraperitoneally with saline (SHAM) or methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM, 22 mg/kg, in a volume of 1 mg/ml) on Embryonic Day 17. TRN slices were taken from 2-6 month old male offspring and in vitro multielectrode array recordings of extracellular multi-unit activity used to quantify spontaneous spindle-frequency bursts. 'Ext2mut' mice with a nonsense mutation leading to a premature stop codon in Exon 2 of zfp804a (the orthologue of ZNF804a, a common risk allele for Sz and bipolar disorder) were identified from an ENU mutagenesis program (MRC Harwell UK). Adult (42 months) male mice backcrossed onto a C57BL6 background were chronically implanted with either arrays of tetrode recording electrodes targeting CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus (5 mutants, 5 wildtype littermates) or with dual-site silicon probes targeting CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Post-mortem immunohistochemistry was used to assess the density of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in CA1 and mPFC. Results: The densities, durations and spectral characteristics of in vitro TRN spindles were similar in slices taken from SHAM and MAM rats. Ext2mut mice showed normal PV densities in CA1 and mPFC. Consistent with this, the spatially-modulated firing properties of CA1 pyramidal cells (place cells) during maze running appeared grossly normal in Ext2mut mice, as did the overall pattern of hippocampal local field potential oscillations during active exploration. However, during rest, Ext2mut place cells (n=45) were significantly over-active during ripples when compared to controls (n=44; p<0.05 ranksum). Silicon probe recordings are currently being analysed to quantify ripple and spindle-associated CA1-mPFC interactions in these mice. Conclusions: Intact spindle activity in TRN slices from MAM-E17 rats implies that the in vivo reduction in spindle density and mis-timed spindle activity relative to CA1 ripples in this model do not stem from core TRN dysfunction. Rather, we suggest that dysfunction of cortical PV interneurons (which are reduced in density in MAM-E17 rats) leads to aberrant cortico-thalamic feedback and/or corticocortical propagation of slow-wave and spindle activity. Spindle abnormalities in Sz may therefore derive from cortical, as well as thalamic, pathologies. The aberrant rippleassociated firing in CA1 of zfp804a mutant mice is similar to that reported in a calcineurin knockout mouse model of Sz (Suh et al. 2013, Neuron 80: 484-93) and may be a common signature of sleep-dependent hippocampal dysfunction in Sz models. This may reflect impaired local interneuronal networks and, alongside spindle abnormalities, is likely to contribute to impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation in Sz and related diseases.

N2  - Considerable interest exists internationally in determining the effectiveness of obesity prevention initiatives that commence early in life. The Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study was a randomised controlled trial investigating whether additional guidance and support around sleep, breastfeeding, diet and physical activity would slow the rate of excessive weight gain from birth to two years of age. While POI is part of the Early Prevention of Overweight in CHildren (EPOCH) prospective meta-analysis collaboration of four similar Australasian trials, it is unique in having a sleep intervention arm and including multiparous as well as primiparous mothers. 802 women were recruited in late pregnancy and randomised to: (1) Sleep (education sessions antenatally and at 3 weeks targeting the prevention of sleep problems, followed by an intervention from 6 months postpartum targeting the treatment of sleep problems), (2) FAB (provision of a lactation consultant to promote breastfeeding to 6 months, and education sessions at 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 and 18 months targeting healthy eating, sedentary time and active play for families), (3) Combo (Sleep and FAB interventions) or (4) Control. All four groups received standard Well Child care from the provider of their choice (typically 8 consultations in the first two years of life). Retention was high with 85% of families still involved in the study at 2 years of age. Further data were collected at 3.5 years and data collection at 5 years is ongoing. Mean body mass index (BMI) did not differ at 2 years by intervention group but children in the sleep arm were significantly less likely to be obese (=95th percentile) than those in the FAB group. FAB and Combo appeared to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary activity. Data on infant feeding, physical activity (accelerometry), sleep, and dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire) will be presented.

N2  - In most species, self-sustained molecular clocks regulate 24-h rhythms of behavior and physiology. In mammals, a circadian pacemaker residing in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives photic signals from the retina and synchronizes subordinate clocks in non-SCN tissues. The emergence of circadian rhythmicity during development has been extensively studied for many years. In mice, neuronal development in the presumptive SCN region of the embryonic hypothalamus occurs on days 12-15 of gestation. Intra-SCN circuits differentiate during the following days and retinal projections reach the SCN, and thus mediate photic entrainment, only after birth. In contrast the genetic components of the clock gene machinery are expressed much earlier and during midgestation SCN explants and isolated neurons are capable of generating molecular oscillations in culture. In vivo metabolic rhythms in the SCN, however, are observed not earlier than the 19th day of rat gestation, and rhythmic expression of clock genes is hardly detectable until after birth. Together these data indicate that cellular coupling and, thus, tissue-wide synchronization of single-cell rhythms, may only develop very late during embryogenesis. In this mini-review we describe the developmental origin of the SCN structure and summarize our current knowledge about the functional initiation and entrainment of the circadian pacemaker during embryonic development.

N2  - Whanau Pakari is a unique multidisciplinary programme launched in January 2012 for obese children and adolescents. Aim: To review baseline assessments, weightrelated comorbidities and cardio-metabolic profile of Whanau Pakari participants. Method: Baseline assessments from January 2012 to August 2014 were reviewed. Referral criteria were BMI > 98th centile, or >91st centile with significant weight-related co-morbidities, age 5-16 years. The assessments included health and lifestyle parameters. Results: 240 assessments were reviewed. Average age was 10 years, with 53% female (n = 126). Primary ethnicity was identified as Maori in 45% of patients, New Zealand European (45%), Pacific (3%), Asian (3%) and Other (4%). Weight had been a concern for an average of 3.7 years (n = 207). Average BMI percentile was 99.6 (range 94-100), with an average BMI standard deviation score (SDS) of 3.1 (range 1.5-5.4). Average BMI of the accompanying adult was 33.6 (range 19.3-62.6). Acanthosis nigricans was present in 98 (41%) of the children. Of the 224 mothers who responded, 89 (40%) smoked during pregnancy. Average birthweight was 3.45 kg. A family history of weight problems was reported for 189 (79%) and of Type 2 Diabetes for 143 (60%) of the children. Of the 238 children for whom casual blood pressure recordings were available, 45 (19%) had pre-hypertension, and 12 (5%) had hypertension (n = 12). Pauses in breathing were reported by 48 (20%). A baseline blood sample was obtained on 176 (73%) of the children. Average fasting serum insulin was 149 pmol/L (range 12-1185). Insulin resistance (fasting insulin > 80 pmol/L) was present in 125 (71%). Average HbA1c was 34 mmol/mol (range 25-94), including 1 Type 1 Diabetes patient and 2 with Type 2 Diabetes, and an average fasting glucose 5.2 mmol/L (range 3.3-16.4). Conclusion: Whanau Pakari has demonstrated concerning levels of weight-related comorbidities across all ethnicities with hypertension, likely obstructive sleep apnoea and insulin resistance of particular concern.

N2  - BACKGROUND: True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia.
METHOD: Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias.
RESULTS: High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited.

N2  - Disturbances of fetal autonomic brain development can be evaluated from fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) reflecting the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Although HRP analysis from cardiotocographic (CTG) recordings is established for fetal surveillance, temporal resolution is low. Fetal magnetocardiography (MCG), however, provides stable continuous recordings at a higher temporal resolution combined with a more precise heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. A direct comparison of CTG and MCG based HRV analysis is pending. The aims of the present study are: (i) to compare the fetal maturation age predicting value of the MCG based fetal Autonomic Brain Age Score (fABAS) approach with that of CTG based Dawes-Redman methodology; and (ii) to elaborate fABAS methodology by segmentation according to fetal behavioral states and HRP. We investigated MCG recordings from 418 normal fetuses, aged between 21 and 40 weeks of gestation. In linear regression models we obtained an age predicting value of CTG compatible short term variability (STV) of R<sup>2</sup> = 0.200 (coefficient of determination) in contrast to MCG/fABAS related multivariate models with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.648 in 30 min recordings, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.610 in active sleep segments of 10 min, and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.626 in quiet sleep segments of 10 min. Additionally segmented analysis under particular exclusion of accelerations (AC) and decelerations (DC) in quiet sleep resulted in a novel multivariate model with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.706. According to our results, fMCG based fABAS may provide a promising tool for the estimation of fetal autonomic brain age. Beside other traditional and novel HRV indices as possible indicators of developmental disturbances, the establishment of a fABAS score normogram may represent a specific reference. The present results are intended to contribute to further exploration and validation using independent data sets and multicenter research structures.

N2  - Changes in the maternal environment can induce fetal adaptations that result in the progression of chronic diseases in the offspring. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of maternal chronic sleep restriction on blood pressure, renal function and cardiac baroreflex response on male offspring at adult age. Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in two experimental groups: control (C) and chronic sleep restricted (CSR). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. Chronic sleep restricted females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily, between the 1st and 20th day of pregnancy. After birth, the litters were reduced to 6 rats per mother, and were designated as offspring from control (OC) and offspring from chronic sleep restricted (OCSR). Indirect blood pressure (BPi - tail cuff) was measured by plethysmography in male offspring at 3 months old. Following, the renal function and cardiac baroreflex response were analyzed. Values of BPi in OCSR were significantly higher compared to OC [OC: 12762.6 (19); OCSR: 14462.5 (17) mmHg]. The baroreflex sensitivity to the increase of blood pressure was reduced in OCSR [Slope: OC: 22.660.15 (9); OCRS: 21.660.13 (9)]. Hypothalamic activity of ACE2 was significantly reduced in OCSR compared to OC [OC: 97.4 615 (18); OSR: 60.263.6 (16) UAF/min/protein mg]. Renal function alteration was noticed by the increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) observed in OCSR [OC: 6.460.2 (10); OCSR: 7.4 60.3 (7)]. Chronic sleep restriction during pregnancy caused in the offspring hypertension, altered cardiac baroreflex response, reduced ACE-2 activity in the hypothalamus and renal alterations. Our data suggest that the reduction of sleeping time along the pregnancy is able to modify maternal homeostasis leading to functional alterations in offspring.

N2  - Introduction: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare pathology encountered in pregnant woman, which carries a high risk of maternal mortality. Anaesthetic management of parturient with PH undergoing cesarean section is a challenge as maternal mortality rate remains 30 - 50% irrespective of adequate medical care. We report the case of pastient with severe PH and infected bronchiectasis who successfully underwent an emergency cesarean section under epidural anaesthesia (EA). Case Report: A 29-year-old primigravida female presented with increasing dyspnoea at 30 weeks of pregnancy. Her past medical history revealed that she had a tuberculosis treatment and history of chronic cough with mucoid expectoration for a period of six months. She was admitted with symptoms and signs of right heart failure. On examination she had a clubbing finger and could only sleep in a semi-setting position. Arterial blood gas showed hypoxia with partially compensated metabolic alkalosis (pH 7,466, pCO2 56,2 mmHg, pO2 76,9 mmHg, HCO3 40,9 mmol/l). On auscultation she had an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound and a systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation. Electrocardiography showed right heart strain, and a chest radiograph showed a honeycomb appearance in right mid lung. Computed tomography of her chest showed a signet ring appearance in the both of lungs, suggesting a bilateral bronchiectasis. An echocardiogram showed a dilated right heart chambers with D-shaped of left ventricle, impaired right ventricular systolic function, tricuspid regurgitation, and a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 131,4 mmHg, suggesting severe PH. On obstetric examination, the height of fundus was about 28 weeks in size, ultrasound scan showed a twin intra uterine pregnancy with an estimated gestational age of 28-30 weeks. Sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on relatively stable maternal and good fetal condition, our multiproffesional team decided to extend the gestation to 34 weeks under close fetal and maternal monitoring and to schedule an elective cesarean section. She was treated with meropenem for infected bronchiectasis, furosemide for right heart failure, and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor for her pulmonary hypertension. But she had a worsening dyspnoea at 32 weeks of gestational age, so she underwent an emergency cesarean section under EA. Twin pre-term female neonates were born (weight 1380 gram and 1330 gram, respectively; Apgar score 7/9 and 7/9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively). Postoperatively the parturient was transferred to intensive care unit with stable hemodynamics.

N2  - Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy among high-risk women. Study Design This was a prospective, observational study. We recruited women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, history of preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9) and severe (≥30). Subjects who had a normal AHI at the baseline (AHI < 5), but an abnormal study in the third trimester (AHI ≥5) were classified as having new-onset SDB. Results A total of 128 women were recruited. In early pregnancy 21, 6 and 3% had mild, moderate, or severe SDB, respectively. These frequencies increased to 35, 7, and 5% in the third trimester (p < 0.001). About 27% (n = 34) experienced a worsening of SDB during pregnancy; 26 were cases of new-onset SDB, while the other 8 had SDB in early pregnancy that worsened in severity. The incidence of new-onset SDB was 20%. The majority of these new-onset cases were mild. Conclusions SDB in early pregnancy is common in high-risk women and new-onset SDB occurs in 20% of these women.

N2  - Objective: Pregnancy has long been acknowledged as a condition that predisposes to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of GERD and the effect of GERD on quality of life (QOL) and pregnancy outcomes in Korean pregnant women. Methods: This study was a prospective, cohort study which followed pregnant women in the second or third trimester. Ninetyfour consecutive pregnant women who visited Seoul National University Boramae Hospital for the prenatal test were included in this study. GERD was diagnosed with the use of the GERDQ (gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire). QOL in pregnant women with GERD was assessed using QOLRAD (quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia questionnaire). Pregnancy outcome was evaluated with obstetric records after delivery. Results: Twenty eight (29.8%) of 94 women were diagnosed as GERD by GERDQ. History of GERD in pre-pregnancy and BMI of pre-pregnancy were associated with the development of GERD during pregnancy (9% vs 25%, P = 0.041/ 21.04 ± 2.82 vs 19.97 ± 1.90, P = 0.036). On aspects of QOL, emotional stress (P = 0.014), sleep problem (P = 0.015), food/drink problem (P = 0.004), and vitality (P = 0.029) were more prevalent in pregnant women with GERD. Pregnancy outcomes as assessed by birth weight, Apgar score, pre-term birth, and gestational age at partum were not different between the two groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of GERD during pregnancy was 29.8% in our cohort. Previous history of GERD and lower BMI in pre-pregnancy can be the predictive factors of the development of GERD in pregnant women. GERD significantly impaired QOL of pregnant women.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy brings about many changes in a woman's life in somatic, psychological and social spheres. Therefore, many women decide to participate in childbirth education classes. The aim of study was to determine the differences in emotional distress between women who participated in childbirth education classes and these who did not. Material and Methods: Seventy first-time mothers after labor were examined. Based on a survey carried out, the women were divided into two equal groups. Group I consisted of women who had participated in childbirth education classes and Group II of women who had not. The data was gathered by means of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) adapted to Polish conditions. Results: There were no differences either in age or in BMI rates among the examined women. The level of education and knowledge about labor was significantly higher among the participants of childbirth classes. The results of the GHQ-12 revealed that women from Group I had a better mental status than women from Group II. Significant differences were observed in terms of sleep deprivation, overcoming difficulties and in the ability to enjoy daily activities. Conclusions: Participation in childbirth classes has a significant influence on psychological well-being in pregnant women as measured by the GHQ-12.

N2  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) (N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) (N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.

N2  - Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model.
Design: Case-control comparison in a murine model.
Setting: University research laboratory.
Participants: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice.
Interventions: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses.
Measurements and Results: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 ± 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 ± 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 ± 0.10 and 2.45 ± 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 ± 0.16 and 5.80 ± 1.24, respectively).
Conclusions: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

N2  - Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At 12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.03-1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88-0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) and overall MVPA (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal) sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12-5.15) and increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.05-3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep.

N2  - Background: Exclusive breastfeeding is a known risk-reduction strategy for reducing SIDS and SUDI, yet Infant Mortality and SIDS-reduction groups mostly ignore, minimize, and discount the importance and feasibility of exclusive breastfeeding. Blanket “Never bedshare” messages have resulted in mothers bedsharing on truly unsafe surfaces such as couches. Formula companies are major contributors to SIDS-reduction organizations and researchers in the US and England. Much research on SIDS and SUDI uses confusing and contradictory terminology, fails to control for alcohol use and infant feeding method, and fails to clearly define the sleep surface and conditions when a deceased baby is found. Over 75% of breastfeeding mothers bedshare with their babies at least part of the night, and the lowest rates of SIDS and SUDI are found in the exclusive breastfeeding populations in the US and worldwide. This presentation calls upon SIDS/SUDI agencies and breastfeeding organizations to collaborate on safety messages that support breastfeeding and simultaneously reduce risk of SIDS and SUDI. Objective(s): 1. Describe unintended consequences of safe sleep messages that may result in increased risk to infants. 2. Describe flaws and limitations in research studies that are used as the basis of safe sleep policies. 3. Describe conflicts of interest related to SIDS, safe sleep and infant mortality groups. Materials/Methods: Literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar for the terms “SIDS,” “sudden infant death syndrome,” “bedsharing,” “co-sleeping,” “breastfeeding,” “unintended consequences” and “sleep-related deaths.” Monitoring of internet, social media sites and parenting publications from January 2003 through October 2013. Examination of SIDS-support, crib distribution, and safe sleep internet sites; national, state and local SIDS and safe sleep initiatives; published policies and position statements of international, national, and state professional associations and public health agencies relevant to maternal-child health. Results: Bedsharing and breastfeeding are closely linked. Mothers use multiple arrangements and strategies to manage sleep and continue breastfeeding. SIDS and smothering are two different entities, but are used interchangeably in some research studies. SIDS is not related to bedsharing: the most central risk factors for SIDS are maternal smoking during pregnancy, prone position, formula feeding, and non-proximity to a responsible caretaker during sleep. Infant smothering deaths are most commonly associated with couches, alcohol or drug use in the bed-partner, or sleeping with non-parents. Statements that suggest that “bedsharing is lethal” may be dismissed or ignored by minorities and nursing mothers. When an adult bed is thought to be dangerous, mothers tend to use unplanned surfaces, especially sofas which pose a greater risk for smothering. Inconsistent, missing and confusing definitions were found. Studies failed to include independent documented variables including Infant feeding method which was inconsistently reported; alcohol use in bed partners which was missing or extrapolated; and smoking during pregnancy or in the household which was not consistently reported. Evidence of formula-industry funding was found on some SIDS-reduction groups web sites (First Candle and CJ SIDS foundation), and SIDS researchers' publications. Conclusions: Responsible parents are caught between two public health agendas: Safeguarding (prevention of harm) vs. Well-being (promotion of health including breastfeeding). Breastfeeding initiatives mostly lack “safe bedsharing” guidelines. Infant-mortality and SIDS-reduction initiatives fail to name formula as a SIDS risk factor. California Department of Public Health's policy could be used as a national model. There is an urgent need for AAP and other public health associations and agencies to develop safe bedsharing guidelines that acknowledge different risk factors for breastfeeding, non-smoking, sober mothers, and communicate these widely. Stakeholders must work together and acknowledge parent's rights to full information on safety that supports their individual family needs. Safe bedsharing, increasing breastfeeding, and reducing SIDS and SUDI are compatible goals.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal-axis function regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol, which during pregnancy can cross the placenta and have lasting impacts on fetal growth and development. This article provides a preliminary test of the hypothesis that a woman's socioeconomic status (SES) predicts her cortisol during pregnancy and her offspring's cortisol during the early postnatal period among an ethnically diverse sample in Auckland, New Zealand to evaluate whether differences in cortisol contribute to the intergenerational inheritance of health disparities within this population.
METHODS: Maternal saliva samples were collected at waking and prior to sleep on 2 days in late pregnancy (34-36 weeks gestation; N = 55), and a subset of offspring saliva was collected before (N = 48) and 20 min after a standard vaccination at 6 weeks of age (N = 19). SES was quantified using a locally validated index of material deprivation, the NZ Deprivation Index for individuals (NZiDep).
RESULTS: We found that, after controlling for ethnicity and other covariates, women with higher NZiDep scores had significantly higher evening but similar morning cortisol, consistent with a pattern of chronic strain. Infants of women reporting greater material deprivation had elevated cortisol response to vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that maternal SES experience impacts maternal cortisol in pregnancy and offspring cortisol reactivity soon after birth, with potential long-term effects on offspring biology and health. Additional research is needed to clarify how biological and behavioral factors in both the prenatal and postnatal period facilitate this relationship.

N2  - Introduction. WED is a clinical diagnosis based on verbal descriptions of experienced sensorimotor symptoms; 10% of the population is assumed to be on the WED-spectrum, but only 2% experience significant problems. As young children and/or children with NDCs may not be able to communicate clinical symptoms, diagnosing childhood-WED is challenging. We investigate familial childhood-WED in patients with NDCs, whose mothers experience WED symptoms. Patients and methods. 17 children with NDCs were assessed at the Sleep/Wake-Behaviour Assessment Clinic. Familial WED was diagnosed with clinical history and a modified Suggested Clinical Immobilization Test; individuals were asked to sit bare-foot in a relaxed position, remain motionless and describe sensorimotor symptoms. The gathered data was recorded in a detailed phenotyping database (Tab. 1). Results. Mothers: 100% experienced WED-related discomfort, 59% Insomnia, 29% signs of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), 18% parasomnias; 76% had general anemia and 59% pregnancy-related anemia; 41% reported co-morbid mental health diagnoses (MHD) and general diagnoses. Children: 100% presented with WED and Insomnia; 94% had sensory processing abnormalities, were restless sleepers, and reported signs of SDB, 85% experienced parasomnias; 88% and 59% of the children investigated received a confirmed NDC and/or MHD. 82% were trialed with psychotropic medications (2.9/child), 57% experienced adverse drug reactions. Conclusions. Familial WED adds to complex clinical presentations in children with NDCs, accounting for sleep-problems and challenging daytime behaviours. Given the challenges in diagnosing WED in young/non-verbal children, investigating the maternal sleep history and including a focused familial WED assessment was instrumental. Maternal anemia seems to play a key role, which should be investigated further. (Table Presented).

N2  - In Malawi, school-age children have the highest rates of malaria illness at health facilities and asymptomatic infections in the community. Whether this is due to age-related biological susceptibility or difference in access to malaria control interventions is unclear. We used community-based surveillance data to assess interventions, including bednet use and prompt diagnosis and treatment, in school-age children (6-15years) compared to younger children (0-5years) and pregnant women, groups that are typically the target of anti-malaria interventions. During cross-sectional surveys in September 2012 and May 2013, we enrolled 7653 participants. Schoolage children were less likely to report using bednets (645/1130, 57%) than younger children (600/790, 76%, p<0.001) and pregnant women (57/74, 77%, p<0.001). Among school-age children, the likelihood of bednet use was not affected by gender or rural vs. urban setting, but they were more likely to sleep under a net in the rainy season and when the ratio of household members to nets was lower (2.6 vs 4.5 people per net, p<0.001). Effects of bednets in this age group will be determined by comparing rates of anemia, microscopic and submicroscopic parasitemia. Fever in the last two weeks was reported in fewer school-age children (163/1130, 14%) than younger children (200/790, 25%); p<0.001). Among those with fever, there was no difference between the groups in seeking treatment or duration of fever prior to seeking treatment. School-age children were most commonly taken to a shop for treatment compared to younger children, who were most commonly taken to a government health facility. By parent report, the two groups were equally likely to be tested for malaria and to receive antimalarial drugs. In Malawi, school-age children have less access to antimalarial interventions than younger children and pregnant women. This may partially explain their high rates of disease and infection. New interventions targeting this group or strategies to increase access to existing programs may decrease both disease burden and transmission.

N2  - Malaria prevention is vital to its control. At least 80% of children less than 5 years (U5) and pregnant women (PW) sleep under long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) while all PW attending ante-natal clinics should receive at least two doses of Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT). Even though there is gradual attempt to scaleup access to these interventions, little information is available about their currents. We analysed access to LLINs and IPT in Nigeria using secondary data.We collected national summary data on malaria preventive services from January 2011 to December 2012. Data on uptake of LLINs in U5 and PW, and uptake of IPT in PW from all reporting health facilities (HF) were extracted. Analysis was done by state using Microsoft excel. In 2011, of the 2,741,485 PW who attended ANC in 96,418 HFs, 622, 317 (22.7%) and 649, 732 (23.7%) received LLIN and IPT respectively. In 2012, of the 3, 392, 363 PW who attended ANC in the 114, 667 HFs, (9%) and (16.6%) received LLIN and IPT respectively. In 2011 and 2012 199289(3.2%) of the 6,220,672 and 301896(3.2%) of the 9,521,932 U5 seen received LLINs respectively. Despite increase in ANC attendance and reporting HF, access to LLIN and IPT remains low. In Nigeria, universal access to malaria preventive commodities and services has not yet been achieved in high risk groups. High antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance alone is not sufficient to ensure high IPT and LLIN coverage as the Roll Back Malaria target of 80% was not achieved.SP for IPT should always be made available at all HF's and health workers should be trained on the need to increase IPT coverage.

N2  - DESIGN: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours.
METHOD: Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9 months post-partum.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence.
CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.
STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Post-partum weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What does this study add? Post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is associated with PWR at 9 months post-birth. Post-partum depression, stress and anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction.
OBJECTIVES: Post-partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR.

N2  - The timing and pattern of mammalian behavioral activities are regulated by an evolutionary optimized interplay of the genetically based biological (circadian) clock located in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei and direct responses to environmental factors that superimpose and thus mask the clock-mediated effects, the most important of which is the photically induced phase-setting (synchronization) of the circadian rhythmicity to the 24-hour solar day. In wild and captive animals living under the natural conditions prevailing in their habitat, to date, only a few attempts have been made to analyze the role of these two regulatory mechanisms in the species' adaptation to the time structure prevailing in their habitat. We studied the impact of housing conditions and season on the daily timing and pattern of activity in Mexican spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). To this end, we carried out long-term activity recordings with Actiwatch® AW4 accelerometer/data-logger devices in 11 adult Ateles living under identical natural lighting and climatic conditions in either a large wire netting cage or a 0.25 ha forest enclosure in the primatological field station of Veracruz State University near Catemaco, Mexico. In a gravid female in the forest enclosure, we obtained first-hand information on the effect of late pregnancy and parturition on the monkey's activity rhythm. The Ateles behaved strictly diurnal and undertook about 90% of daily total activity during this activity time. Due to a higher second activity peak in late afternoon, the bimodal activity pattern was more pronounced in monkeys living in the forest enclosure. Although the spider monkeys kept there had an earlier activity onset and morning activity peak than their conspecifics in the cage, no consistent differences were found in the parameters characterizing the phase-setting of the circadian system to the environmental 24-h periodicity, either by comparison or correlation with the external time markers of sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS). The most obvious effect of late pregnancy, parturition and lactation was a distinct reduction of the activity level during the week of parturition and the next. Seasonal variations in the form of significant differences between the long-day summer half year and the short-day winter half year were established in the phase-angle differences of the morning activity peak to SR, in the evening activity peak and activity offset to SS, as well as in the activity time and the peak-to-peak interval, but not in the phase position of activity onset to SR or in the height of the morning and evening activity peak. These findings in combination with a high variability of the phase angle differences indicate that in A. geoffroyi, a relatively weak circadian component and strong masking direct effects of environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the daily activity rhythm.

N2  - Objectives: Circadian blood pressure (BP) pattern is diverse in patients with essential hypertension. In this study, the relationship between circadian BP pattern and coronary artery disease (CAD) in hypertensive patients was investigated. Methods: A total of 716 hypertensive patients (390 men, 326 women) from 2012 to 2013 were included in the study. All other hypertensive patients were excluded if (1) <18 or >90 years old; (2) pregnant women; (3) under antihypertensive treatment; (4) BP measurements over 160/100 mmHg; (5) night-work employment; (6) suffering acute stroke or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; (7) with sleep apnea syndrome; (8) evidence of disease or conditions responsible for secondary hypertension; (9) could not tolerate the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM); (10) history of any arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, hepatic failure, kidney failure and significant systemic disease. Circadian BP patterns were evaluated with the 24 hours ABPM and divided into dipper (10-20% SBP fall), non-dipper (0-10% SBP fall), extreme-dipper (>20% SBP fall) and reverse dipper (SBP nocturnal rise) according to the nocturnal reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP). We made the diagnosis of CAD based on syndrome, electrocardiogram, blood tests (cardiac markers) and cardiac stress testing or coronary angiogram. Descriptive results are presented as percentages for discrete variables and as means (standard deviation) for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationship between the incidence of CAD and the circadian patterns of BP. Results: In our study, the BP of 171 patients (23.8%) showed a reverse dipper pattern, while 370 patients (51.5%) had a non-dipper pattern and 177 patients (24.7%) had a dipper pattern. Patients with reverse dipper pattern were older (P<0.01), more often smokers (P<0.01) and had a remarkably higher fasting glucose (P<0.01). Importantly, the percentage of CAD (P<0.01) and diabetes (P<0.05) were higher among the patients with reverse dipper pattern. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, reverse dipper pattern of BP was an independent factor for the incidence of CAD (OR 1.427; 95% CI 1.360-1.498; P<0.01). The result of our study also suggested that 24h- SBP (OR 1.012; 95% CI 1.011-1.014; P<0.01) and 24h-DBP (OR 1.053; 95% CI 1.050-1.055; P<0.01) were closely related to CAD. Furthermore, age (OR 1.041; 95% CI 1.027-1.056; P<0.01), diabetes (OR 1.630; 95% CI 1.123-2.366; P<0.05), triglycerides (OR 1.258; 95% CI 1.056-1.499; P<0.05) were independently associated with a reversed dipper BP pattern. Conclusions: Reverse dipper pattern of BP examined with the 24h ABPM is an independent predictor for CAD. The BP of hypertensive patients with CAD and diabetes were more frequently found to be reverse dipper pattern.

N2  - Background: Interventions to prevent sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) have generally been population wide interventions instituted after case-control studies identified specific childcare practices associated with sudden death. While successful overall, in New Zealand (NZ), the rates are still relatively high by international comparison. This study aims to describe childcare practices related to SUDI prevention messages in a New Zealand community, and to develop and explore the utility of a risk assessment instrument based on international guidelines and evidence. Methods: Prospective longitudinal study of 209 infants recruited antenatally. Participant characteristics and infant care data were collected by questionnaire at: baseline (third trimester), and monthly from infant age 3 weeks through 23 weeks. Published meta-analyses data were used to estimate individual risk ratios for 6 important SUDI risk factors which, when combined, yielded a "SUDI risk score". Results: Most infants were at low risk for SUDI with 72%at the lowest or slightly elevated risk (combined risk ratio ≤1.5). There was a high prevalence of the safe practices: supine sleeping (86-89%over 3-19 weeks), mother not smoking (90-92%over 3-19 weeks), and not bed sharing at a young age (87%at 3 weeks). Five independent predictors of a high SUDI risk score were: higher parity (P =0.028), younger age (P =0.030), not working or caring for other children antenatally (P =0.031), higher depression scores antenatally (P =0.036), and lower education (P =0.042). Conclusions: Groups within the community identified as priorities for education about safe sleep practices beyond standard care are mothers who are young, have high parity, low educational levels, and have symptoms of depression antenatally. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing maternal depression as a modifiable risk factor in pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters. Objectives: To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for Plasmodium vivax. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment. For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials, 3662 participants, high quality evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality evidence). For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences. In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence)but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes. In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes. In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar. A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants). Authors' conclusions: Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants.

N2  - Objectives: We used linked existing data from the 2006-2008 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), the Current Population Survey (CPS, a federal survey that provides on-going U.S. vital statistics, including employment rates) and self-reported body mass index (BMI) to answer: How does BMI vary across full time occupations dichotomized as sedentary/non-sedentary, accounting for time spent in sleep, other sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities?.
Methods: We classified time spent engaged at a primary job (sedentary or non-sedentary), sleep, and other non-work, non-sleep intensity-defined behaviors, specifically, sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities. Age groups were defined by 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64 years. BMI groups were defined by 18.5-24.9, 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and ≥35.0 kg/m2. Logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between BMI and employment in a sedentary occupation, considering time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age race/ethnicity, and household income.
Results: The analysis data set comprised 4,092 non-pregnant, non-underweight individuals 20-64 years of age who also reported working more than 7 hours at their primary jobs on their designated time use reporting day. Logistic and linear regression analyses failed to reveal any associations between BMI and the sedentary/non-sedentary occupation dichotomy considering time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income.
Conclusions: We found no evidence of a relationship between self-reported full time sedentary occupation classification and BMI after accounting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income and 24-hours of time use including non-work related physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The various sources of error associated with self-report methods and assignment of generalized activity and occupational intensity categories could compound to obscure any real relationships.

N2  - Background: Adiponectin (AdipoQ) is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes whose expression and plasma levels are inversely related to obesity and insulin-resistance. AdipoQ plays a fundamental role in energy homeostasis and inflammation. Increasing epidemiological evidence has revealed associations between gestational perturbations and the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring later in life. Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common sleep disturbance among pregnant women, particularly during the third trimester. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications enable the developmental environment to modulate gene transcription, with many of these changes becoming stable throughout the lifespan. The effects of SF during late gestation on the epigenetic changes are unknown. We hypothesized that SF during late gestation would induce epigenetic modifications of AdipoQ in the visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice. Methods: Female C57BL/6 (Time-pregnant) mice were fed with normal chow and exposed to SF or control sleep (CS) conditions for the last 5 days of gestation. SF was performed for 12 hrs during daylight and consisted of gentle, mechanically-induced arousals at 2 min intervals using a custom developed automated device. After birth, litters were culled to 6 pups, subsequently kept with the mothers for 21 days, and fed with normal chow (10% fat). At 24 wks of age, VWAT was harvested, and global DNA methylation and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) activity were assessed. AdipoQ mRNA expression was determined using qPCR. AdipoQ specific DNA methylation and histone H3 modifications (both active and inactive marks) of the promoter and enhancer regions were analyzed by MeDIP and ChIP techniques. Results: In male offspring mice exposed to SF during late gestation, increased body and VWAT mass developed along with reductions in AdipoQ mRNA expression in VWAT and plasma levels. Global DNA methylation was increased, and HAT activity was decreased in VWAT of male mice. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmc) and H3K4 (active epigenetic marks), and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine (5-mc) and H3K9 (inactive marks) also emerged in male VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression in VWAT. Conclusions: SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in the AdipoQ gene that are associated with reduced expression of this gene along with increased body weight and VWT mass in male offspring. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by sleep disorders may impose the emergence of adverse long-lasting metabolic phenotypes in the offspring.

N2  - PURPOSE: To establish the distribution of OSA risk scores in pregnant women using a modified Sleep Apnea Clinical Score (SACS) screening tool. Scores of >48 in previous studies have been shown to be predictive of moderate/severe OSA (AHI>20) in non pregnant patients. Additionally, correlations between adverse maternal/fetal outcomes were assessed in this study. This review also demonstrates local epidemiologic data pertaining to pregnancy and sleep disordered breathing. METHODS: Retrospective single center chart review using PeriBirth® of visits to Medstar Georgetown University Hospital Labor & Delivery (L&D) unit from July-December 2012. All women routinely underwent Modified SACS at each visit to L&D. 389 patients (680 visits) during this time interval, with a completed Modified SACS were included in the analysis. Maternal conditions/outcomes examined: age, prepregnancy BMI/diabetes/HTN, gestational diabetes/HTN, chronic anemia, placentation abnormalities, eclampsia/preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome, postpartum hemorrhage, transfer to MICU. Fetal/neonatal outcomes examined: large for gestational age (LGA), small for gestational age (SGA), need for NICU, cord gas results, 5 minute Apgar, birth trauma, stillbirth, and fetal presentation. RESULTS: Modified SACS ranged from 26 to 50, with a mean of 35.59. 75% of patients had a Modified SACS<37. Statistically significant higher Modified SACS were associated with the following conditions: prepregnancy HTN (N=25, SACS 41.44 present/35.49 absent, p<0.0001), gestational HTN (N=70, SACS 40.18 present/35.18 absent, p<0.0001), mild preeclampsia (N=31, SACS 38.82 present/35.53 absent, p=0.002), thalassemia (N=7, SACS 42.36 present/35.57 absent, p=0.0139), LGA (N=34, SACS 36.84 present/35.63 absent, p=0.0326). CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant higher Modified SACS in this study were associated with maternal HTN/gestational HTN, preeclampsia, thalassemia, and fetal LGA. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This is a preliminary analysis of the data of a non-validated OSA screening tool in pregnancy, which will encompass L&D visits from May 2007 to December 2012. An estimated 3,300+ patients will be included in the final analysis. Adverse maternal/fetal outcomes have been reported in patients with OSA. We will perform a multi-center prospective study using home sleep studies to validate the modified SACS as a screening questionnaire for OSA during pregnancy. A validated questionnaire may have clinical value in identifying patients for further diagnostic testing and treatment.

N2  - Introduction: It is well established that sleep duration and quality decline in late pregnancy and that there is an increase in the occurrence of certain sleep disorders. There has, however, been limited research focused on the possible association with depression during this life stage, which was the aim of the present study. Methods: Women participating in the E Moe, Mama : Sleep and Maternal Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study provided demographic information and completed questions on sleep, symptoms of sleep disorders and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) between 35-37 weeks gestation. Scores on the EPDS were dichotomised as ≥13 vs <13 and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between sleep (duration, quality, snoring, breathing pauses, leg twitching, restless legs, insomnia) and significant depressive symptoms. All models included ethnicity, age, socioeconomic position, parity, prior history of depression, life stress, relationship status and sleep prior to pregnancy (with the exception of symptoms of restless legs). Results: Data were obtained from 376 Maori (mean age = 28 y, SD = 6 y) and 713 non-Maori women (mean age = 32 y, SD = 5 y). Of those women, 17.8% scored ≥13 on the EPDS; 9.7% slept ≤5 hrs per night; 50.1% had <3 good nights of sleep in the past week; 21.9% frequently snored, 5.3% had breathing pauses, 13.6% had frequent leg twitching/jerking, 16.4% had restless legs and 80.5% reported insomnia symptoms. Logistic regression analyses showed that ≤5 hrs sleep per night (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.0-7.2), <3 good nights of sleep a week (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), frequent snoring (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2), frequent leg twitching (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.5), and insomnia symptoms (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.3-10.2) were independently associated with an EPDS score ≥13. A history of depression, life stress and relationship status were also consistently associated with depressive symptoms but ethnicity, age, socioeconomic position and parity were not. Discussion: Changes in sleep and symptoms of sleep disorders were independent predictors of significant depressive symptoms in late pregnancy, suggesting that maternity health care providers should be identifying women with sleep problems and referring them for further assessment and treatment.

N2  - Background: OSA is strongly linked to depression with clinically depressive symptoms commonly regarded as consequences of OSA. Poor sleep in pregnancy has been associated with an increase in depressive symptoms. It is possible that poor sleep in pregnancy is the result of OSA which has been shown to increase during pregnancy. Snoring in pregnancy, assessed by questionnaire has been shown to be significantly related to EPDS scores > 10, indicating depressive symptoms. This abstract presents preliminary data from an ongoing study examining the relationship between OSA and EPDS. Methods: 16 women >28 weeks singleton pregnant at King Edward Memorial Hospital were monitored overnight using an ApneaLink-plus device (nasal pressure, oximetry and respiratory effort). They also completed the EPDS and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). ApneaLink data were exported into compumedics profusion software and manual scoring performed using a hypopnea definition which included a minimum 30% decline in flow with a 3% drop in Sp02. Oxygen desaturation/hr (ODI) was calculated at 2%, 3% and 4%. Logistic transformation was performed on ODI2%, ODI3%, ODI4%and AHI and ANOVA regression was performed against EPDS. Preliminary Results: 16 women aged 32 ± 5 yrs (range = 24-42) were studied. EPDS scores were 8.3 ± 4.5 (range, 1-15). AHI was 1.6 ± 1.5 events/hr (range, 0-5.3). Only one woman had OSA (AHI > 5). No statistically significant relationships were found between EPDS scores and AHI (r = 0.18, p = 0.53), ODI2% (r = 0.17, p = 0.72), ODI3% (r = 0.17, p = 0.53) or ODI4% (r = 0.3, p = 0.28). Conclusion: The relatively high EPDS scores may reflect the population studied, being hospital inpatients. No relationships were noted between any measure of sleep disordered breathing and depressive symptoms, although the study is limited by the low number of women with OSA. Data collection is ongoing.

N2  - Introduction: Physiological and psychological changes that occur during pregnancy and postnatally are associated with changes in women's sleep quantity and quality. Long-itudinal data on such changes in Maori (M) and non-Maori (nM) women in NZ are limited. Method: The E Moe, Mama : Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/NZ study collected sleep data: pre-pregnancy (T1); late pregnancy (35- 37 wks) (T2); 4-6 wks post-natal (T3); and 11-13 wks post-natal (T4). Questionnaires were completed at T2 (including retrospective items for T1) and T4 and a brief phone call conducted at T3. Sleep duration was measured using self-reported total sleep time (TST) across 24 hrs including naps at T1, T2, T3 & T4. Sleep quality included the number of good night's sleep across a week (GNS) at T1, T2 & T4, and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale Total Score (GSDS-T) and Sleep Quality subscale (GSDS-Q) at T2 & T4 (higher values = greater disturbance). Results: Discussion: Univariate analyses indicate that late pregnancy is a time of shorter and more disturbed sleep for women. This may be a crucial time for support and intervention for women with sleep difficulties. Few differences by ethnicity emerged, with TST pre-pregnancy being the only significantly different variable. Maori women slept longer at T1 which may be explained, in part, by a younger sample. Sleep duration and quality did not return to pre-pregnancy levels by 11-13 wks postnatal. Results warrant further investigation of sleep differences over time taking into account other possible confounding factors. (Table Presented).

N2  - Rationale: Gestational perturbations such as maternal over- or under-nutrition, stress, are associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases in the offspring. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy. Our data suggest that increased somatic weight and altered glucose homeostasis occur in the offspring following sleep fragmentation (SF) during late gestation. Epigenetics plays a significant mechanistic role in enabling the gestational environment to influence the developmental trajectory through modulation of gene expression. We hypothesized that epigenetic misregulation in selected master regulators of metabolism genes, such as Foxo1 (Forkhead box O1), may account for such altered phenotype in the SF offspring. Dysregulation of Foxo1 function has been implicated in diabetes and insulin resistance. Since the reversibility of epigenetic states offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention, we hypothesized that the epigenetic abnormalities induced by SF during late gestation can be reversed by physical activity. Methods: Pregnant mice were underwent SF (every 2 min during daylight) from day 14 until day 19 of gestation. Physical activity in offspring group consisted in walking in a motorized wheel for 30 min., 3 times per week for 4 weeks. At different time points livers were harvested and epigenetic analyses were performed. DNA and histone epigenetic modifications were analyzed by Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) techniques. Results: Late gestation SF induced transgenerational misregulation of Foxo1 gene by epigenetic mechanisms, and such alterations were accompanied by alterations in metabolism manifesting as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. The epigenetic signature of these abnormalities in Foxo1 gene included DNA 5-hydroxymethyl-CpG and histone modifications and regulatory noncoding RNAs in the promoter region of Foxo1, and also in regions more distal to the transcription start site. We found that Foxo1 increased expression in the liver of SF offspring correlated with up regulation of some of the known Foxo1 downstream gene targets involved in liver gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, these epigenetic abnormalities were reversed by instituting physical activity during early life of the offspring but not later in life. Conclusions: SF during late gestation induces metabolic dysfunction in the offspring and transgenerational deregulation of Foxo1 gene by epigenetic mechanisms. The epigenetic abnormalities in the Foxo1 gene in the offspring induced by SF during late gestation can be reversed by instituting physical activity, but such reversibility appears to be restricted to a defined window of opportunity during post-natal life.
