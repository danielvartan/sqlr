AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children. DESIGN: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency ( < or = 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

AB  - Background: Trauma-exposed women may be at magnified risk for posttraumatic stress (PTSS) and depression symptoms in the perinatal period, but few studies have examined symptomatology across the perinatal period in high-risk samples. Further, the role of sleep in perinatal symptomatology has been largely neglected in the violence literature, despite its well-established associations to mental health in other samples. This study aimed to examine the trajectory of PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period and the effects of childhood adversity, intimate partner violence and prenatal sleep impairment on PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period.Method: In a longitudinal, prospective study, 101 low-income pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy, at 6-weeks postpartum, and 4 months postpartum. N = 83 women completed at least 2 interviews and were included in the analyses. Prenatal sleep, childhood adversity, and IPV exposure were assessed at the prenatal interview; PTSS and depression were assessed at all interviews.Results: Past year IPV was associated with elevated prenatal mental health symptoms and prenatal sleep difficulties were associated with a worsening trajectory in perinatal PTSS.Conclusions: Screening for IPV and prenatal sleep difficulties may be paramount in identifying those at risk for the development or exacerbation of mental health symptoms in the perinatal period.

AB  - Background: Becoming the parent of a new baby comes with a range of challenges including difficulties with emotional adjustment, couple relationship issues and difficulty managing common infant behaviors, such as crying and sleep problems. This time can be especially challenging for couples who experience a range of risk factors. Previous parenting interventions for parents of babies have shown mixed results. This protocol paper describes a randomized controlled trial of a group-based parenting intervention for high-risk parents expecting their first baby.Methods/design: Participants will be randomized to either Group Baby Triple P or Care as Usual (CAU). Group Baby Triple P involves 4 × 2 h group sessions delivered during pregnancy and 4 individual telephone sessions of 30 min each in the early postnatal period. Outcomes will be assessed via parent self-report questionnaire, home observations and a baby diary 10 weeks and 6 months post-birth. Primary outcomes will be parental confidence and perceived competence. Secondary outcomes will include parental responsiveness and bonding with the baby, relationship happiness, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and stress, and infant crying and sleep. Analyses will involve a series of rANOVA and rMANOVAs, t-tests and a multilevel modeling approach.Discussion: A brief summary, strengths and potential implications are discussed.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ANZCTR 12613000948796 .

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Both restless legs syndrome ([RLS], also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease [WED]) and depression are common during pregnancy. However, no prior studies have assessed if pregnant women with RLS have an elevated risk of depression during and/or after pregnancy. METHODS: 1,428 women who were pregnant in gestational week 16-17 were asked to participate in a longitudinal survey. They were followed by web-based questionnaires in gestational week 17 and 32, and 6 weeks after delivery. Data were also retrieved from prenatal and birth records. Two different sets of criteria were used to examine the prevalence of RLS in the cohort (International Restless Legs Syndrome Society Group standard criteria and the later developed CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire). The latter questionnaire attempts to exclude those with common 'mimics' of RLS. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio for depression in gestational week 17, 32, and postpartum week 6 in relation to pre-pregnancy RLS onset and moderate to severe symptom severity were 4.74 (2.30 - 9.76), 3.67 (1.85 - 7.28), and 2.58 (1.28 - 5.21), respectively. No significant associations were seen in pregnant women with de novo RLS during pregnancy. When using the standard diagnostic RLS criteria and frequency of symptoms more than 2-3 days per week, the prevalence of RLS was 12.3%. With the CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire and the same threshold for frequency of symptoms the prevalence was 6.5%. CONCLUSION: Women with RLS onset before pregnancy with moderate or severe symptoms had an increased risk of both antenatal and postnatal depression. The self-reported prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is lower when a questionnaire dealing with 'mimics' is used. CITATION: Wesström J, Skalkidou A, Manconi M, Fulda S, Sundström-Poromaa I.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge.Methods: Infants born ≤32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their respiratory stability once they were ≥35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive apnoea indices and correlations tested.Results: Twenty-four infants completed the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the modified polysomnography.Conclusion: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in preterm infants ready for discharge.

AB  - A newborn infant's early attentive behavior to maternal vocalization is known to promote early interaction between the mother and the infant. Full-term infants at birth can recognize their mothers' voices. It is believed that this early ability of newborn infants is acquired from prenatal experience with the mother's voice. The mother's voice is the most salient sound in the uterus, and the fetus can hear sound beginning of 24 weeks gestation. However, preterm infants are born with insufficient prenatal vocal experience and an immature auditory system which is more sensitive to low frequency sounds than high frequency sounds. Preterm infants have minimal exposure to the human voice in the NICU but are exposed to loud mechanical noises. Preteen infant may hear the male voice better than the female voice to produce attentive behaviors.The purpose of this study was to examine preterm infants' responsiveness to female and male voice over time. Nineteen preterm infants (< 32 weeks gestation) were enrolled in the study. The sleep/awake state, motor (stress and self-regulatory) behavior, and autonomic (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) responses were recorded by a Gould Recording System and two digital video cameras. The data was collected once a week from 32 weeks post-conceptional age through hospital discharge. Changes from baseline in each infant's responses during the vocal stimulation and during the post-vocal stimulation were analyzed using a chi square test and MANOVA.Results indicated that the drowsy state increased during vocal stimulation and after vocal stimulation the asleep state increased. The heart rate of the preterm infant increased slightly during vocal stimulation but decreased after vocal stimulation. Overall, the vocal stimulation did not evoke either stress or self-regulatory responses during presentation. The difference in the preterm infant responses to the male and the female voices was not statistically significant.Vocal stimulation has some benefit for the preterm infant as evidenced by increased sleep state, no stress responses, and the cardiac orienting response. These data provide an insight into the early auditory responses of the preterm intent to human voice, with implications for both parent(s) and health care providers to enhance early interaction between the parents and the infants in the NICU.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and to evaluate factors associated with RLS in a population of Iranian pregnant women.Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive pregnant women admitted for delivery underwent an interview within 2 days of parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale.Results: Seventy-nine (17.8%) women met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 ± 2.1 months among 69 (87.3%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio 2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and neonatal anthropometric data.Conclusion: Restless legs syndrome is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean delivery.

AB  - Objectives To examine: (1) the prevalence and characteristics of bed-sharing among non-Hispanic Black and White infants in Georgia, and (2) differences in bed-sharing and sleep position behaviors prior to and after the American Academy of Pediatrics' 2005 recommendations against bed-sharing. Methods Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective. Rao-Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results A total of 6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011. Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported 'ever' bed-sharing compared to White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000-2004 to 2006-2011, a total of 10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites. Conclusions for Practice Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the importance of tailored messaging. Specific research and practice implications are identified and described.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results. METHODS: Sixty-one clinicians across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics, disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP. RESULTS: The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%, respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age, depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more advanced stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with a higher risk vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account, obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were associated with PGP.

AB  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is not only a severe public health issue that jeopardizes maternal and foetal health but also violates human rights. The aim was to explore the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence among pregnant women, in the southwestern region of Scania in Sweden, and their experience of a history of violence. In addition, to explore the association between domestic violence during pregnancy and possible risk factors.Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort-study including pregnant women ≥18 years of age, registered at antenatal care when pregnant. A cohort of 1939 pregnant women answered Questionnaire I (QI) in gestational week 13 (mean 12.8 week, SD 5.11). Response rate of Questionnaire II (QII) in gestation week 34 (mean 33.9 week, SD 2.2) was 78.8 % (n = 1527). Statistical analysis was descriptive statistics, logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).Results: Both QI and QII were completed by 77.8 % (n = 1509) of the women and 44.3 % (n = 668) reported a lifetime experience of abuse irrespective of type, severity or perpetrator. Also, 5.1 % (n = 77) reported some experience of abuse past year. Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 2.0 % (n = 29) and the incidence was 7.3 new cases per 1000 women. The strongest risk factor for domestic violence, during early and late pregnancy, was history of violence whereby all women who disclosed exposure had also reported history of violence (p < 0.001). To be single/living apart gave 8.4 times more risk associated with domestic violence during pregnancy (AOR 8.4; 95 % CI: 2.2-32.6). Having several symptoms of depression and lack of sleep gave 3.8 times more risk respectively (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI: 1.1-13.6) and (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI 1.1-12.9).Conclusions: Pregnant women with a history of violence as well as being single/living apart and/or having several symptoms of depression during pregnancy should be alerts for clinical working midwives and obstetricians. Further, this is important knowledge for health care providers to develop or upgrade guidelines and plans of action for pregnant women exposed to violence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized in the Western world as a public health burden, but there has been no community-based study performed to assess the prevalence of the condition in India. The study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population. DESIGN: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study. SETTING: A semi-urban community in Delhi.Duration: Two years (2003 to 2005).Patients and participants: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy. INTERVENTION: An OSA assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage 1 of the study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80 nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies.Observations and results: A total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550 habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73 nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant risk factors for OSAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion bias.

AB  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious public health issue which threatens maternal and foetal health outcomes. The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of depression and sense of coherence.Methods: This study has a cross-sectional design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria were women ≥ 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by 39.5% (n =761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart, unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18); history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment, age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3).Conclusions: The reported prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health.

AB  - Problem/Condition: Various maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy (e.g., unintended pregnancy, late entry into prenatal care, cigarette smoking, not breast-feeding) are associated with adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Information regarding maternal behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends, to enhance the understanding of the relations between behaviors and health outcomes, to plan and evaluate programs, to direct policy decisions, and to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives.Reporting Period Covered: This report covers data from 1993 through 1999.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver a live-born infant. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with a telephone interview. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets. PRAMS generates statewide estimates of various perinatal health topics among women delivering a live infant. Data for 1999 from 17 states are examined. In addition, trend data are examined for 12 states that had at least 3 years of data during 1993--1999.Results: In 1999, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy resulting in a live birth ranged from 33.7% to 52% across the 17 states. During 1993--1999, only one state reported a decreasing trend in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy. Women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care ranged from 16.1% to 29.9%. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care significantly decreased over time in seven of the 12 states with trend data. In general, women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report late or no entry into prenatal care. The prevalence of smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 6.2% to 27.2%, and the prevalence decreased in five states from 1993 to 1999. Overall, smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy was associated with younger age (<25 years), non-Hispanic ethnicity, having less than or equal to a high . school education, receiving Medicaid, and delivering a low birthweight infant. The prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during pregnancy ranged from 2.1% to 6.3%. No trends were observed for physical abuse from 1996 to 1999, the only years for which these data were available. Across the 17 states, only Medicaid status was consistently associated with experiencing physical abuse during pregnancy. The prevalence of breast-feeding initiation ranged from 48% to 89%. Ten of 12 states with trend data reported increases in the prevalence of breast-feeding initiation. Overall, women aged <20 years, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were less likely to breast-feed. The prevalence of breast-feeding duration for at least 4 weeks ranged from 34.9% to 78.1%. From 1993 to 1999, increases in levels of breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks were observed in eight states. Women aged <25 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were generally less likely to breast-feed for at least 4 weeks. The prevalence of back sleep position for infants ranged from 35.1% to 74.6%. Increases in the use of the back sleep position were observed in all 12 states with trend data from 1996 to 1999. Black race and having less than or equal to a high school education were consistently associated with not using the back sleep position.Interpretation: For surveillance during 1993--1999, the majority or all states observed increases in breast-feeding initiation, breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks, and back sleep position. Approximately one half of the states observed decreases for late or no entry into prenatal care and smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Little or no progress was observed in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy or physical abuse during pregnancy.With few exceptions, the 17 states failed to meet the Healthy People 2000 objectives for the seven reported behaviors in 1999. Certain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of women were associated with an increased risk for several of the behaviors, including younger age, black race, less education, and receipt of Medicaid just before or during pregnancy.Public Health Action: State maternal and child health programs can use these population-based data for reporting on core and state-negotiated performance measures of the Title V Block Grant Measurement Performance System. The data, which are important in planning and evaluation programs, help identify whether target populations are receiving services and help identify barriers to or gaps in services. The data can be shared with policy makers to direct policy decisions that might affect the health of mothers and infants. In addition, these findings can be used to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010 objectives.

AB  - Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N=160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks' gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient ( p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep deficiency across all time points ( p=0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior. METHOD: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. RESULTS: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. CONCLUSION: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study.

AB  - Introduction: recent studies suggest that women with gestational diabetes are more likely to suffer sleep disorders compared to pregnant women without diabetes. The objectives of this study were to analyze the risk factors associated with gestational diabetes and to verify if exist an association between the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes and the quality of the sleep and/or daytime sleepiness. Material and methods: case-controls study with a sample of 130 pregnant women, 46 of them with gestational diabetes and 84 controls. Anthropometric parameters such as weight, stature, body mass index (BMI) and abdominal perimeter were evaluated. Socio-demographic variables, including age and family situation were assessed, and a gynecological study was performed, evaluating the number of simple or multiple births, number of miscarriages and gynecological pathology during the past 3 years. The O'Sullivan test was conducted for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The quality of sleep and daytime sleepiness were also measured. Results: 46 women were diagnosed of gestational diabetes. There are significant differences (p < 0.001) in BMI scores among women with gestational diabetes and controls, being the highest values in the diabetic group. There is a significant association (p = 0.002) between the existence of family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes present a significant worse quality of sleep (p < 0.001), and values of daytime sleepiness higher than the general population. Conclusions: high values of BMI or family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be factors associated to the risk of suffer gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes have a poorer quality of sleep and a higher degree of daytime sleepiness than the general population, reducing the well-being of the mother and the fetus.
AB  - Introducción: estudios recientes sugieren que las mujeres con diagnóstico de diabetes gestacional tienen más probabilidad de padecer trastornos del sueño en comparación con el resto de las mujeres embarazadas. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron analizar los factores de riesgo asociados a diabetes gestacional y verificar una asociación entre padecer o no diabetes gestacional y la calidad del sueño y/o somnolencia. Material y métodos: estudio observacional de casos y controles a partir de una muestra de 130 gestantes, 46 con diabetes gestacional y 84 controles. Se realizó una valoración antropométrica, evaluando peso, estatura, índice de masa corporal (IMC) y perímetro abdominal. Se realizó una valoración sociodemográfica, evaluando edad y situación familiar y laboral, así como un studio ginecológico, evaluando número de partos simples y múltiples, número de abortos y patología ginecológica durante los últimos tres años. Para el diagnóstico de diabetes gestacional se realizó el test de O‘Sullivan. Se midió la calidad del sueño y la somnolencia diurna. Resultados: del total de gestantes estudiadas, 46 fueron diagnosticadas de diabetes gestacional. Existen diferencias significativas (p < 0,001) en las puntuaciones del IMC entre gestantes diabéticas y no diabéticas, siendo sus valores más elevados entre las diabéticas. Existe una asociación significativa (p = 0,002) entre la existencia de antecedentes familiares de diabetes mellitus tipo 2 y padecer o no diabetes gestacional. Las gestantes diabéticas presentan un significativo empeoramiento (p < 0,001) de la calidad del sueño. Respecto a la somnolencia diurna, las gestantes diabéticas poseen una somnolencia diurnal superior a la media poblacional. Conclusiones: en la población estudiada, puntuaciones elevadas en el IMC, así como antecedentes familiares de confordiabetes mellitus tipo 2 parecen ser factores asociados al riesgo de padecer diabetes gestacional. Las embarazadas con diabetes gestacional poseen una peor calidad del sueño y un grado de somnolencia diurna superior al de la media poblacional, reduciéndose con ello el bienestar de la madre y del feto.

AB  - Obesity is one of the major health problems and a determining factor in the prevalence of diseases such as metabolic syndrome, asthma, sleep apnea, infertility and various types of cancer. Its origin is multifactorial, involving genetic, socioeconomic and environmental factors. These last ones contribute mostly to explain the current epidemic growth of this disease. The sedentary lifestyle, inadequate diet, lack of sleep, alterations in intestinal microbiota and stress are factors related to its development. Since Barker presented his hypothesis about the "fetal origin of adult diseases", there are increasing number of studies that show the influence of an inadequate nutritional status and maternal weight in the development of chronic diseases, as obesity in offspring. The nutritional deficiencies of the pregnant mother cause epigenetic modifications and abnormal programming of the development oforgans and devices, adapting the fetus to this situation of deficiency and being able to adapt to an obesogenic environment after birth, increasing its propensity to obesity. Also, poor maternal nutritional status is related to intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight infants, with a higher risk of childhood and adult central obesity. Currently, deficient intake of micronutrients and overweight or maternal obesity tend to overlap, and this combination may exacerbate the increase in obesity in the offspring. It is important to identify pregnant mothers at risk of suffering nutritional alterations and establish their improvement as a primary prevention strategy for overweight and obesity.
AB  - La obesidad es uno de los mayores problemas de salud y un factor determinante del padecimiento de enfermedades prevalentes como síndrome metabólico, asma, apnea del sueño, infertilidad y diferentes tipos de cáncer. Su origen es multifactorial, interviniendo factores genéticos, socioeconómicos y ambientales. Siendo estos últimos los que más contribuyen a explicar el crecimiento epidémico actual. El sedentarismo, dieta inadecuada, falta de sueño, alteraciones en la microbiota intestinal y el estrés, son factores relacionados con su desarrollo. Desde que Barker presentó su hipótesis sobre el origen fetal de las enfermedades del adulto, son cada día más el número de estudios que evidencian la influencia de un inadecuado estado nutricional y ponderal materno en el desarrollo de enfermedades crónicas, como la obesidad en el descendiente. Las deficiencias nutricionales de la madre gestante ocasionan modificaciones epigenéticas y una programación anormal del desarrollo de órganos y aparatos, adaptándose el feto a esta situación de carencia y pudiendo tener dificultad de adaptación ante un ambiente obesogénico después del nacimiento, aumentando su propensión a la obesidad. También, el deficiente estado nutricional materno está relacionado con retraso del crecimiento intrauterino y neonatos de bajo peso al nacer, siendo mayor el riesgo de obesidad central infantil y del adulto. Actualmente, la ingesta deficiente de micronutrientes y el sobrepeso u obesidad materna tienden a superponerse, y esta combinación puede exacerbar el aumento de obesidad en el descendiente. Es importante identificar a las madres gestantes con riesgo de padecer alteraciones nutricionales y establecer su mejora como estrategia de prevención primaria del sobrepeso y obesidad.

AB  - Background: Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities. Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care.Methods/design: This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded "Well Child" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to "Well Child" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6 months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia.Discussion: Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials NCT00892983.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. RESULTS: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P<.05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<.05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P>.05). CONCLUSION: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS.

AB  - PurposeThis study was conducted for the purpose of assessing the validity of having pregnant women monitor their own pregnancies by producing a self-monitoring check sheet relating to self-care during pregnancy.MethodsSurvey 1 : A survey was conducted on 55 pregnant women in which the subjects were asked to describe their experiences and opinions relating to maintaining and promoting health during pregnancy.Surveys 2 and 3 : A survey was conducted on 31 pregnant women (in week 19 to 38 of pregnancy) for 7 to 8 days in which the subjects were asked to monitor their pregnancies using a check sheet in addition to measuring the amounts of walking and physical activity, recording waking and sleeping times, sleep time and dietary contents (Survey 2). In survey 3, the levels of apprehension and depression were measured before and after monitoring and the subjects were interviewed.ResultsA check sheet (daily maternity check sheet) was produced consisting of the 10 items of sleeping status, fetal movement, abdomen and bleeding, body weight, diet, exercise, daily activities, mood (comfort), maternal image and communication with the fetus, along with a column for allowing subjects to write down any comments they may have. In Surveys 2 and 3, there was a correlation between monitoring of the amount of walking and exercise and monitoring relating to sleep time and sleep status, fetal movement and abdominal distention.The amount of daily activity during the day, abdominal distention and psychological state had an effect on sleeping. (3) Agreement was confirmed between dietary contents, the contents of comments written by the subjects and monitoring. (4) It was possible to objectively make a retrospective assessment of the behavior and emotional state of pregnant women through self-monitoring.ConclusionThe use of a daily maternity check sheet was confirmed to enable pregnant women to implement objective self-monitoring of their pregnancies with only a minimal burden.

AB  - Objective: To characterize sleep patterns among pregnant women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization.Study design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization after 20 weeks’ gestation. Women were recruited to wear an Actigraph, complete a sleep log for 7 consecutive days, and complete a sleep survey at the end of the study period. Actigraphy was used to determine rest and sleep intervals, sleep onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset.Results: A total of 40 participants were recruited, and 28 had ≥ 5 nights of data for a total of 177 nights of antepartum sleep data. Mean gestational age was 30 weeks. Median sleep duration was 7.05 h ± 1.71 h. In all, 43.5% of women had an average sleep duration of <7 h per night. In all, 28.2% of the study nights had a bedtime between midnight and 5 am. Going to bed between midnight and 5 am was significantly associated with sleep durations of <7 h (70.7 vs. 32.5%, p < .001). Participants reported an average of 2.4 awakenings per night due to hospital-related events.Conclusions: Prolonged antepartum hospitalization has a negative impact on sleep duration and quality.

AB  - Background: African-American (AA) women have poorer pregnancy outcomes, and studies in nonpregnant women suggest a different etiology of weight gain in AA compared with white women. We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy. Objective: We aimed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy. Design: This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers.Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine. Results: AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean ± SEM: 27.7 ± 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean ± SEM (in kg/m2): 36.9 ± 0.7], and body fat (mean ± SEM: 45.0%±0.6%). AA women had more fat-freemass (P=0.01) and tended to be more insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06). Energy intake was signifi- cantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 ± 76 compared with 2769 ± 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 ± 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 ± 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 ± 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 ± 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01954342.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves episodic nocturnal apneas. Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent polysomnography and FHM for > or =3 hours. The relationship between maternal characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were controlled for potential confounders. RESULTS: When compared with polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and 63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with oxygen desaturation <95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder (r(s) = 0.44; P < .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities and OSA parameters. CONCLUSION: In pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire poorly predicts OSA. It is unclear whether fetal compromise during maternal apnea is a mechanism in OSA that is related to pregnancy outcome.

AB  - This single case outlines the acupuncture treatment of a 34-year-old female patient with chronic pain from psoriatic arthritis. She presented with multiple painful and inflamed joints, including in the hips, shoulders, lumbar spine, jaw, fingers, and toes. She experienced significant pain, which interrupted her sleep and kept her from focusing her attention on a daily basis. Concurrently, she and her partner hoped to conceive and were concerned with pregnancy risks associated with her pain medications. After 21 acupuncture treatments over the course of 14 weeks, the patient experienced relief to the extent that she was able to completely eliminate the use of pain medication before conceiving with her partner. At various stages in this case, a variety of acupuncture approaches were applied, including methods from traditional Chinese medicine, five element constitutional acupuncture, and Japanese styles of acupuncture. This case demonstrates the clinical choices made in the application of various acupuncture modalities along this patient's treatment course. Using case reports such as this to discern the strengths, weaknesses, and best applications of each style may be useful in guiding the evolution of acupuncture practice.

AB  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and(b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant (31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation.

AB  - Background: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum. Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥ .97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient > .87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity. Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions.

AB  - Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population.Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS.Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1α=.754; Factor 2α=.524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established.Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women.

AB  - Study Objectives: We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among pregnant Peruvian women.Methods: A cohort of 642 women were interviewed at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation. During interview, we ascertained information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment scales, respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used.Results: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep medication. We observed significantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42), the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had significantly increased odds of experiencing stress-induced sleep disturbance (odds ratio, OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.40, 5.31), depression (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 3.58, 8.37), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.57; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.76).Conclusion: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three, factor-specific scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study was to examine the levels of fatigue that primiparous women experience during childbirth and its association with maternal factors. A convenient sample consisting of 100 primiparous women interviewed on admission to the labor and delivery unit of a large suburban hospital was obtained. These women were interviewed three times at two-hour intervals during labor unless they delivered before these time periods or were administered epidural anesthesia. The final interview was within twenty-four hours of delivery. The subjective, cognitive and physiological dimensions of fatigue were measured by the Fatigue Symptom Checklist and Visual Analogue Scales, the Digit Span Subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (revised R), and a hand held bulb dynamometer. A repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated that fatigue significantly increased as labor progressed. Fatigue was found to be high for these women as a group when they were admitted to the hospital and it continued to increase during labor. A canonical correlation was computed to determine the best predictors for fatigue. The predictor set of variables included: (1) whether the woman took formal childbirth education classes; (2) the amount of sleep; (3) whether she exercised during the last trimester of pregnancy; (4) whether she worked during the last trimester of pregnancy; (5) her state and trait levels of anxiety; and (6) whether she had been medicated prior to the interview. On admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were, state anxiety, amount of sleep, trait anxiety, and medication. Two hours after admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were previous fatigue, medication and work. Four hours after admission, the variables were medication, previous fatigue, exercise and childbirth education. Six hours after admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were previous fatigue, medication, exercise and work. Within 24 hours after delivery, the greatest predictor of fatigue was previous fatigue. There was a positive correlation between fatigue scores on admission and subsequent fatigue scores during labor. Women who had strong contractions reported significantly higher levels of fatigue at 2, 4 and 6 hours after admission. Women who used intense pattern of breathing exercises reported significantly higher levels of fatigue than those who used slow chest breathing. The total length of labor was significantly correlated with fatigue scores after delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of psychosocial and demographic variables to health behaviors in early pregnancy. DESIGN: First trimester findings presented from a prospective study of weight gain in pregnancy. SETTING: A comprehensive health care system in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: 114 pregnant women (75% white, 13% African American, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian) of 12 weeks gestation or less. OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-Care Inventory, which includes diet/eating, substance abuse, recklessness, hygiene-related practices, sleep/rest, and exercise behaviors. RESULTS: In regression analysis the final model of demographic and psychosocial variables showed that higher depressive symptoms, lower internal locus of control for fetal health, and lower family income were related to poorer health behaviors in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Health behaviors in early pregnancy may be affected by psychosocial factors such as depressive symptoms. Greater emphasis should be given to such factors in research and prenatal assessments.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis apply in a general sample of perinatal women.Method: 101 women in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R).Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted.Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

AB  - Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a growing population of patients. Medical and surgical advances have increased the number of CHD adult survivors, which may create quality-of-life (QOL) issues not previously considered. Quality-of-life issues pertinent to this patient population involve health and life insurance acquisition, birth control, genetic counseling, pregnancy concerns, employment, and independent living arrangements. The purpose of this study was to describe the QOL of adults with CHD. The study used a prospective cross-sectional case-control design to examine QOL using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The study participants were a sample of 124 adults with CHD from an outpatient cardiology clinic in a metropolitan university-affiliated teaching hospital in the Northeast and 124 matched healthy control subjects. Between the participants and the matched control subjects, there was a significant difference in the total mean SIP score, the physical and psychosocial dimension scores, and all the category scores (P < 0.05). The areas of life the adults with CHD reported as lacking in quality involved the categories of work (SIP of 11.1, moderate disability) and sleep and rest (SIP of 9.03, mild disability). The results of this study indicate that the SIP can be used for quantitative and subjective QOL assessment of adults with CHD. It is suggested that cardiac advanced practice nurses use the results of this study to develop appropriate information, counseling, and anticipatory guidance for this patient population.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates.Methods: Newborn infants (≥35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated.Results: Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 ± 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p = 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores.Conclusions: Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

AB  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother-child pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. RESULTS: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life.

AB  - Objectives Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15-44 years) in the US. Methods Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant ( p < 0.01)]. Significantly fewer pregnant and non-pregnant minority women reported adequate sleep (7-8 h) than non-Hispanic white (white) women ( p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same trends were found. Discussion Compared to white women, minority women, despite reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping, providing evidence of an important health disparity.

AB  - Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p < .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

AB  - Aim: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <32weeks gestation spending a greater proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP).Methods: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP post-extubation had sleep and wake activity measured by actigraphy for 72hours post-extubation. Activity diaries were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling. Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the analysis.Results: 28 infants with mean gestation of 28.3weeks (SD 2) and birth weight 1074g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those on NCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8) p=0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean activity score than those on NCPAP (p=0.003, p=0.002, respectively).Conclusion: Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infants are at risk of overweight. Infant overweight predisposes child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education, initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of infant overweight at age 12 months. METHODS: Pregnant obese Latina women were recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention subjects received home visits by trained Spanish-fluent community health workers who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects. RESULTS: Compared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight. Infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6 months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12 months (r = 0.60, P < .0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants at ages 6 months (P < .06) and 12 months (P = .005). Breastfeeding was less common in families with employed mothers (P = .02) and unemployed fathers (P < .01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P < .003). Compared to formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for infants breastfed for ≥2 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of success of the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.

AB  - Background: Young adulthood is a critical life period for health and health behaviours. Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the Raine Study cohort. Methods/design: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics, medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors, spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography. Discussion: Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health across adulthood.

AB  - Changes in prenatal care practices resulted from a pilot study with 12 urban New Mexican women who received no prenatal care. The women were interviewed regarding their reasons for not receiving care during pregnancy, health behaviors, and perceived neonatal outcomes. Data on actual neonatal outcomes were taken from the medical record. Maternal reasons for no prenatal care were socio-demographic, system- related, attitudinal, and outside forces of job and childcare. To ensure a healthy baby, the women made changes in their nutrition, self-care activities, substance use, sleep, and exercise activities. All of the women perceived they had a healthy baby. Yet 61 % of the neonates had complications and 45% were low birth weight. The research findings were used to develop a care management program that included case management and utilization management.

AB  - Epidemiological reports describe a child population increase in BP level and an increase in prevalence of hypertension, that is largely, but not entirely, driven by a concurrent increase in childhood obesity. Given current estimates, ≈10% of adolescents have hypertension or prehypertension. In addition to obesity, dietary salt intake and waist circumference, a marker of visceral obesity, are found to be independently associated with the rise in BP among children and adolescents. Dietary salt intake in urban children is well above recommended levels largely because of consumption of processed and fast foods. Childhood exposures, such as stress,52 salt, and fructose, as well as lifestyles, including food sources, sleep patterns, and reductions in physical activity may have a role in obesity-high BP associations. In addition, clinical and translational evidence is mounting that intrauterine exposures alter can effect changes in fetal development that have an enduring effect on cardiovascular and metabolic function later in life. These effects can be detected even in children who are products of a term otherwise normal pregnancy. Hypertension in childhood has been defined statistically (BP ≥ 95th percentile) because of lack of outcome data that links a BP level with heightened risk for future cardiovascular events. Therefore, primary hypertension had been considered a risk factor for later hypertension in adulthood. Intermediate markers of TOD, including cardiac hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and increases in cIMT, are detectable in adolescents with primary hypertension. Evidence that vascular injury is present in the early phase of hypertension and even in prehypertension warrants consideration on the current definition of pediatric hypertension. With further studies on TOD and other risk factors in addition to high BP, it may be possible to shift from a statistical definition to a definition of childhood hypertension that is evidence based. Preventing or reducing childhood obesity would have substantial benefit in countering the documented increase in BP levels and prevalence of high BP in childhood. Weight control in overweight and obese children, along with dietary changes 53 and increases in physical activity,54 has benefit on BP levels in childhood. Prevention of childhood obesity and BP risk will require multiple levels of intervention, including public health, health policy, and attention to food supply to foster the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.
