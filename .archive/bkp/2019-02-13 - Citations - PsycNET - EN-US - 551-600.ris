N2  - Comments on an article by Brandi L. Joyner, Carmen Gill- Bailey and Rachel Y. Moon (see record 2010-04284-003). Their article is effective in pointing out that in our office waiting rooms and clinics, 64% of magazine pictures that show sleeping infants who are not being held by an adult are in the prone position. In addition, many more of our waiting-room magazine pictures show infants sleeping together with another person. We should applaud the authors for their important work, but we should also berate ourselves for accepting the status quo and distributing the offending magazine literature for people to read. We have an obligation to remove the harmful magazines that illustrate unsafe sleep environments from our premises and then write to the publisher, explaining the potential harm of providing literature in their publications that is contrary to accepted safety recommendations. Their article recognizes a health problem, but the rest should be up to us, starting with removing the offending magazines from our offices and then explaining to our patients' families why we did so.

N2  - Presents an obituary of Ed Bromfield (1951–2009). Ed Bromfield was a truly loved colleague, mentor, and friend to many in the neurology, epilepsy, and other communities. A gentle giant, he was equal parts compassion, passion, and intelligence. Ed was an active academician, authoring and co-authoring many, but more importantly, ever thoughtful papers and chapters. His areas of interest in epilepsy included new drug development (felbamate, fosphenytoin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam), neuroimaging (SPECT, PET), psychiatric issues, and epilepsy surgery. Among his other areas of expertise were the diagnosis and treatment of nonepileptic seizures, brain tumors, and epilepsy; sleep and epilepsy; quality of life of people with epilepsy; refractory status epilepticus; omega fatty acids for epilepsy; and effects of maternal drug treatment on pregnancy and fetal outcomes.

N2  - In this study the performance of 75 pregnant women and 25 non-pregnant women was tested using measures of verbal, everyday, and subjective memory. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVEL), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Extended Version (RBMT-E), and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ) were used to determine if differences in memory performance could be detected between the two groups and if there was a specific trimester of pregnancy when memory declined most significantly. The relationships among the tests also were examined. The pregnant group reported significantly more memory problems than the non-pregnant group on the EMQ, which was explained by reported sleep loss; the pregnant group reported significantly more sleep problems than the non-pregnant comparison group. The hypotheses that the pregnant group would perform significantly worse than the non-pregnant group on the RAVLT and RBMT-E tests were not supported by the results. While the objective memory measures showed a moderate relationship with one another, the EMQ showed an insignificant relationship with the IRMBT-E and RAVLT. It is speculated that the discrepancy between the subjective and objective memory test results is due to the pregnant group's ability to overcome mild memory deficits for short periods of time. Popular culture may also play a role in fostering the belief that memory loss occurs during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Despite advances in epilepsy therapeutics, some physicians feel uncomfortable with newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to difficulty in promptly obtaining blood levels to guide medication adjustment, and even when levels for newer AEDs are obtained, many practitioners feel they are not very useful. Lacking confidence in AEDs whose levels that cannot readily or expeditiously be measured, many clinicians share uncertainty about proper use of the newer AEDs and monitoring AED administration. Similarly, some epilepsy patients inflate the importance of AED blood level monitoring, feeling that blood levels falling within traditionally therapeutic ranges are a fail-safe for seizure control, regardless of their compliance or personal behavior aggravating seizure burden, such as poor sleep or use of illicit substances. This review examines the elusive concept of therapeutic AED blood levels and potential uses and abuses of blood level monitoring, reinforcing appropriate uses for blood levels to ensure compliance and adjust for altered AED pharmacokinetics in the context of aging and disease states, pregnancy, or drug interactions.

N2  - The United States is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The majority of American women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. The presence of excess body weight in a woman can negatively impact fertility, pregnancy, postnatal recovery, and the health of her child. Psychiatric comorbidities, including eating and mood disorders, can influence nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss in the postpartum period. Stress associated with care taking in the postpartum period impacts levels of sleep and physical activity, which further impact postpartum weight retention. This article reviews the literature in these areas; the article discusses the management of excess body weight during and after pregnancy as well as related psychiatric conditions in pregnant and postpartum women.

N2  - Activity-rest behaviour of 11 neonates whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy (s-group) and 11 neonates of non-smoking mothers (ns-group) born by Caesarean section (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using Actiwatch® actometers. In addition, a standardised diary was kept regularly. Amount of sleep time during daytime, night time, and 24 h, as well as sleep bouts during daytime and night time, were compared. Both groups showed a significant difference in amount of night time sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at night time. Many adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy are known. We could not, however, detect significant differences in the amount of night time sleep, daytime sleep, and 24h sleep time between the s- and ns-group neonates.

N2  - This study examined the relationship between maternal prenatal attachment and postnatal infant sleep. Ninety first-time pregnant mothers, between 35 and 40 gestational weeks, completed the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (Müller, 1989), which consists of 21 items and assesses the mother's prenatal attachment to her fetus. After the birth of their infant, the mothers charted their infant's sleep for three consecutive 24-hour periods when the infant was 1 week and 3 months old, using the Sleep/Activity Record (Barnard, 1999). Correlational analysis revealed that PAI scores did not correlate with either infant sleep segments or longest sustained sleep. However, the study found an inverted correlation between PAI scores and infant total sleep at one week. The study extends current literature on prenatal to postnatal continuity.

N2  - This study is a review over the results of the researches made on the effects of the new electronic technologies on children. The behavioral problems developed by the children whose mothers were using regularly mobile phones during their pregnancy were: 25% more risk from emotional problems; 35% more risk from difficult relationships with peers and chances to become hyperactive; 50% more proneness to problems with conduct. The children who use frequently the mobile phones develop problems as headache, fatigue, difficulties in concentration, vertigo/dizziness, attention disorders, nervousness, changes in the sleep architecture etc. Not just the use of new gadgets create problems, but also social networking websites as Facebook, Twitter etc. are said to shorten attention span, encourage instant gratification and make young people more self-centered. Starting from these researches from around the world, it is very necessary that also Balkan countries to make studies on the impact of new communication technologies.

N2  - Objective: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. Methods: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother–child pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother’s reported child’s race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. Results: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents the case studies of 28-year-old woman at 37 weeks’ gestation became increasingly confused and forgetful. She slept 12 hours daily, mistook her apartment for previous residences, and forgot her children’s names. She had had a febrile seizure at age 4, and several brief convulsions as a teenager. A sleep-deprived EEG had been negative. She took phenytoin for a year, then stopped prior to her first pregnancy. She had no further convulsions. She could not describe cocktail ingredients, despite working as a bartender, but correctly recited old addresses. Toes were equivocal on the right and downgoing on the left. Sensation and coordination were normal. Gait was narrow-based and slightly unsteady, but she did not fall. This 28-year-old peripartum woman has subacute onset encephalopathy with memory loss and abulia, as well as long tract signs. The widespread distribution of MRI lesions suggests a multifocal process affecting primarily the white matter. CNS vasculopathy, primary or secondary, could explain the distal caliber changes in the middle cerebral arteries. The distinctive corpus callosum lesions in this patient are like the “snowball” lesions that are characteristic of this disease, and high CSF protein is common.4,5 It is not a known complication of pregnancy.

N2  - Study Objectives: This study investigated whether there was a relationship between disrupted sleep and postpartum mood disturbances in women during the week after delivery. Design: Sleep and mood were measured during the third trimester (Time-1) and one week postpartum (Time-2) in a 2-stage longitudinal design. Setting: Participants were recruited from an antenatal clinic in a regional Melbourne hospital. Participants: Forty-four healthy women at low risk for postpartum depression. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy and subjective sleep by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; mood was assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Sleep and mood questionnaires were administered at Time-1 and Time-2. Wrist actigraphy was collected for one week at both times. After delivery, both objective and subjective nighttime sleep significantly worsened with decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, while daytime napping behavior significantly increased. On average, mood improved across all scales after delivery, although 45.95% of the sample experienced deterioration of mood. Regression analyses showed little relationship between Time-1 and Time-2 objective nighttime sleep, and postpartum mood. Variables that related to both Time-1 and Time-2 subjective perception of sleep, including subjective nighttime sleep, sleep-related daytime dysfunction, and daytime napping behavior, were significant predictors of postpartum mood. Conclusions: The perception of poor sleep, and the conscious awareness of its impact during wake-time, might share a stronger relationship with the occurrence of immediate postpartum mood disturbances than actual sleep quality and quantity.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a prospective and controlled design. Method: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. Results: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for <3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. Conclusions: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Many factors, including genetic differences, have been shown to play a role in susceptibility and resistance, but few studies have investigated the range of genetic variation in rodent models. Methods: We examined ethanol teratogenesis in 5 inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J (B6), Inbred Short-Sleep, C3H/Ibg, A/Ibg, and 129S6/SvEvTac (129). Pregnant dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose–dextrin (MD) on day 9 of pregnancy. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 and fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for gross morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was then either placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and placed in ethanol for subsequent skeletal analyses. Results: B6 mice exposed to ethanol in utero had fetal weight deficits and digit, kidney, brain ventricle, and vertebral malformations. In contrast, 129 mice showed no teratogenesis. The remaining strains showed varying degrees of teratogenesis. Conclusions: Differences among inbred strains demonstrate genetic variation in the teratogenic effects of ethanol. Identifying susceptible and resistant strains allows future studies to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying prenatal alcohol phenotypes.

N2  - Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT₁ and MT₂ receptors, especially those in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which acts on the hypothalamic sleep switch. Therefore, they differ fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists primarily favor sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent sleep, as required in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A major obstacle for the use of melatonin to support sleep maintenance in primary insomnia results from its short half-life in the circulation. Solutions to this problem have been sought by developing prolonged-release formulations of the natural hormone, or melatoninergic drugs of longer half-life, such as ramelteon, tasimelteon and agomelatine. With all these drugs, improvements of sleep are statistically demonstrable, but remain limited, especially in primary chronic insomnia, so that GABAergic drugs may be indicated. Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence. They do not induce behavioral changes, as sometimes observed with z-drugs. Despite otherwise good tolerability, the use of melatoninergic drugs in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy has been a matter of concern, and should be avoided in autoimmune diseases and Parkinsonism. Problems and limits of melatoninergic hypnotics are compared. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality in late pregnancy and recurrence of postpartum major depression (PPMD) through 28 weeks postpartum. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 36 weeks gestation was assessed in 51 non-depressed women with a history of PPMD; recurrence was determined by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Sleep quality in late pregnancy was not related to recurrence per se, but it was related to timing of recurrence (Kruskal-Wallace = 9.78, p = .008). Rapid recurrence (within 4 weeks post delivery) was preceded by fewer sleep complaints (mean PSQI for early recurrers = 4.8 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .09). Recurrence after 4 weeks postpartum was preceded by more sleep complaints in late pregnancy (mean PSQI for late recurrers = 9.9 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .02). Sleep quality in late pregnancy may help in identifying women at risk for a PPMD recurrence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake, circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level. Conclusions/Significance: ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans.

N2  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are critical to ensure successful reproduction, but few studies have focused on how they may change with transitions in reproductive state. Those that have focused on pregnancy and lactation have revealed the emergence of new temporal patterns in a wide range of functions. The first part of this dissertation examines the hypothesis that these changes might be driven by modification of rhythms within the circadian system of the brain. I first characterized differences between non-pregnant and early pregnant laboratory rats in rhythms in protein expression of a neuronal activity marker (Fos) and in one component of the molecular oscillator (Per2) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which houses the primary pacemaker of the mammalian brain. In these studies I also examined the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ), which is involved in modulating SCN output signals. Fos rhythms in one subregion of the SCN, the shell, and in the vSPZ underwent changes in waveform, and the peak of the Per2 rhythm in the whole SCN was phase-advanced during early pregnancy. To determine whether changes in Fos expression in the SCN shell and vSPZ were light-dependent, I next characterized differences in light-induced Fos expression in the SCN and vSPZ in non-pregnant and early pregnant rats housed in constant darkness. The rhythms of light-responsivity of the SCN shell and vSPZ were altered in early pregnancy, but in a manner that indicates that changes in these areas in animals kept in a light/dark cycle were not light-dependent. I next present evidence that rhythms in Per2 expression in some, but not all, extra-SCN oscillators within the brain also change in early pregnancy. This indicates that some aspect of early pregnancy induces modifications in the coupling of different elements of the circadian system. This could potentially cause rhythms in varying aspects of physiology and behavior to change in different ways. I also show that temporal patterns of Fos expression in some, but not all, non-circadian regulatory systems within the brain are modified in early pregnancy. Therefore, it appears that integration of concurrent changes in rhythms within and beyond the circadian system leads to a re-organization of rhythmicity within the brain. This might be part of the mechanism by which transitions from one reproductive state to another lead to the emergence of a diverse range of new rhythmic patterns in behavior and physiology. In my final experiment, I characterized rhythms in activity and temperature in females of a diurnal rodent species, the Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), as they progressed through a series of reproductive states. In contrast to nocturnal rodents, rhythms in females of this species underwent changes in amplitude, but not in phase, during pregnancy and lactation. This suggests that diurnal and nocturnal species may need to modulate their rhythms in different ways in order to reproduce successfully. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Case: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression, defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation, and Sonia may have been physically abused as well. Currently, Sonia is in third grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading, but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her younger brother and grandmother. Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications. Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to read at the age of 3 years. Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia worries about everything, including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When an argument occurs at home, she gets scared, bites her nails, and cries. Sonia currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and mental illness in the father's family. While conducting an interview with her mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. Instead, she illustrated a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was poor, her vocabulary, sequencing, and illustrations demonstrated above age-level skills for written expression and drawing. Examples of the writing that accompanied the drawings include: I hate when my parents fight. I get scared and feel sick to my tummy like I want to throw up. I just hate that feeling! My mom told me she had a 'boyfriend.' These words were the most horrible I ever heard. Soon a nightmare began. Nightmares make me very, very scared.

N2  - Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 third-trimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0 for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0 for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3 to 36.0 ) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression. Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. Study Design and Methods: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. Results: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r ≥ 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. Clinical Implications: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

N2  - Breastfeeding (BF) is a health-promoting behavior and exclusive BF has proven economic and ecologic benefits to individuals and societies. Yet Healthy People 2010 BF objectives for exclusive BF remain unmet and prevalence is lowest for low-income populations. The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study of 126 predominantly low income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads was to compare maternal and infant factors associated with nighttime BF behavior between exclusive BF dyads and supplemented dyads. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, independent t-tests, and Chi-square tests were used for analysis. BF behavior was categorized as either (1)  exclusive BF, defined as 100% BF or breastmilk feeding on all three nights, or (2) supplementation, defined as any formula during any of the three nights. Compared to women in supplementation (n=59), women in exclusive BF (n=67) were older, more likely Caucasian, working at 36 weeks pregnant but not working at 1 month postpartum, in a relationship, and getting less help with baby at night. There was no group difference in objective sleep at the last month of pregnancy assessment. At one month postpartum, women in the supplementation group averaged 30 minutes less night sleep compared to women in the exclusive BF group. Compared to infants who were supplemented (n=54), infants who were exclusively breastfed (n=66) were significantly more likely to room-in with mothers in hospital and receive a home visit. They were statistically larger at birth, although the difference in size may not be clinically relevant. Assessment of sleep in new mothers is important for BF maintenance and more effort is needed to promote exclusive BF among younger women, African Americans and women of Asian descent. Rooming-in practice in the hospital after birth should be encouraged, as it was significantly associated with exclusive BF behavior at one month postpartum in this diverse sample of new families. Future research using a qualitative approach would be ideal to discover how nighttime feeding for new mothers evolves over time, their motivation for BF, and their network of influence in support of BF behavior. Findings from qualitative research will be useful in developing an effective intervention for BF maintenance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women’s daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

N2  - Our aim was to examine the characteristics of EEG findings and epilepsy in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and the associated clinical and familial risk factors. Fifty-seven children (86% male) with ASD, mean age 82 ± 36.2 months, were included in the study. Thirty-nine (68.4%) children had the diagnosis of autism, 15 (26.3%) had Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and 3 (5.3%) had high-functioning autism. One hour of sleep and/or awake EEG recordings was obtained for each child. All patients were evaluated with respect to clinical and familial characteristics and with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The frequency of interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities (IIEAs) was 24.6% (n = 14), and the frequency of epilepsy was 14.2% (n = 8). IIEAs were associated with a diagnosis of epilepsy (P = 0.0001), Childhood Autism Rating Scale Activity scores (P = 0.047), and a history of asthma and allergy (P = 0.044). Epilepsy was associated with a family history of epilepsy (P = 0.049) and psychiatric problems in the mother during pregnancy (P = 0.0026). Future studies with larger samples will help to clarify the possible associations of epilepsy/IIEAs with asthma/allergy, hyperactivity, and familial factors in ASD.

N2  - During the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and breast-feeding periods, as well as in menopausal and post-menopausal periods, the physiological and psychological processes that change according to the hormonal fluctuations influence every women similarly and each one differently. These physiological processes are controlled by neuroendocrine sequences, of which the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis are the most important ones. The hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis affects mood, anxiety, cognition and pain. The interaction of these hormones with mood and behavior is bidirectional. The differences in phenomenology and epidemiology of mood disorders with regards to gender can be explained with the effects of hormones. All of the periods mentioned above are related with mood disorders at terms of risk factors, disease symptoms, progress of disease and response to treatment. Epidemiologic data supports the relationship between the mood disorders and reproductive processes. The prevalence of major depression increases in women with the menarche and ceases in post- menopausal period. Similarly, the initial symptoms of bipolar disorder begins around the menarche period in 50% of the cases. Despite proper treatment, some female patients with major depression experience recurrence during the premenstrual period of their menstrual cycles. The conformity and change in a woman’s brain during pregnancy is controlled dominantly by the neuroendocrine systems, while it is controlled by the external stimuli actively related to the baby during nursing period. The changes that occur are closely related to postpartum mood disorders. Again, all the changes and suspension of medication during this procedure are risk factors for early depressive and dysphoric situations. Variables of a wide range, from follicle stimulating hormone, melatonin, and sleep to body mass index interact with mood disorders in menopausal and post-menopausal periods. Interest on the effects of gonadal steroids on the central nervous system has grown parallel with our increasing knowledge. In the last decade, the place of hormonal treatments in the treatment of mood disorders have been discussed continuously. During this period, along with the anti-depressant efficacy of estrogen, anti-manic efficacy of tamoxifen was also demonstrated in several studies. In this paper, the complex relationship between the physiological changes and the mood disorders during a menstrual cycle, pregnancy, nursing, menopausal and post-menopausal periods are briefly reviewed and discussed over the reproductive hormones in the context of etiology, phenomenology and treatment.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. Results: PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Most antidepressant medications in current use have several disadvantages: a delayed therapeutic effect, side effects, stigmatization and concerns about safety for the developing fetus during pregnancy. Several chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as an alternative. The current article reports the design and the initial outcome results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (wake therapy—WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv) sleep phase advance (SPA). Methods: The study was conducted as a set of 12 single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive volunteering patients. Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis beginning with a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a set of four consecutive morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1–T4),and with a final measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5). Results: A clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies. Conclusions: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well tolerated. It affords many advantages, such as the achievement of a rapid response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up, safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or behavioural state. Aims: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep. Study design: Case–control. Cases had a gestational age of ≥ 42 weeks; controls were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile. Subjects: STAN® registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was selected during active and one during quiet sleep. Outcome measures; Absolute and normalized low (0.04–0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4–1.5 Hz) of heart rate variability. Results: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively, P = 0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P = 0.50) or absolute (41 and 21 respectively, P = 0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07 respectively, P = 0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively, P = 0.03) and absolute (16 and 10 respectively, P = 0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and 0.14 respectively, P = 0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both groups (all P values < 0.05). Conclusions: We found sympathetic predominance during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation during rest was increased compared to near term.

N2  - A suite of changes in circadian rhythms have been described in nocturnal rodents as females go through pregnancy and lactation, but there is no information on such patterns in diurnal species. As the challenges faced by these two groups of animals are somewhat different, we characterized changes in activity and core body temperature (Tb) in female diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as they went through a series of reproductive states: virgin, pregnant, pregnant and lactating, lactating only, and post-weaning. The phase of neither rhythm varied, but the amplitude did. Females increased their overall levels of daily activity from early to late pregnancy, regardless of whether they were also lactating. The pattern of activity was less rhythmic during early than mid-lactation, in both non-pregnant and pregnant females, as a consequence of a decrease in daytime relative to nighttime activity. The Tb rhythm amplitude dropped from mid-pregnancy through mid-lactation, and there were rises in Tb troughs during the mid-light and mid-dark phases of the day, though pregnancy and lactation affected Tb at these times in somewhat different ways. This study demonstrates that rhythms in diurnal grass rats change during pregnancy and lactation in different ways than those of nocturnal species that have been studied to date and that the effects of pregnancy and lactation are not additive in any simple way.

This study linked the 2001 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data set with Taiwan’s birth and death certificate registries. In total, 220 465 singleton live births were included. The key dependent variable was whether or not an infant’s father was diagnosed with schizophrenia, while the independent variable of interest was whether an infant had LBW. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of LBW, after adjusting for the infant and parents’ characteristics. The results show that infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were more likely to have LBW than those whose fathers did not (12.6% vs 8.0%). Infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were found to be 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.10–2.52, P < .05) times more likely to have LBW than their counterparts whose fathers did not have schizophrenia, following adjustment for gestational week at birth, parity, paternal age and highest educational level, family monthly incomes, and marital status. We conclude that the offspring whose fathers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia had increased risk of LBW compared with those whose fathers had no schizophrenia. This finding paves the way for further studies and suggests that there may be potential benefit to early intervention to prevent LBW in pregnant women with husbands with schizophrenia.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol increases the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Physiological changes associated with these exposures are not well studied. Full-term infants were tested within the first 3 days of life. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol consumption and/or smoking during pregnancy would alter autonomic nervous system function. Newborns whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had lower beat-to-beat heart rate variability in quiet sleep. Infants whose mothers consumed alcohol had lower global heart rate variability, but only in active sleep. Unexposed infants demonstrated increases in heart rate with head-up tilt and decreases in heart rate with head-down tilt, but smoking and alcohol-exposed infants showed no significant responses. These results indicate that autonomic function is altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol and smoking. Such markers may provide early identification of infants at greatest risk for SIDS.

N2  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.

N2  - Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12 months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing behaviors mediated the relations between these domains.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sensorimotor disorder where patients complain of an almost irresistible urge to move their legs. This urge can often be accompanied by pain or other unpleasant sensations, it either occurs or worsens with rest particularly at night, and improves with activity. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group has established four essential criteria for clinical diagnosis of RLS. State of art: Affecting an estimated 7.2 to 11.5% of the adult population, the symptoms of RLS may be associated with significant sleep disturbance and may have a negative impact on quality of life. The prevalence of RLS increases with age, and women are more frequently affected than men. In France, the estimated prevalence is 8.5%. Among sufferers, 4.4% complain of very severe symptoms. Although RLS is mainly idiopathic, several clinical conditions have been associated with it, especially iron deficiency with or without anemia, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. These conditions may share a common pathophysiological mechanism involving a disorder of iron metabolism. By contrast, controversy persists as to whether polyneuropathy, particularly when associated with diabetes, is to be considered as an important cause of secondary RLS. This association is difficult to demonstrate as conventional electromyography is not adequate to detect small fiber neuropathy often associated with diabetes. Conclusion and perspectives: RLS is often underdiagnosed and few subjects receive recommended RLS drug treatment. There is a clear need for complementary education to improve the accurate diagnosis of RLS. Indeed, better knowledge of this syndrome is a prerequisite to prompt an appropriate therapeutic management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children. Design: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. Measurements and results: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency (≤ 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

N2  - Epidemiological research examining the consequences of sleep-related disturbances (SRDs) during and after pregnancy on mood disorders in women is lacking. The theoretical framework for this study is based on the biopsychosocial model, which proposes that sleep functions as a moodregulating system and addresses certain perinatal biological, psychological and social pressures. Therefore, the hypothetical basis for this research is based on the assumption that perinatal women experiencing SRDs are at greater risk of developing postpartum mood disorders than those women who are not subjected to SRDs perinatally. This prospective cohort study of perinatal women ( N = 38) examined the number and the effects of perinatal SRDs on perinatal mood disorders. Measurements of SRDs in this group included the PSQI and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. While the CES-D scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Zung Anxiety scale evaluated mood disorders. Using binomial approximations, relative risk, and multiple regression analyses the results of this study found that perinatal women experience more SRDs than non-pregnant women, perinatal SRDs increase the risk of perinatal mood disorders, and perinatal SRDs are predictive of mood disorders during and after pregnancy. In conclusion, these results establish that women experiencing perinatal SRDs have an increased risk of developing mood disorders during and after pregnancy. Therefore, the need for effective techniques in the prevention and intercession of SRDs in women during and after pregnancy will aid in the reduction of perinatal mood disorders. Recommendations to maternal healthcare providers would include the extensive use of sleep histories taken throughout the perinatal period for the early detection of SRDs. This information will facilitate maternal healthcare providers allowing for adequate treatment of SRDs and alleviate one of the triggering mechanisms of perinatal mood disorders leading to a positive psychosocial change in perinatal women.

N2  - The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is low in the general population in Turkey. To assess the prevalence of RLS in pregnancy, a hospital-based survey assessing symptoms of RLS and other sleep problems was performed through face-to-face interviews and physical examination on 983 pregnant women from 11 hospitals in the two urban and four suburban areas of Kayseri, Turkey, at the time of delivery and 6 months after delivery. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International RLS Study Group. A total of 103 women reported the occurrence of RLS symptoms during pregnancy, giving an RLS prevalence rate of 10.48%, with presence of symptoms more than three times per month, which decreased to 2.9% after 6 months. A significant relationship was observed between RLS and the number of previous pregnancies: women who had one child were compared with women who had 2–3 children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.441, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894–2.324), and women who had ≥4 children (OR = 2.530, 95% CI, 1.377–4.650). Patients with and without the RLS syndrome were similar in respect to distributions of age, income level, career, iron and folate therapy, sleep habits, and sleep problems. The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women is low, like the low prevalence in the general population in Eastern European and/or Asian populations.

N2  - Objectives: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (≤0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls). Methods: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Results: There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. Conclusions: Both cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal stress reactivity measures suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns. This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period.

N2  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.

N2  - Objective: To explore women’s levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample. Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell’s Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women’s fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women’s emotional experiences during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objective: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is associated with infant sleep disturbance. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Southampton, UK. Participants: A cohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study. Measurements and Results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23,95% C11.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46). Conclusions: Women with preconceptional psychological distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy, independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

N2  - Different factors have been proposed to influence morningness-eveningness, biological rhythms, and sleep-wake cycles, but few studies focused on the influence of social habits. Here, we focus on the influence of children and partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age. Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5 h on the weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children. The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children, 0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and child. Partners’ chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother’s lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first-months of life, and that children are a more important social factor than the male partner.

N2  - Background: The decrease of maternal docosahexaenoic (DHA) status during pregnancy has been associated with postpartum depression, especially in women with a low intake of DHA. Since the DHA intake in the Netherlands is low, we investigated whether supplementation of low doses of DHA or DHA plus arachidonic acid (AA) during pregnancy and lactation could prevent depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in this period. Methods: Women were supplemented daily with placebo, DHA (220 mg) or DHA+AA (220 mg each) from week 16 of pregnancy till three months postpartum. Fatty acid analyses were performed in the available plasma samples at 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were measured in weeks 16 and 36 of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum using EPDS and within one week postpartum using a blues questionnaire. Results: 119 women completed the study. The average frequency of fish intake was low, 0.94 times per week, and did not differ between the groups. The supplementation groups did not differ in mean EPDS scores or changes in EPDS scores, nor in incidence or severity of postpartum blues. Red blood cell DHA, AA and DHA/ AA ratio did not correlate with EPDS or blues scores. Indices of sleep quality did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: Supplementation of 220 mg/day DHA or DHA+AA (220 mg/day each) does not prevent peripartum depressive symptoms, in a population based sample with low background DHA intake.

N2  - There is common understanding among clinicians treating cancer patients in the developing world that the suffering of the body as a result of growing tumors leads to the suffering of the mind. In spite of this, it is appalling that few clinicians in these countries translate this understanding into action in their practice. In most cases the psychological issues receive very little attention and most patients make their psychological cancer journeys alone. The diagnosis of cancer to patients in developing countries is in most instances equated to death. This evokes intense emotional crisis and loss of hope. The loss of hope, a fundamental human experience manifesting as an energy which brings life and joy, influences the psychological state and behavior of patients. As patients continue on the cancer illness trajectory which is marked by increasing disability, pain and realization that cure or prolonged reprieve from death is impossible they experience multiple psychological problems. The diagnosis of cancer also brings out family issues such as—How will the children live without their father or mother? How will other dependants in the extended family live once the patient dies? A lot of questions remain unanswered and this leads to further psychological damage. Most of these problems are left unresolved in developing countries because most clinicians do not have adequate skills to deal with them. The impact of this on the quality of life of the patients and their family members is immense. This chapter highlights with case reports some psychological issues which have an impact on the quality of life of patients with common cancers in developing countries. The areas which are addressed include: Myths about cancer; Fear of Recurrence; Sexual problems; Pain perception; Fatigue; Guilty of delaying diagnosis; Guilty for doing things that may have caused cancer; Changes in physical appearance; Depression; Sleep difficulties; Changes in what they are able to do after cancer treatment; The burden the cancer may have on finances; The burden the cancer may have on the loved ones; and Concerns about whether they will be able to father children or get pregnant.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation. Aim: This study examines sleep–wakefulness–distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. Participants: A national infant cohort (N = 35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N = 36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. Outcome measures: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups. Results: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep–wakefulness patterns.

N2  - Objective: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for safe infant sleep practices. Methods: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of >900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Results: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP. Conclusions: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to explore the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety across pregnancy and the early postpartum. Methods: Participants (N = 207) completed the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait subscale, Beck Depression Inventory, and social support and sleep quality measures at two time points during pregnancy and once in the early postpartum period. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of anxiety and depression over time, depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of anxiety in late pregnancy and anxiety in late pregnancy predicted higher depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum. A bi-directional model of depression and anxiety in pregnancy was supported. Limitations: Data were based on self-reports and participating women were predominantly tertiary educated with high family incomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms precede the development of higher levels of anxiety and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict higher depressive symptoms. Clinicians are advised to screen for anxiety and depression concurrently during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Children who were born prematurely are at higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) compared to their same-age peers who were born fullterm. Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of SDB symptoms and effects on growth among preterm infants while they are still infants, with a goal of identifying risk factors to facilitate prevention and early intervention. Methods: The Louisville pediatric SDB risk survey was administered to the primary caretakers of prematurely born infants attending the Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic at West Virginia University Children’s Hospital. Results: Participation was 100% among 173 consecutive patients invited to participate in the study. At 9.13 months corrected age, 8.1% of infants born at a mean of 31.6 weeks gestation were reported to snore ≥3 days/week, a rate consistent with diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing among older children. A composite of nine parent-reported symptoms was created based on factor analysis. Birth weight and size for gestational age at birth did not differ between snoring groups or correlate with the composite score. But a significant negative correlation between the composite risk for SDB score and current weight for adjusted age percentile score indicate that infants with higher SDB symptom profiles have lower weight for age (r = -.18, p = .028). Conclusions: SDB symptoms are detectable among infants born preterm, while they are still infants. Because of their preferential risk for SDB and its somatic consequences, a primary research goal should be description of the natural history of SDB and identification of modifiable risk factors and treatment options.

N2  - Study Objectives: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2) identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based. Participants: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830). Interventions: None. Measurements and results: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPDS > 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression. Conclusions: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.
