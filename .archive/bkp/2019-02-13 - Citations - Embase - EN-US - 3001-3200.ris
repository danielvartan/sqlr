N2  - Introduction: This article is a review of literature data concerning the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed pregnant women. Literature findings: The adverse effects for the foetus, the newborn and the child were evaluated. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is of around 10 to 20% of the population of childbearing women. Depression is often misdiagnosed and underestimated in pregnant women. Starting a pharmacological treatment for depression in these women is not easy because data concerning the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy are still unclear. The non-treated pathology is associated with higher risk of maternal morbidity, including arterial hypertension, which could lead to preeclampsia or eclampsia, ideation and suicide attempts, and postpartum depression. Foetal development is also affected and adverse outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight, irritability, and sleep disorders are frequent. Pharmacological therapy is necessary when non-pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Suicide attempts and relapse of depression have been described when depressive women stopped their pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women diagnosed with depression must be treated. Selective SSRIs are now largely used in this pathology and have replaced tricyclic antidepressants because of fewer side effects. In general, drugs have a low teratogenic potential, only 4 to 5% of malformations are iatrogenic. Teratogenic risk is high between conception until the end of the second month of gestation. Safety of SSRIs treatment during pregnancy and potential risk for the foetus and newborn were unquestioned before publication, in the late 2005, of some alarming data concerning a possible teratogenic effect. Studies showed an increased risk for all congenital malformations with SSRIs and particularly with paroxetin. A few studies after 2005 have also found an association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs (especially paroxetin) and congenital malformations. However, other studies failed to demonstrate this association and the risk for cardiovascular malformations also does not seem to be significantly increased. Numerous studies in pregnant women have shown that SSRI treatments are associated with a significant increase of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of neonatal behavioural syndrome, including signs of withdrawal or serotonin impregnation. Restlessness, poor tone, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia were the most frequent signs. These symptoms occur during the first days of life and are usually brief and not serious. Recent studies have also documented an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and cases of cerebral haemorrhage have been described. Data concerning a possible effect on motor and cognitive development at school age in children prenatally exposed to SSRIs are limited. Discussion: Although a number of studies revealed that SSRIs are not teratogenic, some of them showed congenital malformations associated with use of these antidepressants; in particular an increased risk of cardiac defects with paroxetin. In practice, the potential risk implies that the decision to treat a pregnant woman with SSRIs (notably paroxetin) should be taken carefully; this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits, adverse effects and possible alternatives. Neonatal toxicity seems to be relatively frequent when SSRIs are prescribed during late pregnancy. For all depressed pregnant women, the severity of the depression must be taken into consideration before introducing a pharmacological treatment. When depressive women are already treated, studies have shown that antidepressants must be maintained during pregnancy to prevent relapse and suicide attempts. © 2009 L'Encéphale, Paris.

N2  - Object: Depression during pregnancy is associated to physical symptoms that can impair the functioning of women; furthermore some of the depression somatic symptoms (i.e., sleep disturbance, fatigue, weight change and appetite) are also features of pregnancy. The overlap of symptomatology can interfere with the identification and the diagnosis of the mood episode. Aim of this study is to compare the the depressive phenomenology and the presence of Axis I comorbidity between pregnant and non pregnant depressed women. Method: We diagnosed Major Depression (MD) using the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Diagnosis DSM IV (SCID I) in 32 pregnant women at third month of pregnancy and 87 non pregnant women and we compared the depressive phenomenology in the two groups. Then we administered the Mood Spectrum Self Repost Last Month (MOOD SR-LM) in the two group in order to study the mood spectrum symptomatology. Result: Pregnant depressed women have higher psychomotor retardation, higher levels of concentration and lower agitation than non pregnant depressed women. The severity of depression symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. Conclusion: Our results agree with current litterature about the presence of psychomotor retardation in depressed pregnant women. The higher level of concentration in pregnant women could be explained by the high comorbidity with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). In the pregnant depressed women the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Panic Disorder (PD) comorbidity are more rappresentated.

N2  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n=245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

N2  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves episodic nocturnal apneas. Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM abnormalities. Study Design: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent polysomnography and FHM for ≥3 hours. The relationship between maternal characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were controlled for potential confounders. Results: When compared with polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and 63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with oxygen desaturation <95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder (rs = 0.44; P < .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities and OSA parameters. Conclusion: In pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire poorly predicts OSA. It is unclear whether fetal compromise during maternal apnea is a mechanism in OSA that is related to pregnancy outcome. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Stress causes various diseases, including infertility and ovarian dysfunction. Stress response is controlled by hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and sympathoadrenal system (SAS). We analyzed the association of HPA axis and SAS with various types of ovarian dysfunction and IVF outcomes. Methods: In study 1, a total of 157 women with ovarian dysfunction according to abnormalities in the basal body temperature and 7 normal volunteers were studied. The patients were classified to 8 groups: PCOS, 49 women; PCOS with habitual abortion, 7; low body weight, 10; elevated FSH, 24; elevated PRL, 6; endometriosis, 10; high age, 4; and idiopathic, 47. HPA axis was analyzed by the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test (DST) on cycle days 3-7. The circadian rhythm was classified into normal (N) type and 4 abnormal types: low-morning (LM), plateau (P), V-shaped (V), and fat (F) types. SAS was analyzed by measuring plasma catecholamines. In study 2, the rates of pregnancy and abortion were compared between patients with normal and abnormal HPA axis in 178 IVF cycles. Results: Study 1: The incidence of abnormal circadian rhythm in salivary corti-sol was significantly higher in women with ovarian dysfunction than in normal volunteers (48% vs. 0%) The incidence was high in PCOS with habitual abortion (86%), low body weight (60%) and PCOS (53%), and moderate in elevated PRL (50%), idiopathic (47%) and elevated FSH (42%), and low in endometriosis (30%) and high age (0%). DST was worsened in types N, LM, P, V and F in this order. The incidence of elevated catecholamines was prominently high in PCOS with habitual abortion (86%), compared with other groups of ovarian dysfunction (0%-27%) and normal volunteers (0%). Study 2: IVF pregnancy rates were similar in N, LM, P, V and F types, but abortion rate was significantly higher in V and F types than in N, LM and P types (50% vs. 19%). Abortion rate was significantly higher with abnormal DST than with normal DST (50% vs. 21.4%). Conclusions: Abnormal HPA axis was identified by the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in half of women with ovarian dysfunction, especially more frequently in PCOS and low body weight. Abnormal HPA axis and SAS were prominently frequent in PCOS with habitual abortion, and also were associated with abortion in IVF. Stress-response-mechanism is closely related to ovarian function and maintenance of pregnancy, and its normalization may work as a novel treatment of infertility and pregnancy loss.

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between pregnancy physical discomforts experienced during the second trimester and late pregnancy depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effect of sleep quality on antenatal depressive symptomatology. Healthy pregnant women (N = 257) completed the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Inventory at early-mid second trimester, and then again at late third trimester. Physical symptoms and sleep quality at the first time point were both correlated moderately with depressive symptoms at late pregnancy. Discomfort associated with physical symptoms was a better predictor of depressive symptoms than Frequency of symptoms, although a score combining Frequency, Discomfort and Effect of symptoms on life was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses of the mediation model indicated that physical symptoms at early-mid second trimester predicted depressive symptoms in the last trimester both directly, and via poor sleep quality (prospectively), which mediated the relationship. The clinical implications of these findings for antenatal care are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction/Background: About 1/5 of pregnant women experience pelvic pain. The pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, sleep and daily activities. The evidence of effectiveness of treatment for pelvic girdle pain is rather weak. Resent research has focused on the importance of activation of muscles for motor control and stability of the lumbopelvic region. Since there is little research on this topic the purpose of the study was to review trials on preventing and treating this condition. Method: Systematic review studying the effectiveness of interventions for pregnant women with PGPor LBP using the Cohrane database systematic reviews, MEDLINE, CINAHL Results: According to the UK National Clinical guidelines for the Care of Women with Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction (Pelvic Girdle Pain), recognition and management of symptoms may reduce the long-term morbidity experienced by some women. For women with pain associated with pregnancy, strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises and water gymnastics reduces pain intensity and pain related sick leave. Acupunture gives more relief from evening pain than exercises. For those pregnant women with both pelvic and back pain acupunture seems to be more effective in reducing the intencity of pain than physiotherapy alone; while stretching and stabilising exercises result in more total pain relief. Women receiving usual prenatal care report more use of analgesics and sacroiliac belt Conclusion: Pregnancy related exercises, physiotherapy or acupunture appear to have better effect in relieving back or pelvic pain than antenatal care alone. Although effects are small women stay at work and function at daily activities.

The incidence of cardiovascular events such as stroke, transient ischaemic attack, sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction peaks in the morning hours, following a relative decline in these events during the night. It is thought that the morning surge in blood pressure (MSBP) may provide part of the explanation for the increased incidence of cardiovascular events in the morning hours. The aim of this study was to investigate the blood pressure (BP) profile of baboons; including day time values, night time values and the MSBP to determine if the baboon has a similar BP profile to the human. Pregnant (n=3) and non-pregnant (n =3) female baboons had a telemeter (PA-D70, Data Sciences International, USA) implanted to allow for continuous remote intra-arterial blood pressure measurement. The animals were kept on a day-night cycle using artificial timed light from 6am 6pm daily. The MSBP was defined as the BP 2 hours after rising (8 am) minus the average BP overnight (6pm-6am). Data from 2 mornings and nights was averaged, and t-tests were performed for statistical analysis using PASW Statistics 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., USA). There were no significant differences between the groups in age or weight of the animals. In the non-pregnant animals, mean overnight BP was 127±2 mmHg systolic and 83±2 mmHg diastolic and morning BP was 139±4 mmHg systolic and 90±1 mmHg diastolic. The pregnant animals' BP was lower both overnight (112±2 mmHg systolic (P=0.004) and 76±3 mmHg (P=0.101)) and in the morning (122±3 mmHg systolic (P=0.028) and 79±3 mmHg diastolic (P=0.044)). The mean MSBP was 12±3mmHg systolic and 7±2 mmHg diastolic for the non-pregnant baboons, and 10±2 mmHg systolic and 3±2 mmHg diastolic for the pregnant baboons (not significantly different, P=0.699 and P=0.308). These results suggest that baboon blood pressure is similar to humans in terms of the MSBP, with a rise in systolic BP of 10-15 mmHg in the morning. Pregnancy does not appear to affect the presence or magnitude of the MSBP. Also similarly to humans, the blood pressure of pregnant females is significantly lower than that of non-pregnant females.

N2  - FEV1 < 40% of predicted value is a relative contraindication for pregnancy. Here we introduce a 29 ys old woman who decided to carry out her pregnancy despite a FEV1 of 25% pred. at 2 weeks' gestation. She had a severe bronchopneumopaty with a FEV1 < 30% in past 4 ys with chronic infection by P. Aeruginosa, MRSA. During last exacerbations, she needed oxygen therapy (OT) at rest and during efforts. She has pancreatic insufficiency but a good BMI (20) and a CFRDM insulin-dependent. Once pregnant, our team regularly assessed clinical status, cardio-respiratory function, glucose blood levels and microbiological findings. She required 3 hospitalizations at 17th,26th and 28th week's gestation due to acute exacerbations; she was treated with i.v. ceftazidime, inhaled colistine, steroids and OT, first nocturnal then daytime. To prevent respiratory deterioration and dyspnoea we started to acclimatize her to NIV since the first admission, with no recorded hypercapnia. Though her reluctance, it was then well tolerated and she used it increasingly, especially during sleep. Spirometry, S2pO2 and gas exchange remained stable throughout pregnancy. A joint decision was made to deliver the baby at 31st week gestation by caesarian section, using spinal-anesthesia and being assisted by physiotherapists for NIV in operating theatre. The outcome was successful for her and the newborn. A close surveillance, a sub-continuous antibiotic therapy, a tailored respiratory physiotherapy and a multidisciplinary work let her be in fairly good health to give birth. According to our findings and patient's judgment, the key point of this success has been the early but gradual use of NIV.

N2  - To investigate the relationship between sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) and preeclampsia and the possible pathogenesis of the latter. Twenty-five healthy pregnant women, 43 pregnant women with preeclampsia, and 27 with preeclampsia complicated by SAHS were enrolled in this study. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the lowest arterial oxygen saturation (LSaO2) were measured through a 7-hour polysomnography (PSG), and the maternal age, gestational age, body mass index and 24-hour urine protein were recorded. All the indexes except for the maternal age and gestational age showed significant differences between the 3 groups. The two groups of preeclampsia patients showed a significant difference in BMI from the control cases. Significant positive correlations of AHI to BMI, MAP and 24-hour urine protein were noted; LSaO2 was found to inversely correlate to BMI, MAP, and 24-hour urine protein. In spite of the significant correlation of BMI to the other indexes, we found that BMI was less important than AHI and LSaO2. SAHS may induce or aggravate preeclampsia. Greater attention should be given to the presence of SAHS in pregnant women with obesity, but obesity is not the predominant predisposing factor for preeclampsia.

N2  - AIM: We aimed to determine the prevalence of OSA in newly-diagnosed IIH patients and to validate the Berlin questionnaire as a screening tool for OSA in IIH patients. BACKGROUND: OSA is strongly associated with obesity and is thought to be associated with IIH1,2. However, the prevalence of OSA in IIH patients is unknown. Patients at high risk for OSA can be identified using the Berlin questionnaire3,4, but it is also unknown if the Berlin questionnaire reliably identifies IIH patients at high risk for OSA. METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive patients with newly-diagnosed IIH. Pregnant patients and patients less than 16 years old were excluded. All patients completed the Berlin questionnaire and had a diagnostic sleep study. We collected demographic/anthropometric data (age, sex, race, height, weight, and BMI), Berlin questionnaire results, sleep study results, and clinical data (symptoms, signs, automated perimetry results, and CSF opening pressure). OSA was diagnosed when the calculated respiratory disturbance index was >15. RESULTS: We included 15 patients for this interim analysis; 11 female (73.3%), 6 Caucasian (40%), 9 African-American (60%). Age ranged from 17-54 (median 32). BMI ranged from 27.3-49.9 (median 40.4). Seven patients (47%) had OSA diagnosed by sleep study. Berlin questionnaire scores were “high risk” for OSA in 9 patients (60%), of which 6 had OSA by sleep study. Only one of 6 patients with a “low risk” score had OSA by sleep study. The sensitivity of the Berlin questionnaire for OSA in IIH patients was 85.7%, while the specificity was 62.5%. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that the prevalence of OSA may be higher in IIH patients than in the BMI-matched general population, where it is about 30%. A “high risk” score on the Berlin questionnaire suggests OSA in IIH patients and should prompt a sleep study. Findings from a larger sample will be presented at the meeting.

N2  - Introduction: Increasingly today women are delaying having children until their late thirties and forties, for social reasons such as careers or relationships. Fertility problems are more common in this age group and if IVF is required, the chances of success may be improved by using donor eggs from younger women. Oocyte cryopreservation or “egg freezing” gives women the opportunity to store their own eggs when younger and use them later in life, should they encounter problems with fertility. Since the first human pregnancy from a cryopreserved oocyte in 1986, progress has been relatively slow, with the numbers of live births worldwide still in the low hundreds. Lately this area has gained increasing interest, as reports of improved success rates have filtered through to the headlines. Although women have to undergo a few cycles of IVF with its associated risks, the process may be acceptable given the potential gains. We aimed to investigate whether young women would undergo oocyte cry-opreservation when given information regarding the benefits and drawbacks. We also aimed to outline the main reasons behind their decisions. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to 200 women aged 18 - 30 years including 100 medical students and 100 non-medical students from education and sports studies at the Leeds University, United Kingdom (UK). Ethical approval was obtained prior to conducting the survey in September 2009. Verbal consent was sought from participants who were provided with an information sheet and an attached questionnaire in their lecture theatre. This was anonymous and included tick box questions directed towards the above aims. Completed responses were returned to a box that was collected after the end of their lecture. Statistical differences between groups were calculated using the Fisher's exact test. Results: 98/100 medical students (Group A) and 97/100 non-medical (45 sports students and 52 from education studies) - Group B, returned the completed questionnaires. The average age was 21 years in group A and 20 in group B. A significantly higher number of medical students were single compared with group B- 63.3% versus 25.8% (p < 0.0001). None in group A and 3 in group B had children. A significantly higher number in group A, 85.7% would delay their family due to social circumstances compared with 49.5% in group B (p < 0.0001). Amongst those who would postpone their family, 80.9% from group A would undergo egg collection and freezing compared with 45.8% in group B (p < 0.0001). In group A, 85.3% were prepared to undergo 3 cycles of IVF whereas the majority (79%) in group B were prepared to undergo only one IVF cycle if they chose to have egg freezing. The commonest reason to postpone family was career followed by financial stability and marriage in group A and in group B, it was financial stability followed by a stable relationship and career. Conclusions: These results are not surprising as professional women have long struggled under the double yoke of the social pressure to become educated and financially self-sufficient and the competing biological imperative to reproduce while still young. To date, very little research has been done towards establishing whether the concept and practicalities of egg freezing are acceptable to women considering delaying childbearing for social reasons. With the gradual and continual improvement of cryopreservation techniques comes an increased demand for these services. Education about the biological clock targeting young women in universities is critical to ensuring that they take an informed decision about their future reproduction. The IVF clinics need to recognize the needs and desires of women in deciding whether to offer the egg freezing procedure more frequently and to enable staff to tailor counselling appropriately.

N2  - Introduction: Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. Method: A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical, or non specified depression, and those without depression. Results: Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4%, and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Conclusions: Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research.

N2  - Clinical observations in chronic inflammatory diseases have demonstrated the significant influence of neuroendocrine mechanisms on the immune system: (1) Amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy; (2) preponderance of women versus men with respect to autoimmune diseases; (3) negative effects of ovulation-inducing therapy, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy; (4) protective effect of hemiplegia; (5) influence of psychological stress on inflammation; and (6) influence of circadian rhythms on inflammatory symptoms. The effects of different hormones and neurotransmitters on the immune system are influenced by: (1) the immune stimulus (foreign antigens or autoantigens) and subsequent antigen-specific immune responses, (2) the cell types involved during different phases of the disease, (3) the target organ with its specific microenvironment, (4) the timing of hormone or neurotransmitter increase in relation to the disease course, (5) the concentration of hormones and neurotransmitters, (6) the variability in expression of receptors depending on the microenvironment and the cell type, and (7) the intra-and extracellular peripheral metabolism of hormones and neurotransmitters leading to important biologically active metabolites with quite different anti-and proinflammatory functions. The circadian rhythm of disease-related symptoms with a peak in the early morning hours confirms that the neuroendocrine system has a strong influence on these chronic immune/inflammatory diseases. The influence is transmitted by the circadian fluctuation in the activity of hormonal and neuronal pathways linking the brain to immune cell activation. These considerations could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for rheumatic diseases in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

N2  - Life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong permanent long-term effects on the behavioural and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In rats, repeated restraint stress of the pregnant dam during the last week of pregnancy produces long lasting changes in the HPA axis function and behaviours in the offspring. These changes include a hyperactivity of HPA axis response associated with a reduction in the number of hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. The HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young adult and aged animals, therefore suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after the confrontation to an intense inescapable footshock, prenatal restraint stress (PRS) rats durably show a blunted corticosterone secretion after stress. PRS also induces a hyporeponse of the HPA axis when animals are exposed to an alcohol challenge. Rats exposed to a PRS also show behavioural disturbances known to be related to the HPA axis. Indeed, PRS produces high anxiety levels and depressive-like behaviour during adulthood including sleep disorders related to depression. With ageing, these animals exhibit memory impairments in hippocampo-dependent tasks. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by stress in utero, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategy. For example, early adoption or environmental enrichment during adolescence, as well as a chronic treatment with Insulin-like growth factor 1 in aged animals attenuated some HPA dysfunction's produced by PRS. Mechanisms underlying the PRS effects on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous works demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy may play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported. Thus, stressed mothers show high glucocorticoid levels during pregnancy. Furthermore, in the offspring of stressed mothers, the HPA response to stress is normalised by maternal adrenalectomy during pregnancy. Recently, our group has reported that repeated restraint stress during pregnancy leads to a decrease of the placental 11β-HSD2 activity. Finally, gestational stress has long lasting effects on HPA axis and behaviour in female dams. Thus, during lactating period, stressed mothers show an impairment of maternal care and low aggressive behaviour against a male intruder. Moreover, females stressed during pregnancy show an increase of anxiety-like behaviour several weeks after the end of the stress period. Given that, several evidences suggest that changes in maternal care may durably program offspring's HPA function and behaviours, it could be postulated that the alterations of the maternal behaviour during the early postnatal period may also strongly contribute to the long-term effect described after prenatal stress.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to investigate if the MDA plasma concentrations are correlated to negative psychopathology in paranoid schizophrenic inpatients. Methods: The sample was comprised by 38 patients who were admitted in the psychiatric ward of the University Hospital of the Canaries. Thirty eight patients were male and 9 were female with medium average age of 37.41±11.23. Exclusion criteria were psychoactive substance use, presence of acute or chronic organic pathology, treatment with immunosuppressive medication, pregnancy and mental retardation or severe cognitive impairment. There were performed two blood extractions following the circadian rhythm, at 12:00 and at 24:00 hours. One hour before night blood collection, each patient was placed in a reclined position in bed, with the eyes closed, in complete darkness and with eyes covered with a mask. Blood was centrifuged at 3.000 rpm for 10 minutes. Specific biological and psychopathological determinations were performed at admission and at discharge. Psychopathology was assessed with PANSS and by the same psychiatrist. Statistical analyses were carried out with the Social Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). MDA was determined spectrophotometrically. Results: MDA level at night was 1.94±1.54 while MDA level at midday was 2.23±1.36.Mean PANSS negative score was 15.73±6.31.Serum MDA level correlated positively with PANSS negative scores, both at midday and night (midday r=0.39, p< 0.0 1, midnight r=0.41, p< 0.01). Conclusions: The total negative subscale score correlated positively with day and night time levels of MDA, therefore we can conclude that MDA may be used as a marker of negative psychopathology.

N2  - Introduction: Fertility treatment can significantly impact women's lives, affecting their careers, personal relationships, and family life. There is inadequate information about which aspects of the experience pose the most difficulties to patients, especially in terms of their relationships with others. The objective of this survey was to gain knowledge about the emotional impact and challenges of infertility in order to more precisely define the stressors. This knowledge should facilitate the design of interventions to improve quality of life. Material and Methods: 445 women aged 18-44 years who were: 1) undergoing treatment for infertility, 2) had received fertility treatment within the last 2 years, or 3) were having trouble getting pregnant but had not received treatment, were asked to complete an online survey using the TNS European Access Panels. Participation involved completion of a 15-minute survey and was conducted across France (n = 108), Germany (n = 111), Italy (n = 112), and Spain (n = 114) between October 20, 2009 and October 30, 2009. Results: Of the women surveyed, 32% were concerned about their fertility prior to trying, 58% felt they waited too long to try, and 40% reported feeling embarrassed about experiencing infertility. Of note, more than one half felt “fawed as a woman,” 77% could not get a restful night's sleep, 35% had not told anyone, and less than one half felt hopeful or optimistic. While close friends and family were seen as a further source of support, many women also agreed that they felt a degree of resentment toward those who took getting pregnant for granted (74%) and those who offered unsolicited advice (69%). While in treatment or trying to conceive, many women were anxious about sex (48%) and felt the fun and spontaneity had been taken out of it (45%). However, women entering treatment were more likely to feel hopeful, and less likely to feel frustrated and confused. Although 63% of women in treatment reported support from their partners; 34% reported that tension had increased, 44% hid their feelings from their partner, and almost one half felt it had become the focal point of their relationship. On average, women waited more than a year to begin treatment, and despite knowing about their “ticking clock,” women aged over 35 years took longer to seek help than younger women. Overall, 81% wished they had sought out a fertility specialist sooner. More than one third reported waiting to see if it would happen naturally, but 27% waited because of a physician recommendation. While the greatest barrier to treatment was fear of failure (72%), 52% also reported side effects as a major influence. Other barriers to starting treatment included a lack of knowledge and expense/cost. Conclusions: Infertility causes a range of emotions; infertile women report numerous triggers including friends and their partner. The results of this survey highlight areas in which patients and physicians need further education. Most women reported a significant delay in beginning treatment due to concerns over failure and side effects, a desire to conceive naturally, and advice from a physician. These survey results suggest that educating patients about options for treatment may help them seek treatment sooner to lessen the emotional impact and challenges of infertility and highlight areas in which to better support patients.

N2  - Infants of opiate-addicted women typically have prenatal comorbid polydrug exposure, including alcohol and tobacco. The acute and longterm neurodevelopmental deficits of prenatal alcohol exposure were examined in relation to postnatal measures of behavioral state, neurocognition and developmental milestones in the first year. Methods: Rural, disadvantaged women (n=55) were recruited from a large narcotic treatment program. All participants were maintained on methadone during pregnancy. Structured clinical interviews of the mothers were conducted prenatally using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90R), Hollingshead 4-Factor Index and frequency-variability-quantity estimates of current and retrospective use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Bi-weekly urinalysis screens were conducted during pregnancy and meconium toxicology was determined at birth. Neonatal sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous movements were recorded during the neonatal hospitalization. Auditory recognition memory was conducted in the first month and at 7 months using the EEG eventrelated potential (ERP) oddball paradigm. Bayley Scales of Infant Development were conducted at 9 months of age. Results: Socioeconomic status was associated with history of alcohol abuse (T-ACE, p <.05; MAST score, p <.05), psychiatric status (SCL-90 Anxiety, p <.05), and neonatal head circumference (p =.01). Prenatal alcohol use was associated with poorer neurocognitive performance (e.g. reduced amplitude to the frequent tone at all 3 sites, p <.05). Preliminary findings in infant followup found that several prenatal alcohol exposure estimates were negatively associated with Bayley Scales for language composite and adaptive behavior scales. Conclusions: This study found that infants prenatally exposed to methadone are at risk for comorbid alcohol exposure. In this study, neurobehavioral development was adversely affected in several domains associated with estimates of prenatal alcohol exposure in the first year of life. Socioeconomic status also modulated maternal health, prenatal alcohol exposure risk and infant outcome.

N2  - Introduction: The decline in fertility in many western societies go together with a trend to delay motherhood until later in life. Postponement confronts women with the age related decrease in fertility. Today, women foreseeing motherhood at a more advanced age can stop their biological clock through oocyte cryopreservation. This study also aimed to characterize women that may potentially undergo social oocyte freezing. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was completed by 1024 women living in Belgium in June 2009. The questionnaire was mailed to women representative of all social classes, geographic locations within the country and aged between 21 and 40 years, representing the age group for potential oo-cyte freezers. Prior to the administration of the questionnaire, women received an informative text on oocyte cryopreservation. Women were informed about the possible use of the technique for medical and social reasons the associated risks, side effects and experimental state of the technique. A number of statements were formulated to assess the attitudes towards various aspects of oocyte freezing. The respondents were asked to indicate on a 5-point scale to what extent each attitude applied to them. In total 1049 women out of 1914 filled out the questionnaire leading to a response rate of 55%. Another 25 cases were excluded because of an inconsistent or incomplete answering pattern. Results: 3.1% (n = 32) of the 1.024 women answered 'yes' to the question whether they would consider to freeze their oocytes. 28.4% (n = 291) answered 'maybe', 16.7% (n = 171) stated they 'do not know/have no idea' and half of the women answered 'no' (51.8%; n = 530). In order to simplify the further analyses, the sample was split up into three groups; 'potential freezers' (answered 'yes' or 'maybe'), the 'doubtful group' and the 'non-freezers'. Potential freezers are more likely to be younger and less often married (23.5% versus 60.9%) or in a cohabiting relationship (31.9% versus 52.4%) when compared to the non-freezers or doubtful group. Potential freezers are also less likely to already have children as compared to non freezers (22.4% vs 64%) (p < 0.000) and desire significantly higher number of children in the future (P < 0.000). When faced with infertility, potential freezers were more likely to visit a fertility centre while 'non-freezers' were more likely to refrain from having children than women in the doubtful or potential freezers group (p = 0.002). The groups did not differ in their views towards adoption as a first choice. Potential oocyte freezers and doubtful women are equally and significantly more open towards the use of donated oocytes. Also, the potential oocyte freezers and doubtful women are equally and significantly more inclined to donate their oocytes through anonymous or known donations. No difference was noted between the groups in relation to the importance of a genetic bond, physical resemblance or behavioural resemblance of their children. Potential oocyte freezers are significantly more open to the idea of single motherhood than people in the doubtful or non-freezers groups. Women of all three groups do not differ in their views on the access to fertility treatment of women between 40 and 45 years old or in the need for an age limit to fertility treatments. However, potential freezers pointed to a significant older age at which it would be still sensible to become pregnant as compared to non-freezers (41.84 yr. versus 39.59 yr.). All three groups are equally aware of the existence of oocyte freezing and score equally on a fve questions multiple choice question fertility awareness test. Conclusions: This is the first study that has investigated attitudes towards social oocyte freezing in a large group of women of reproductive age. Only a small proportion of women considers to cryopreserve their oocytes, however another 25% state they would maybe consider to undergo such a procedure. This survey also indicates that also women at a young reproductive age would consider the procedure and that potential oocyte freezers would be more inclined to donote if the stored oocytes are no longer needed.

N2  - Objectives: Although significant advances in antiemetics control chemotherapy associated vomiting, nausea remains problematic. The hypothesis is that nausea comprises a range of symptoms. Methods: Survivors, who had received chemotherapy for cancer, consented to semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed and analyzed for their speech about nausea. The interviews will continue until data saturation. Of the first 11 analyzed, there were 5 females and 6 males, a median of 3.5 years (range 6 months to 10 years) post chemotherapy all who had received at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy, most as outpatients. Results: The onset of nausea ranged from immediate to day 5 post chemotherapy. The duration was from 1.5 hours to 6 months with conditioned stimuli continuing to trigger nausea in one case. The symptoms which the patients associated with nausea were vomiting, dry retching, loss of appetite, dizziness, and indigestion (described as ranging from queasiness to intense abdominal churning). The 3 patients who also had diarrhea had more symptoms including 2 with concomitant mucositis. Most patients described psychological symptoms. Some described a physical restlessness or a mental restlessness and inability to concentrate, with an underlying anxiety and negative emotions which could trigger nausea. Other triggers for nausea were odors, foods (particularly meat), changing posture, and brushing teeth. Nausea improved by avoiding triggers, eating light foods (often dairy, fruit, soft drink) antiemetics and hot-packs. A strong component of avoiding nausea was calming anxiety via relaxation, meditation, reassurance that it passes, sedatives to induce sleep, and particularly distractions (movies, hobbies, excursions). Patients could distinguish chemotherapy-induced nausea from that associated with pregnancy or food and alcohol by its persistence and associated symptoms, particularly lethargy and because it reminded them of their cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: Control of nausea will require management of a range of physical symptoms and anxiety.

N2  - Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity. Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts, and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Obesity is a growing problem. In England in 2008, 66% of men and 57% of women had a BMI >25 kg/m2; within this 24% of men and 25% of women were obese with a BMI >30 kg/m2. Obesity is a major contributing cause of disease. The relative risk (RR) of diabetes in overweight men is 2.40 and in obese men 6.74 compared with men with a BMI in the normal range. The respective RR values in women are 3.92 and 12.41. There is a 40% increased risk of death from CVD for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI above 25 kg/m2. Obesity is also associated with a raised risk of: fertility problems, cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, pregnancy complications, obstructive sleep apnoea and asthma. Patients should be offered advice on dietary change and increasing physical activity which includes behavioural components. Encouragement to make small changes in a sustained way can make significant differences to energy balance. Physical activity should be of moderate intensity (increased heart rate and breathing but still able to converse). Drug treatment is a useful addition when lifestyle measures alone are not effective. Evidence is increasing for the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in treating obesity-related disease, particularly diabetes.

N2  - The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes. © 2010 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Background: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.Methods: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.Results: After adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping ≤ 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m2) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (≥ 25 kg/m2). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations. © 2010 Qiu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: According to an old Swiss proverb, "a new mother lazing in childbed is a blessing to her family". Today mothers rarely enjoy restful days after birth, but enter directly into the challenge of combining baby- and self-care. They often face a combination of infant crying and personal tiredness. Yet, routine postnatal care often lacks effective strategies to alleviate these challenges which can adversely affect family health. We explored how new mothers experience and handle postnatal infant crying and their own tiredness in the context of changing hospital care practices in Switzerland.Methods: Purposeful sampling was used to enroll 15 mothers of diverse parity and educational backgrounds, all of who had given birth to a full term healthy neonate. Using interpretive phenomenology, we analyzed interview and participant observation data collected during the postnatal hospital stay and at 6 and 12 weeks post birth. This paper reports on the postnatal hospital experience.Results: Women's personal beliefs about beneficial childcare practices shaped how they cared for their newborn's and their own needs during the early postnatal period in the hospital. These beliefs ranged from an infant-centered approach focused on the infant's development of a basic sense of trust to an approach that balanced the infants' demands with the mother's personal needs. Getting adequate rest was particularly difficult for mothers striving to provide infant-centered care for an unsettled neonate. These mothers suffered from sleep deprivation and severe tiredness unless they were able to leave the baby with health professionals for several hours during the night.Conclusion: New mothers often need permission to attend to their own needs, as well as practical support with childcare to recover from birth especially when neonates are fussy. To strengthen family health from the earliest stage, postnatal care should establish conditions which enable new mothers to balance the care of their infant with their own needs. © 2010 Kurth et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - RATIONALE: There is mounting evidence that poor sleep and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are common during pregnancy. However, little is known about sleep quality in healthy pregnancy, nor about the prevalence or development of SDB. The aim of this small study is to measure sleep and SDB in healthy uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess the use of a screening tool for SDB in these women. METHODS: 21 women in the 1st trimester (T1) and 27 women in the 3rd trimester (T3) of pregnancy and 24 non-pregnant women of similar age (controls) were recruited from a large, public hospital. All underwent overnight polysomnography and completed the Multivariate Apnea Prediction (MAP) Index Questionnaire (Maislin et al., 1995). RESULTS: Compared to control subjects, self-reported night time awakenings were more common in the pregnant women, usually due to discomfort or the need to urinate. Sleep architecture was disrupted with reduced sleep efficiency, more stage 1 and less stage 4 sleep in pregnant compared to control participants. As a percentage of total sleep time, snoring was more prevalent in the T1 (median 2.7%) and T3 (median 5.55%) groups compared to control subjects (median 0.9%). Although the median(IQR) AHI was normal in the pregnant groups (T1 2.4[1.6-4.8], T3 2.9 [1.4-5.5]), the proportion of those with AHI > 5 was significantly greater in the T1 (23.8%) and T3 (30.8%) groups compared to control (4.2%). There was no significant relationship between AHI and the MAPI. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are more prevalent during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women. SDB may develop during pregnancy, as the prevalence increases from the non-pregnant control group to the T1 group and then to the T3 group. Snoring is more common in the latter stages of pregnancy. Given the negative maternal and foetal outcomes linked to snoring and SDB, these findings highlight the importance of developing a reliable prediction method to identify and treat sleep disorders promptly.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Excessive daytime sleepiness is a very frequent and early symptom during pregnancy. Sleeping disorders increase as pregnancy advances, but its clinical impact remains unknown. Materials and Methods: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was used to assess sleepiness among gestations at the third trimester. This tool is an 8-item instrument which quantifies on a 3-point scale the perceived severity of daytime sleepiness and insomnia-related interference with daytime functioning; in addition it allows sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome screening. A score of 10 or more was considered as having sleepiness whereas 18 or more as very sleepy. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: A total of 50 pregnant women aged 30.9 ± 6.18 years were studied at a mean gestational age of 39 ± 1.32 weeks (range: 37-41 weeks). The mean EES values were 7.7 ± 4.0. A 20% had an EES score > 10, and a 2% had an EES score of > 18. In the group with an EES score ≤10, weight gain was 12.7 ± 5.4 kg, neck circumference 38.9 ± 8.7 cm and arm circumference 31.4 ± 5.2. In those presenting EES scores 10-18, values were 16.2 ± 6.3 kg, 42.0 ± 6.1 cm and 31.7 ± 4.4 cm. In group EES score>18, values were 17 kg, 50 cm and 35 cm, respectively. Significant differences were found in weight gain ( p = 0.049). Conclusions: Since sleep disorders may be associated to abnormal cytokine secretion which may adversely affect pregnancy, further studies are needed to precisely define sleep characteristics.

N2  - Rationale: Knowledge regarding the spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and how this correlates clinically with outcomes in women, especially in the gravid state, is only emerging. To date, few studies have systematically investigated the incidence or prevalence of SDB during pregnancy. We identified high-risk pregnancy patients in a specialized clinic in Puerto Rico and assessed prevalence of SDB based on self-reported questionnaires. We also identified other risk factors based on serial anthropometric measurements and pre-gravid healthcare state. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study for high-risk pregnancies was done. Subjects were recruited after September 2008, with recruitment goal to provide 95% confidence interval and 5% margin of error based on prevalence of SDB during pregnancy. Berlin and Epworth questionnaires were administered, anthropometric measures taken by the same study personnel and baseline pre-gravid healthcare status was obtained from medical records. Results: Fifty two patients have been analyzed (age 32.4 ± 6.23 SD). The later represent extreme ages with highest prevalence of ages 18-22 and 40-45. Fifty eight percent (58% n=30) had a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Seventy five percent (75% n= 39) had Epworth scale >10 while (68% n=35) had a positive Berlin questionnaire. Mean pre-pregnancy BMI is 28.9 while mean neck circumference was 16.2 inches. Most patients (88% n=46) had a Mallampati score of I or II. Conclusion: High prevalence of pre-eclampsia exists among high-risk pregnancies in this sample. There is a higher prevalence of SDB among these patients as compared to previously published data. The higher prevalence of SBD was noted also in their pre-gravid state.

N2  - When women with chronic medical illnesses, including bipolar disorder, decide to have children, they are often concerned about the impact of a pregnancy on their illness and about the potential effects or risks that they take on their child. But what about the men? The study follows pregnant women with a major depression episode (current or in the past). The depression can be a predictor of a bipolar disorder. The women will be screened with the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Checklist. If the study does conclude that depressed women with a positive MDQ screening have a higher risk on a postpartum episode, this will have implications for preventive treatment postpartum. Another part of the study will look at bipolar men whose spouses are pregnant. Sleep disturbance in the period of delivery (and after) may have a negative effect on the bipolar psychopathology in the first weeks after becoming a father. There is very little research of the effects on bipolar men with a (healthy) pregnant woman; we think it can fill a gap in the already existing research. The treatment for both women and men is in our centre a part of a clinical pathway; women, men and children are treated form the preconception period (six months before the pregnancy) until toddler period (48 months). It offers a program for all major psychiatric disorders. The program is a unique cooperation between different disciplines: infant mental health, prevention programs, child mental care, and adult care and cure.

N2  - Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea (OSAH) is an independent risk factor for chronic hypertension in the general population. We recently reported that gestational hypertension (GH) is strongly associated with OSAH during pregnancy. There is also evidence that women with prior GH are at increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity later in life, and in particular, chronic hypertension. In the present study, we hypothesized that prior GH is associated with current OSAH. Objective: To determine the prevalence of OSAH among woman with or without remote previous GH. Methods: Nested case-control study with random selection from a tertiary obstetric center database of women with a singleton pregnancy with or without the presence of GH who delivered between 1989 and 1998. Each participant completed clinical and sleep questionnaires, and underwent physical examination, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelab®) and a full unattended home polysomnography (Medipalm, Braebon®). OSAH was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15/h. Results: A scheduled interim analysis was conducted on 15 GH women (mean age 49.6± SD 5.4 ï€ , BMI 29.8 ± 7.3kg/m2, BP: 128 ± 4/84 ± 3 mmHg) and 15 controls (age: 49.0± 3.9, BMI: 24.9± 3.9, BP: 117 ± 17/76 ± 11 mmHg). An average of 18.3 ± 1.6 y had elapsed since the index pregnancy. Chronic hypertension was present in 47 % of prior GH women and 7% of controls (p=0.016). OSAH was present in 73% of GH subjects (11/15) but in only 20% (3/15) of controls (p=0.004). The mean AHI was 19.7 ± 9.7/h (range 4.1 - 41.4) for GH subjects and 11.2 ± 7.0/h (range 2.5 -30.4) for controls (p =0.011). The crude odds ratio for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea given the presence of prior GH was 11.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2 - 71.7), while adjustment for age and BMI yielded an OR = 10.7 (95% CI 1.7 - 96.3). Conclusions: Women with a history of remote GH are significantly more likely to have chronic hypertension and to have OSAH than women without a history of prior GH.

N2  - Objective: Insufficient sleep in children is associated with adverse health effects. We examined the associations of early life risk factors with infant sleep duration. Methods: We studied 1676 mother-infant pairs in a prebirth cohort study. Main outcomes were mothers' report of their infants' average 24-hour sleep duration at ages 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Results: Infants slept mean standard deviation [SD] durations of 12.2 (2.0) hours/day at age 6 months, 12.8 (1.6) hours/day at age 1 year, and 11.9 (1.3) hours/day at age 2 years. In multivariable regression models, maternal antenatal depression, introduction of solids at age <4 months, and infant TV/video viewing were associated with shorter sleep durations at both 1 and 2 years of age. Estimates were 0.36 fewer hours/day of sleep for maternal antenatal depression, 0.39 fewer hours/day of sleep if infant was introduced to solids at age <4 months, and 0.11 fewer hours/day of sleep for each 1 hour of TV viewed per week. Attendance at child care outside the home was associated with 0.18 fewer hours/day of sleep at age 2 years. At age 2 years, black, Hispanic, and Asian infants slept 0.40, 0.82, and 0.95, respectively, fewer hours per day than white infants. Conclusions: Maternal depression during pregnancy, early introduction of solid foods, infant TV viewing, and attendance of child care were associated with shorter infant sleep duration. Racial/ethnic minority children slept fewer hours in the first 2 years of life than white children. Our results suggest that various risk factors, some potentially modifiable, are worthy of clinical consideration when addressing infant sleep duration.

N2  - The interpretation of cardiotocograhy tracings (CTG) is still crucial in modern technology, both during pregnancy and labor. “Eye-balling” the pattern is important, but a structured analysis should always be performed. One starts with the judgment of contractions and/or hypertonia, then the baseline, variability, accelerations, and decelerations, followed by a conclusion. A thorough description helps to be more precise and accurate. The recognition of too many contraction, i.e. overstimulation, is of great importance. If the basal FHR is too high, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis. The same is true for silent patterns, sinusoidal-like pattern (SLP) etc. A silent pattern can be seen during a fetal behavioural state 1F (“non-REM-sleep”), but also under pathologic conditions, And classically, a sinusoidal CTG (SLP) has been associated with severe fetal anaemia. This is certainly still valid, but similar patterns can also occur under different circumstances. The point is not the precise definition of the pattern, but rather the knowledge or recognition that a CTG pattern is “not normal”. One should not jump to conclusions, but rather make a differential diagnosis and try and find the reason for this pattern. For example, normal fetal behaviour may elicit a SLP as well: fetal regular mouthing “movements” during state 1F leads to a small sinus pattern, while fetal sucking movements in state 3F (“quiet awake”) may lead to a SLP with a much larger sinus. Also, drugs like pethidine and meperidine may evoke a SHP, and the use of medication should therefore be considered. Finally, even if the maternal heart rate is recorded, and not the fetus (!), a SLP can be seen, especially during the second stage of labor. In conclusion, when one observes an “abnormal” CTG, one should always work on the differential diagnosis, and continue the recording. The sudden appearance of a SLP is seldom worrisome, and in most cases there is time to think, before unnecessary interventions are undertaken, or before the pregnant women is sent home without a necessary intervention.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Fetal electrocardiography (fECG) from a portable abdominal monitor (Monica Healthcare, Nottingham) could increase the diagnostic use of heart rate variability in high-risk pregnancies. However, signal quality may be insufficient depending on factors such as maternal physical activity and posture, or bedside vs. ambulatory setting. Materials and Methods: Fifty healthy women (gestation week 23-40) wore the monitor during day and night at home and 38 women (gestation week 26-37) during a hospital stay. Durations of recordings ranged between 1.4 and 28 h. Fetal HR (FHR) was automatically analyzed and extracted beat-by-beat. Success rate of fetal heart rate detection (%SUC) for each minute of recording was analyzed in relationship to concurrent measurements of maternal physical activity, posture, and sleep vs. wake state. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: In the ambulatory setting, %SUC was 77.3 for sleep and 29.5 for wake (p < 0.01). This was largely due to the effects of physical activity (%SUC for level 0, 1, 2, 3: 68.7, 26.3, 15.1, 5.6) and posture (%SUC supine: 71.8; upright: 47.1). %SUC rates in the clinical setting were generally lower (e.g. % SUC sleep: 61.7; activity level 0: 48.3). Conclusions: Results demonstrate that diagnostic utility of the FHR monitor strongly depends on the home/hospital setting and maternal sleep-wake-cycle, activity, and posture. Meaningful heart rate variability analysis is largely confined to supine sedentary recordings. Factors contributing to the reduced accuracy in clinical settings need to be investigated.

N2  - Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) provides us with a method of assessing brain activity in critically ill neonates. In extremely premature neonates, the aEEG trace is predominantly discontinuous, making it difficult to distinguish between a "normal" and "abnormal" trace. We measured aEEG activity in the first 48 h of life in neonates born before 29-wk gestation and used both visual and quantitative analysis of the aEEG data to assess differences in neonates with poor short-term outcome [death or peri/intraventricular hemorrhage (P/IVH)] compared with those who survived without P/IVH to identify features of an abnormal aEEG. On quantitative analysis, EEG continuity <80% at 10-μV level was a sensitive and specific marker of poor short-term outcome. By using this marker, we identified 83% of neonates who died or developed grade 3 or 4 IVH and 60% of neonates who developed grades 1 or 2 IVH, with a positive predictive value for death or any IVH of 73% and a negative predictive value of 86%. Absence of sleep-wake cycling with baseline variability <2 μV was the strongest predictor of outcome using visual analysis alone. © 2010 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

N2  - History is a cyclic poem written by time upon the memories of man. (Shelley) In the beginning there were Bob and Patrick, and then came Louise. Louise originated from an oocyte collected from a naturally derived large antral follicle. However clinicians and embryologists were already aware that the chances of successful implantation after IVF were increased if they had a number of embryos from which to select, and if they put more than one embryo into the uterus. Superovulation with Clomifene, and pituitary then urinary derived gonadotropins became the order of the day. Clinicians collected many eggs, embryologists had many embryos from which to select, and there were many multiple pregnancies. Clinicians and embryologists became tired of midnight oocyte collections timed against the onset of the natural LH surge. GnRH agonists appeared, and, somewhat surprisingly, these were found to desensitise the pituitary GnRH receptor after prolonged exposure. 'Downregulation' became de rigeur, clinicians and embryologists had more sleep and patients had menopause. Pregnancy rates improved. This was largely because of better embryology but the clinicians took most of the credit. IVF teams stopped going to the pub whenever there was a positive pregnancy test as their LFTs became deranged. However inertia crept in. Successful units became more and more resistant to change. Anything might lead to a fall in pregnancy rate, so protocols became cast in stone and deviant doctors and embryologists were sent to the Gulag. But the poetry of IVF is cyclic. Pressure from obstetricians, paediatricians, politicians and poets led to a drive to reduce multiple pregnancy rates. We needed less embryos, not more, and women began to ask whether the menopause was a necessary part of IVF conception. The bête noir of ovarian hyperstimulation began to be talked about more openly, and scary stories were exchanged. So ART creaked and groaned its way into C21 with gradual acceptance of 'mild', 'soft', 'gentle' or other soap powder derived acronyms for a more user friendly approach to superovulation. Embryologists had fewer eggs to play with, although their quality might have improved, and tanks of liquid nitrogen gradually emptied of supernumerary embryos. OHSS became a rare event and even British journalists began to admit that IVF might be a 'good thing' (well one can live in hope). The talk reviewed where we are in the cycle of superovulation strategies, with some pointers to the future and occasional nostalgic references to the good old days.

N2  - RATIONALE: Late preterm infants (LPI)s make up 71% of all preterm births and their incidence has been increasing over the last 20 years. LPIs have increased respiratory morbidity including transient tachypnea and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) compared to term infants. A single course of antenatal steroids (AS) is recommended for pregnant women at risk for delivery between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation and significantly decreases RDS in the preterm infant. We have shown that a single course of AS increases respiratory compliance (Crs) in preterm infants treated with AS at 24 - 34 weeks versus matched untreated infants. We hypothesized that LPIs who received a course of AS would have increased Crs compared to untreated LPIs. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria were: 1) LPIs born at 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks; 2) treatment with a course of AS (2 doses of betamethasone) within 7 days of delivery or at least one dose of AS ≥ 6 hours before delivery; 3) pulmonary function testing performed within 72 hours of life and before surfactant when required. Our comparison group was LPIs who had received no AS before delivery and matched for gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), race and gender to the study group. Crs was measured with the single breath occlusion technique during quiet sleep (Pediatrics 2008). RESULTS: We studied 25 LPIs treated with AS and 25 matched LPIs who did not receive AS. The treated LPIs had a significantly increased Crs (both total Crs and normalized for body weight). Significantly less of the treated LPIs required any continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or > 24 hours of supplemental oxygen after delivery. There was no difference in need for surfactant or days on mechanical ventilation. (Table presented) CONCLUSION: Crs is significantly increased in this cohort of LPIs who received AS prior to delivery compared to matched LPIs who did not receive AS. Although not randomized, this preliminary data supports the possible beneficial effects of AS for infants at risk of delivering between 34 to 36 weeks. This will need to be studied in a randomized trial targeting specific gestational ages within the LPIs and carefully evaluating safety and efficacy. We speculate that the increased Crs could be secondary to enhanced lung fluid reabsorption and/or decreased RDS in these patients.

N2  - Objectives: To fully ascertain the familial aggregation of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to characterize the clinical features of familial RLS (fRLS) cases. Design: A case series survey with a high response rate. Setting: Academic research center. Participants: Consecutive RLS probands (n=249) were followed up in a specialized sleep center for 15 years. A total of 671 cases of fRLS met the current standard diagnostic criteria, including 192 probands characterized using multidimensional clinical assessments and 479 affected family members assessed by their responses to a structured questionnaire telephone diagnostic interview. Main Outcome Measures: Sibling and offspring relative risk ratio and clinical and genetic features of patients with fRLS and families. Results: Our data showed that RLS aggregates in families with a familial rate of 77%, a sibling relative risk of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.4), and an offspring relative risk of 1.8 (1.0-2.7). Familial RLS is a chronic disorder with a mean (SD) disease duration of 24(16) years and a wide range of age of onset (mean [SD], 28[15] years), with most family members having early-onset disease but mild to moderate RLS symptoms. Our clinical data also indicated that fRLS is more prominent among women who also had increased incidence of anemia/iron deficiency, arthritis, and number of pregnancies. Pregnancy-related RLS seems to be a characteristic feature of fRLS, and afflicted women tend to have a much younger age of onset. Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome significantly aggregated in families with variable phenotypic expressivity, and the siblings of severely affected individuals have an increased risk of developing the disease. ©2010 American Medical Association.

N2  - Introduction: Mitochondrial myopathies are a rare heterogeneous group of disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial DNA resulting in defects of the respiratory chain. Although multiple organ systems may be affected, they predominantly affect skeletal muscle. Three groups of mitochondrial abnormalities are described: the respiratory chain deficiencies (complexes I-IV), mitochondrial DNA mutations and mitochondrial deletions. 1 Case Report: A 28-year old patient with a mitochondrial respiratory chain defect affecting complexes I (NADH oxidase - absence of activity) and IV (cytochrome oxidase-reduced activity), diagnosed at 10 years of age was referred to the multi-disciplinary high-risk obstetric team. Her main problems were skeletal myopathy with poor mobility and respiratory weakness, elevated blood lactate, cataracts, pigment retinopathy and short stature. She had documented nocturnal hypoventilation treated with CPAP (6cm H20) for the last 7 years. She was monitored during pregnancy with lung function tests, sleep studies and serial fetal growth scans but showed no evidence of deterioration. Elective caesarean section (CS) was undertaken at 37 weeks of gestation. Full standard anaesthetic monitoring was instituted. Supplemental face mask oxygen was given to increase the baseline oxygen saturation from 93% to 97%. We performed combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia with 12 mg bupivacaine and 400 meg diamorphine intrathecally. A further 50 mg bupivacaine was given epidually to achieve a block to T4. A phenylephrine infusion was titrated to maintain baseline blood pressure until delivery. There were no episodes of dyspnoea or desaturation therefore intraoperative CPAP was not required. Post-natal progress was unremarkable. Discussion: Patients with mitochondrial myopathies can exhibit a variety of different clinical syndromes. Any organ system can be involved necessitating individualised management. The main issues for our patient were respiratory weakness and lactic acidosis. CS was the delivery mode of choice in order to avoid the increased metabolic demand of labour which might precipitate potentially life threatening lactic acidosis or respiratory compromise.2 Regional anaesthesia reduces metabolic stress and avoids the problems of general anaesthesia in these patients which may include potential drug sensitivity (induction agents and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants), malignant hyperthermia, hyperkalaemia (suxamethonium use) 3 and post-operative respiratory depression.

N2  - Objective: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. Study Design: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. Results: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P < .05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P < .05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P > .05). Conclusion: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrinopathy of women during their childbearing years with a prevalence of 6-8 %, although a conclusive definition of the disorder and the importance of the three diagnostic criteria relative to each other remain contentious. Familial and genetic factors cause predisposition to PCOS, but a significant degree of controversy exists regarding the etiology of this syndrome. The major endocrine disruption is excessive androgen secretion and abnormal gonadotropin dynamics and a large proportion of women also have abnormal insulin activity. Many body systems are affected in PCOS, resulting in several health complications, including menstrual dysfunction, infertility, hirsutism, acne, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. An increased risk of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, and sleep apnoea is also found more commonly in this population Even though the adverse health consequences associated with PCOS are substantial, most women are not aware of these risks. Early recognition and treatment of metabolic sequelae should be the main focus of clinicians. Lifestyle modifications, mainly a balanced diet, weight loss, and regular exercise, are of utmost importance. On the pharmacologic front, various therapies, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and in particular oral contraceptives with antiandrogen properties appear to be very promising in the management of cosmetic and metabolic aspects of PCOS.

N2  - The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as iron deficiency or some drug treatments.The patients suffering from RLS should be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule.Drug treatment should be restricted to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on an individual basis, when the clinical impact is serious.Four drug classes are central to the treatment of RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines.Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel®) and pramipexole (Sifrol®).After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We have previously defined the characteristics of upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex (UESCR) evoked upon mid esophageal provocation in human neonates (Jadcherla et al. J Pediatr 2003 and 2005, Am J Gastroenterology 2007). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of sleep in modulating the volume dependent esophageal adaptive reflex responses. We tested the hypothesis that the frequency recruitment of esophageal provocation induced UESCR is dependent on media type (air, liquid), volume, activity state (sleep and awake) and maturation. METHODS: Healthy enteral-fed neonates (N=13, 27±0.7 wks gestation) were evaluated at 34±0.5 wks (Time-1) and 37±0.5 wks (Time-2) corrected age using concurrent esophageal manometry and video-polysomnography (V-PSG). Mid esophageal infusions (829) of graded volumes of air (0.1 to 5 ml) and liquids (0.1 to 2 ml) were given, and the frequency recruitment of UESCR were evaluated by observers blinded to sleep state, and V-PSG was scored by observers blinded to manometry. Multiple logistic regression and mixed statistical models were used, data shown as Least Squared Means ± SEM or Odds Ratios (95% CI). RESULTS: At Time-1, 399 infusions (153 air, 246 liquid) were given; of which 57 infusions were in awake and 342 in sleep state. At Time-2, 430 infusions (172 air, 258 liquid) were given; of which 42 infusions were in awake and 388 in sleep state. The relationship between the stimulus (media, volume), activity state (awake and sleep), UESCR, and maturation (Time-1 vs. -2) are described in the table. Results in the table may be interpreted as unit volume increment in the stimulus results in corresponding Odds Ratio increment in the recruitment of the reflex. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Increased recruitment of UESCR in sleep is preserved in healthy premature infants. a) Significantly (P < 0.05), maturational differences in the recruitment of UESCR evoked upon mechano-stimulation with air are present in awake state only. b) However, significant(P < 0.05) increase in recruitment of UESCR evoked with liquids is present in sleep state at both stages of maturation. 2) These findings may be of importance in the evaluation of aerodigestive pathologies.

N2  - Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD1) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for immunoglobulin μ-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2). It has been described to represent 1% of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients that present as infants. Because of the poor prognosis of this disease, early diagnosis is imperative. We present a patient with failure to thrive, stridor, and right diaphragm paralysis who progressed to respiratory failure and was diagnosed with SMARD1. Case report: This infant male presented at one month of age with noisy breathing and failure to thrive. He was born at 40 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. On admission he had symptoms of a weak cry, stridor, and difficulty feeding. Initial workup revealed silent aspiration and right diaphragmatic paralysis. Polysomnography showed obstructive sleep apnea, frequent stridor, and paradoxical breathing. Bronchoscopy revealed mild laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and left sided bronchomalacia. After this procedure he had acute respiratory failure and required intubation due to a collapsed right lung. He had several failed extubations and remained ventilator dependent. He underwent right diaphragm plication and supraglottoplasty to improve his respiratory mechanics without success. He then underwent tracheostomy and needed mechanical ventilation. At 3 months of age nerve conduction studies showed significant denervation of the motor neurons with the distal upper extremities being affected and the proximal muscle motor neurons conserved. Genetic testing revealed the patient had heterozygous mutations at IGHMBP2 gene (c.1060+2T>C in intron 7, c.1737C>A detected in exon 12). After discussion of the diagnosis and prognosis with the patient's family, his parents elected to withdraw care. Discussion: Our patient had presenting features consistent with SMARD1 including the following: inspiratory stridor, a weak cry, and hemidiaphragm paralysis. The prominence of stridor and obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography initially led practioners to focus on an evaluation of the patient's airway. His diagnosis was not made until after multiple interventions were made including diaphragm plication, airway evaluation and surgery, and tracheostomy with mechanical ventilation. While SMARD1 is described in the literature, its rarity can make diagnosis a challenge. Unlike the relatively more common SMA, patients with SMARD1 will have respiratory distress prior to manifestation of distal muscle weakness. Genetic testing for SMARD1 should be considered in any infant presenting with respiratory distress and elevated diaphragm without a history of birth trauma. Early diagnosis can then promote educated discussions regarding prognosis with the family.

N2  - Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered first-line therapy for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); however, about one half of patients stop therapy within one year. Initial CPAP use has been shown to predict long-term adherence, and strategies to maximize initial use could reduce the eventual abandonment of therapy. Prescribing a short-term course of a nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic when initiating CPAP therapy is one potential strategy. Lettieri and colleagues conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if an initial short course of eszopiclone (Lunesta) would improve long-term CPAP adherence. The Study: The authors recruited patients newly diagnosed with OSA who were initiating CPAP therapy. All patients received formal mask-fitting, and were randomized to receive 3 mg of eszopiclone or a placebo nightly for the first 14 nights of CPAP therapy. During the next six months, CPAP use was monitored by a smart card adherence-monitoring device that was integrated into the CPAP units. Patients were excluded if they had a long-term history of taking hypnotic medications, drank more than two alcoholic beverages per night, were pregnant, or had been diagnosed with a hepatic disease or a psychiatric condition that would preclude completion of the study. Results: A total of 154 patients with similar baseline traits were randomized to receive eszopiclone or placebo. The eszopiclone group used their CPAP machines more often than the control group (64.4 versus 45.2 percent of nights), and for a longer period on average (4.05 versus 3.02 hours per night. Patients using placebo were nearly twice as likely to discontinue CPAP therapy (hazard ratio = 1.90) as patients using eszopiclone. Results were unrelated to apnea severity, age, or baseline sleepiness scores. Conclusion: The authors conclude that an initial two-week course of eszopiclone in patients with OSA increases their CPAP adherence, and significantly decreases discontinuation rates within the first six months of use. © 2010 by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

N2  - A 2 day old term male born at an outside facility was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit in our institution for evaluation of tachypnea. The pregnancy and vaginal delivery were unremarkable. The birth weight was 3805 grams. Apgars were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Minutes after delivery, the infant's respiratory rate increased to 80 breaths per minute. He was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 98% in ambient air. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 38 and pO2 of 88. His tachypnea resolved within a few minutes only to recur after breastfeeding. During these episodes, the infant had clear breath sounds, mild subcostal retractions and no oxygen desaturation. His mother noticed his respiratory rate increased especially when “angry.” Physical exam upon admission to our facility: temperature 36.8° C, heart rate 162/minute, respiratory rate 40/minute, blood pressure 69/53, weight 3.8 kilograms. Oxygen saturation in ambient air was 98%. The infant was sleeping comfortably. His cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. His chest was clear to auscultation with good aeration. Awakening resulted in short audible “sighs” with inspiration followed by rapid abdominal breathing, subcostal retractions and normal exhalation. His electronically monitored respiratory rate climbed to 100 breaths per minute without a decline of his oxygen saturation. When asleep, his respirations normalized. The infant showed no signs of feeding intolerance. Plain films of the chest and abdomen were normal. A polysomnograph revealed diaphragmatic fluttering at a rate of > 400/minute during inspiration superimposed upon a baseline respiratory rate of 40-70/minute. Flexible laryngoscopy demonstrated mild laryngomalacia. Results of polysomnography (Graph presented) Impedance pneumography of the chest and abdomen for a 30 second window demonstrates DF only with inspiration at a rate of greater than 400/min with an underlying respiratory rate of 70 breaths/minute. Diaphragmatic flutter (DF) is a rare condition defined as diaphragmatic contractions at a rate of 35 to 480/min and can occur in all age groups. These contractions typically occur during inspiration, and associated laryngeal collapse with contraction may manifest as stacatto inspiratory noises. Rarely does DF occur during sleep or cause respiratory failure. When DF is associated with dysphagia, laryngomalacia and gastroesophageal reflux, it is known as “respiratory flutter syndrome” (RF). The pathogenesis of DF and RF are unknown, but may involve dysfunction of the respiratory control generators, phrenic neuropathy or direct diaphragmatic irritation. Diagnosis can be made with polysomnography, which in our case revealed fluttering of the respiratory rate during inspiration. DF has been successfully treated with chlorpromazine, a dopamine antagonist, but in other cases, it self-resolves.

N2  - Epilepsy is found in 30 to 50% of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Etiology, location of the lesion in cortical or subcortical areas, and its timing from fetal to postnatal periods are variables that influence both risk for evolution to refractory epilepsy and outcome after hemispherotomy. Intractable epilepsy is associated with cortical vascular injury, abnormalities of cortical development (polymicrogyria, hemimegalencephaly) and some progressive conditions (Sturge-Weber disease, Rasmussen's disease). Hemispherotomy has to be considered as early as possible in presence of refractory disabling seizures but also in patients with cognitive decline, which may be related abundant interictal epileptic activity during sleep in the absence of overt seizures. Outcome for seizures after hemispherotomy is favorable if there is neurophysiological evidence that seizures arise from the damaged hemisphere. Outcome for motor function, language and cognition after hemispherotomy need to be addressed separately. It is admitted that hemispherotomy may be performed if fine fingers movements in the opposite arm are impossible. Indeed, if hemiparesis may worse after surgery, aggravation is usually transitory as deficit returns to presurgical baseline except for the distal part of the arm. Reorganization via ipsilateral corticospinal projections is more efficient if the lesion had occurred early in pregnancy. Language is not aggravated after surgery in cases of ante or perinatal lesion because it is the intact hemisphere that is dominant for language in these situations. Still, language may be ameliorated if the intact hemisphere was functionally inhibited by epileptic discharges arising from the damaged hemisphere. If cognition is usually unchanged, behavioral improvement is usual after successful surgery.

N2  - We describe the case of a patient analysed with array-CGH for recurrent fever, abnormal EEG and mild mental retardation. The boy was born at term after a normal pregnancy. Family history was unremarkable. He came to our attention because he presented episodes of fever since the age of three years. Febrile episodes recurred at 5 week intervals and were associated with pharyngitis and sometimes aphtous stomatitis. From the age of 3 to 5 years, he presented some paroxysmal falls without loss of consciousness. The EEG (awake and at sleep state) was abnormal. His neurological examination was characterised by an important language delay and clumsy motor skills. The use of corticosteroids permitted the disappearance of the febrile episodes and the paroxysmal falls but did not improve the electrical cerebral activity that continued to be characterized by frequent focal and diffuse paroxysmal elements. A brain MRI was performed and resulted normal. Laboratory tests showed increased acute phase reactants and IgD levels (372 g/L with n.v. up to 80). Genetic analysis for auto-inflammatory conditions, including TNF-receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), HyperIgD syndrome (HIDS) and Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) was negative. Array-CGH analysis identified a microdeletion of about 280kb in chromosome 15q13.2. The first oligomere deleted was at 28441169bp, and the last one at 28719195bp. Only one known gene maps to this region, CHRFAM7A, a hybrid consisting of a partial duplication of the CHRNA7 gene fused to a copy of the FAM7A gene. Homozygosity for the CHRFAM7A deletion was confirmed for the patient by PCR analysis, with both parents being heterozygote carriers. Interestingly, the alpha7-nicotinic acethylcoline receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7) is located in vicinity to CHRFAM7A. CHRNA7 is involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders linked to 15q13-q14 and is also known for its action on the immune system through the colinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Although the CHRNA7 gene was not affected by the deletion in our patient, it is possible that its function may be indirectly affected by the CHRFAM7A deletion. In order to test thishypothesis, gene expression profiling of both genes in the patient and his parents is currently under way.

N2  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant (P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. Methods: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. Conclusions: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future. © The Author(s) 2010.

N2  - The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is low in the general population in Turkey. To assess the prevalence of RLS in pregnancy, a hospital-based survey assessing symptoms of RLS and other sleep problems was performed through face-to-face interviews and physical examination on 983 pregnant women from 11 hospitals in the two urban and four suburban areas of Kayseri, Turkey, at the time of delivery and 6 months after delivery. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International RLS Study Group. A total of 103 women reported the occurrence of RLS symptoms during pregnancy, giving an RLS prevalence rate of 10.48%, with presence of symptoms more than three times per month, which decreased to 2.9% after 6 months. A significant relationship was observed between RLS and the number of previous pregnancies: women who had one child were compared with women who had 2-3 children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.441, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894-2.324), and women who had ≥4 children (OR = 2.530, 95% CI, 1.377-4.650). Patients with and without the RLS syndrome were similar in respect to distributions of age, income level, career, iron and folate therapy, sleep habits, and sleep problems. The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women is low, like the low prevalence in the general population in Eastern European and/or Asian populations. © 2010 The Authors.

N2  - Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - During pregnancy, physiological changes occur that can potentially compromise the respiratory system by increasing the incidence and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing. The main change is the increased incidence of snoring (11 to 47% depending on the series) which is seen more often in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension complicated or not by pre-eclampsia. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of the main symptoms of the sleep apnea syndrome (which comprise snoring) during pregnancy and secondarily to seek a link with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Thus, we performed a prospective study on 144 women who responded to a predetermined questionnaire 24 hours after giving birth in a maternity. Results: One hundred and thirty women had a normal pregnancy and 14 a pathological one (pregnancy induced hypertension and/or pre-eclampsia). The mean age was 27.2 ± 4.7 years and the Epworth score was 7.6 ± 1.8. Snoring occurred in 48.6% of the patients while 75% of them did not snore before pregnancy. The Epworth score was increased in the snoring population (10.0 ± 1.34). In the group with pregnancy-induced hypertension, 78.5% of the patients snored (p = 0.0001), the Epworth score was 11,57 ± 1,55 (p = 0,0001) and 28.6% reported breathing pauses (p = 0.018). Conclusion: The symptoms of the sleep apnea syndrome appear frequent during pregnancy and seem to be correlated with the pregnancy-induced hypertension. The results underline the relevancy of polysomnographic recordings to support the diagnosis and to develop a treatment that will prevent the pathology. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are of increasing use in pregnant women, but their long-term effects on the child are largely unknown. On the basis of our recent experimental data in mice, our hypothesis is that in utero SSRI treatment will induce life-long sleep alterations through the hyper-activation of 5-HT1A receptors during the prenatal period. The demonstration of such a mechanism could open the way to novel pharmacological issues for the treatment of depression during pregnancy. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Recent studies have shown a negative association between sleep duration and obesity. We examined this relationship using data on 2002 non-pregnant women aged 35-68 from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, a community-based prospective study in Metro Cebu, Philippines. Sleep duration (total hours sleep) was calculated from the women's 24-hr activity diaries (reported for a typical weekday). Obesity measures include body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2)) and waist circumference (in cm). Linear regression models adjusted for age, energy intake, parity, activity levels, and other confounders show a negative association between sleep duration and BMI [beta (95% CI) -0.26 (-0.38 to -0.14)] and waist circumference[beta (95% CI) -0.57 (-0.88 to -0.27)]. Getting more than 6 hours of sleep protected against the risk of overweight (BMI=>25) [Odds ratio (95% CI) -0.68 (0.55 to 0.84)]. These findings are consistent with those of other studies, and provide valuable insights particularly for older women given that 39% of these women are aged >=50. Among older adults, this sleep-obesity association gains relevance as sleep duration gets shorter and losing weight becomes more difficult with age.

N2  - Objectives: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (≤0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls). Methods: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Results: There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. Conclusions: Both cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress reactivity measures suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns. This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Growing interest has been driven by the discovery of a tight relationship between prenatal manipulations and development of short- and long-term health disorders. Our objective was to analyze developmental programming effects of maternal sleep deprivation on offspring expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the hypothalamus. Pregnant female Swiss mice aged 3 months were distributed into 5 groups: One group of dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for six hours on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3); and a last group which could sleep normally (CT). At the 3rd month of age, male offspring were euthanized and the hypothalamus dissected for RNA extraction. Real time PCR assays were used to measure levels of mRNAs encoding the enzymes in the tissue. We found no alteration in the expression of the DNMTs 1 and 3a. Although we found no differences in the DNMTs expression in the hypothalamus, epigenetic alterations could have important implications for development of health disorders.

N2  - The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood obesity and diabetes are unclear. These studies investigated energy homeostasis in 8- and 20-wk-old male and female mice subjected to protein deficiency in utero. Pregnant C57BL/6J female mice were fed a protein-deficient diet (6% protein). Undernourished offspring (UO) and controls (CO) were cross-fostered to lactating dams fed a 20% control diet. The 24-h profiles of energy expenditure, feeding behavior, physical activity, and whole-body substrate preference was assessed using 8-wk UO and CO weaned onto control diet. Blood chemistries, glucose tolerance,andexpression of genes involved in hepatic lipidand glucose metabolism were analyzed in 8- and 20-wk-old CO and UO fed control or a high-fat diet. UO exhibited IUGR with catch-up growth at 8wk of age and increased severity of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by 20 wk of age. Therefore, fetal malnutrition in the C57BL/6J mouse increases sensitivity to diet-induced obesity. Abnormal daily rhythms in food intake and metabolism, increased lipogenesis, and inflammation preceded obesity in the UO group. Arrhythmic expression of circadian oscillator genes was evident in brain, liver, and muscle of UO at 8 and 20 wk of age. Expression of the clock-associated nuclear receptor and transcription repressor Rev-erbα was reduced in liver and muscle of UO. Altered circadian physiology may be symptomatic of the metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR, and altered feeding behavior and substrate metabolism may contribute to the obese phenotype.

N2  - Background: Webb R et al (in press 2009) found an excess risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) for infants born to women with psychotic illness, including schizophrenia. For infants of women with psychotic illness, the absolute risk of SIDS has fallen since the global “Reducing the Risks” (RTR) campaign. However, the relative risk of SIDS in these women's infants has increased compared with infants born to other women in the general population. We aimed to determine whether infants born in Western Australia (WA), to women with psychotic illness, were at greater risk of SIDS than other infants. Methods: A population based record linkage case cohort study of infants (n = 472,722) born in WA from 1980 to 2001 inclusive, to 249,145 women. Of the live born, singleton infants 20,209 were born to women with severe mental illness (case mothers) and 436,725 to women with no mental illness (control mothers). Mothers of the 587 SIDS infants were compared with mothers whose infants were alive at one year. Results: Infants born to women with psychotic illness after the RTR campaign were significantly more likely to be a SIDS death (OR 2.9 95% CI 2.3 - 3.8) than infants born to other women. Women with psychotic illness were more likely to be teenaged (OR 2.2 95% CI 2.1 - 2.3), unsupported by a partner (OR 2.6 95% CI 2.6 - 2.8), to smoke during pregnancy (OR 2.7 95% CI 2.5 - 2.9), and to have experienced significant obstetric complications (OR 1.4 95% CI 1.3 - 1.5) in their current pregnancy when compared with the control group of women. Singleton infants born to women with psychotic illness after the RTR were significantly more likely to weigh less than 2,500 grams (OR 1.6 95% CI 1.5 - 1.7) or be born before 37 weeks gestation (OR 1.1 95% CI 1.0 - 1.1), than infants born to women with psychotic illness before the RTR. Discussion: Infant's sleep position, young maternal age, maternal smoking, single motherhood, maternal socioeconomic disadvantage, male infants and preterm birth are among the established risk factors for a SIDS death. During the study period, the Australian RTR for SIDS campaign validly stressed parental behavioural risk factors: safe infant sleeping posture; avoidance of smoke exposure and not over-wrapping the baby. In this study, the major risk factors for SIDS for infants born to women with psychotic illness, when compared with other women were: low birth weight, preterm birth, current or prior teenage and/or single motherhood, smoking in pregnancy and obstetric complications, all potentially modifiable risk factors. Of the RTR target behaviours, only smoking in pregnancy was available in our dataset, and only for 1998 to 2001 inclusive, making pre and post-RTR campaign comparisons difficult. However, unless rates of smoking during pregnancy had declined for women with psychotic illness, then we would not expect obstetric complications to be modified by the RTR. The next step in this program of work is to examine separately data for maternal illness onset prior to the infant's birth compared with post-partum illness onset.

N2  - Introduction Acromegaly is a serious endocrinopathy that is associated with considerable morbidity and increased mortality (1-3). Although the pituitary tumours associated with acromegaly are usually benign, the elevated levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 lead to a wide range of cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine and metabolic alterations. Thus, number of co-morbidities are present in patients with acromegaly, including arthropathy, hypertension, sleep apnoea, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, cardiomyopathy, colon polyps, goitre, and headache (4-7).In a recent meta-analysis, the weighted mean of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) from 16 published studies of patients with acromegaly was 1.72 (8). In the more recent studies improved survival is reported, presumably due to modern treatment modalities and strictly defined cure criteria, but nevertheless there was a 32% increased risk for all-cause mortality acromegaly (8). Patients with random serum GH levels < 2.5 ng/ml after treatment, mostly measured by standard radio-immuno assay (RIA), had mortality close to expected levels (SMR 1.1) compared with a SMR of 1.9 for those with a level > 2.5 ng/ml. Similarly, a normal serum IGF-1 level for age and sex was associated with a SMR of 1.1 compared with a SMR of 2.5 for those with elevated IGF-1 levels (9). Treatment goals and approaches Currently, treatment options in acromegaly include surgical removal of the tumour, medical therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary. Each treatment modality has specific advantages and disadvantages but the optimal use of these treatments and their combination should result in a reduction of mortality in the acromegaly patient population to that of general population. Goals of treatment are to: Inhibit GH hypersecretion and normalize IGF-1 levels; Control tumour growth and relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumour may be exerting on the surrounding brain areas; Preserve normal pituitary function or treat hormone deficiencies; Improve the symptoms of acromegaly. Based on the fact that basal GH levels > 2.5 ng/ml (3, 10), elevated IGF-1 (3, 11, 12), age and disease duration (3, 12), hypertension (3) diabetes and cardiac diseases are the main determinants of mortality, biochemical goals to control mortality are a GH< 2.5 ng/ml or a normal range and sex adjusted IGF-1 levels. Measurement of GH during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) may be preferred to a random GH measurement, and a biochemical control is defined as a nadir of GH < 1.0 ng/ml during the OGTT. Successful treatment of GH/IGF-1 hypersecretion is expected to improve co-morbidities in patients with acromegaly to varying degrees. Nevertheless, some may persist even after successful control of acromegaly, and some may improve even if control is not achieved (13). So, all co-morbidities should be actively diagnosed and treated irrespective of GH and IGF-1 levels, and therapeutic decisions should be made according to both clinical and biochemical assessment. Medical therapy Currently, there are three drug classes available for the treatment of acromegaly: dopamine agonists (DAs), somatostatin analogues or somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs), and a GH receptor antagonist (GHRA). After transsphenoidal surgery, SRLs are generally the first line of treatment, followed by GHRA or DAs. Somatostatin receptor ligands The SRLs act primarily via somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5 leading to a decrease in adenoma GH secretion. They have a multitude of other endocrine and non-endocrine effects, including inhibition of glucagon, VIP, and gastrointestinal peptides. Periodically GH/ IGF-I levels should be monitored to assess response. The use of SRLs is most appropriate (14): After surgery has failed to achieve biochemical control; To provide disease control, or partial control, in the time between administration of radiation therapy and the onset of maximum benefit attained from radiation therapy; As first-line therapy when there is a low probability of a surgical cure (for example, large extrasellar tumours with no evidence of central compressive effects); Before surgery to improve severe co-morbidities that prevent or could complicate immediate surgery (15). Long-term studies indicate that approximately 70% of patients receiving SRLs have GH levels < 2.5 ng/ ml and normalized IGF-1 and maximal benefit may be achieved after 10 years of therapy (16). However, these studies often include patients pre-selected for GH responsivity. In unselected populations, SRLs reduce GH to < 2.5 ng/ml and normalize IGF-1 in 44% and 34% of patients, respectively (17). Tumour shrinkage of > 20% occurs in approximately 75% of acromegaly patients receiving these drugs (mean 50% reduction in tumour volume) (18). These peptide analogues have a proven safety record. Common side effects include altered gastrointestinal motility with a reduction over the first few months of treatment. Multiple small gallstones and gallbladder sludge commonly occur, but rarely cause cholecystitis. Because of alteration in counter regulatory hormones (eg, insulin, glucagon, GH), hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia can occur. Bradycardia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias have been reported. Thus, patients on insulin, oral hypoglycaemias, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers may need dosage adjustments. Secondary hypothyroidism can also occur because of parallel inhibition of thyrotropin secretion. Patients should remain on the same dose for 3 months (assuming medication tolerance) to properly assess adequacy of treatment and the need for dose titration. In well-designed trials, the long-acting formulations appear to be equivalent in the control of symptoms and biochemical markers in patients with acromegaly (19).Octreotide (Sandostatin) - adult dose: initial: 50 μg SC tid; can increase to 500 μg tid; doses of 300-600 μg/d or higher seldom result in additional benefit. Adverse effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and increased incidence of gallstones and biliary sludge. Caution is needed in renal impairment. It is usually safe in pregnancy but benefits must outweigh the risks (category B). Octreotide LAR (Sandostatin LAR) The long-acting somatostatin analogue is administered every 4 weeks (adult dose 10-30 mg i.m. q28 days). Similar improvements occur in GH/IGF-I levels compared to octreotide but are associated with fewer adverse effects. Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established (category C). Lanreotide (Somatuline Depot) This octapeptide analogue of natural somatostatin elicits high affinity for human somatostatin receptors 2, 3, and 5. Inhibits a variety of endocrine, neuroendocrine, exocrine, and paracrine functions, including basal secretion of motilin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and pancreatic polypeptide. Markedly inhibits meal-induced increases in superior mesenteric artery blood flow and portal venous blood flow. Also significantly decreases prostaglandin E1-stimulated jejunal secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Reduces prolactin levels in acromegalic patients, when treated long term. Fatal risk is revealed in studies in animals but is not established or not studied in humans (category C in pregnancy). Lanreotide is indicated for long-term treatment of acromegaly in patients who experience inadequate response to other therapies. Adult dose-90 mg s.c. q 4 week for 3 months initially; dosage range 60-120 mg q4 week. In moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment: 60 mg s.c. q 4 week for 3 months. The dose is adjusted according to GH/IGF-1. Dopamine agonists DAs are the only oral medication available for acromegaly. These agents are usually added to SRLs if complete remission has not been achieved. They have modest effects if used as a single agent and are less potent than SRLs in decreasing both GH (42.4% vs. 62.8%, P < 0.008) and IGF-1 (8% vs. 40.4%, p = 0.05) (21). Clinical situations where DAs may be useful include (14): After surgery (very occasionally as first-line therapy) in selected patients, such as those with markedly elevated prolactin and/or modestly elevated GH and IGF-1 levels; As additive therapy to SRLs in patients partially responsive to a maximum SRLs dose - about 50% of such patients may achieve control of GH and IGF-1 with combination therapy (20). Bromocriptine (Parlodel) Acts on central dopamine receptors. It is considered to be more effective in tumours that co-secrete prolactin and the dose used to treat acromegaly is usually much higher than that used for hyperprolactinemia. Initial adult dose is 1.25 mg p.o. and is increased gradually; maintenance dose is 20-30 mg p.o. adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, nasal congestion, orthostatic hypotension, and digital vasospasm. Patients tend to develop tolerance to adverse effects. Caution is needed in renal or hepatic disease. Bromocriptine is usually safe in pregnancy but benefits must outweigh the risks (category B). Cabergoline (Dostinex) Of the two DAs, the long acting one - Cabergoline is considered to be more effective in acromegaly, and this is limited - monotherapy is effective in less than 10% of patients (22). The weekly dose is 1.0-2.0 mg. High doses of Cabergoline in patients with Parkinson's disease (higher than doses used in acromegaly), and a prolonged duration of therapy, are associated with the development of cardiac valvular abnormalities. Valvular disease has not been found in patients receiving the conventional doses used for pituitary tumours (23). Patients receiving higher than conventional doses of Cabergoline for prolonged periods of time should be monitored by performing echocardiography. Growth hormone receptor antagonist Pegvisomant (Somavert) is a recombinant DNA analogue of GH that is structurally altered to act as a GHRA. It selectively binds to GH receptors on cell surfaces, thereby blocking endogenous GH binding. This action interferes with GH signal transduction, resulting in decreased IGF-I, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and acid-labile subunit. The indications for its use are (14): In patients that have persistently elevated IGF-1 levels despite maximal therapy with other treatment modalities. Possibly as monotherapy or in combination with a SRLs in other patients. Pegvisomant is highly effective in acromegaly and significantly improves the quality of life in patients that require both SRLs and pegvisomant to achieve biochemical control (24). Loading adult dose is 40 mg s.c., and maintenance dose is 10 mg s.c qd initially. It may increase or decrease q 4-6 week by 5 mg increments as determined by IGF-I levels. The dose may not exceed 30 mg/d. Safety issues with GHRA include liver function abnormalities and tumour growth. Tumour growth is infrequent (<2%) (25) and approximately 25% of patients have liver function abnormalities, but these appear to be transient in most patients without changing the GHRA dose (26). Whether the tumour growth is due to the GHRA or merely reflects ongoing tumour growth when there is no therapy directed specifically at the tumour has not been established definitively. Pegvisomant improves insulin sensitivity without affecting insulin secretion and may increase insulin or oral hypoglycemic effect. Pegvisomant treatment decreased fasting insulin, fasting glucose and HbA1C and improved metabolic control in acromegalic patients with and without diabetes (26). Recent publications suggest that GHRA may be useful in combination therapy with a SRL (27, 28), but there are no direct comparisons between combination therapy and monotherapy with GHRA. The combination of a SRL and a GHRA may be useful for acromegaly that is resistant to other treatment modalities, for patients who have not achieved biochemical control after surgery, or to improve cost-effectiveness in patients that would otherwise require high-dose GHRA monotherapy. Conclusion No single treatment is effective for all patients. Treatment should be individualized, and often combined, depending on patient characteristics such as age, duration of the disease, tumour size, complications and co-morbidities. There are certain areas where more data are needed on the use of medical therapies. No head-to-head studies of the different SRLs of adequate design and power are available to recommend one drug over the other. More data on the potential use of GHRA as a first-line treatment or in combination with SRLs are needed. The relative cost-effectiveness of all medical therapies as monotherapy, or in the various combination options, requires evaluation. In addition to medical therapy for GH/IGF-1 hypersecretion, treatment of co-morbidities has an important impact on quality of life and mortality.

N2  - We report on an otherwise healthy infant who presented with clusters of alternating central facial nerve paresis. Pregnancy, birth and early development were uneventful. A cousin had been diagnosed with rolandic epilepsy. At 11 months of age, the patient showed intermittent facial asymmetry compatible with right sided central facial paresis. Laboratory work up did not reveal signs of infection, cranial MRI and CT of the petrous bone were normal. Over 1 week, she spontaneously showed full remission of all symptoms. At 17 months of age, she had a similar episode with a now left sided intermittent facial paresis which lasted for 14 days. At 27 months, she presented with clusters of brief episodes of right sided facial paresis. Sleep EEG was normal. At 49 months of age, she again showed episodes of left sided facial paresis. Single episodes lasted for 5-10 s with up to 50 episodes during 24 h. Symptoms spontaneously subsided within 4 days and physical examination was otherwise entirely normal. An EEG now showed right parietooccipital rolandiformic sharp waves with activation during drowsiness and sleep. Because of the positive family history and the EEG, a diagnosis of benign infantile seizures with negative epileptic myoclonus was made. No antiepileptic treatment was started. She is now 58 months of age and no further episodes have occurred. Ictal orofacial phenomena are the clinical hallmark of benign focal epilepsy with centrotemporal sharp waves (BECTS). Negative epileptic myoclonus has repeatedly been described in childhood BECTS, however, to our knowledge it has never been reported in an infant. As in our patient, negative epileptic myoclonus and epileptic episodes of loss of function lasting for prolonged periods frequently lead to a broad diagnostic workup including imaging studies. In infants presenting with episodic central facial nerve paresis, the possibility of negative epileptic myoclonus should be considered.

N2  - Background: Primary Ovarian Insufficiency is defined as a cessation or interruption in ovarian function that occurs prior to 40 years of age. Causes include viral or autoimmune oophoritis, environmental toxins, radiation or chemotherapy, as well as genetic causes such as Turner Syndrome and Fragile X and other disorders linked to the X chromosome. However, the pathogenesis and genes involved are yet to be elucidated. Any woman with amenorrhea for 4 months AND two serum FSH levels in the menopausal range meets criteria for primary ovarian failure. Case: We present a case of a nulligravida 17-year-old female who presented to her gynecologist with a primary complaint of amenorrhea for the past three months. The patient reported previously normal menses beginning at age 11 with physical exam revealing normal breast development as well as secondary sexual characteristics. There were no signs of androgen excess. She denied breast discharge. She denied previous coital activity but reports fluctuating weight, increase in sleep, fatigue, decrease in energy level and hot/cold sensations. Serum and urine HCG were negative. The patient received a full endocrine and autoimmune workup including DHEA-S, thyroid panel, FSH, LH, testosterone, prolactin level, ANA, anti-adrenal antibodies, cortisol levels, estradiol, as well as an abdominal pelvic ultrasound. FSH levels were in the menopausal range on two separate occasions, but estradiol levels were normal. Further testing for withdrawal bleeding with Provera elicited a normal response. Chromosomal testing ordered and molecular analysis was negative for Fragile X. Genetic banding and karyotype analysis revealed a balanced translocation between 46,X, t(X;1)(q21.3;q23) highlighting a rare genetic cause for primary ovarian insufficiency. Comments: Although X-chromosome rearrangements and translocations have been cited in the literature as causes of primary ovarian insufficiency, the mean age of ovarian dysfunction/failure is reported at age 29. Here we describe an unusual case of an adolescent female with features characteristic of primary ovarian insufficiency. Although multiple causes were excluded including autoimmune or iatrogenic causes as well as permutations in the FMR1 gene encoding for the Fragile X syndrome, this case highlights the importance of karyotype analysis revealing the rarer, balanced translocation between the sex and autosomal chromosomes. Family history may uncover other affected family members with similar ovarian dysfunction as it may occur in up to 15% of first degree relatives. Although this patient has no mental impairments, some sex to autosomal translocations present with mental handicaps such as mild mental retardation that may guide the practitioner into arriving at the correct diagnosis. This case exemplifies the importance of obtaining a full workup on the pediatric or adolescent patient who presents with secondary amenorrhea and the primary cause is not pregnancy or stress-related. In addition, it explores specialized treatment and management options for the adolescent patient.

N2  - Purpose: To use radiation exposure rate measurements to determine patient-specific radiation safety instructions with the aim of reducing unnecessary precaution times and to evaluate potential doses to members of the public. Methods and Materials: Radiation exposure rate measurements were obtained from 1279 patients with Stage T1-2 prostate cancer who underwent transperineal 125I or 103Pd seed implantation from January 1995 through July 2008. An algorithm was developed from these measurements to determine the required precaution times to maintain public effective doses below 50% of the limits for specific exposure situations. Results: The median air kerma rates at 30 cm from the anterior skin surface were 4.9 μGy/h (range: 0.1-31.5) for 125I and 1.5 μGy/h (range: 0.02-14.9) for 103Pd. The derived algorithms depended primarily on the half-life Tp, the measured exposure rate at 30 cm, and specific exposure situation factors. For the typical 103Pd patient, no radiation safety precautions are required. For the typical 125I patient, no precautions are required for coworkers, nonpregnant adults who do not sleep with the patient, or nonpregnant adults who sleep with the patient. Typical 125I patients should only avoid sleeping in the "spoon" position (i.e., in contact) with pregnant adults and avoid holding a child for long periods of time in the lap for about 2 months. Conclusions: The large number of cases available for this study permitted the development of an algorithm to simply determine patient-specific radiation safety instructions. The resulting precaution times are significantly less restrictive than those generally prescribed currently. © 2010 American Brachytherapy Society.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic motherchild pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. RESULTS: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy. CONCLIISIOiS: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life.

N2  - The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as iron deficiency or some drug treatments. The patients suffering from RLS should be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule. Drug treatment should be restricted to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on an individual basis, when the clinical impact is serious. Four drug classes are central to the treatment of RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel®) and pramipexole (Sifrol®). After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Stress during pregnancy seems to predispose to behavioral and cognitive disorders in later life (Psychol Bull 130, 2004:115). In fetal sheep, a single course of betamethasone (BM) is a profound stimulator of maturation of cortical neuronal activity at the expense of persisting sleep state fragmentation as a major symptom of depressive disorders (Early Human Dev 83,2007:129). Objective: To examine if maternal stress early during pregnancy affects functional brain maturation. Methods: 12 pregnant ewes underwent isolation stress thrice weekly for 3h between 30 and 100 dGA (days gestation, term 150 dGA) which resulted in reproducible stress responses without habituation (Reprod Sci 16,2009:646). Seven non-stressed pregnant ewes functioned as controls. After chronic instrumentation, fetal electrocorticogram (ECoG) was recorded between 109 and 136 dGA and analyzed by calculating the nonlinear prediction error (PE) as a measure of causality (Chaos 19,2009:015111). Results: In stressed and non-stressed fetuses, cyclic ECoG activity started to develop with maturation of the NREM sleep ECoG at 122 dGA followed by the REM sleep ECoG at 130 dGA. Thus, maturation of thalamic pacemaker circuits that are active in NREM sleep precedes maturation of cortical neuronal interactions that mediate REM sleep. Similar to BM treatment, maternal stress induced persisting sleep state fragmentation and REM sleep suppression in the fetus (p<0.05, Fig. 1). Conclusions: Unlike BM treatment during the 3rd trimester, maternal stress during the 1st and 2nd trimester didn't affect maturation of REM sleep. In contrast, brain stem nuclei that control sleep state length seem to be sensitive to increased glucocorticoid levels over the entire gestation. Persisting sleep state fragmentation indicates the potential of maternal stress during pregnancy to predispose the baby to neurobehavior and depressive disorders. (Figure presented).

N2  - Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan.Design: Cross-sectional.Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 third-trimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale.Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0% for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women.Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression.Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder. © 2009 Sigma Theta Tau International.

N2  - Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. Study Design: Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm birth (PTB). Results: The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA. Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0%; P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%; P = .007). Controlling for comorbid conditions, OSA was associated with an increased risk of PTB (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-6.6), mostly secondary to PET (63%). Cesarean delivery (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.9-22.1) and OSA were associated with maternal morbidity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-13.7). Conclusion: Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical complications, and indicated PTB. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: In a recent prospective study we recently found a 9% prevalence of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy. Severe RLS with iron deficiency was more common in the 7th and 8th months of pregnancy and had profound effects on fatigue, sleepiness and sleep quality (A. Hübner, unpublished). Anectdotal reports suggests the possibility of iron supplementation as therapeutic option of RLS in pregnancy. Objective: To assess the effect of an infusion of ferric carboxymaltose on RLS in pregnant women with RLS and iron deficiency. Patients and methods: Pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate to severe RLS with iron deficiency (ferritin <35 ug/l) or anemia (<11 g/dl) are enrolled in this open-label non-controlled study. Depending on Hb, Iron substitution is performed with an infusion of 500-900 mg of ferric carboxymaltose. Assessment of the effect of treatment is be done by actigraphy for periodic limb movements in sleep (before and one week after therapy), questionnaires (International RLS Study group questionnaire, fatigue severity scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index) and blood tests (iron, ferritin, CRP) at the screening visit, the therapy visit, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after therapy as well as 2 weeks (questionnaires only) and 6 weeks after delivery. Results: So far three patients have been enrolled and treated with ferric carboxymaltose. All three reported a marked decrease in RLS-symptoms from the first night after infusion and showed a decrease of the IRLSSG score of 48%, 59% and 61% respectively. One patient has already had a post therapy actigraphy and showed a decrease of PLMS of 72% in night 1, 61% in night 2 and 9% in night 3. Conclusions: Preliminary results of this ongoing project sugget that iron infusion may have a positive effect on RLS during pregnancy when associated with iron deficiency (ferritin <35 ug/l) or anemia.

N2  - In the last year approximately 63 000 babies were born in New Zealand and 300 000 babies were born in Australia. Over two thirds of these mothers would have experienced pronounced changes to their sleep in the 9 months of pregnancy. Once the baby is born, fragmented sleep and sleep restriction continue and are normal and often severe. There is presently limited information on what constitutes 'normal' changes to sleep during the perinatal timeframe and when these changes become 'extreme.' Recent evidence from the United States and a pilot study conducted in New Zealand indicate that women who have short or poor quality sleep late in pregnancy are at greater risk of requiring medical intervention during birth. In addition, poor sleep across the perinatal period has been associated with mood changes in the postnatal period. This paper will discuss recent findings on changes to sleep in healthy pregnant women and implications for maternal health, particularly possible links to the development of postnatal depression.

N2  - Circadian rhythms in heart rate are present in the adults of several species and in human and sheep fetuses. The persistence of a rhythm fetal heart rate under sympathetic denervation (1), suggests that a biological circadian clock may be present in the fetal heart. Knowledge of the fetal circadian system is limited. In the capuchin monkey at 90% of gestation, clock genes are expressed in several fetal organs. Moreover, the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and the fetal adrenal gland, show a 24-h rhythm of oscillation in clock genes and of MT1 (2). Aim:To identify expression of clock genes (Bmal1, Per 1-2, Cry2 and Clock) and the expression of ADRB1, ANP, and MT1 genes in atrium and ventricle in fetal capuchin monkey at 90% of gestation by sqPCR. Fetal hearts were obtained at 08h, 14h and 20h. We quantified ADRB1, ANP and 18S-rRNA expression by qPCR. Results were expressed as gen/18S-rRNA. Results: All genes were expressed in atrium and ventricle. Levels of ANP and ADRB1 were higher in atrium than ventricle (60 and 10 fold, respectively). ANP showed higher levels of expression in atrium at 20h, whereas the ventricle showed a tendency a high level of expression at 14h. We did not detect a circadian expression of ADRB1 in atrium whereas we detected a robust circadian expression of ADRB1 in ventricle, with a maximum at 14h. Conclusion: We observed circadian rhythms of ANP and ADRB1 in fetal atrium and ventricle. However the maxima were achieved at different clock times. These preliminary observations suggest the presence of functional circadian clocks in the fetal heart. The difference in temporal organization of ADRB1 and of ANP in atrium and ventricle suggest independent regulation in these genes in each compartment.

N2  - Background: The article was designed to estimate the effect of active and passive household cigarette smoke exposure on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma. Methods: We used a secondary observational analysis of pregnant women with mild and moderate-severe asthma enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study of asthma in pregnancy and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing inhaled beclomethasone and oral theophylline. A baseline questionnaire detailing smoking history and passive household smoke exposure was given to each patient. Smoking status was confirmed in the RCT using cotinine levels. Data on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected and analyzed with respect to self-reported tobacco smoke exposure. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson χ2 statistics were used to test for significance. Results: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total symptomatic days (P<.001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P<.001). Among the newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age< 10th percentile (P<.001), and a lower mean birth weight (P<.001). There were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure. Conclusions: Among pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities. © 2010 American College of Chest Physicians.

N2  - Background: Children who were born prematurely are at higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) compared to their same-age peers who were born fullterm. Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of SDB symptoms and effects on growth among preterm infants while they are still infants, with a goal of identifying risk factors to facilitate prevention and early intervention. Methods: The Louisville pediatric SDB risk survey was administered to the primary caretakers of prematurely born infants attending the Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic at West Virginia University Children's Hospital. Results: Participation was 100% among 173 consecutive patients invited to participate in the study. At 9.13 months corrected age, 8.1% of infants born at a mean of 31.6 weeks gestation were reported to snore ≥3 days/week, a rate consistent with diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing among older children. A composite of nine parent-reported symptoms was created based on factor analysis. Birth weight and size for gestational age at birth did not differ between snoring groups or correlate with the composite score. But a significant negative correlation between the composite risk for SDB score and current weight for adjusted age percentile score indicate that infants with higher SDB symptom profiles have lower weight for age (r = -.18, p = .028). Conclusions: SDB symptoms are detectable among infants born preterm, while they are still infants. Because of their preferential risk for SDB and its somatic consequences, a primary research goal should be description of the natural history of SDB and identification of modifiable risk factors and treatment options. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Purpose: To determine if sleep difficulties are associated with preadolescent overweight and obesity. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis examined the relationship between sleep difficulties and childhood overweight/obesity. Participants are from the PHAST project, a continuing longitudinal cohort study of children's physical activity, anthropometry, and aerobic fitness conducted among children in Niagara region since 2004. Children entered the program in grade four and had their height and weight assessed biannually for the first three years and annually thereafter. Because of a high prevalence of overweight or obese (approximately 30% of boys and 36% of girls are overweight or obese) we added another survey in 2008 among this cohort. All students and their parent(s) entered in the PHAST project received a consent letter. For those providing consent, a package including a Sleeping Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) was sent to their parents. In the PHAST cohort 2,205 students had their height and weight measured in the school gymnasium. However, only 854 parents of these students returned the SBQ for their child. After excluding those with missing data related to this analysis, a total of 607 (288 males, 318 females) students, ages 11-13 years were included in the analysis. Overweight/obesity status was determined using age-specific criteria. Children were categorized as having sleep difficulties if they reported that they had 'sometimes' or 'often' experienced waking up at night, snoring or breathing loudly, or were restless while sleeping. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of childhood overweight status and sleep difficulties adjusted for age, gender, breast-feeding, maternal smoking status in the year before pregnancy, mother's age at birth, birth weight, and total hours of sleep. Results: In this sample, 28% children (76 boys and 95 girls) were identified as being overweight or obese. Relative to their normal weight peers, overweight and obese individuals reported a higher prevalence of sleeping behavior problems (10.3% vs. 26.3%, p < .0001), reduced hours of sleep (9.4 vs. 9.1 hours, p < .0002), and a lower proportion of breastfeeding (84.1% vs. 69.4%, p < .0001). In comparison to children having no sleep behavior problems (n = 121), the odds ratios (95% CI) of being overweight or obese using a multiple logistic regression model for those having any one, any two, or all three sleep behavior problems were 1.04 (.561.92), 1.55 (.84-2.86), and 3.75 (1.92-7.34) times higher, respectively. Conclusions: The results suggest that the risk of overweight/ obesity among those preadolescents increases with increased difficulties in sleeping. However, the direction of this relationship has not been determined.

N2  - Objective: To study the normal ranges of sleep-wake cycles in normal fetuses. Materials and methods: A total of 600 fetal heart rate. (FHR) tracings were studied from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at a gestational age between 30 and 40 weeks with a 1-h recording. Two obstetricians interpreted all the FHR recordings independently. Results: The mean baseline FHR was 141.6. (7.6) beats/min. The median relative percentage time spent in a quiet state was 26%. (0-88.6). The median duration of time spent in a quiet state was 15.7 min. (0-53.2) within a 1-h recording. Both quiet and active states were established in 84% of cases. The number of FHR accelerations per hour in an active state increased with advancing gestational age, whereas the baseline FHR gradually decreased. Conclusions: Normal ranges of fetal sleep-wake cycles were established. Fetuses between 30 and 40 weeks had wide variations in the percentage of time spent in sleep-wake states.

N2  - Introduction:Spontaneous abortion is the most common complication of pregnancy. However, the effects of abortion on mental health remain controversial. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between spontaneous abortion and general health outcomes. Methods: In this cohort study, the General health questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) were administered for 500 women in early stage of pregnancy referring to state clinics of Semnan city between 2007-2008. These women were fallowed afterwards on a monthly schedule. 98 abortions have occurred among these women who were once more fulfilling the GHQ-28 one month after abortion. Another 98 women were randomly selected from those who experienced no abortion until 20th week of gestational age to answer the GHQ-28 as control group. Statistical analyses were performed using t-test, Chi Square, Fisher exact tests and Logistic regression. Results: Mean (±SD) age in abortion group was 26.3±6.1, whereas in control group was 25.4±5.8 years, which were not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between two groups in their number of previous pregnancies, living children, previous abortions and education levels. Abortion has significant effect on incidence of somatic disorder (OR=34.7, P=0.027), anxiety and sleep disorder (OR=5.0, P=0.043), depression (OR=11.5, P=0.027) and general health condition after-abortion (OR=10.2, P<0.001). While on the contrary, abortion did not have any significant effect on social function. GHQ-28 mean score in the case group before abortion and after abortion was 22.6 and 29.4 respectively. However, mean score in the control group was 22.5 and 21.5, respectively before and after 20th weeks of gestational age. Changes in mean health scores of two group were significant (P<0.001). Conclusion: Psychological support of women with abortion for improve their quality of life is a necessity.

N2  - Background: For many years, the etiology of neonatal occipital alopecia (NOA) ocurring on the occiput during the early months of life has been thought to be friction caused by the neonate's sleeping position. It is recently clear that NOA has no relationship with the sleep position but with the physiologic shedding of hair in early neonatal life. However, very few studies have focused on epidemiology and etiology of NOA. Objective: We sought to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for NOA. Methods: Medical records of 240 postpartum patients delivered in the obstetrics department at Chosun University Hospital between January 2006 and June 2007 were reviewed to obtain data on gravid females and their neonatal baseline characteristics. Telephone interviews with 193 respondents among them were conducted to investigate the actual conditions of babies' NOA. Along with record reviews, the related clinical data including the presence of NOA, initial occurrence and restoration time of NOA, baby's sleeping position, hair volume at birth, and the presence of maternal postpartum telogen effluvium were asked to assess maternal correlation and fetal risk factors of NOA. Results: Among 193 respondents, the presence of NOA was in 39 babies (20.2%). Bivariate analyses showed that NOA was not significantly associated with sleeping position, hair volume at birth, birth weight, gender of baby, and parity and postpartum telogen effluvium of mother, but was significantly associated with gestational age, maternal age, and delivery method (P<.05). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the maternal risk of NOA was higher in subjects delivered after 38 weeks' gestational age (odds ratio [OR], 3.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-9.79), in subjects younger than 36 years of parturition age (OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.06-13.65), and in subjects not undergoing a Caesarean section (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.06-5.33). Conclusion: The fetus-related factors (eg, the baby's sleeping position, etc) are not associated with NOA, while the maternal pregnancy-related factore, such as mature gestational age, younger gravida (<36 years old), and nonsurgical delivery are associated with babies' NOA in this study population. This finding raises possibility that NOA is a physiologic condition resulting from synchronised shedding of telogen hairs initiated in utero, because it is more affected by usual pregnant state than by unusual pregnant state in our study.

N2  - Objective: To delineate the opioid and non-opioid etiologies of neonatal withdrawal syndromes (NWS); to describe the clinical features of NWS, specifically, the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opioids; to describe a scoring system for evaluating and monitoring treatment for neonates exhibiting drug withdrawal; and to review the current scientific evidence for pharmacologic management of withdrawal in opioid-exposed neonates. Methods: Scientific literature review and Cochrane database review of neonatal withdrawal syndromes and their treatment. Results: Neonatal withdrawal syndromes have been described secondary to maternal use of opioid and non-opioid drugs and other substances during pregnancy. Opioid etiologies include methadone, heroin, buprenorphine, fentanyl, and oxycodone. Non-opioid etiologies of NWS have been described secondary to alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, marijuana, nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); however, it is debatable whether some of these latter substances actually cause a clinical abstinence syndrome or whether the symptoms are a drug intoxication effect. It is estimated that NAS occurs in 55% to 94% of infants born to substance-dependent women. Defining clinical signs and symptoms of a “pure” NWS due to a single agent is difficult as many newborns are actually exposed to poly-substances during gestation. The contributory effect of other substances, including alcohol and nicotine, to the physiologic and behavioral dysregulation after birth must be considered. Presenting symptoms of the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to maternal opioid use usually occur within the first 48-72 hours after birth, but may present up to 2-4 weeks of age due to methadone. Severity of NWS depends on the specific drugs/substances, timing, and the frequency of use by the mother during pregnancy. Clinical features of NAS include neurologic hyperexcitability (insomnia, irritability, cry, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremors, poor sleep, and convulsions), enteric symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, feeding disturbances), and sympathetic/parasympathetic dysregulation (sweating, yawning, fever, tachypnea, and congestion/sneezing). The differential diagnosis of NAS includes neonatal sepsis, meningitis, hypoglycemia, and hypocalcemia, and must always be considered in the evaluation. The Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (or adaptations thereof) is one of the most frequently used scales to quantify objectively the severity of the NAS and to guide treatment/response to treatment, although it has never been scientifically validated. Infants are scored on 31 items (as noted above along with failure-to-thrive and skin excoriations) at regular intervals. Treatment for NAS has included pharmacologic (opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and phenothiazines) and non-pharmacologic interventions. Literature has demonstrated wide variation in practices and inconsistencies in treatment for NWS both in the United States and the United Kingdom/Ireland. Non-pharmacologic therapy is imperative for all infants exhibiting NWS and includes swaddling, slow rocking, environmental controls (low lighting, “white noise”), and pacifiers. Institution of pharmacologic therapy is necessary in a subset of neonates who are exhibiting excessive symptoms to prevent morbidity (score ≥8). The goal of medication therapy is stabilization of more severely symptomatic infants, allowing them to eat, sleep, gain weight, and interact with caregivers, and then a gradual reduction or weaning of medication to allow hospital discharge. Medication regimens used to treat opioid-induced NAS are variable and institution-dependent, although opioid agonists, primarily methadone and morphine, appear to be most frequently used. Opioid agonist medications are thought to be the most effective agents in the treatment of neonatal neurobehavioral problems related to in utero opioid exposure; however, a Cochrane review failed to identify a specific opioid as optimal treatment for infants undergoing opioid withdrawal. Sedatives, such as diazepam, have not been shown to be effective treatment for NWS. Evidence has demonstrated that a combination treatment of opioids and phenobarbital significantly decreases hospital stay and decreases withdrawal severity.5 Comprehensive reviews of pharmacologic management of NAS have concluded that strong evidence is lacking on the relative efficacy of different medication regimens. Buprenorphine has been found to be a novel, safe and effective treatment for NAS. Clonidine has also been demonstrated to be both safe and efficacious both as single and as an adjunctive therapy to opioids. Polydrug withdrawal is primarily treated with opioids alone and in combination with phenobarbital. Many clinicians advocate that treatment of infants with NWS should be based on symptoms, rather than weight-based dosing, at defined intervals, although this issue has never been studied. Neonatal withdrawal due to maternal use of SSRIs has only recently been described and investigated. Overlap between symptoms caused by drug SSRI drug withdrawal or direct serotonin effects likely exists, although NWS has been demonstrated in symptomatic infants with very low or undetectable levels of drug or active metabolite. Symptomatic treatment and/or phenobarbital for those infants with convulsions have been suggested. Conclusive evidence for a “true” neonatal cocaine abstinence syndrome is equivocal, as cocaine and its metabolites have been found in neonatal urine for as long as 7 days postdelivery. Conclusion: The use of opioid agonists (morphine and buprenorphine) and clonidine as adjunct therapy are needed for infants with severe withdrawal symptoms due to passive maternal exposure of opioids. Additional research is needed to provide more optimal and standardized methods for evaluation and treatment of NWS.

N2  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology often encountered in neurologic practice. It produces nonlocalizing symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure and, when left untreated, can result in severe irreversible visual loss. It most commonly occurs in obese women of childbearing age, but it can also occur in children, men, nonobese adults, and older adults. Although it is frequently associated with obesity, it can be associated with other conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea and transverse cerebral venous sinus stenoses. Recent identification of subgroups at high risk for irreversible visual loss, including black patients, men, and patients with fulminant forms of IIH, help guide the optimal management and follow-up. Ongoing studies of venous anatomy and physiology in IIH patients, as well as a recently begun randomized clinical treatment trial, should provide further insight into this common yet poorly understood syndrome. © 2010 MedReviews®, LLC.

N2  - This presentation will first show examples of circannual rhythms within the animal kingdom and also give evidence for circannual rhythms in humans. A clear distinction must be made between “true” circannual rhythms and “simple” annual or seasonal rhythms. Although the biological significance probably is similar in both cases, the possible underlying mechanisms are very likely quite different. The biological importance lies in the fact that both circannual rhythms and seasonal rhythms allow physiological changes to be complete well in advance of seasonal environmental changes. Those environmental variables that, in the course of evolution, have exerted selection pressure to restrict an activity to a particular time of year are called “ultimate factors”. Physiological and/or morphological adaptations that require some time to develop must be initiated early enough to be completed on time, i.e. when the environmental challenges (the ultimate factors) meet with the adequate adaptations. For example, to guarantee that the young are born at the optimal time of year, the preceding process of gonadal development and gestation must be initiated long in advance and often at a time of suboptimal living conditions. For that, the animals need a forewarning environmental cue that reliably gives information about the season to come well in advance. Such cues that actually trigger the annual cycles by affecting physiological processes are called “proximate factors”, of which the photoperiod and its seasonal change is the most important one. The processes that are controlled by the photoperiod (and hence by the pineal gland and melatonin) comprise essentially all types of activities known to show seasonal variations. In contrast, circannual rhythms are generated endogenously (without an extermal trigger) and can persist for many years even under constant environmental conditions. Accordingly, true circannual rhythms can only be found in organisms with a life span of at least several years. In circannual rhythms the proximate factors such as photoperiod do not trigger and thereby initiate the seasonal rhythms, but they are used as zeitgeber to synchronize the endogenous rhythm with the outside world. It has long been questioned whether circannual rhythms exist, or whether they represent only a “sequence of stages”. Today, there are many good examples for endogenous circannual rhythms in many different species and even in humans there is good evidence for at least residual circannual rhythms. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and the anatomical location of a circannual pacemaker within the central nervous system are still under debate. Our present knowledge will be presented and discussed.

N2  - There is evidence that melatonin acts directly on the regulation of ovary function. This action is probably attributed in part to melatonin receptors, which are known to be present in granulosa and cumulus cells (Kang J-T et al. 2009 J. Pineal Res. 46, 22-28). Melatonin is also known to be associated with the modulation of circadian rhythms and the regulation of seasonal reproductive function (Arendt J 1998 Rev. Reprod. 3, 13-22). Circadian rhythms and clock genes appear to be involved in reproductive processes (Dolatshad H et al. 2009 Repro. Fertil. Dev. 21, 1-9). However, the presence of melatonin receptor genes and the clock genes has not been so widely studied or has never been reported to exist in mammalian oocytes.The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of nuclear (Rorα) and membrane (Mt1 and Mt2) melatonin receptors genes and the clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Cry1, Cry2, Per1, Per2) in rat oocytes by reverse RT-PCR. Twenty-seven-day-old Wistar female rats were treated with 20 UI of pregnant mares serum gonadotropin for induction of follicular development and slaughtered 48 h later. All the procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences. The ovaries were removed and placed in TCM-199 supplemented with 100 UI mL-1 penicillin, 100 μg mL-1 streptomycin, and 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol (H-199 medium). Germinal vesicle-intact oocytes, isolated from the ovarian follicles, were denuded from cumulus cells by vortexing for 5 to 8 min. The denuded oocytes were incubated for 5 min in H-199 medium with 0.1% pronase for removal of the zona pellucida. Pools of 80 oocytes per cDNA sample were used. As an internal control for the sample integrity, additional primers for RPL37a were included in each PCR reaction. All the 3 control PCR replicates showed a repeatable amplification. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of cDNA yielded Rorα, Clock, Bmal1, and Cry1 products in 2 of 3 replicates. No expression of the MT1 and MT2 mRNA was observed. The preliminary results suggest the presence of a nuclear melatonin receptor gene and some clock genes in rat oocytes. However, additional studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

N2  - Background: Poor maternal nutrition increases the risk of obesity in the offspring. Circadian periodicity of gene expression, and thus adipocyte function, is controlled by core clock components including CLOCK. SIRT1, an NAD + -dependent protein deacetylase, regulates CLOCK in some tissues. AMPK regulates SIRT1 activity. Both SIRT1 and AMPK regulate adipocyte function. Since abnormal clock function could predispose to obesity, we investigated whether a maternal low-protein diet programmes changes in adipocyte clock function via changes in SIRT1 and AMPK. Methods: Rats were maintained on 8% protein (maternal low-protein; MLP) or 20% protein (control) diet during pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were placed on standard diet at weaning. Protein and gene expression in visceral adipose tissue of 8-week-old offspring was analysed using Western blot and qRT-PCR respectively. SIRT1 activity was measured using fluorescent-based methodology. Results: Protein levels of phospho(Thr172)-AMPK (54.9± 7%; P< 0.01) were lowered in MLP adipose tissue compared to control. Total AMPK was unchanged. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (52± 10%; P< 0.05), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD 1 salvage pathway, and SIRT1 protein (48.4± 4.3%; P< 0.001) and activity (10± 2.5%; P< 0.05) were suppressed by MLP. Gene expression of PPARg (3.1 fold; P< 0.001) was increased consistent with loss of SIRT1-mediated repression of PPARg. Consistent with data from SIRT1-/- MEFs, lowered adipocyte SIRT1 protein and activity were associated with decreased adipocyte CLOCK protein expression in MLP offspring compared to control (60± 6.3%; P< 0.01). Conclusions: Poor early-life protein nutrition could impact circadian periodicity through abnormal function of core clock proteins in association with PPARg activation achieved through lowered SIRT1 and AMPK activities.

N2  - Purpose: Parents influence adolescent health and health behaviors, yet little is known about parents' perceptions of their own educa-tional needs related to adolescent health. Our purpose is to: (1) Describe parents' self-reported educational needs regarding adolescent health issues; and (2) Examine variation in parental reports of adolescent health educational needs based on child's age, and parent socio-demographic and behavioral factors. Methods: In 2008,1078 parents of adolescents 11-17 years of age in North Carolina (NC) participated in two state-wide population-based telephone surveys: the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (NC BRFSS) and a follow-up Child Health Assessment Monitoring Program survey (NC CHAMP). Parents were asked whether it would be helpful to learn about teen health issues, and if so, how helpful it would be to learn about specific issues. Analyses were conducted using weighted survey data (SAS 9.1) to provide population-based descriptions of parents' reported educational needs, and to test whether perceived need varied by age of child, parent socio-demographic (gender, race, education, income), or parent behavioral risk factors linked to specific educa-tional topic (e.g., Is parent BMI associated with parents' perceived educational needs about teens and healthy weight?). Results: The majority (72%) of participants reported it would be helpful to learn more about adolescent health issues. Of parents who reported educational needs, the proportions who reported it would be 'very helpful' to learn about teens and the following topics were: driving safety (80%); preventing pregnancy (79%); STDS (78%); marijuana and other drugs (76%); communication (75%); alcohol (74%); depression (73%); healthy weight (69%); healthy sleep (68%); tobacco (67%); and immunizations (66%). Fifty-four percent of participants reported that it would be 'very helpful' to learn about 6 or more topics, and were coded as “high-need parents.” Black non-Hispanic parents were more likely to report high need than white non-Hispanic parents (66% vs. 46%, p < .01); parents with lower levels of education (HS or less) were more likely to report high need than parents with education beyond HS (66% vs. 49%, p < .01); parents with incomes < 100% FPL were more likely to report high need than those with incom-es > 400% FPL (64% vs. 42%, p < .01). Adolescent age and parent gender were not associated with parents' report of high need. Multivariate analyses revealed that parent race was independently associated with report of high need, above and beyond education and income. Parent behavior/risk factors were not associated with reported educational need about specific adolescent health topics with one exception: parents at lower risk of motor vehicle injury were more likely to report that it would be very helpful to learn about teens and driving safety when compared to parents at higher risk of motor vehicle injury (81% vs. 69%, p = .04). Conclusions: Most parents of adolescents 11-17 years of age perceive that it would be very helpful to learn more about adoles-cent health topics. Future research is needed to better understand parents' preferred content and mode of delivery, impact of parent education on adolescent behaviors, and variation based on culture, race, and ethnicity.

N2  - Background: Rates of premature birth are around 10% in Australasia and numbers are increasing annually. With improvements in neonatal intensive care techniques the percentage of preterm infants surviving has increased dramatically and complications of prematurity are thus becoming increasingly common. It has been reported that adults who were born preterm have an increased risk of hypertension and in addition preterm infants are also at increased risk for the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Results: Studies by our group have now identified that preterm birth imparts a lasting effect on blood pressure (BP) and its control, which persists for up to 6 months after term equivalent age. We identified that infants born at 28-32 weeks of gestation had significantly lower BP than age matched term infants during sleep, the predominant behavioural state of infancy, with the most marked effects being at 2-3 months post term corrected age, the age which coincides with the peak incidence of SIDS. Preterm infants also had an impaired ability to control BP when tested with head up tilts. Conclusions: It has been hypothesised that SIDS results from an inability to compensate for a profound hypotension combined with an impairment of life preserving arousal responses. We have previously demonstrated that preterm infants have an impaired ability to arouse from sleep in response to a variety of challenges. Thus, the low BP and reduced BP control in combination with reduced arousability may explain the increased risk for SIDS in preterm infants. Our findings of impaired BP control may also have implications for long term cardiovascular health.

N2  - Background: The use of digital thermometers to record rectal or axillary temperatures is standard practice in newborn care. These measurements can disturb babies” sleep and developmental care routine and are potentially invasive. The “No Touch” thermometer measures infra red heat produced by the temporal artery when scanned 1-2 cm above the temporal region. It is, therefore, much less invasive and does not require direct contact with the infant. We undertook this audit to compare the temperature measured by the “No Touch” thermometer with our “standard” measurement of axillary temperature using digital thermometers. Method: Newborns nursed in open cots were eligible to take part in this comparison audit. In each baby, three “No Touch” temperature measurements were recorded followed by an axillary (“routine care”) temperature measurement. Data was collated and compared using Wilcoxon matchedpairs signed-ranks test. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics committee. Results: A total of 20 babies with an average gestation 35.5, and average weight 2775 g, were recruited. The actual difference between the mean axillary and “No Touch” measurements was -0.54. This difference was highly significant with a two-tailed P-value of <0.0001. Conclusions: Monitoring temperature of newborn babies nursed in an open cot with a “No Touch” thermometer appears to be less accurate than axillary measurements.

Results: A total of 38 preterm infants (mean gestation 30.0 weeks, mean weight 1498g) participated. The difference between mean axillary and “No Touch” measurements was only -015 which, whilst statistically significant. (P = 0.0016), is unlikely to be important clinically. Conclusions: Temperatures measured with a “No Touch” thermometer differed by only a small amount from axillary temperature recorded with digital thermometers in preterm babies nursed in incubators. Larger studies are warranted.

N2  - Objective: To explore the effects of preterm infants massage, as an environmental enrichment model, on the maturation of electroencephalographic activity with a quantitative EEG approach. Design: Case control study. Methods: The study involved 20 preterm infants (10 study group and 10 controls) born between 30 and 33 weeks gestation and without brain abnormalities. Massage was started at around 10 days post-birth and lasted for 10 days. The protocol consisted of three daily massage sessions of 15 minutes each. EEG was performed at 1 week (before massage) and repeated at 4 weeks (after massage). Spectral EEG analysis was performed on 80 seconds of active sleep applying the Fast Fourier transformation on the signal obtained from eight monopolar derivations. The spectrum was divided into the main four frequency bands: delta (0.54Hz), theta (4.5-7.5Hz), alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13.530Hz). The same EEG protocol was applied to a matched control group not receiving massage. Statistical Analysis: SPSS v14.0 with P-values 2-tailed, P<0.05. Within-group differences were analysed by means of the paired-sample t-test, corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction). Between-group differences were analyzed with a 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures with time (pre- vs. post-massage) and subject group (massaged vs. controls) as factors. Levine's test was used to assess equality of variances. Results: The modification in global EEG spectral power between the two assessments was significantly different for the two groups, especially for the delta band activity. The interaction between time and subject group was significant for the global spectral power in the delta band (F(1,15)=4.7, P<0.05) and for the local spectral power from the central leads in the delta band (F(1,15)=16.1, P<0.000) and in the beta band (F(1,15)=4.8, P<0.05). This was due to the significant decrease of EEG spectral power in non-massaged infants relative to massaged infants between T1 and T2. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the relative increase of EEG spectral power observed in the group of massaged infants is the effect of the post-natal enrichment represented by infant massage, which might be mediated by an action on synaptic plasticity, similar to that observed in the animal model.1-3 Our findings suggest that infant massage in preterm infants favours a process of maturation of brain electrical activity similar to that observed (in utero) in full-term infants. Our speculation is that this could be due to an attenuation of the discrepancies between the extrauterine and the intrauterine environment.

N2  - Studies have shown that asthma in children is caused by environmental and genetic factors. In adult asthma, risk factors were less well recognized. Likewise, in Thailand, data in adult asthma is limited. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors, determine skin reactivities to allergens, and assess concomitant allergy among adult asthma in Phitsanulok, a major city in the lower northern Thailand. Five hundred and thirteen Naresuan University staff members and students completed 2 sets of questionnaires and underwent allergy skin prick tests. The first set of questionnaires was standardized Thai version of ISAAC questionnaire for identifying asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema. The second set was modified from ISAAC phase II questionnaire to identify asthma risk factors. Fif-ty-eight subjects (11.6%) were identified as having physician's diagnosed asthma and 89 subjects (17.7%) wheezed in the past 12 months. Among 89 subjects, 14.4% wheezed more than once a month, 45.6% had wheez-es interfering with sleep. Concomitant allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema among these asthma subjects were 82.5%, 67.9%, and 14.9%, respectively. Eighty seven point nine percent of asthmatic subjects had positive skin reactivities to at least one allergen. Two of the most common allergens were house dust mites and cockroaches. Maternal smoking during pregnancy, smoking among family members, and family history of allergy were statistically significant risks for developing asthma, while having a rice field around the residence represented a significant protective factor. In conclusion, high prevalence of asthma presented in Phitsanulok and many asth-matic subjects were partly controlled or uncontrolled. The environment such as a rice field could protect against asthma, however atopy and smoking exposure were significant risks for asthma development.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 11 per cent of pre-menopausal women though it often remains undetected. Women may present differently than men, and the classic findings of snoring, witnessed apnoeas and sleepiness may not be observed. Factors which predispose to OSA include polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, retromicrognathia, and hypothyroidism. OSA may contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Emerging evidence indicates that snoring and OSA increase during pregnancy. For normal women with normotensive, low-risk pregnancies the prevalence of OSA is very low. Among normotensive pregnant women with high risk pregnancies, the prevalence of OSA is high and is even higher among those with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia during pregnancy. Incident snoring, which is a marker for OSA, is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational hypertension. Recent studies indicate that OSA per se is an independent risk factor for gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and may contribute to other poor obstetrical outcomes. The diagnostic test of choice for OSA is a polysomnography with electroencephalogram. Milder degree of disease than what is usually considered clinically significant among men or non-pregnant women appears to be relevant for foetomaternal outcomes. There seems to be benefit for blood pressure control to treating even milder degrees of OSA with CPAP, both acutely and over the 9 months of pregnancy. Chronic hypertensive women should be strongly considered for diagnosis and treatment of OSA prior to or beginning as early as possible in pregnancy to help maintain blood pressure control. Increasing awareness of OSA among maternal health care providers is important given the potential benefits for pregnancy and other health-related outcomes associated with identification and treatment of OSA.

N2  - To determine the prevalence of snoring in Thai, pregnant women. This study was carried out from April 2008 through August 2008 at the antenatal clinic, HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center Nakorn Nayok province. Two hundred and thirty-eight pregnant women were enrolled. All subjects answered the Berlin questionnaire; this include information on age, weight, height, gravid health status, gestational age, witnessed incidences of snoring, and symptoms associated with sleep apnea. The description of snoring as frequency, volume, complaints from other people and bouts of sleep apnea were recorded and analyzed. The prevalence of snoring in pregnancy was 35.29%. The snoring volume, recorded as slightly louder than breathing, in this group was 91.67%. One-fourth of the cases presented with snoring approximately 3-4 times a week with complaints of snoring bothering other people. The incidence of sleep apnea was found in 5.95% of this group. The prevalence of snoring was found in approximately one-third of the pregnant women screened.

N2  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Premature rupture of membranes is a normal occurrence of labor and can occur before or after the onset of contractions. The clinical factors associated with premature rupture of membranes include: low socioeconomic status, low body mass index, prior preterm pregnancies, smoking, sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract, conization, cervical cerclage and amniocentesis. Objective: To evaluate whether prolonged release of the vaginal insert of PGE2 is superior to dinoprostone gel to achieve cervical ripening in patients with term pregnancy that occur with premature rupture of membranes. Material and method: Randomized clinical trial in the surgical unit of play in a period of 6 months, with an estimated sample of 50 patients was randomized by block table. After assessment confirming rupture of membranes, Bishop Score and meeting inclusion criteria, group A was applied PGE2 intracervical gel 0.5 mg with a maximum of 3 doses, every 6 hours. Group B was administered at vaginal insert of PGE2 single dose for 24 hours, the patient was left to sleep 30 minutes cardio toco-monitoring chart for at least 2 hours after application. Results: The average time to maturity was 310.59 minutes with a standard deviation of 198.7 and concluded that there was no significant difference between the onset of uterine activity and the onset of labor among the prolonged release dinoprostone and alternatives such as the gel cervical for cervical ripening. Conclusions: Either this is a good choice to ripen the cervix in patients with term pregnancy and premature rupture of membranes.

N2  - Background: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related disorder characterised by an irresistible urge to move the lower limbs associated with unpleasant sensations. Symptoms present while at rest, generally in the evening, and are relieved, at least partially and temporarily, by movement. RLS affects 5-10% of the general population, frequently resulting in chronic sleep deprivation. Drugs targeting the dopamine pathway have shown therapeutic benefit. RLS may develop secondary to conditions such as renal failure, iron deficiency and pregnancy. More commonly, RLS is a familial disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. RLS loci have been identified in six distinct genomic regions by linkage analysis. Association mapping has highlighted a further four areas of interest. To date, no causative gene has been identified. Design: We recruited a three generation Irish family with autosomal dominant RLS. Eighteen members participated in this study of whom 11 are affected. Institutional ethical approval was obtained and all participants gave written informed consent. Symptom questionnaires were completed and neurological examinations were undertaken. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood samples. Polymorphic microsatellite markers were amplified by PCR and samples were genotyped using the ABI3130 genetic analyser. LOD scores were generated using FASTLINK software. Results: Linkage was excluded from all known RLS loci. A genome-wide scan identified a region of linkage with a maximum LOD score of 3.59, at a theta value of 0. Recombination events, identified by haplotype analysis, define a genetic region which corresponds to 2.5 Mb. This disease gene containing region has approximately 100 known genes. A number of candidate genes have been identified based on potential involvement in RLS pathogenesis and are the subject of further study. Conclusions: We have successfully identified a novel locus for autosomal dominant Restless Legs Syndrome. Completion of this stage of the study enables us to attempt to identify the causative gene in this family and, thus, to further the understanding of RLS pathogenesis.

N2  - Our aim was to examine the characteristics of EEG findings and epilepsy in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and the associated clinical and familial risk factors. Fifty-seven children (86% male) with ASD, mean age 82 ± 36.2 months, were included in the study. Thirty-nine (68.4%) children had the diagnosis of autism, 15 (26.3%) had Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and 3 (5.3%) had high-functioning autism. One hour of sleep and/or awake EEG recordings was obtained for each child. All patients were evaluated with respect to clinical and familial characteristics and with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The frequency of interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities (IIEAs) was 24.6% (n = 14), and the frequency of epilepsy was 14.2% (n = 8). IIEAs were associated with a diagnosis of epilepsy (P = 0.0001), Childhood Autism Rating Scale Activity scores (P = 0.047), and a history of asthma and allergy (P = 0.044). Epilepsy was associated with a family history of epilepsy (P = 0.049) and psychiatric problems in the mother during pregnancy (P = 0.0026). Future studies with larger samples will help to clarify the possible associations of epilepsy/IIEAs with asthma/allergy, hyperactivity, and familial factors in ASD. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To assess features of sleep among pregnant women. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of low-risk pregnant women in a tertiary perinatal centre (CHUS) in Eastern Townships, Quebec. Sleep was assessed during the second trimester (mean gestational age 16.1 ± 3.0 weeks) (T2) and third trimester (mean gestational age 27.5 ± 1.8 weeks) (T3) using a validated self-administered questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Scores in this index range from 0 to 21, representing the cumulative scoring of seven sleep components. Subjects with a score > 5 were identified as "poor sleepers." Descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses were performed. Results: Among 260 consenting women, 192 (73.6%) had a term delivery without any adverse outcome. There were no differences in sleep parameters between pregnancies with adverse outcome and without adverse outcome. Mean overall PSQI scores showed evidence of deterioration in sleep quality from T2 (5.26 ± 3.16) to T3 (6.73 ± 4.02; P < 0.01). This deterioration was displayed in five of seven sleep components (P < 0.01). Scores in the "poor sleeper" range were recorded by 36% of women in T2 and 56%, of women in T3 (P < 0.01). "Poor sleep" in T2 and T3 was associated with low or high weight gain (P < 0.01), annual family income < $40 000 (P = 0.03), and single motherhood (P < 0.01). There was a trend for a seasonal influence on sleep scores (P = 0.08). The only predictor of poor sleep using multivariate analysis was single motherhood (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Sleep is disturbed in early pregnancy and is worse in the third trimester. Interventions to improve sleep should be sought to optimize quality of life for pregnant women.

N2  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of sleep disorders during pregnancy. To identify in which moment of gestation they occur and the different factors related to their appearance. People and method: Transverse prospective observational study, performed in the Hospital Virgen de la Luz of Cuenca from December 2006 to May 2008. A specific questionnaire was designed for the data collection of the above study. All the full term expectant mothers who attended the fetal pathophysiology consultation of the hospital during the months of April to July 2007 were included. Results: A total of 290 pregnant mothers have been studied, an 86.6% of the surveyed women referred changes in their sleeping patterns since they were pregnant. The sleeping disorder that showed most prevalence was the insomnia symptomatology: sleep wakefulness, nocturnal awakening and non-refreshing sleep. The symptomatology of the restless legs syndrome was the second most frequent: affecting 67%, followed by snoring which affected 50.7%, excessive diurnal somnolence to the 39% and sleeping apnea to 5.9%. These disorders appeared throughout the whole gestation period, being the third quarter the one of most prevalence. Relation among several sleep disorders and non-modifiable variables such as age and multiparity was observed; and others modifiable like sedentary lifestyle and overweight, as well as other disorders and habits related to sleep. Conclusions: Sleep disorders are very common in mothers to be. However, either women or doctors who treat them do not consider them as actual health problems.

N2  - Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and safe treatments to improve sleep are needed. Generally, physical activity improves sleep, but studies are lacking on the associations of physical activity with sleep among pregnant women. Our aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association of various modes of physical activity and activity clusters with sleep quality and duration among 1259 pregnant women. Participants were recruited into the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study from prenatal clinics at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. Women self-reported sleep quality and duration and physical activity in the past week. We used cluster analysis to create seven physical activity profiles and multivariable logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, parity, self-rated general health, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Women with higher levels of occupational physical activity were more likely to report either short or normal sleep duration than longer duration. Women with higher levels of indoor household physical activity were less likely to report normal sleep duration than shorter duration. Women in the recreational-indoor household activity cluster were less likely than women in the inactivity cluster to report normal sleep duration as compared with longer duration. Our data suggest weak associations of physical activity with sleep duration and quality in late pregnancy. Physical activity is recommended to pregnant women for health benefits, yet more research is needed to understand if physical activity should be recommended for improving sleep. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances during pregnancy among healthy nulliparous women. Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study of healthy nulliparous women, recruited between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation, who completed a baseline sleep survey at enrollment with follow-up in the third trimester. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Disordered Breathing, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, National Institutes of Health/International Restless Legs Syndrome Question Set, Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Differences in sleep characteristics between the baseline and third trimester were compared using the paired t test or McNemar test for continuous or categorical data, respectively. Results: One hundred eighty-nine women completed both baseline and follow-up sleep surveys. The mean gestational age was 13.8 (±3.8) and 30.0 (±2.2) weeks at the first and second surveys, respectively. Compared with the baseline assessment, mean sleep duration was significantly shorter (7.4 [±1.2] hours compared with 7.0 [±1.3] hours, P<.001), and the proportion of patients who reported frequent snoring (at least three nights per week) was significantly greater (11% compared with 16.4%, P=.03) in the third trimester. The percentage of patients who met diagnostic criteria for restless leg syndrome increased from 17.5% at recruitment to 31.2% in the third trimester (P=.001). Overall poor sleep quality, as defined by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score greater than 5, became significantly more common as pregnancy progressed (39.0% compared with 53.5%, P=.001). CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are prevalent among healthy nulliparous women and increase significantly during pregnancy. © 2009 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Objective: To review the evidence and provide recommendations for the counselling and management of obese parturients. Outcomes: Outcomes evaluated include the impact of maternal obesity on the provision of antenatal and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Evidence: Literature was retrieved through searches of Statistics Canada, Medline, and The Cochrane Library on the impact of obesity in pregnancy on antepartum and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, obstetrical anaesthesia, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to April 2009. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. Values: The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Practice Obstetric Committees of the SOGC under the leadership of the principal authors, and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Benefits, Harms, and Costs: Implementation of the recommendations in this guideline should increase recognition of the issues clinicians need to be aware of when managing obese women in pregnancy, improve communication and consultation amongst the obstetrical care team, and encourage federal and provincial agencies to educate Canadians about the values of entering pregnancy with as healthy a weight as possible. Recommendations: 1. Periodic health examinations and other appointments for gynaecologic care prior to pregnancy offer ideal opportunities to raise the issue of weight loss before conception. Women should be encouraged to enter pregnancy with a BMI < 30 kg/m2, and ideally < 25 kg/m2. (III-B)2. BMI should be calculated from pre-pregnancy height and weight. Those with a pre-pregnancy BMI > 30 kg/m2 are considered obese. This information can be helpful in counselling women about pregnancy risks associated with obesity. (II-2B)3. Obese pregnant women should receive counselling about weight gain, nutrition, and food choices. (II-2B). 4. Obese women should be advised that they are at risk for medical complications such as cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Regular exercise during pregnancy may help to reduce some of these risks. (II-2B). 5. Obese women should be advised that their fetus is at an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, and appropriate screening should be done. (II-2B). 6. Obstetric care providers should take BMI into consideration when arranging for fetal anatomic assessment in the second trimester. Anatomic assessment at 20 to 22 weeks may be a better choice for the obese pregnant patient. (II-2B). 7. Obese pregnant women have an increased risk of Caesarean section, and the success of vaginal birth after Caesarean section is decreased. (II-2B). 8. Antenatal consultation with an anaesthesiologist should be considered to review analgesic options and to ensure a plan is in place should a regional anaesthetic be chosen. (III-B). 9. The risk of venous thromboembolism for each obese woman should be evaluated. In some clinical situations, consideration for thromboprophylaxis should be individualized. (III-B).

N2  - A 6 month pregnant, 28 year-old patient comes to the sleep specialist consultation for an excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring and possible sleep apneas. She is overweight and has a history of pregnancy with preeclampsia, at the origin of a caesarean. Polysomnography finds an apnea/hypopnea index at 35 per hour, with a micro-arousal index at 40 per hour. Thus, continuous positive pressure (CPAP) therapy starts, the symptoms regress and the pregnancy ends without complication. Far from the birth, the control polysomnography without CPAP finds an apnea/hypopnea index at 18 per hour, with upper résistance airway syndrome. So, a treatment by mandibular advancement device is decided. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective To determine the functional development of children born after treatment of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension with labetalol versus methyldopa, and no antihypertensive treatment. Design Historical cohort study. Setting Twelve Dutch hospital departments of obstetrics. Population Live-born children born in these hospitals and prenatally exposed to labetalol, methyldopa, or bed rest because of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension. Methods Central nervous system development was measured with standard tests at 4-10 years of age. Linear regression techniques and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to compare the groups with regard to the outcome measures. Main outcome measures Intelligence quotient (IQ), concentration, motor development, and behaviour at primary school age. Results A total of 202 children were included in the analyses. More children exposed to labetalol had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than those exposed to methyldopa (OR 2.3; 95% CI 0.7-7.3), or those born to women who had been admitted for bed rest (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.2-13.9). Sleeping problems seemed to be reported more frequently after prenatal methyldopa exposure than after exposure to labetalol (OR 3.2; 95% CI 0.6-16.7) or bed rest (OR 4.5; 95% CI 0.9-23.2), although the differences were not statistically significant. Test scores on other aspects of functional development did not differ between the three groups. Conclusions In this hypothesis-generating study, labetalol exposure in utero seemed to increase the risk of ADHD among children of primary school age, whereas prenatal methyldopa exposure might influence sleep. Further studies with appropriate sample sizes are warranted to determine the long-term effects of antihypertensive medications. © RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - We examined background information and course of labour from a cohort of 2,810 low-risk nulliparas to identify possible lifestyle and anthropometrical risk indicators for dystocia. Criteria for dystocia: cervical dilatation <2cm over 4h during labour's active phase, or no descent during 2h (3h with epidural) in the descending phase, or no progress for 1h during the expulsive phase. After adjustments, athletics or heavy gardening ≥4h per week appeared protective for dystocia (OR 0.63, CI 0.45-0.89), contrary to a non-significant finding of intensive physical training (OR 1.57, CI 0.84-2.93). Caffeine intake of 200-299mg/day was associated with dystocia (OR 1.37, CI 1.04-1.80); also high maternal age (OR 2.25, CI 1.58-3.22), small stature (OR 2.18, CI 1.51-3.15) and pre-pregnancy overweight (OR 1.28, CI 1.02-1.61). No association was found between dystocia and alcohol intake, smoking, night sleep and options for resting during the day.

N2  - A suite of changes in circadian rhythms have been described in nocturnal rodents as females go through pregnancy and lactation, but there is no information on such patterns in diurnal species. As the challenges faced by these two groups of animals are somewhat different, we characterized changes in activity and core body temperature (Tb) in female diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as they went through a series of reproductive states: virgin, pregnant, pregnant and lactating, lactating only, and post-weaning. The phase of neither rhythm varied, but the amplitude did. Females increased their overall levels of daily activity from early to late pregnancy, regardless of whether they were also lactating. The pattern of activity was less rhythmic during early than mid-lactation, in both non-pregnant and pregnant females, as a consequence of a decrease in daytime relative to nighttime activity. The Tb rhythm amplitude dropped from mid-pregnancy through mid-lactation, and there were rises in Tb troughs during the mid-light and mid-dark phases of the day, though pregnancy and lactation affected Tb at these times in somewhat different ways. This study demonstrates that rhythms in diurnal grass rats change during pregnancy and lactation in different ways than those of nocturnal species that have been studied to date and that the effects of pregnancy and lactation are not additive in any simple way. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - It is widely known that during pregnancy, two-thirds of women consider their sleep patterns to be abnormal. These sleep alterations, which begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, appear to be influenced by the pronounced alterations in the levels of reproductive hormones that occur during the gestational period. In society at large, there is increasing discussion of the risks related to sleep loss. Considering social events, traffic and the increasing entry of women into the workforce, both quality and duration of sleep are compromised, and this may in turn have a significant effect during pregnancy. As pregnancies are often not detected before the end of the first month of gestation, the new mother's inability to take precautions (including adequate sleep) in the initial stages of pregnancy may have several consequences for the offspring. This study was undertaken to determine whether preimplantation sleep deprivation of pregnant mice alters hormonal profiles and homocysteine metabolism. One group of dams was continuously sleep deprived using the platform technique from gestational day 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three other groups were sleep deprived by gentle handling for a duration of six hours on gestational day 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). Finally, to obtain a pregnancy time-matched control, a number of dams were allowed to sleep normally during pregnancy. After sleep deprivation, blood samples were collected fromthe experimental animals and the respective time-matched controls, and the concentrations of homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone were measured. The concentration of plasma progesterone was decreased in the PSD 72 group, and plasma estradiol was increased in the GH 2 group. Corticosterone levels were increased after all sleep deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 group and decreased in the PSD 72 group. In addition, we found a decrease in pregnancymaintenance in all experimental groups. Sleep deprivation during pregnancy changes plasma homocysteine concentrations differently according to the timing and method of sleep deprivation. Also, all experimental groups showed a decrease in pregnancy maintenance after preimplantation sleep deprivation of pregnantmice, indicating the importance of sleep in this period of life.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known regarding the impact of poor sleep on pregnancy outcomes. In the non-pregnant population short sleep duration has been associated with an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between short sleep duration and glucose metabolism during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, cohort study of healthy nullip-arous women recruited between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation (early pregnancy). Participants completed a sleep survey at the time of enrollment and in the third trimester (late pregnancy). Short sleep duration (SSD) was defined as an average sleep duration of < 7 hours/ night. Subjects were followed prospectively and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical record by study personnel blinded to the sleep survey results. Pregnancy outcomes of women with SSD were compared to outcomes of women without SSD using both uni-variable and multivariable statistical techniques. RESULTS: Of the 189 women who completed both surveys, 183 (97%) provided sleep duration data. The mean gestational age was 13.9 ± 3.8 weeks and30.0 ± 2.2 atthe first and second survey respectively. Forty-eight percent of women (88/183) reported SSD in early and/or late pregnancy. Women reporting a SSD had on average higher glucose values on their 1-hour OGTT(115.6 ± 31.2 vs. 104.6 ± 23.0, p = .008), and were more likely to have 1-hour OGTT values 130 (32.1% vs. 15.2%, p = .008). Also, these women were more likely to meet criteria for gestational diabetes (10.2% vs. 1.1%; OR 10.6, 95% CI 1.3, 85.5). Even after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy BMI, SSD continued to be significantly associated with 1-hour GTT values 130 (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1,5.2) and the development of gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 9.1, 95% CI 1.1, 80.5). CONCLUSION: Short sleep duration during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.

N2  - Objective: To explore women's levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample. Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy. © 2009 AWHONN.

N2  - Objective: Clinical and experimental studies have shown that insufficient sleep results in a variety of adverse physiologic effects, including hypertension, impairment of glucose control, development of type 2 diabetesmellitus, obesity and damage of the immune system. Considering that the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in the young offspring. Methods: Female 3-month-oldWistar rats were kept overnight with a male, and vaginal smears were taken the following morning. A positive smear was considered as day 0 of gestation. The pregnant rats were divided in two groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction). Between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy, SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platformtechnique for 20 hours daily. At 3 months old, male offspring of both groups were evaluated for blood pressure and renal function (glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow) and morphology (glomerular area and n°; of glomeruli by mm3). Results: Offspring from SR (OSR), had higher systolic blood pressure than offspring from C (OC). OSR also had increased renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rates, filtration fractions and urine flow when compared to OC. The morphologic parameters indicated that OSR had fewer glomeruli by mm3 and enlarged glomeruli. Conclusions: Our results suggest that OSR presented glomerular hemodynamic alterations, since we found significant increases of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rates and filtration fractions. Parallel to the functional alterations, decreased nephron number and glomerular hypertrophy reflect definitive renal changes. It is possible that the increase in BP may be transmitted to the renal circulation causing morphofunctional changes. Thus, sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in a nephron deficit, the development of hypertension and morphologic as well as functional alterations in the rat offspring.

Study Design: This study involved a cross-sectional, non-randomized screen and comparison between groups. Patients: The study population included 103 preeclamptic pregnant women, 106 healthy pregnant women and 102 non-pregnant women. All participants were age and parity-matched. Methods: Sleep disturbances were evaluated using the Global Sleep Assessment inventory and a DSM-IV-TR based, non-structured psychiatric interview. Information from the medical chart of each participant was used to determine the blood pressure of each woman as well as any pregnancy complications that occurred. Results: When compared to the other two groups, the preeclamptic women reported more frequent snoring (p=0.00), increased difficulty falling asleep (p=0.034), increased difficulty remaining asleep (p=0.022) and more problems with drug- and anxiety-related insomnia (p=0.45). Conclusions: The frequent sleep disturbances that are seen in preeclamptic women may be related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease.

N2  - Couples are waiting longer to have children, and advances in reproductive technology are allowing older men and women to consider having children. The lack of appreciation among both medical professionals and the lay public for the reality of a male biological clock makes these trends worrisome. The age-related changes associated with the male biological clock affect sperm quality, fertility, hormone levels, libido, erectile function, and a host of non-reproductive physiological issues. This article focuses on the potentially adverse effects of the male biological clock on fertility in older men. Advanced paternal age increases the risk for spontaneous abortion as well as genetic abnormalities in offspring due to multiple factors, including DNA damage from abnormal apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. Increased paternal age is also associated with a decrease in semen volume, percentage of normal sperm, and sperm motility. Older men considering parenthood should have a thorough history and physical examination focused on their sexual and reproductive capacity. Such examination should entail disclosure of any sexual dysfunction and the use of medications, drugs, or lifestyle factors that might impair fertility or sexual response. Older men should also be counseled regarding the effects of paternal age on spermatogenesis and pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances in preeclamptic and nonpreeclamptic women and compare them. Study design: Crosssectional, nonrandomized screening and comparison between groups. Patients: 103 preeclamptic pregnant women, 106 healthy pregnant women and 102 nonpregnant women (age and parity-matched). Methods: A survey evaluating sleep disturbances using Global Sleep Assessment inventory was conducted, as well as a DSM-IV-TR based nonstructured psychiatric interview. Pregnancy complications and blood pressuremeasurements were obtained from each woman's medical chart and recorded. Results: Compared to the other two groups, preeclamptic women had a higher frequency of snoring (p=0.00), difficulties in falling (p=0.034) and staying asleep (p=0.022), and drugs and anxiety related insomnia (p=0.45). Conclusions: Frequent sleep disturbances in preeclamptic women may be related to this pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the physical characteristics and symptoms associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in an obese pregnant population. STUDY DESIGN: Obese women (BMI >30 kg/m2) were enrolled into a prospective observational study. Validated standardized questionnaires were completed to evaluate OSA related symptoms: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Berlin Sleep Questionnaire, Fatigue Score and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). These subjects underwent overnight obstructive sleep apnea testing (OSA) using a portable home monitor (ARES) and body composition using air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod). An apnea hypopnea index of ≥5 with excessive daytime sleepiness was considered diagnostic of OSA. Medical charts were reviewed documenting the presence of comorbid conditions. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. RESULTS: 8/42 subjects (19%) met criteria for OSA. Obese women with (OSA) and without OSA (no-OSA) were similar in age (36 vs. 32 years, p=0.2). They had similar neck circumference (41 vs. 37cm, p=0.8) and waist to hip ratio (0.95 vs. 0.93, p=0.95) and body composition (47 vs. 44% body fat, p=0.19). OSA also had similar rates of chronic hypertension (39.4 vs. 28.6%, p=0.69) and diabetes (39.4 vs. 42.9, p>0.9) compared to NO-OSA. However, the OSA were more likely to have metabolic syndrome (57.1 vs. 15.2%, p=0.03). The presence of metabolic syndrome had a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 85% for OSA. An ESS score of > 10 provided 83% sensitivity and 67% specificity for identifying women with OSA. The Berlin Sleep Questionnaire was poorly predictive with 95% of women screening positive but only10% specificity. Among the entire cohort, 35% had an abnormal score on the FSS, indicating significant fatigue and 47% had poor sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Among obese pregnant women symptoms of abnormal sleep are prevalent but not very predictive of the presence of OSA. Women with the metabolic syndrome may represent a subset of women who are at particularly high risk for OSA.

N2  - Introduction: Growing interest has been driven by the discovery of a tight relationship between prenatal manipulations and development of short- and long-term health disorders. It is widely known that during pregnancy, twothirds ofwomen consider their sleep to be abnormal. Moreover, several studies have shown that prenatal stress leads to weight alterations in offspring during development. Objectives: This study was undertaken to determine whether prenatal exposure to sleep deprivation alters weight and organs relative weight of offspring. Methods: One group of dams was continuously sleep deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 1 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep deprived by gentle handling for six hours on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). Finally, to obtain a control group, a number of dams were allowed to sleep during the pregnancy. After birth, the offspringwereweighed at Day 3 of life without gender separation. Within thirty days, the animals were classified as male and female. After, the offspring did not and after they did not suffer any other intervention during development until the third month of age when they were weighed and sacrificed for tissue collection (heart, fat, muscle and liver). Results: We observed an alteration in birth weight for pups whose mothers were sleep deprived by gentle handling compared with the control group. In groups GH 1 (2.79±0.31 g) and GH 3 (3.57±0.24 g), we observed a decrease in weight while group GH 2 (2.1±0.5 g) displayed an increase compared to the controls (2.51±0.28 g). However, by 3 months of age these differences disappeared.When gender was considered in the analysis we observed that adult females from the control group presented lower muscle relative mass (0.50% of total body weight) than male controls (0.64%). Conclusion: This data indicate that sleep deprivation of mothers in the beginning of pregnancy lead to birth biometric alterations in the offspring. Moreover, this difference was not maintained when animals reached adult life.

N2  - Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT1 and MT2 receptors, especially those in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which acts on the hypothalamic sleep switch. Therefore, they differ fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists primarily favor sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent sleep, as required in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A major obstacle for the use of melatonin to support sleep maintenance in primary insomnia results from its short half-life in the circulation. Solutions to this problem have been sought by developing prolonged-release formulations of the natural hormone, or melatoninergic drugs of longer half-life, such as ramelteon, tasimelteon and agomelatine. With all these drugs, improvements of sleep are statistically demonstrable, but remain limited, especially in primary chronic insomnia, so that GABAergic drugs may be indicated. Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence. They do not induce behavioral changes, as sometimes observed with z-drugs. Despite otherwise good tolerability, the use of melatoninergic drugs in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy has been a matter of concern, and should be avoided in autoimmune diseases and Parkinsonism. Problems and limits of melatoninergic hypnotics are compared. © 2009 Hardeland, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

N2  - Objective: The study aimed to assess possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and sleep disturbances in 2-month-old infants. Subjects and methods: The study comprised 200 apparently healthy infants from community settings selected by chance (88 boys, 112 girls), aged 2 months, who were singletons born in St. Petersburg in 2007. The mothers were asked to complete the questionnaires addressing major infant, maternal and demographic characteristics with particular emphasis on maternal smoking during pregnancy. As a part of the interview, the mothers were requested to describe possible sleep disturbances in their infants, divided into five major sleep domains: bedtime problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, awakenings, regularity and duration of sleep as well as snoring. Results: Of 200 mothers, 63 (31.5%) smoked during pregnancy. The babies born to smoking mothers more commonly were reported as having bedtime problems [odds ratio (OR)=2.75; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-6.58], and this association remained significant after adjustment was made for major potential confounders. Maternal smoking after delivery did not significantly add to the risk. Babies born to smoking mothers more often had irregular sleep, but this association was markedly influenced by the confounding effect of maternal education. No statistically significant differences were found for total night time sleep duration, the frequency of night time awakenings, excessive night time waking and daytime sleepiness as well as for snoring and noisy breathing during sleep. Conclusion: Maternal smoking during pregnancy should be considered as a risk factor for infant bedtime problems, emerging as early as 2 months of age. © 2009 Springer.

N2  - Objectives Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy(J.M.E.) needs life-long anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment. Of various drugs tried in this condition, valproate effectively treats all types of seizures seen in J.M.E. Among valproate side effects, neural tube defects (NTD) in the offspring, is a deterring factor in its use in childbearing period. To avoid NTD, most authorities advise on switching to AED drug before conception.As well, the effects of valproate on male fertility is feared of. Clonazepam controls only the myoclonic jerks, leaving the patients unprotected and susceptible to generalized seizures, which mostly occur in the morning after sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is the most prevalent precipitating factor for generalized seizures in these patients. Materials &Methods Between Jan 2003 & April 2008, 15 newly diagnosed JME patients (9 girls, 6 boys), were given clonazepam (1.0-4.0 mg) at bedtime, and were compared to 16 patients on valproate treatment. All were advised to avoid sleep deprivation. Results This study showed, all patients in the clonazepam group, (100 %) had full control of their myoclonic jerks; 4(26.6%) had breakthrough episodes of generalized seizures, provoked by sleep deprivation; the rest (11,73.4 %), were in full remission of their myoclonic and generalized seizures. In control group, 2(12.5 %), had episodes of breakthrough, sleep-deprived, generalized seizures;the rest(14, 87.5%) were in remission. Statistically, there was no significance between the results in both groups. Clonazepam side effects were limited to mild to moderate drowsiness in the morning, eliminated by giving the dose earlier at night. Conclusion The study suggests that if J.M.E. patients avoid sleep deprivation, they can be treated with clonazepam alone to avoid side effects of valproate.

N2  - Background: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or behavioural state. Aims: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep. Study design: Case-control. Cases had a gestational age of ≥ 42 weeks; controls were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile. Subjects: STAN® registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was selected during active and one during quiet sleep. Outcome measures: Absolute and normalized low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4-1.5 Hz) of heart rate variability. Results: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively, P = 0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P = 0.50) or absolute (41 and 21 respectively, P = 0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07 respectively, P = 0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively, P = 0.03) and absolute (16 and 10 respectively, P = 0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and 0.14 respectively, P = 0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both groups (all P values < 0.05). Conclusions: We found sympathetic predominance during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation during rest was increased compared to near term. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - This article will suggest that moderate sleep apnea may have an adaptive benefit, the reduction of nocturnal, respiratory heat loss, that may have caused it to be selected for despite the associated disadvantages. Sleep apnea is caused by the collapse of the throat, specifically the pharyngeal airway, during sleep and can result in discomfort and hypoxia. The large size of the fleshy structures in the pharynx and hypotonicity of the pharyngeal musculature are what cause humans, and many other species of mammals, to be susceptible to apnea. There are many functional and anatomical parallels between sleep apnea and a well known, thermoregulatory response that minimizes respiratory cooling in the lower airways known as reflex bronchoconstriction. Bronchoconstriction involves the constriction of the inner airways, the bronchioles, in response to cold air, a reaction that acts to warm inspired air before it makes contact with the more sensitive lower airways and alveoli. Because air is colder at night and body temperature drops severely during sleep, sleep apnea may represent a similar protective, thermoregulatory adaptation. When the pharynx is collapsed, the diameter of the pharyngeal airway decreases, allowing increased intermolecular collisions between inspired air and the epithelial walls of the upper airway. An increase in the number of collisions facilitates the transference of both warmth and humidity to inspired air before it reaches the more sensitive lower airway resulting in the maintenance of internal, core temperature and alveolar heat retention. In fact, sleep apnea can be conceptualized as a functional reversal of the thermoregulatory process of panting, where the pharynx is highly dilated instead of collapsed. Given the disorder associated with sleep apnea, the absence of a disease state secondary to surgical correction, the fact that the disorder is exclusive to warm-blooded animals, the high proclivity for collapse documented in pregnant mothers, and the functional similarities between collapse and reflex bronchoconstriction, it appears that the phenomenon may represent an evolutionary trade-off that helped to minimize respiratory cooling. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To explore associations between disrupted rest-activity cycles and symptoms of depression in the perinatal period. Methods: Mothers were evaluated in the third trimester of pregnancy (n=61), at 3 months postpartum (n=33), at 6 months postpartum (n=21) and at 12 months postpartum (n=8). Twenty-one non-pregnant women were used as a reference group. Self-reported inventories (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II; Postpartum Depression Screening Scale, PDSS) were completed to assess depressive symptoms and actigraphy was used to measure rest-activity patterns. Correlation analyses between BDI-II and PDSS total scores and rest-activity parameters within the same subjects were calculated. Results: The rest-activity cycle of mothers was disturbed in pregnancy and particularly during the first months after delivery. Symptoms of depression were associated with altered rest-activity cycles, with a less marked dichotomy between sleep and wake states (BDI-II, r= -0.28, p=0.03), with less activity when awake (from r= -0.26, p=0.05, PDSS to r= -0.31, p=0.02, BDI-II) or before retiring (BDI-II, r= -0.40, p<0.01) and particularly with more inactivity in the hours after rising (BDI-II, r=0.28, p=0.03; PDSS, r=0.33, p=0.01). Conclusion: Engaging in daily activities when awake and a good sleep hygiene could eventually ameliorate mood decrements in mothers-to-be or mothers who have recently given birth.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation. Aim: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. Participants: A national infant cohort (N = 35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N = 36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. Outcome measures: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups. Results: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common non genetic cause of mental retardation; prenatal alcohol exposure affects the development of the nervous system. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is essential in normal neuronal development and survival as well as synaptic plasticity, an important factor in learning and memory. Previously, we have shown that prenatal treatment with neuroprotective peptides, NAP+SAL, prevented alcohol induced fetal anomalies and learning deficits. Our objective was to evaluate if NAP+SAL's neuroprotective effects are mediated by preventing alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression during embryonic development. STUDY DESIGN: A well-characterized FAS model was used (Webster, 1980). Timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides (20g, 30 min before alcohol). Embryos were harvested at 6h(E8), 24h(E9) and day 10(E18). Each sample included at least 3 embryos, representing at least 3 litters per time point. Calibrator-normalized relative real-time PCR was performed to quantify BDNF with HPRT1 standardization. Statistics included ANOVA and Fisher PLSD. RESULTS: At 6h pretreatment with NAP + SAL did not prevent the alcohol-induced decline in BDNF (P=0.9). However, pretreatment with the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<0.05) at 24h and E18. {Figure presented} CONCLUSION: NAP+SAL prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24h and 10 days after alcohol exposure. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies and learning deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome.

N2  - Sleeping arrangements under long-lasting impregnated nets (LLIN) were recorded in 2467 households during the low malaria transmission season (May-June 2007) and the same families were followed up during the high malaria transmission season (December 2007-January 2008) in two malaria-endemic areas of Sri Lanka. Approximately 800 households each from the three main ethnic groups were studied. The number of families lost to follow-up was 68. A significant increase was seen in the proportion of households using LLINs the previous night during the high transmission season (96%) compared with the low transmission season (90%) (P ≤ 0.001 for all three ethnic groups). When sleeping arrangements of the entire population were considered, priority to sleep under the LLIN was given to children under 5 years during both seasons. The percentage of children under five who slept under a LLIN increased from 75% during the low transmission season to 90% during the high transmission season. Utilisation of LLINs by pregnant women was low; only approximately 45% of pregnant women reported sleeping under a LLIN during both seasons. The study suggests the possible need for re-focusing of health education messages regarding the importance of LLIN use among pregnant women. © 2008 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

N2  - Introduction: The role of exercise capacity in patients with sleep disorders is under investigation. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated to some cardiovascular consequences including exercise cardiopulmonary impairment, particularly in obese patients. Narcolepsy (NAR) is characterized by periods of irresistible sleep, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Excessive daytime sleepiness and sometimes fatigue are frequently reported in both OSA and narcoleptic patients. Exercise capacity in narcolepsy has not been fully investigated. The aimof this study was to evaluate functional capacity in narcoleptic patients compared to OSA and controls. Methods: Eleven narcoleptic patients (mean age 40,18±8,81) characterized by clinical history, multiple sleep latency test, and presence of HLADQB1∗0602 allele were enrolled and matched by age and gender to OSA and controls (CON). Eleven OSA patients mean AHI of 26,51±28,57, and eleven non-OSA, non-narcoleptic, otherwise good sleepers comprised the control groups. Inclusion criteria were: body mass index <40 kg/m2, left ventricle ejection fraction >35%, and sedentarism. Severe systemic disease, pulmonary or cardiac disease, smoking, pregnancy, and major cognitive impairment were criteria for exclusion. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, maximum limited symptom cardiopulmonary exercise test with ramp protocol taking into consideration age, gender, 2D-echocardiogram, and spirometry. ANOVA, p<0,05. Results: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2) was lower in narcoleptic patients compared to OSA and controls group (18,65±6,72; 31,13±9,24; 32,97±7,46; respectively, p<0,01). Peak carbon dioxide production (NAR = 21,74±6,86; OSA = 31,06±7,50; CON = 35,59±8,97; p<0,01), anaerobic threshold (NAR = 13,74±2,85; OAS = 23,40±5,11; CON= 25,12±4,47; p<0,01), ventilatory equivalents for O2 (NAR = 38,56±10,61; OSA = 25,65±4,18; CON = 27,79±4,17; p<0,01) and CO2 (NAR = 33,39±6,87; OSA = 23,86±2,00; CON = 25,76±1,67; p<0,01) were lower in narcoleptic patients compared to all other groups. Conclusion: Narcolepsy was associated to lower exercise capacity when compared to OSA and controls subjects.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated to autonomic dysfunction and increased cardiovascular mortality. In healthy subjects, an attenuated heart rate at one minute of exercise recovery is related to an autonomic dysfunction and chronotropic incompetence, and it is a predictor of all-causes mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chronotropic response at the firstminute of cardiopulmonary exercise test recovery in OSA patients and in non-OSA controls. Methods: Thirty-five mild (G1), 27 moderate (G2), 20 severe (G3) OSA patients and 68 controls subjects (G4) were selected from the database of the Sleep Institute of Sao Paulo city. Inclusion criteria were: both genders, ages between 35 and 65 years and sedentarism. Severe systemic disease, cardiac disease, pregnancy and patients receiving treatment for OSA were criteria for exclusion. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, polysomnography and a maximum limited symptom cardiopulmonary exercise test. One-way ANOVA, p<0.05. Results: The mean ages were similar between groups (G1: 49.0±7.7 y, G2: 50.6±5.5 y, G3: 51.0±6.7 y, G4: 49.2±6.6 y; p=0.5). Peak hemodynamic response did not differ between controls and OSA patients, considering the systolic blood pressure (G1: 180.4±28.9, G2: 179.4±22.9, G3: 197.2±29.6, G4: 182.4±32.0; p=0.1), diastolic blood pressure (G1: 87.0±11.6, G2: 88.5±16.7, G3: 92.2±15.8, G4: 87.2±13.1; p=0.1) and heart rate (G1: 164.3±15.7, G2: 160.2±15.06, G3: 160.1±11.87, G4: 162.2±15.7; p=0.6). The firstminute recovery heart rate (G1: 130.9±17.9, G2: 126.4±13.4, G3: 128.2±18.0, G4: 129.1±18.1; p=0.7) and the difference between the peak and the resting heart rates (HR) - delta HR (G1: 33.3±7.6, G2: 33.8±10.1, G3: 32.7±12.9, G4: 34.0±11.5; p=0.9) were also similar between groups. Conclusion: These results suggest that OSA does not impair cardiovascular response during exercise at the first minute recovery heart rate and blood pressure.

N2  - Introduction: Conflicting data regarding exercise capacity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been published, which may be partially explained by the difficultly of controlling for all of the confounding factors. The role of functional capacity in OSA remains under investigation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exercise, anthropometric, and blood parameters in lean, sedentary OSA patients compared to controls in the absence of cardiac and respiratory disease. Methods: Fifty-four lean subjects (27 OSA patients) were selected from the database of the Sleep Institute of São Paulo city. The control group was matched for age and gender. Inclusion criteria were: both genders, ages between 35 and 65 years, BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and sedentarism. Patients with severe systemic disease, pulmonary or cardiac disease, smoking or pregnancy, and patients receiving treatment for OSA were excluded. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, polysomnography, a maximum limited symptom cardiopulmonary exercise test, 2D-transthoracic echocardiography and spirometry. ANOVA, p<0.0 5. Results: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between groups. The mean age was 52.9±7.9 years in the OSA subjects and 52.8±8.1 years in controls (p=0.95). The cervical circumference was higher in the lean apneics when compared to the lean non-OSA (33.7±3.5 cm and 31.4±2.8 cm; p=0.01). As expected, there were statistical differences in the AHI (15.4±9.2 events/h and 3.1±1.1 events/h; p<0.01), arousal index (14.7±8.2 events/h and 9.1±4.3 events/h; p<0.01), minimal oxygen saturation (87.2±3.5% and 91.1±3.3%; p<0.01), and mean oxygen saturation (93.0±2.5% and 95.1±2.4%; p<0.01) in the lean OSA patients. Glycemia was higher in the lean OSA group (115.1±50.1 mg/dl and 94.2±9.8 mg/dl; p=0.04). There were no differences between the groups in the peak oxygen consumption (VO2), anaerobic threshold (AT), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood pressure, and heart rate. Conclusion: High glycemia and cervical circumference enlargement are the main characteristics of lean OSA patients. Exercise performance is similar between lean OSA patients and lean non-OSA subjects considering the peak VO2, AT, and RER.

N2  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by a disagreeable sensation in the limbs which worsens at night and in rest condition and is improved by movement. The majority of patients with RLS present periodic limb movements (PLM), insomnia and a good response to the dopamine-agonists compounds. The natural course of RLS is generally chronic with only sporadic and irregular periods of remission. In idiopathic cases the neurological examination is unremarkable and often a positive family history is reported. Standard diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosis of RLS and for the polysomnographic scoring of PLM, as well as specific tools to quantify the RLS severity are available. Several conditions, such as iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, antidopaminergic medications and neurological disorders, may induce symptomatic forms of the syndrome. RLS is a common and often underdiagnosed disorder, with a prevalence around 5-10% in the general population. Although the pathogenesis of RLS/PLM is still unknown, there are pieces of evidence which support a dysfunction of the descending hypothalamic inhibitory dopaminergic pathways to the spinal cord. For their tolerability, safety, half-life and efficacy, which is evident immediately and also at low dosages, the non-ergot derivate dopamlne-agonlsts represent the first choice treatment in RLS. Iron, benzodiazepines and antlepileptic drugs are also available as a second line or combined treatment.

N2  - Introduction: The Sham CPAP is the most adequate placebo available for investigations assessing the effects of CPAP in the treatment of OSA. However, little is known about the effects of sham CPAP on sleep and breathing. Objective: To compare the clinical and polysomnographic variables (PSG) between groups with effective CPAP (C) and Sham CPAP (S), as well as to perform follow-up on these patients. Methods: Seventy patients with moderate to severe OSA referred to CPAP treatment were selected. Those included in the study were 35 to 65 years of age, non-smokers with BMI < 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Pregnancy, major medical or neurological diseases, as well as any upper airway conditions that could prevent the use of the CPAP were excluded. Patients who had had contact with CPAP were also excluded. Patients were randomly allocated to the CPAP or Sham CPAP groups. Sham CPAP consisted of a CPAP device adapted to deliver up to 1 cm H2O pressure, but maintaining the sensation of ventilation into the mask. Anthropometric and PSG assessments were carried out in all patients. Results: Of the 70 patients, 27 (38.5%), 11 of whom belonged to the S group and 16 to the C group, discontinued the protocol. Of the patients that discontinued the protocol, 16 patients claimed they could not adapt to the device, 9 terminated participation before the 1st month of use, and 2 in the course of the investigation. Of the 43 remaining patients, 30 completed the 6-month protocol. The mean age of the patients completing the study was 55±10 years, their mean BMI 29.5±4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and mean AHI 41.2±22. There was no difference in age (S: 56.3±8.7 vs. C: 53.4±10.5; p=0.26), BMI (S: 28.7± 3.4 vs. C: 30.2±5.0; p=0.22) or gender (S: F: 9/M: 19 vs. C: F: 18/M: 24; p>0.05) between groups. No differences were found in the baseline PSG variables between the S and C groups. In the PSG with the use of the devices, the values of AHI (S: 26.2±21.7 vs. C: 8.2±7.0; p<0.001), arousals (S: 23.7±20.1 vs. C: 3.7±7.2, p<0.001) and REM (S: 17.0±9.0 vs. C: 21.0±6.3; p=0.07) were different between groups, as expected. The intra-group comparison PSG data (baseline PSG vs. PSG with the use of the devices) showed that the AHI values differed only in the effective CPAP group (48.7±23.7 vs. 7.6±7.0; p<0.005). After 6 months of treatment, the groups did not differ in compliance according to the built-in compliancemeter (S: 3.4±2.1 vs. C: 4.6±2.1; p=0.92). Conclusion: We observed similar compliance between Sham and CPAP groups, and the Sham proved to be as effective as placebo treatment herein.

N2  - Aim: The study aimed to assess the time of labour onset and its symptoms as perceived by women in labour and midwives, and the relationship between these and first stage duration. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study of women with a singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation was performed in 41 maternity units. The sample comprised 1,170 women, 611 nulliparae (np) and 559 multiparae (mp), who answered two standardized questions on the onset of labour and selected the applicable symptoms of labour onset from a list of eight. A multivariate Cox regression model was computed covering further perinatal factors. Results: The median durations of the first stage of labour as assessed by the women themselves were 11 (np) and 6.5 h (mp), and as assessed by the midwives 7 (np) and 4 h (mp). Median time intervals between the start of labour onset symptoms as perceived by the women concerned and the midwives' diagnoses varied greatly: the shortest related to watery fluid loss (np = 1.5 h, mp = 0.0 h), the longest to alterations in sleep patterns (np = 11.5 h, mp = 4.5 h). Irregular pain, watery fluid loss and the time between self-diagnosed and professionally diagnosed onset of labour were just as closely associated with the duration of the first stage of labour as perinatal factors. Significant perinatal factors were induction with oxytocin, herbal remedies and PROM. Conclusions: The perceptions of women in labour are as important as perinatal factors in determining the duration of the first stage of labour and should be taken into account in intrapartum care. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction, usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Background: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period and it is important to examine interventions being used to educate new parents about caring for themselves and their newborns during this time. Objectives: To assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an individual or group on maternal/paternal and infant outcomes and health services, and whether the effects of structured postnatal education vary by length or type of intervention and by population. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2007), CINAHL (1982 to September 2007), ERIC (1966 to September 2007), HealthSTAR (1966 to September 2007), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2007), Sociological Abstracts (1974 to September 2007), ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2007), Current Controlled Trials (August 2007), Trialscentral.org (August 2007) and The National Research Register (August 2007). Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided by an educator to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post birth related to the care of an infant or of the family. We excluded studies of educational interventions for parents of infants in neonatal intensive care units. Data collection and analysis: Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Main results: We included 14 trials (2934 women) and excluded 24. Of the 14 included studies, education tested included: four on infant sleep enhancement, four on infant behaviour, two on general post-birth health, three on infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills with infants. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and/or participant accrual/loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only five were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses and these included the same two studies. Of these five meta-analyses, only one was found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect; education on sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of sleep in 24 hours (95% confidence interval 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. Authors' conclusions: The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborn infants remain unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep although more and larger studies are needed to confirm this. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

N2  - The review was made on gene pass conception as individual DNA data bank reflecting unique genetic peculiarities of each human, its major potential contribution in achievements of active longevity and creation most favorable conditions for maximal duration of individual life-span. Participation of major age-regulated genes such as biological clock genes and the weak chain genes in aging processes of humans is briefly outlined. The significance of genetic testing of allelic polymorphisms and marker-genes implicated in common multifactorial disorders is stressed. The problems evoked by genetic results interpretation are mentioned. Special attention is paid to Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) technology implemented for analysis of genetic profiles and candidate genes associated with common diseases. Scientific problems and social interests in creation of individually oriented DNA-data banks (Gene Passes) amenable for the pregnant women, children, sportsmen, etc. are discussed. The relationship of Gene Pass idea to the current international genetic program "Personificated Genome" is highlighted. Feasible perspectives for genetic testing and basic contribution of Gene Pass into gerontology practical medical service are reviewed.

N2  - Study Objectives: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children. Design: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. Measurements and results: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency (≤ 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation. Aim: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. Participants: A national infant cohort (N = 35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N = 36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. Outcome measures: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups. Results: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness patterns.

N2  - Despite advances in epilepsy therapeutics, some physicians feel uncomfortable with newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to difficulty in promptly obtaining blood levels to guide medication adjustment, and even when levels for newer AEDs are obtained, many practitioners feel they are not very useful. Lacking confidence in AEDs whose levels that cannot readily or expeditiously be measured, many clinicians share uncertainty about proper use of the newer AEDs and monitoring AED administration. Similarly, some epilepsy patients inflate the importance of AED blood level monitoring, feeling that blood levels falling within traditionally therapeutic ranges are a fail-safe for seizure control, regardless of their compliance or personal behavior aggravating seizure burden, such as poor sleep or use of illicit substances. This review examines the elusive concept of therapeutic AED blood levels and potential uses and abuses of blood level monitoring, reinforcing appropriate uses for blood levels to ensure compliance and adjust for altered AED pharmacokinetics in the context of aging and disease states, pregnancy, or drug interactions. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: Many women report disturbed sleep during pregnancy, but its impact on clinical outcomes remains unknown. This study examined subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in relation to preterm birth. Methods: A convenience sample of 220 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the second trimester. Women who had preterm and full-term births were compared on these measures. Results: The preterm birth rate of the sample was 14.6 %. Sleep latency, the period from lights out to sleep onset, was significantly longer in the preterm group, which also reported a tendency to use more sleep medications, but had lower PSQI daytime dysfunction scores. Perceived stress did not differentiate preterm and full-term groups. Conclusion: Disturbed sleep in pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth. Future studies should examine specific physiological factors that underlie this increased vulnerability.

N2  - The aim of this multicenter prospective cohort study was to develop and validate a prediction tool for moderate to severe delayed (days 2 to 5) nausea/vomiting (N&V) after chemotherapy. To develop the initial prediction tool, 200 patients from a single center were enrolled. Clinical, patient, and outcomes data associated with delayed N&V were collected. An additional 146 patients from three cancer centers were prospectively enrolled to externally validate the instrument. All patients received standard antiemetic prophylaxis that was consistent with the guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. A generalized estimating equations multivariate regression model was used to develop the initial model. Using backward elimination, we derived a risk-scoring algorithm (range 0-62) from the final reduced model. On multivariate analysis, eight predictive factors were identified and validated for delayed N&V: age, type of antiemetic used, prior N&V, a history of morning sickness during pregnancy, chemotherapy cycle, acute N&V, hours of sleep the night before chemotherapy, and use of nonprescription antiemetics. Risk scores of 16-20 were identified as the cutoff scores to maximize the sensitivity (72.0%) and specificity (64.4%) of the prediction tool. The instrument had good predictive accuracy when applied to the validation sample. To our knowledge, this is the first such tool to be developed and validated for the prediction of delayed chemotherapy-induced N&V in patients with different types of solid tumors. This tool may be used to identify a priori patients at high risk for chemotherapy-induced N&V and allow optimization of their antiemetic therapy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) from birth to age 2 years, whether recent advice has been followed, whether any new risk factors have emerged, and the specific circumstances in which SIDS occurs while cosleeping (infant sharing the same bed or sofa with an adult or child). DESIGN: Four year population based case-control study. Parents were interviewed shortly after the death or after the reference sleep (within 24 hours) of the two control groups. SETTING: South west region of England (population 4.9 million, 184 800 births). PARTICIPANTS: 80 SIDS infants and two control groups weighted for age and time of reference sleep: 87 randomly selected controls and 82 controls at high risk of SIDS (young, socially deprived, multiparous mothers who smoked). RESULTS: The median age at death (66 days) was more than three weeks less than in a study in the same region a decade earlier. Of the SIDS infants, 54% died while cosleeping compared with 20% among both control groups. Much of this excess may be explained by a significant multivariable interaction between cosleeping and recent parental use of alcohol or drugs (31% v 3% random controls) and the increased proportion of SIDS infants who had coslept on a sofa (17% v 1%). One fifth of SIDS infants used a pillow for the last sleep (21% v 3%) and one quarter were swaddled (24% v 6%). More mothers of SIDS infants than random control infants smoked during pregnancy (60% v 14%), whereas one quarter of the SIDS infants were preterm (26% v 5%) or were in fair or poor health for the last sleep (28% v 6%). All of these differences were significant in the multivariable analysis regardless of which control group was used for comparison. The significance of covering the infant's head, postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, dummy use, and sleeping in the side position has diminished although a significant proportion of SIDS infants were still found prone (29% v 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Many of the SIDS infants had coslept in a hazardous environment. The major influences on risk, regardless of markers for socioeconomic deprivation, are amenable to change and specific advice needs to be given, particularly on use of alcohol or drugs before cosleeping and cosleeping on a sofa.

N2  - Disruption of neurodevelopmental processes from in utero exposure to opiates has been shown in animal and human studies, including altered risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Neurodevelopmental outcome in offspring of opiate addicted women is further complicated by co-morbid exposure to other substances of abuse (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and marijuana) as well as prescribed medications (e.g. antidepressants, benzodiazepines) for psychiatric disease. The aim of this study is to examine the role of opiate and other polydrug exposure to neonatal sleep and arousal states and spontaneous movements. Rural, disadvantaged mothers (N=64) who were maintained on methadone were recruited from a large opiate treatment clinic in Northeastern Maine. Estimates of fetal exposure were based on maternal methadone dose history, maternal self-report, pregnancy urinalysis and infant meconium testing. Maternal interviews were conducted during the third trimester using the quantity, variability and frequency method to determine alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use during the pre-pregnancy and pregnancy periods. In the postbirth withdrawal period, infant neurobehavior was determined using piezoelectric devices to measure the infants' sleep-related spontaneous movements and 24-h realtime digital video recorded behavioral sleep and arousal states in the neonatal intensive care setting. Preliminary findings identify type and quantity of agent-specific prenatal exposure and atypical sleep-related movement organization and sleep fragmentation. Results are compared to typical and high risk samples without opiate exposure.

N2  - Infants with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) following prenatal opioid exposure are at high risk for brain injury that may be related to prenatal exposure and/or the severity of NAS. Our study examines autonomic, sleep and neurocognitive functioning in newborns of opiate dependent mothers in treatment. Sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous movements were monitored using actigraphy, and videography during hospitalization and compared to NAS severity which was assessed every 3 hours. Recognition memory was examined using the EEG event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm method at frontal (Fz), central (Cz) and parietal (Pz) sites. Severity of abstinence symptoms correlated with actigraphic level. Sleep-related spontaneous movements were reduced in duration compared to normal neonates. ERP findings revealed that frequent minus rare tone P2 peak differed significantly in latency (Fz: p=.001; Cz: p=.02) and amplitude (Pz: p=.006). Younger infants (< 2 weeks PNA) had lower amplitude response to both stimuli, and no evidence of sensory discrimination, than infants 2-4 weeks PNA (Fz: p=.003; Cz: p=.006; Pz: p=.005). Infants of older mothers showed lower amplitude ERP response to both stimuli (Pz: p=0.007). ERP amplitude response to the rare stimulus in Fz was blunted in infants whose mothers entering the narcotics treatment program later than the first trimester compared to mothers who became pregnant while in the program (p =.01). The pattern of opioid prenatal exposure and the severity of NAS predict disruption in autonomic, sleep and attentional systems.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to explore health promoting lifestyles and related factors in pregnant women. Methods: This was a descriptive study using convenience sampling. Altogether, 172 pregnant women were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Personal data was collected, and the instruments used included perceived health status, self-efficacy of health behaviors, perception of family or peers' health-promoting behaviors, and Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP Π). Results: The results showed that the standardized total score of health promoting lifestyles was 66.88 (moderate level). The subscales of the HPLP Π in descending order of standardized scores were as follows: "interpersonal relationships," "health responsibility," "psychological wellness," "nutrition," "stress management" and "physical activity." There were significant differences in the total scores of the HPLP Π among subjects with different educational level, socioeconomic status, chronic diseases, exercise habits, length of sleep, and perceived health status. Both perception of health-promoting behaviors among family (or peers) and self-efficacy of health behaviors had significantly positive relationships with health-promoting lifestyles. Perception of the family or peers' health-promoting behaviors, self-efficacy of health behaviors, perceived health status and chronic diseases were the four significant predictors of health-promoting lifestyles, accounting for 62.4% of the variance. Conclusion: The findings of this study could be used as a reference for prenatal care, nursing education, and maternal / neonatal health policies.

N2  - Objective: Diurnal blood pressure (BP) variation has been shown to predict CVD morbidity and mortality with non-dipping nocturnal BP (less than 10% variation from daytime mean value) or over-dipping nocturnal BP (20% or greater variation from daytime mean value) being associated with increased CVD risk. The mechanisms underlying diurnal BP variation are varied and include age, ethnicity, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors. Postmenopausal status has been associated with non-dipping nocturnal BP in African-American and Caucasian women. To our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between menopausal status and over-dipping BP. The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between menopausal status and the prevalence of non-dipping and over-dipping nocturnal BP in a group of middle-aged Mexican American women. Design: 247 women, aged 40-65, were randomly recruited from communities near the San Diego/Mexico border. Exclusionary criteria included hypertension (stage 3 and above) or antihypertensive treatment, history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or other serious illness, pregnancy, and taking medications with autonomic effects. Menopausal status was assessed via self-report and women were categorized into the following groups: premenopause (regular menstrual cycle over past twelve months), perimenopause (inconsistent menstruation over past twelve months), and postmenopause (no menstruation within the past 12 months). Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored during a 36 hour period within a typical work week. Based on participant's self-reported sleep/wake schedule, the monitor was programmed to take readings every 30 minutes during waking hours and 60 minutes during sleep. Participants were instructed to maintain a normal level of activity. All BP readings were reviewed and out of range values were identified and excluded from analyses. Average blood pressure during wake and sleep (based on self-reported actual sleep times) was estimated for each person via multi-level modeling analyses, to accommodate the nested structure of the data. Average daytime values accounted for momentary fluctuations in posture, temperature, physical activity, and substance and/or food consumption assessed via electronic diary. A percent dipping score for systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure was subsequently calculated (wake BP-sleep BP/wake BP) and used to categorize women into groups based on the following criteria: nondippers (< 10% variation) and over-dippers (>20% variation). Results: On average, women were 49.51 years of age (SD = 6.64), 72.8% were born in Mexico, and 68.6 % reported an education level of high school or higher. Analyses regressing the prevalence of non-dipping BP on menopausal status indicated that stage of menopausal transition was not associated with the prevalence of non-dipping nocturnal SBP and DBP (all ps >.10). However, after accounting for age, recent use of hormonal replacement therapy, education, income, nativity, physical activity level, and BMI, postmenopausal women displayed greater odds of over-dipping nocturnal SBP as compared to their premeopausal [OR (95%CI) = 4.85(1.05, 22.5), p <.05] and perimenopausal [OR (95%CI) = 4.33(1.01, 18.76), p =.05] counterparts. Menopausal status was not significantly related to prevalence of over-dipping nocturnal DBP. Conclusion: In a sample of middle-aged Mexican-American women, menopausal status was associated with diurnal blood pressure variation with the prevalence of over-dipping nocturnal SBP being higher among postmenopausal women compared to other groups. Contrary to previous findings, menopausal status was not associated with the non-dipping nocturnal BP in this sample. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the significance of menopausal status in. understanding diurnal blood pressure variation in middle-aged Mexican-American women. Over-dipping nocturnal BP is associated with cardiovascular events potentially due to hypoperfusion during sleep or an exaggerated morning surge of BP. Thus, overdipping may represent one manifestation of menopause's effect on CVD risk.

Restless legs syndrome (Review). J Intern Med 2009; 266: 419-431. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensory-motor disorder that is characterized by intense restlessness and unpleasant creeping sensations deep inside the lower legs. Symptoms appear when the legs are at rest and are worst in the evening and at night. They force patients to keep moving their legs, and often to get out of bed and wander about. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are also common during sleep amongst those suffering from RLS, and sleep efficiency is severely reduced. There are idiopathic as well as symptomatic forms of RLS, the latter being associated with e.g. pregnancy, iron deficiency and chronic renal failure. A family history of RLS is very common and pedigrees in these cases suggest an autosomal-dominant transmission with high penetrance. Genetic investigations have been performed in order to identify genes associated with RLS. Several loci have been found (on chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, 20p and 16p). Pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood. However, advanced brain imaging studies and positive results of dopaminergic treatment suggest that RLS may be generated by dopamine dysfunction locally within the central nervous system. At present, there is a wide range of treatment options including levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and iron supplements. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) from birth to age 2 years, whether recent advice has been followed, whether any new risk factors have emerged, and the specific circumstances in which SIDS occurs while cosleeping (infant sharing the same bed or sofa with an adult or child). Design: Four year population based case-control study. Parents were interviewed shortly after the death or after the reference sleep (within 24 hours) of the two control groups. Setting: South west region of England (population 4.9 million, 184 800 births). Participants: 80 SIDS infants and two control groups weighted for age and time of reference sleep: 87 randomly selected controls and 82 controls at high risk of SIDS (young, socially deprived, multiparous mothers who smoked). Results: The median age at death (66 days) was more than three weeks less than in a study in the same region a decade earlier. Of the SIDS infants, 54% died while cosleeping compared with 20% among both control groups. Much of this excess may be explained by a significant multivariable interaction between cosleeping and recent parental use of alcohol or drugs (31% v 3% random controls) and the increased proportion of SIDS infants who had coslept on a sofa (17% v 1%). One fifth of SIDS infants used a pillow for the last sleep (21% v 3%) and one quarter were swaddled (24% v 6%). More mothers of SIDS infants than random control infants smoked during pregnancy (60% v 14%), whereas one quarter of the SIDS infants were preterm (26% v 5%) or were in fair or poor health for the last sleep (28% v 6%). All of these differences were significant in the multivariable analysis regardless of which control group was used for comparison. The significance of covering the infant's head, postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, dummy use, and sleeping in the side position has diminished although a significant proportion of SIDS infants were still found prone (29% v 10%). Conclusions: Many of the SIDS infants had coslept in a hazardous environment. The major influences on risk, regardless of markers for socioeconomic deprivation, are amenable to change and specific advice needs to be given, particularly on use of alcohol or drugs before cosleeping and cosleeping on a sofa.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a prospective and controlled design. Method: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. Results: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for >3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. Conclusions: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.

N2  - Genes associated with lactation evolved more slowly than other genes in the mammalian genome. Higher conservation of milk and mammary genes suggest that species variation in milk composition is due in part to the environment and that we must look deeper into the genome for regulation of lactation. At the onset of lactation, metabolic changes are coordinated among multiple tissues through the endocrine system to accommodate the increased demand for nutrients and energy while allowing the animal to remain in homeostasis. This process is known as homeorhesis. Homeorhetic adaptation to lactation has been extensively described; however how these adaptations are orchestrated among multiple tissues remains elusive. To develop a clearer picture of how gene expression is coordinated across multiple tissues during the pregnancy to lactation transition, total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissues collected from rat dams (n = 5) on day 20 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two types of gene expression analysis were performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between days within a tissue were identified with linear regression, and univariate regression was used to identify genes commonly up-regulated and down-regulated across all tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis showed genes commonly up regulated among the three tissues enriched gene ontologies primary metabolic processes, macromolecular complex assembly and negative regulation of apoptosis ontologies. Genes enriched in transcription regulator activity showed the common up regulation of 2 core molecular clock genes, ARNTL and CLOCK. Commonly down regulated genes enriched Rhythmic process and included: NR1D1, DBP, BHLHB2, OPN4, and HTR7, which regulate intracellular circadian rhythms. Changes in mammary, liver and adipose transcriptomes at the onset of lactation illustrate the complexity of homeorhetic adaptations and suggest that these changes are coordinated through molecular clocks. © 2009 Casey et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although Rett Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder in females is thought to be relatively common from worldwide studies. There are few or probably no reports from the West African sub region. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Rett Syndrome in a Ghanaian. METHODS: Using International Diagnostic criteria for Rett syndrome, a 21-month old female presenting with mental retardation and autistic features was followed up for nearly two years and all clinical features and relevant investigations recorded. RESULTS: Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful, child developed normally till age 12 years when her development began to decline. She exhibited handwriting and bruxism was underweight with microcephaly investigations were normal except for epileptform discharges on EEG and prolonged QT interval on ECG. She was treated with melatonin and dompor for her sleep and reflect problems respectively. The patient met the criteria for a diagnosis of classical Rett Syndrome. CONCLUSION: This report shows that Rett syndrome does exist in the West African sub-region. It is possible to identify the condition in girls presenting with mental retardation or autistic features if they are appropriately followed up.

N2  - Introduction: As circadian rhythm dysregulation may contribute to depressive disorders (DD) and estradiol and progesterone are important regulators of circadian rhythms, we tested the hypothesis that circadian dysregulation may contribute to DD during women's reproductive cycle. Methods: We compared sleep (by polysomnography) and plasma melatonin (sampled every 30 minutes from 18:00-10:00 h in dim light or dark) in women with a DD during the menstrual cycle (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder-PMDD), pregnancy, postpartum (onset within three months) or menopause with matched normal controls (NC). Results: In PMDD vs. NC, plasma melatonin was lower with an earlier offset time and shorter duration (p < 0.03); stage 2 sleep was higher and REM sleep lower, and in the luteal vs. follicular phase, both groups had increased awakenings and less stage 3 sleep (p < 0.05). During pregnancy, DD vs. NC women had less melatonin secretion, and greater sleep efficiency, stage 3 minutes and REM density (p < 0.05). In postpartum DD vs. NC women, there were no differences in melatonin secretion, but DD women had less total sleep time, sleep efficiency, stage 2 minutes and later sleep onset time (p < 0.05). Menopause DD vs. NC women had increased peak concentration and area under the curve of melatonin secretion and a later offset time (p < 0.05); sleep parameters were not significantly different. Discussion: Melatonin and sleep changes distinguish women with DD from NC during the reproductive cycle, but the specific differences vary during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum and menopause.

N2  - Introduction: Anecdotally, memory and sleeping problems during pregnancy are common. However the memory deficits have not been consistently reported and pregnancy-related sleep disorders have rarely been investigated. This study aims to profile memory and sleep impairments during pregnancy and to establish whether memory deficits can be attributed to sleep disturbance. Methods: Twenty-seven women in the third trimester (T3), 20 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy and 24 non-pregnant control women of similar age were recruited from a large, public hospital. All underwent overnight PSG and completed episodic and procedural memory tasks before and after the PSG. Results: (table presented) There were no significant differences in visual or procedural memory across groups. Auditory memory differences between the groups could not be significantly attributed to the sleep deficits found. Conclusions: Pregnant women perform significantly worse on tests of auditory memory but not visual or procedural memory, as compared to non-pregnant women. Pregnant women are also more likely to experience sleep disturbances in the form of increased light sleep and decreased deep sleep, more awake time, increased snoring and limb movements. Negative physiological and psychological effects are consistently documented following sleep disruption. Memory disruption may impair ability to follow instructions given during medical consultations. Sleep and memory impairments need further investigation in pregnancy; sleep health should be an important focus of antenatal care given the higher prevalence of sleep-related disorders found in this group.

N2  - Introduction: To investigate both pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being, we introduced a long-term monitoring system for fetal movement during maternal sleep at home using a newly developed sensor (Early Human Dev 84, 2008). We then developed a special recorder that pregnant women could operate by themselves and developed a system of fetal movement analysis. In the present study, we report on further developments in the system to accommodate perinatal telemedicine via a mobile Internet. Methods: The recorder consists of two capacitive acceleration sensors (one for a fetus; one for a mother). The analysis can automatically detect and count fetal movement, change the threshold for fetal movement, automatically or manually exclude artifacts coming from mothers, and make comparisons based on gestation weeks. We created a software program that can be easily operated, sending data with one click via bmobile3G. A normal pregnant woman (35 y) who gave written informed consent tried the system. She recorded fetal movement every four weeks at home between 21 and 32 gestation weeks. She put the fetal sensor on her abdomen and the maternal sensor on her thigh, and recorded fetal movement. After recording the data, she sent it to our server. Results: It took five minutes to send the data (36 MB) to our server. Fetal movement counts detected per hour during maternal sleep at 21, 24,28, and 32 weeks were 71, 149,230, and 246, respectively. These results were similar to those of other pregnant women (see, Jpn Society Sleep Research, 2009). Conclusion: Pregnant women are able to easily record fetal movement with the new recorder at night by themselves, and they can easily send their data with one click. Support: JST.

N2  - Introduction: Previous findings have suggested an association between women's poor subjective sleep during and immediately after pregnancy, and postpartum blues (PPB) symptoms. This study further explored the roles of objectively and subjectively measured sleep in PPB as a function of parity. Methods: During the third trimester (Time-1), 24 multiparous (MP) and 20 nulliparous (NP) completed questionnaires on mood and sleep; among them, 23 MP and 18 NP wore actigraphs for 7 days. In the second part of the study, 16 MP and 12 NP wore actigraphs during the first postpartum week (Time-2), and 21 MP and 16 NP completed the same mood and sleep questionnaires. Results: For MP mood improved significantly after delivery across all scales, whereas for NP mood significantly worsened on some scales and showed no improvement on others. After delivery, both MP and NP had significantly poorer objective and subjective nighttime sleep and they increased their daytime naps. The deterioration in objective nighttime sleep and the increase in daytime nap numbers were significantly greater in NP than in MP. When regression analyses were applied to MP and NP combined, or to NP alone, poorer subjective but not objective sleep measures were associated with poorer mood at Time-2. However, regression analyses in MP revealed three significant predicting models for postpartum mood: Time-1 objective nighttime sleep, Time-2 subjective nighttime sleep, and sleep-related daytime dysfunction at both times. Conclusion: Subjective perception of poor sleep as a reflection of women's coping and adjustment is a critical factor in postpartum mental health for both MP and NP. Objectively disrupted sleep throughout late pregnancy may predispose healthy MP to postpartum mood disturbances. However, the role of objective sleep disruption among NP is less clear and needs to be examined in a larger sample as non-sleep related factors might be particularly relevant in this sub-group.

N2  - Introduction: Changes in the quantity and quality of sleep during pregnancy and postpartum are common and may be overlooked or minimalised when considering maternal health and safety. Many perinatal women experience a decline in both quality and quantity of sleep, which may put them at increased risk of drowsy driving, and therefore a motor vehicle accident. Few data have been published regarding sleep changes at this time, particularly in relation to drowsy driving. Methods: Women were recruited in late pregnancy at which time selfreported data was collected including sleep quantity; sleep quality and disturbance, using the General Sleep Disturbance Scale; daytime sleepiness, using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); and drowsy driving behaviours. The same questionnaires were completed again at 12 weeks postpartum. A telephone interview was conducted at between 4-6 weeks postpartum and included three questions on sleep duration and quality. Results: Twenty-nine women participated in the study. Mean total sleep time prior to pregnancy was 8.08 hrs, and this fell significantly to 7.14 hrs in late pregnancy (t (28) = 3.266, p = 0.003). Individual variability in sleep duration was wide, with 83% of women experiencing a change (increase or decrease) in total sleep time of more than 2 hr from pre-pregnancy to late pregnancy. TST did not return to baseline postpartum. Sleep disturbance was common, with 83% “poor sleepers” in late pregnancy, and 63% “poor sleepers” at 12-weeks postpartum. Daytime sleepiness and reported drowsy driving behaviour were higher than in the general population. In late pregnancy 18% had ESS scores >10 compared to 13% in a representative national sample of New Zealand women aged 30-50 years1. Postpartum 15% of women had ESS > 10. Drowsy driving was reported by 34.5% and 37% of women in late pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum respectively. Of the women who had driven drowsy in the last week (at 12 weeks postpartum), 80% had done so with a baby and/or children in the car. Discussion: Given that sleep disruption in pregnancy and postpartum are generally dismissed as “normal”, women may not be aware of the consequences or risks associated with sleep changes at this time. Antenatal education on realistic expectations for sleep in pregnancy and postpartum could help women to manage disruption and make informed choices about driving-related risks.

N2  - Sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness are particularly frequent during pregnancy and are likely to be influenced by changes in reproductive hormones, morphological modifications and sometimes psychological aspects that accompany pregnancy. The frequency of these disturbances increases throughout the pregnancy while they disappear generally some weeks after the delivery. The restless legs syndrome and insomnia are the most frequent. The detection of a sleep apnea syndrome is of utmost importance because potentially source of foetomaternal complications. The management of the sleep disorders during pregnancy is specific and must be adapted to the pregnancy by avoiding if possible appeal to medications. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Depression is a frequent pathology in women, particularly during pregnancy, a period of psychic vulnerability. Numerous studies have shown that this disorder can have major consequences for the mother but also for the child to be born. A study of sleep in these children with the observation from the age of two to 24 weeks shows the presence of an increase in the sleep latency and in the time awake during the night, and a reduction in the sleep duration. Meanwhile, it is well-known that maternal depression, and even more major depression during pregnancy, is a risk factor for depression in children and adolescents, classically associated with specific sleep alterations. Thus, the following question arises: are the sleep alterations a consequence of the mood disorder in the mother, or are they the classical parallel of the depressive state in the child or adolescent himself? From our recent results and the rare data in the literature, it seems that maternal depression is a risk factor, in the child, of sleep disorders that change with age. They consist essentially, for children in a reduction of paradoxical sleep, and for adolescents in a decrease of total sleep time and of sleep efficiency. Given the negative effects of depression on the mother as well as on the child, it seems of primary importance to treat this pathology during pregnancy, and to propose a treatment with minimal deleterious effects on the child to be born. In this respect, the exposure to SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy is a matter of concern, even so more when considering the results of animal research. Indeed, neonatal SSRI exposure in rodents induces sleep and behavior disorders that persist throughout life. Thus, there is a need to explore further the long-term effects of in utero exposure to SSRI on the child, and notably on its life-long vulnerability to sleep and mood disorders. Finally, on the basis of experimental data, new treatments can be developed, that aim at protecting the baby from the negative effects of the SSRI, while preserving the therapeutic efficacy in the mother. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Method: 4 pregnant women who were receiving care at A Hospital with 60 deliveries each month were interviewed in a semi-structured group manner in April of 2009 .The interviews were tape recorded, and transcripted. The data was analyzed qualitatively and inductively. III. Ethical Considerations: Each pregnant woman received an oral explanation and a written infoimation sheet that explained the purpose of this study, the right to refuse or withdraw at any time, and that the data is used only for purposes of this study. They consented to participate in writing. IV. Results: They were in the 34-37th week of pregnancy including primipara (n = 1) and multiparous (n = 3). The average age was 30.2. It took about one hour. They recognized some causes leading to interruption of sleep. They include body pain, pain while turning over in their sleep and frequent urination at night. In order to get good sleep, they laid on their side when they slept. They changed the height of their pillow. 1 have raised my legs with a higher cushion when I slept because I had back pain.' However they had little concern about their mattress. They couldn't explain the kind of mattress they used. V. Conclusions: During the pregnancy period, body pain, pain while turning over during sleep and frequent urination causes interruption of sleep. They arrange pillows and their positions when they sleep. However, they have little concern about their mattresses.

N2  - Objective: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined. Methods: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine). Results: Women gained 14.4 (±5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR]=6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-19.32; OR=3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR=3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively). Conclusions: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - The efferent mechanisms mediating the well-known diurnal cardiovascular rhythms in the late-gestation fetus are only partially understood. In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems (SNS) to these rhythms. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at a mean (SE) of 122 (1) days gestation (term is 147 days) underwent either chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine the day after surgery (n = 8), vagotomy at surgery (n = 8), or were sham controls (n = 8). Fetal heart rate (HR), fetal HR variability (HRV), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), carotid blood flow (CaBF), electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity, and nuchal activity were measured continuously for 24 h. Changes between sleep states were determined in a 6-h interval. Control fetal sheep showed consistent diurnal rhythms in fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, with maximal activity in the evening, but not in nuchal activity. Sympathectomy was associated with a significant reduction of both fetal HR and HRV, while vagotomy was associated with a fall in fetal HRV (P < 0.05) but no change in HR. Despite this, most animals in the two intervention groups still showed diurnal rhythms for fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, although peak HR may have been delayed in the sympathectomy group (mean 02:22 vs. 23:54 h in controls, P = 0.06). There was no effect of either intervention on sleep state cycling, although state-related cardiovascular rhythms were significantly modulated. These data indicate that, neither the SNS nor vagal activity, in isolation at least, is essential for generating cardiovascular diurnal rhythms in the late-gestation fetus.

N2  - Introduction. There is a strong link between female sex hormones and sleep. This implies the existence of sex differences both in the structure of sleep as in the incidence of various sleep disorders. Aim. To review the changes in the pattern of sleep experienced by women along different stages of their life cycle (fertile period, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause and postmenopause), as well as the most frequent sleeping pathologies in which there exist more gender differences (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy). Development. About normal sleeping has been reported a higher quality of it, in women compared with men (increased sleeping time, reduced sleep onset latency, and a greater efficiency of sleeping), but they frequently complain of sleep problems. Moreover, different stages in the life of women are associated with significant physiological and hormonal changes that favour the disruption of normal sleep pattern and by this way, possibly, increase risk to suffer sleep disorders. Conclusions. The reasons that underlie in gender differences in sleeping disorders are attributed to differences in normal sleep pattern, in the clinical manifestations and risk factors for sleep disorders, and in the results and optimal dose of treatments. © 2009, Revista de Neurología.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep has been considered important for brain development however few studies have examined associations between sleep and development in healthy infants. Method: Actigraphy and questionnaire data describing sleep and development were collected from healthy infants. Five developmental domains were assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Aims included piloting study methods and the assessment of factors associated with infant sleep. Results: Subjects were 52 (33 male) one-year-olds (11-13.9 months), orn between 35 and 42 weeks of gestation. (table presented) At the univariate level, the efficiency of night time sleep was positively associated with development of gross motor, problem solving (p < 0.001) and fine motor (p < 0.05) skills. Infants scoring below one or more developmental threshold for “doing well at that time” also had significantly lower sleep efficiency at night time compared to infants scoring above all thresholds (p < 0.001). The proportion of total sleep occurring at night was negatively associated with the development of fine motor skills (p < 0.05). Mixed model analysis of variance controlling for gender and developmental scores revealed that sleep duration at night, sleep efficiency at night, and the proportion of total sleep occurring at night were positively related to age (p < 0.05). Sleep efficiency at night remained positively associated with the development of problem solving skills and scoring above the developmental thresholds, after controlling for age and gender (p < 0.05). However fine motor development was negatively associated with sleep efficiency at night (p < 0.05). The proportion of total sleep occurring at night was positively related to the development of communication and problem solving skills, after controlling for age and gender (p < 0.05). Discussion: Results indicate that at one year of age, sleep efficiency and the maturation of sleep timing is significantly related to age as well as stages of cognitive and motor development. Further research using polysomnography is required to confirm whether links between sleep and development are a marker of sleep architecture maturation, or if sleep duration alone is critical for development in infancy.

N2  - Purpose: The recent report indicates theta 10-15 % of women experience reduced seizure control and 10-15% of women increased seizure frequency during pregnancy, unrelated to epilepsy syndrome, seizure type, drug therapy and previous pregnancy experiences. The proposed pathogenic mechanisms of changed seizure frequency during pregnancy include modified neuroactive hormone levels, water and sodium retention, medication noncompliance, stress, sleep deprivation and decreased AED levels. In our study we are investigating seizure frequency changes during the different phases of pregnancy. Method: We retrospectively analysed clinical data of 150 Pregnancy. The actual seizure frequency was compared to previous yearly seizure averages. The pregnancy period was divided into three main stages: 0-12 weeks, 13-36 weeks and from 36. week to postpartum 6. weeks. We analysed and compared the type of epilepsy, type and frequency of seizures, drug therapy at each patient. Results: During the whole period of pregnancy there were no changes in seizure frequencies compared to previous yearly seizure averages. In the first and third stages seizure frequency increased nearly significantly, but in the second stages seizure control was better than earlier. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred solely in the cases of compliance or management problems. Conclusions: The neuroactive hormone levels are altering during the different phases of pregnancy, thus seizure frequencies are also different in these periods. In the first trimester, neuroactive ovarian hormone levels are increased, before delivery and first 6 weeks of postpartum, the neuroactive hypothalamo-pituitary peptides levels are altering, causing seizure frequency modulations.

N2  - PURPOSE: Snoring during pregnancy is shown to be associated with a higher risk of preeclampsia and growth restriction. The goal of this study is to compare symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in mothers of newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) compared to mothers whose newborns did not require such an admission at birth. METHODS: A cross sectional survey of symptoms of SDB was performed at a large obstetric hospital. Consecutive mothers of neonates admitted to the NICU were recruited to answer a questionnaire on symptoms of SDB and daytime sleepiness using a modified multivariable apnea prediction index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Neck circumference was measured. Statistical analysis: Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact T-test and continuous variables were compared by T-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The associations were summarized by odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 863 women were included; 101 NICU mothers and 762 non-NICU mothers. Among NICU babies, 16.4% were multiples, 64.6% pre-term and 59.1% had low birth weight. Mean age was comparable in the 2 groups. Mothers of NICU babies were more likely to be Hispanic than controls (OR 2.55, 1.54-4.22). There were no significant differences in pre-pregnancy body mass index, weight gain or neck circumference. NICU mothers were more likely to smoke (OR 2.83, 1.61-4.97) and had a higher likelihood of preeclampsia (OR 4.03, 2.14-7.61) and gestational hypertension (OR 5.82, 3.17-10.69). Snoring was prevalent in 42.1% of NICU moms compared to 33.3% in non-NICU moms with a trend toward statistical significance between snoring (OR 1.45; 0.9-2.32), gasping (OR 1.87; 1.0-3.5) and NICU status. CONCLUSION: Despite a previously described association between SDB symptoms and gestational hypertensive disorders, and a high prevalence of gestational hypertensive disorder in our NICU mothers compared to the non-NICU mothers, there was only a trend to a higher incidence of symptoms of SDB in the NICU group. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Snoring in pregnancy is not a statistically significant predictor of NICU admission.

N2  - Introduction: One of the main parts of patronage is aimed to carry out complex of activities directed to patronage of women reproductive health and pregnant directed to forming, preservation and strengthening of mother's health, prevention of diseases and complications during pregnancy and early detection of danger signs. To ensure effectiveness of patronage, medical nurse along with nurses manipulation, should have knowledge and skills on pregnancy course, possible complications, timely detection of danger signs and referral to health facility and should have good communication skills as well. Objective: To study the aspect of patronage visits by nurses at primary health care level. Methodology: In this connection under the direction of Ministry of Health of Republic Uzbekistan in the framework of project “Woman and child healthcare development” was organized preliminary assessment to learn quality of patronage visits held by nurses in primary health care facilities. There was analyzed the questionnaire prescribed by nurses during patronage of pregnant women. Questions were systematized on two points: danger signs of pregnancy, when nurse should refer women to the doctor and second to strengthen of pregnant health and healthy life styles skills. Results: Analysis have shown the following results: 58% of nurses ask pregnant woman, if they have swelling of legs, 46% of about headache, 30% of fetal movement and 37% of about pain. Only 20% of nurses ask about vaginal discharges, 11% of about temperature, 8% of about urination, 4% of about abdomen trauma. Nurses were not mentioned such questions like abdominal pain, loss of consciousness, pain on chest, epigastria or right lower rib, convulsions and stinking odor of vaginal discharge. Very low percentage of nurses were interested with healthy life style behaviors of women. For example, only 10% of nurses ask questions about nutrition and appetite, only 12% of them interested about sleep of pregnant women, 2% - about physical exercises. Time consumption analyses of patronage of pregnant woman have shown that 32% of nurses spend 21 to 30 minutes to contact with pregnant woman, same percentage of nurses spend 31 minutes to 1 hour, 24% of nurses spend 11-15 minutes. 42% of nurses indicated that ideal time to contact with pregnant woman is 21-30 minutes. There is an interesting fact that most of the nurses think that 5 minutes are enough to counsel of woman. Conclusion: In order to improve quality of services provided by nurses at primary health care level in the framework of project “Woman and child healthcare development” 12,000 patronage nurses are being trained on antenatal and postpartum care of mother and newborns, children.

N2  - Aim: Questionnaire studies report that snoring increases during pregnancy and is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. Method: A new mat sensor system was used to objectively measure snoring in nineteen women during all night studies in the first and third trimesters. The device is a thin sensor-mat placed on top of the patient's own mattress and attached to a digital recorder. Results: Four (20%) of the subjects had significant snoring (defined as snoring at least 10% of the night) at the first study, and this increased to 12 of the 19 (60%) subjects in the third trimester. Those who were snoring initially for the longest duration had the greatest increase in snoring during the last trimester. None of the subjects had obstructive sleep apnea as defined by current standard measures (i.e. less than 5 events per hour) but several subject had episodes of obstructive hypopnea. Conclusion: This study provides the first quantitative measurements of snoring during the course of pregnancy and confirms that pregnancy increases the prevalence and severity of snoring. The clinical significance of this snoring is uncertain, and further research will determine if there is any relationship between snoring increase and the occurrence of pregnancy induced hypertension.

N2  - Light therapy, in its function as “zeitgeber” or synchronising agent for the circadian timing system, is well established in sleep medicine as able to shift and stabilise the circadian sleep-wake cycle. Light therapy was initially developed for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), based on photoperiodic mechanisms underlying seasonal behaviour. Clinical trials all over the world have shown light to be the treatment of choice for SAD, as well as helping the larger number of people with subsyndromal SAD - the winter blues. SAD in adolescents is more often manifested as a winter lack of energy, combined with delayed sleep phase, and/or ADHD. What is new, and requires a readjustment of preconceptions or models of how light therapy works, is the growing evidence documenting its antidepressant effects in many other diagnostic subgroups of major nonseasonal depression: unipolar and bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, chronic depression, post-stroke depression, premenstrual depression, and depression in pregnancy & postpartum. Our recently completed double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial of light therapy (7000 lux, 1 /day, 5 weeks) in pregnant depressed women shows that this is indeed an effective treatment - an important non-pharmacological alternative, with no side effects for the foetus.Examples of additional psychiatric/ neurological disorders where preliminary positive studies have been carried out are: bulimia, behavioural & sleep disturbances in ageing and Alzheimer's Dementia, Parkinson's disease, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and chronic fatigue syndrome. We still do not understand the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect, but they may be related to both a) light as a zeitgeber inducing resynchronisation of internal clocks, and/or phase shifting, and/or amplitude enhancement; b) direct effects of light on serotonergic mechanisms (analogue to conventionally-used SSRIs). Depressed patients from any culture and climate tend to withdraw socially and also physically from their normal environment - this leads to less natural light exposure, independent of how much light is available outside. Light therapy may seem counterintuitive in sunny Australia, but is a sound medical option for major depression1.

N2  - In hospitals, women of reproductive age do a range of work tasks, some of which are known to carry potential risks. Tasks such as working with radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents, as well as performing heavy lifting or tasks requiring erratic sleep patterns have been reported to increase the risk of reproductive failures. Our aim was to study pregnancy outcomes in female hospital workers in Denmark. We performed a cohort study of 5976 female hospital workers and used as a reference group 60,890 women employed outside of hospitals. The reproductive health of hospital workers working during pregnancy is comparable to those of non-hospital workers for the majority of reproductive failures studied. However, an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities was noted in some subgroups of hospital workers, which may indicate that some hospital work still entails fetotoxic hazards.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder where sensory motor symptoms are present in limbs predominantly at sleep onset and quiet wakefulness, with a circadian pattern and relieved with movement. The diagnostic criteria for RLS were established in 1995 and revised in 2005. Genetic factors are known to contribute to the etiology of RLS in two-thirds of patients, RLS can also occur with existing medical conditions - called as secondary RLS - in association with renal and liver failure, iron deficiency, Parkinson disease, neuropathy and pregnancy. The prevalence of RLS in Europe and North America has been reported to be between 5-12%. The prevalence in Asia has been reported to be much lower. The prevalence of RLS has been reported as ranging from 0.1% in Singapore to 12.1% in Korea. A community based study in Japan (2008), revealed a prevalence of 1.8%. The prevalence was higher in women than in men. There was a significant association with depression, lowered quality of life and sleep disturbances. A population based study from Korea revealed a prevalence of 3.9% (2008) with a higher prevalence in women and 1% had severe sleep disturbance associated with this. A questionnaire based study in India reported a prevalence of 2% (2007). The epidemiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) has also been evaluated in certain specific groups e.g. the elderly, females, and in patients with other systemic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, renal failure, liver diseases etc. Secondary RLS was also found to have a lower prevalence in Asian countries. The difference might be associated with racial, cultural, genetic differences. The exact reasons for this difference is however not clear as yet.

N2  - Introduction: Irreversible cessation of brain stem function implies death of brain as a whole, with the need for life support (somatic and ventilatory support). Persistent vegetative state (PVS) is a chronic condition with absence of awareness and responsiveness due to overwhelming dysfunction of cerebral hemispheres, with sufficient sparing of the diencephalons and brainstem to preserve autonomic and motor reflexes and sleep wake cycles. Successful maintenance of somatic function following brain death, to prolong pregnancy and facilitate fetal maturation in utero has been reported. We present a case of a 26 year old para 6, who was 19 weeks of gestational age with brainstem death following a massive subarachnoid haemorrhage. In view of the gestational age of the fetus and cardiovascular instability of the patient the decision to withdraw or continue somatic support was a dilemma. Expert opinion sought from a tertiary referral center was that pregnancy would need to be prolonged for 14 weeks to optimize neonatal outcome. There was conflicting opinion regarding continuing somatic support between the next of kin and the biological father who was not legally married and this raised legal and ethical issues. The dilemma was resolved following a spontaeneous miscarraige. Conclusion: Brain death is a tragic event posing a challenge to critical care. This article helps to differentiate between brain death and persistent vegetative state and examines the complex medicolegal and ethical implications that arose in the above situation. We hope this information will help providers to deal with similar issues when confronted with these unique and challenging cases.

N2  - Objective: Fertility in most cultures has a high value and a desire for having child is one of the most essential drives in human. Pregnancy or motherhood is regarded as the evolutionary bases of women personality. Family as a whole is a world phenomenon and an objective for establishing a family is to reproduce and to have children. This is the reason why if an attempt to have child leads to failure, it can become a destructive emotional experience and a stressful event for the couple it may cause depression and a crisis in marital life of the couples. Infertility is a crisis a crisis that just like unexpected experiences may create behavioral and emotional disorders. Depression due to infertility may manifest in various ways such as grief, frustration, fatigue, anxiety, disorder in sleep and appetite. This study was carried out to investigate the relative frequency of depression in infertile women presenting to special Gynecologic clinics, infertility institutes and clinics in rasht -city based on beck test from January, 2005 to June 2005. Material and Method: Present research is a cross-sectional descriptive study on 150 infertile females presenting to gynecologic clinics, infertility institutes and clinics in Rasht. Data collection method was conducted by using a beck questionnaire which was standardized for Iranian community. At first, a form of underlying demographics relevant to subjects was filled out, and then beck questionnaires were given to qualified females by the investigator for answering and completing. If the intended individual was illiterate, the questions were read by the investigator and the answers were recorded. After data- collection, the collected forms consisting of demographic characteristics and beck questionnaire were statistically analyzed after being coded by statistical software of Epi info 2001. Result: In this study, 150 infertile females were assessed in terms od depression based on beck test. Relative mean age of study females was 28.19+5.77. The highest age group of infertile women was 20-25 (35.3%) and the lowest age group of them was 40-45 (2.7%). In this research, 42.7% of them were normal, 49.3% had a mild depression, 7.3% a moderate depression and 7% a severe depression. Conclusion: With regard to the high severity of depression among infertile females and lack of a treatment team under these conditions in infertility clinics for better and more appropriate regonition of the problem, a treatment group must be established by following members: a gynecologist, a psychiatrist, a social worker, a nurse and a psychologist. Implementation of psychiatric consultation and the increase of people awareness level concerning this health problem causes a decline in stress and mental tensions of infertility.

N2  - One of the most significant environmental changes that spread world wide in the twenty century is light at night (LAN). No doubt that LAN had a positive contribution to world economy, culture, health services transportation and sports. However it also exposed the human to abolishment of seasonality or to “seasons out of time”, while humans as other mammals show seasonality in several variables. The results of recent studies carried out in our center reviled that LAN and Light interference (LI) have a significant impact on seasonal acclimatization in rodents as well as on human breast and prostate (BC and PC) cancers but not on lung and recto-colon cancers. The results of in vivo studies showed that inoculation of BC and PC mice cancer cells to mice and LAN, LI, and melatonin treatment had a significant effect on the proliferation of cancer cells, as assessed by tumor volume. The disruption of our circadian rhythms by LAN and light interference (LI) has impact also on daily rhythms of blood coagulation as we showed in short day (SD) acclimated rats exposed to LI. in such rats daily rhythms of prothrombin time (PT) while LI to SD-acclimated golden spiny mice Acomys russatus affected daily rhythms of immune variables. in regards to LAN and LI we should remember that light intensity, wave length and duration of exposure are important variables. The results of a recent study in our laboratory revealed that exposure of mice inoculated with PC cells to blue light at night (~470 nanometer) facilitated the proliferation of the PC cells relatively to mice exposed to long wave length illumination - red light (~700 nanometer). What is the mechanism? Results from our experiments show that LI is a stressor as assessed by the increase of stress hormones (adrenaline and cortisol). Furthermore, a melatonin treatment to mice inoculated with PC or BC cells had a negative effect on cell proliferation. in modern life children and pregnant mothers are exposed to LAN and LI, we are trying to understand if such exposure has an impact on health issues in adults.

N2  - CASE: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression, defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation, and Sonia may have been physically abused as well.Currently, Sonia is in third grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading, but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her younger brother and grandmother.Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications. Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to read at the age of 3 years.Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia "worries about everything," including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When an argument occurs at home, she "gets scared," bites her nails, and cries. Sonia currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and mental illness in the father's family.While conducting an interview with her mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. Instead, she illustrated a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was poor, her vocabulary, sequencing, and illustrations demonstrated above age-level skills for written expression and drawing. Examples of the writing that accompanied the drawings include: "I hate when my parents fight. I get scared and feel sick to my tummy like I want to throw up. I just hate that feeling!" "My mom told me she had a 'boyfriend.' These words were the most horrible I ever heard. Soon a nightmare began. Nightmares make me very, very scared."

N2  - Snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome and obesity hypoventilation syndrome are all defined as sleep-disordered breathing. Many changes occur in the respiratory system and sleep physiology during pregnancy due to physical and hormonal causes. Functional residual capacity, total sleep time, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and stage 3-4 non-REM sleep are reduced during the third trimester of pregnancy. Snoring is more prevalent in pregnant women than nonpregnant women. Snoring during pregnancy may be associated with pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation and low APGAR scores in infant. The prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome during pregnancy is unknown. All pregnant women, especially obese and preeclamptic were asked to possibility of sleep disordered breathing. In this review we summarized, first normal physiological changes of respiratory system and sleep during pregnancy, second maternal and fetal outcome of sleep disordered breathing and finally treatment of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.

N2  - To provide a convenient method for screening obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pregnant women. Seventy-eight pregnant women with suspected OSAHS were calculated for the EP index using Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) with also measurement of the neck circumference (NC) and body mass index (BMI). The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated and the lowest SaO(2) (LSaO(2)) measured through a 7-h polysomnography (PSG). The women were then divided into 4 groups according to the AHI and LSaO(2). The ESS was compared with the PSG-AHI and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated. All the clinical indexes (NC, BMI, EP, AHI, and LSaO(2)) showed significant differences between the 4 groups (P<0.05). EP and PSG were found to have greater correlations to AHI (r=0.759, P=0.000) than NC (r=0.668) and BMI (r=0.663). The area under the ROC of the EP (0.825) was greater than that of NC (0.772) and BMI (0.784). The index of EP showed greater clinical diagnostic value of OSAHS in pregnancy. Base on the ROC, EP at the optimal operating point of 7.5 had a sensitivity of 76.8% and specificity of 68.2% for diagnosis of OSAHS in pregnant women. The ESS is an economic and convenient method for screening OSAHS in pregnant women with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for safe infant sleep practices. METHODS: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of >900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP. CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

N2  - Purpose of the Study. We aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes of pregnant women participating in the largest RCT, of antenatal hypnosis preparation for childbirth, in late pregnancy. Methods. Following Research Ethics Committee approval and informed patient consent, 338 pregnant women in their third trimester, >18 years and who had agreed to participate in the Hypnosis Antenatal Training for Childbirth (HATCh) trial,1 were questioned prior to randomization, regarding their attitudes and knowledge of hypnosis between January 2006 and December 2008. Results. The overwhelming majority of women believed that hypnosis may be a useful method of pain relief 307 (91.1%) and, of reducing anxiety 322 (95.6%). Fifty-six women (16.6%) believed hypnosis was a form of sleep or unconsciousness, 39 (11.6%) thought hypnosis women are under the control of the hypnotherapist, six (1.8%) thought it was a form of playacting or role play and, only four (1.2%) thought that one can get “stuck in hypnosis”. Eight women (2.4%) thought that the presence of a hypnotherapist was essential at the birth if hypnosis was to be effective and, only seven women (2%) thought that maternal control was decreased when hypnosis was used. Conclusions. This side study of the HATCh trial shows that the majority of participants had a positive attitude and good knowledge of hypnosis consistent with the current scientific literature. Areas of misperception persist including: a belief that relaxation was necessary to experience hypnosis, that patients are under the control of the hypnotherapist, and that there is no scientific basis for hypnosis effects.

N2  - The administration of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine pyrimetamine (SP) to pregnant women has been implemented since 2006 in Benin, to replace chloroquine prophylaxis. IPTp is known to be efficacious against malaria during pregnancy, as shown by a clinical trial carried out in 2005 in a neighbouring area (reduction of placental malaria (PM) from 17% before the trial to 3%, reduction of LBW from 16% to 9% and increase of average birth weight from 2876 to 3060 grams) (Briand and col., 2008). However in rural areas, without the strict supervision of a clinical trial, the actual effectiveness may be different. The objective of the study was to assess the observance and efficacy of IPTp in rural Benin one year after its implementation and although the study was not designed to, its effect on PM and birth weight. 625 women were recruited at delivery between June 2007 and July 2008 in three maternity clinics. Data about malaria prevention have been collected: use of IPTp with SP (number of doses), chloroquine (CQ) and impregnated bed nets. Placental malaria was determined at delivery and newborns' weights were collected. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with PM and LBW. Women attended an average of 4.1 antenatal visits (SD = 2.1) and were 66.3% to sleep under impregnated bed nets. According to the questionnaires, 85.3% (511/610) received IPTp during their pregnancy (among them, 17.1% one dose and 82.9% 2 doses). 18.4% (110/599) were still taking CQ. 7.2% of women (43/599) had neither taken IPTp nor CQ. The proportion of women presenting PM at delivery was 10.9% (66/604). 10.3% had a LBW, and average birth weight was 2976gr (SD = 399.5). PM was more frequent in women taking CQ (16.7% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.04) than SP (IPTp, any dose). In multivariate analysis, PM was found to be associated to the use of CQ (aOR = 1.92; P = 0.05). LBW was not significantly associated with the use of IPTp (aOR = 0.46; P = 0.07) or CQ (aOR = 0.44, P = 0.09) but with the use of impregnated bed nets (aOR = 0.30; P < 10-4). The proportion of PM was intermediate between the period preceding the change in malaria prevention policy (prophylaxis by CQ) and the use of IPTp in the context of a clinical trial. CQ associated with PM may be a result that indirectly proves the risk of not taking IPTp. Surprisingly, in spite of a moderate effect on PM, IPTp (even taken once only) allowed to increase birth weight substantially.

N2  - Hypothesis / aims of study: Poor sleep is associated with multiple negative consequences for daytime functioning, quality of life (QoL), well-being and overall health. Nocturia is the most frequently-reported reason for sleep fragmentation in adults over 55 years (1), and also affects a substantial proportion of younger adults ≤39 years - in this age group, ∼40% have ≥1 void/night and ∼15% have ≥2 voids/night on average (2). In this study, the QoL of adults (≥18 years) with nocturia who were recruited to a large Phase III clinical trial of nocturia therapy in the USA and Canada, was assessed at baseline using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) survey instrument. To evaluate the impact of nocturia on QoL, the scores of nocturia patients were compared with normative scores of the US population of similar gender and age group. Study design, materials and methods: Subjects were recruited from 83 study centers in the USA and Canada. Patients were considered eligible if they were ≥18 years of age, had an average of ≥2 voids per night (determined using a 3-day frequency-volume chart [FVC]), and provided informed consent. Subjects were excluded if genitourinary tract disorders were suspected. In males, this included suspicion of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or surgical treatment for BOO or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the past 6 months. In females, this included pregnancy, use of a pessary for pelvic prolapse, or the presence of an unexplained pelvic mass. In both sexes, subjects were excluded if urinary retention was suspected by history, if they had ever experienced urologic malignancies, or if there was a history of neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Other exclusions included heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hepatic and/or biliary disease, hyponatremia, diabetes insipidus, Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone (SIADH) secretion, psychogenic or habitual polydipsia and obstructive sleep apnea requiring therapy. Individuals were also excluded if they had known alcohol or substance abuse, if their work/lifestyle potentially interfered with regular night-time sleep (eg shift workers), if they had received previous desmopressin treatment for nocturia, or if they were receiving loop diuretics. Other classes of diuretics were permitted, either as monotherapy or combination therapy. The HRQoL SF-12 (Short Form-12) questionnaire was used to measure the impact of nocturia and lack of sleep on participants' general QoL at baseline. The SF-12 consists of 12 questions spanning 8 domains: physical functioning, role function-physical, role function-emotional, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health. These scales are combined to create 2 summary measures: the Physical Health Summary and Mental Health Summary. Higher numbers indicate better QoL. The difference between mean scores of nocturia patients and US norm scores was tested for significance using t-tests. Consistent with the SF-12 instructions and the approach utilized in other studies, subjects were considered particularly impaired if they scored below the 25th percentile of the US general population norms. Results: The intention to treat (ITT) population included 757 patients. Mean age was 62 years (range 20-89), 55% were male and mean nocturia frequency was 3.3 voids/night. Mean SF-12 scores for the full ITT sample are shown in Figure 1, together with the published normative and 25th percentile scores of the US population. (Figure Present) Interpretation of results: As can be seen in Figure 1, nocturia patients at baseline scored significantly lower than US norms for all domains of QoL in the SF-12 questionnaire, except mental health. For the summary scores, nocturia patients were similar to US norms for the mental component, but significantly below the norm score, and only a little above the 25th percentile, for the physical component. Nocturia patients were particularly impaired in the domains of physical functioning, role physical (comprised of questions regarding whether the patient a) accomplishes less than they would like, and b) is limited in the kind of work or other activities they perform), and bodily pain. For all three of these domains, nocturia patients (≥2 voids/night) scored on average lower than the 25th percentile of the US population. The SF-12 is a very broad, generic questionnaire, often considered to be insensitive in relation to diseases which do not induce pain or impact physical activity directly. However, since we do see clinically meaningful differences in scores for nocturia patients, this only serves to highlight that getting up to void several times a night is not just a trivial problem. Concluding message: Amongst a broad sample of US and Canadian nocturia patients aged ≥18 years and experiencing ≥2 voids per night, QoL was reduced in comparison with US norms for 7 out of 8 SF-12 domain scores. Particularly, patients reported impaired physical function and inability to reach desired levels of daily activity and work performance. These results confirm that nocturia (≥2 voids/night) can seriously affect the daily function and QoL of patients. Since approximately 15% of all adults in the USA experience nocturia of a similar severity (3), nocturia could represent a significant QoL burden for the US population, warranting a more proactive management of the condition, including treatment strategies targeting the causes of the problem in each patient.

N2  - We present an 8yr old girl with congenital onset spastic quadriplegia, Moyamoya syndrome and severe peripheral vascular disease with Raynaud phenomenon and ischaemic ulceration of her finger tips and toes. She was the product of her mother's 5th pregnancy who had suffered 3 miscarriages. There was no consanguinity. She was born at term as normal and showed congenital onset motor delay. On assessment at 9mos of age she showed 4 limb spasticity. Subsequent head size was normal and she had good language, vision and hearing. From early childhood she experienced chilblains with pale and cyanosed tips of fingers and toes on cold exposure with occasional skin breakdown. Early CT brain showed bilateral basal ganglia calcification; intrauterine infection was excluded. MRI brain at 7yrs of age showed bilateral severe stenosis of supra clinoid internal carotid, middle and posterior cerebral arteries with marked Moyamoya collaterals around the basal ganglia and thalami as well as lacunar infarcts in the right centrum semi ovale and left posterior parietal and occipital lobes. In view of congenital onset intracranial calcifications with chilblains Aicardi Goutieres syndrome (AGS) was considered. DNA screen for mutations in AGS 1, 2, 3 and 4 was negative. She was treated with monthly Prostacycline infusions. At age 9yrs she suddenly deteriorated in sleep from a massive intraventricular bleed that ended fatally despite external ventricular drainage and neuro-intensive care. She tested positive for a homozygous mutation in exon 5 of the newly identified AGS5 gene SAMHD1 (in press Nature Genetics). The involved residue is highly conserved; has not been seen in control alleles and has been identified in 2 other AGS families. The finding of Moyamoya syndrome and peripheral vascular disease in association with mutations in the AGS5 gene suggests a role for SAMHD1 in vascular homeostasis and inflammation.

N2  - Background: Paroxysmal tonic upgaze (PTU) is a syndrome of childhood manifesting as sudden ocular movements with sustained upward deviation of the eyes. This syndrome is usually classified as a transient movement disorder in children. We describe the clinic and outcome of 5 patients. Reports: 2007 we observed in our two clinics 5 infants (4 male and 1 female) with abnormal ocular movements as having PTU and their age at onset of the disease ranged from 2 to 7 months. In all cases we can study the video recorded from the parents. All 5 Infants showed an uneventful pregnancy and birth. Neurological and developmental examination were normal at the onset of the disease. These episodes lasted for 3 to 5 seconds each and were not accompanied by any loss of consciousness. In 3 infants PTU was exacerbated by fatigue and relieved by sleep. In order to exclude epilepsy, we performed interictal EEG and we found this to be normal in all children. In all patients, tonic up gaze episodes disappeared with time to remission, varying from 2 to 12 months, without any therapy and without any change in psychomotor development, EEG and neuroimaging. Conclusion: From a long-term follow-up, we can confirm the good prognosis of PTU and suggest it is possible to define a distinct syndrome of childhood without any neurological abnormalities and with spontaneous resolution. The pathogenesis is still unclear, because this syndrome could reflect the immaturity of cortico-mesencephalic control of vertical gaze, but it could also reflect organic lesions of the mesencephalic region. Early recognition of this benign condition minimizes potentially unnecessary investigations. In spite of little literature this condition seems not to be very rare. Recently, it has been suggested that this transient ocular movement disorder could be associated with other neurological and ophthalmologic disorders such ataxia, amblyopia and strabismus developmental delay and abnormal neuroradiologic features. These reports suggest that PTU is a heterogeneous syndrome in respect of prognosis and outcome and that it could be marker of underlying neurological and developmental abnormalities. Nevertheless, a careful clinical neurophysiologic and neuroradiologic evolution should be performed to detect possible structural lesions mesencephalic in origin causing paroxysmal tonic up gaze.

N2  - Autosomal dominant GTP-cyclohydrolases (GTP-GH) deficiency results in Doparesponsive- dystonia (DYT5) that presents with a wide spectrum of movement disorders and a variable penetrance in the carriers. The diagnosis is confirmed by molecular analysis of GCH1 gene in about 75% of case. We report genotype and clinical and biochemical phenotype of a new family with AD GTP-CH, in which the diagnosis could be addressed by the alteration of the pattern of pterin excretion in urine. This 11-year-old girl was born after a normal pregnancy and delivery from unrelated parents. The father had been suffering since the adolescence from gait fatigability, that came out increased during the late afternoon and evening. The patient's psychomotor development was considered normal. At the age of 3 she suffered from atonic fits that was interpreted as seizures and treated with antiepileptic medicaments. When 8 years old he was again examined because of learning difficulties that were ascribed to a mild mental retardation. Starting from the age of 9 she complained an evening fatigability associated with instable gait that disappeared after the overnight sleep. On the examination, at the age of 11, she showed an obvious choreoathetosis involving limbs and trunk that exacerbated with exercise and in the evening hours. She was mildly retarded (WISC IQ 51) and appeared depressed and anxious. Brain MRI and awake and asleep EEG were normal. Urine pterin assessment disclosed reduced Neopterin (0.27 mmol/mol creatinine; v.n. 0.3-4.0). CSF analysis revealed a normal level of 5HIAA and HVA, while Neopterin was low (1.96 μg/L v.n. 2.3-5.1). Molecular analysis of CGH1 gene disclosed in the girl and in father a frameshift mutation in exon 6 (c.631-632 del AT, p. H211fs). When examined the father showed a very mild foot dystonia with diurnal fluctuation and a low level of Neopterin in urine (0.23 mmol/mol creatinine; n.v. 0.3-4.0). A complete resolution of movement disorder was obtained with L-Dopa/Carbidopa treatment both in the girl and in her father. Conclusions: a) a mild decrease of Neopterin in urine, when detected, can be a useful peripheral marker of AD GTP-CH deficiency; b) CSF 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations not necessarily reflect the severity of biogenic amines depletion at level of serotoninergic and dopaminergic receptors.

N2  - Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD). Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these dams was 11.53 ± 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies. Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

N2  - BASIC ASPECTS OF CHRONOBIOLOGY: Rhythmicity is the most ubiquitous feature of nature. Rhythms are found from unicellular to complex multicellular organisms both in plants and animals including man. Living organisms are continuously influenced by external stimuli, many of which have rhythmic patterns. Environmental rhythms in daily and seasonal patterns of light, food availability and temperature, etc. are predictable and animals-including humans - have the ability to anticipate these environmental events with periodically and predictably changing internal conditions. These rhythmic patterns of anticipation have clear advantages and survival value. The frequencies of rhythms in nature cover nearly every division of time. There are rhythms which oscillate once per second (e.g. in the electroencephalogram), once per several seconds (respiratory rhythm, heart rate), up to rhythms which oscillate once per year (circannual rhythm). The most evident environmental change which results from the regular spin of the earth around its central axis and resulting in the alternation between day and night seems to have induced the predominant oscillation, the circadian rhythm (the about-24-h rhythm; circa = about, dies=day). There is sound evidence that living systems including humans are not only organized in space but are also highly organized in time. The mammalian circadian clocks, located in the neurons of suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the brain and in cells of peripheral tissues, are driven by a self-sustained molecular oscillator, which generates rhythmic gene expression with a periodicity of about 24 h. This molecular oscillator is composed of interacting positive and negative transcription/ translation feedback loops in which the heterodimeric transcrip-tion activator CLOCK/BMAL1 promotes the transcription of E-box containing Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and Period (Per1 and Per2) genes, as well as clock-controlled output genes. After being synthesized in the cytoplasm, CRY and PER proteins feedback in the nucleus to inhibit the transactivation, mediated by positive regulators. The mPER2 protein acts at the interphase between positive and negative feedback loops by indirectly promoting the circadian transcription of the Bmal1 gene and by interacting with mCRY proteins. In various species the genes controlling circadian rhythms have been identified. These clocks regulate a wide variety of behavioural and metabolic processes in many life forms. Furthermore, it has been shown in rodents that about >10% of all genes are regulated in a circadian fashion. In general, the endogenous clock does not run at a frequency of exactly 24 h but somewhat slower in man and in rats, but faster in mice. CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS IN MAMMALS: In all mammals nearly all functions are highly organized in time. Though the circadian rhythm in plasma cortisol is the most well known one in humans, numerous studies in man and in experimental animals have provided convincing evidence for the existence of such rhythms in nearly every physiological function such as in blood flow, stroke volume, peripheral resistance, parameters monitored by ECG recordings, in the plasma concentrations of hormones such as cortisol, melatonin, insulin, prolactin, noradrenaline, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, in atrial natriuretic hormone and plasma cAMP concentration, in blood viscosity, aggregability and fibrinolytic activity, plasma concentration of glucose, electrolytes, plasma proteins, enzymes, in the number of circulating red and white blood cells and blood platelets, etc. Moreover, various functions of the lung (minute volume, peak flow, FEV1, dynamic compliance), of the liver (metabolism, blood flow, first pass effect) and of the kidneys (glomerular filtration, renal plasma flow, pH, urine volume, electrolyte excretion) can vary pronouncedly with time of day. Also gastric acid secretion exhibits a circadian variation with peak values in the late afternoon in normal subjects as well as in patients suffering from peptic ulcer. Finally, also the onset and clinical signs of certain diseases do not occur randomly within 24 h of a day. Already in 1698 John Floyer reported that asthma attacks are more frequent at nightly hours than at other times of the day, an observation which has nicely been confirmed in modern epidemiologic studies in asthmatic patients. Similarly, the occurrence of coronary infarction, sudden cardiac death as well as of angina pectoris attacks and of pathologic ECGrecordings is unevenly distributed over 24 h. Though day-night variations in heart rate and/or blood pressure have already been described since the 17th century, the recent development of easy-to-use devices to continuously monitor blood pressure and heart rate in man (ABPM = ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) demonstrated that blood pressure in normotensive and in hypertensive patients are clearly dependent on the time of day. Moreover, different forms of hypertension may exhibit different circadian patterns: In normotension as well as in primary hypertension there is in general a nightly drop in blood pressure (dippers), whereas in secondary hypertension due to e.g. renal disease, gestation, diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, the rhythm in blood pressure is in about 70% of the cases abolished or even reversed with highest values at night (nondippers). This is a particular interest as the loss in nocturnal blood pressure fall correlates with increased end organ damage in cardiac, cerebral, vascular and renal tissues. In animal experiments significant circadian rhythms have demonstrated down to the cellular and subcellular level of, e.g. various neurotransmitter receptors, signal transduction processes and enzyme activities, also click genes are expressed in a circadian manner. Pharmacokinetic deals with absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs (ADME). The different steps in pharmacokinetics are determined and influenced by physiological functions of the body. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as peak drug concentration [Cmax], time to Cmax [tmax], volume of distribution [Vd], area under the curve [AUC], bioavailability, plasma protein binding and elimination half-life [t1/2] are conventionally not considered to be influenced by the time of day at which a drug is administered. However, an increasing number of recently published studies convincingly gave evidence that this paradigm can not be maintained any longer. The main reason to skip this paradigm is the demonstration that body functions, including those which are known to influence pharmacokinetics, are not constant in time, even not within 24-h of a day. In the light of the chronobiologic and chronopathologic findings described above it is not surprising that the pharmacokinetics and/or the effects of drugs may also be not constant within 24 h of a day. It has been convincingly demonstrated in experimental animals as well as clinical studies that both the drug effects as well as their kinetics can be dependent on the time of day of drug dosing and on the underlying rhythmicity of the function studied. USE OF RADIOTELEMETRY IN CIRCADIAN RHYTHM RESEARCH IN RODENTS: The availability of implantable radiotelemetric devices made it possible to study various cardiovascular functions in freelymoving, unrestrained animals. There is a clear-cut advantage of radiotelemetry over the conventional tail-cuff method as radiotelemetry does not induce stress reactions in experimental animals. The telemetric devices from Data Sciences Inc., St. Paul, MN, were used in rats and mice allowing to measure simultaneously systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and motility by implanting the blood pressure transmitter into the abdominal aorta (rats) or into the carotic artery (mice) or an ECG-transmitter was used to allow continuous monitoring of the heart rate as well as temperature and activity in mice. Moreover, radiotelemetry can be applied to chronopharmacological studies in rodents, having the advantage that each single animal can be its own control, and dose-response studies can be performed at any circadian time after adequate wash-out periods. Aside from normotensive control rats (Sprague-Dawley [SPD], Wistar-Kyoto [WKY]), spontaneously-hypertensive rats [SHR] were used as a model of human primary hypertension and transgenic TGR(mRen2)27 rats [TGR] as a model for human secondary hypertension. Experiments were also performed in wildytype (C57), several strains of transgenic or knock-out mice. To get more insight into the circadian regulation of the cardiovascular system various strains of rats were studied as animal models of human primary and secondary hypertension. Experiments were performed under highly controlled environmental conditions under a light:dark (LD) schedule of 12:12 h. To test for the contribution of the biological clock(s) rats and mice were monitored under free-run conditons in total darkness (DD) as well as after a shift of the LD cycle simulating a westward jet-lag. Our data gave evidence that the circadian rhythms in blood pressure and heart rate are controlled by the biological clock(s), as in rats and mice the rhythms persisted under freerunning conditions in total darkness and were abolished in rats by lesioning of the 'master clock' located in the suprachiasmatic nulcei.

N2  - Background: Ilio-caval stenting now represents the first line treatment for disabling obstructive ilio-caval lesions. Most patients are young women of child-bearing age. We herein report our experience of pregnancy in women who have a history of ilio-caval stenting. Materials and Methods: From November 1995 to April 2008, 119 patients had ilio-caval stenting for obstructive venous disease in our department. Of these, 62 women were able to become pregnant. When pregnancy occurred, they received preventive treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) from the 3rd month of pregnancy to 1 month after delivery and had to wear elastic stockings. Patients also had to sleep on their right side if possible. They were followed during the pregnancy by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and 8 months, and then 1 month after delivery. Results: Eight pregnancies occurred in 6 patients (mean age 26.5 years) who had a patent self-expanding stent (1 patient had 3 pregnancies). They had stenting for May-Thurner disease in 3 patients, for post-deep venous thrombosis (DVT) left common iliac vein occlusion in 1 patient, and during venous thrombectomy in 2 patients. All stents were self-expanding metallic stents located on the left common iliac vein. One patient had unrelated spontaneous abortion after 2 months of pregnancy. No DVT or symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred during pregnancy, delivery, or during the postpartum period. Four patients needed cesarean delivery and none had hemorrhagic complications. None of the patients had adverse effects from the treatment. Duplex scan showed compression of the stent(s) at 8 months in 4 patients with inflow obstruction in 3 patients. Postpartum duplex-scan showed no remaining stenosis in all patients. No stents had structural damage. Conclusion: Ilio-caval stent compression can occur during pregnancy but does not lead to structural damage to the self-expanding stents. Despite this, no cases of DVT occurred with preventive LMWH treatment. © 2009 Society for Vascular Surgery.

N2  - Objective: Affective disorder during pregnancy is a common condition: one in ten pregnant women suffers from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One complaint in pregnancy is sleep disturbance, and this is also a characteristic of MDD. However, the literature about sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant women is sparse. This ongoing study compared subjective sleep in pregnant depressed and non-depressed women. Methods: Self- reported sleep measures were collected by 35 pregnant women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD and 7 non-depressed pregnant women (CON). All women kept a diary for one week where they assessed daily, before bedtime, their feelings (relaxed-tense, somatically unwell-well, alert-sleepy, sated-hungry) and mood (worst-best) on a bipolar scale (VAS) and noted the next morning their sleep onset time, wake-up time, and nighttime awakenings (number, duration). Results: The two groups did not differ in age (M=32.4) and pregnancy week (PW) (M=20.6). Over all trimesters, they showed significant differences in mood (p<.001), feeling tense (p<.05), and duration of nighttime awakenings (p<.05). Compared with CON, MDD showed in the second trimester worse mood (p<.05), and in the third trimester also lower mood (p<.05), longer duration of nighttime awakenings (p<.05), and a trend for longer sleep onset latency (p<.052). Within the groups, no significant difference between the second and third trimester was found. For all pregnant women, better mood correlated with less tension (r = -.466, p<.05), better somatic wellbeing (r=.737, p<.001), fewer (r = -.371, p<.05) and shorter nighttime awakenings (r = -.392, p<.05), and shorter sleep onset latency (r=-.367, p<.05), when PW was controlled. For PW, no significant correlation was found. There were no significant correlations between the trimesters within the groups. Conclusion: Pregnant women with MDD had a significantly lower mood, higher tension, and more sleep disturbances than CON. Greater depressed mood in pregnancy was correlated with poorer somatic wellbeing, higher tension, more and longer nighttime awakenings, and prolonged sleep onset latency. There was no increase in sleep disturbances in the third compared with the second trimester.

N2  - Introduction: Three retrospective studies [1-3] suggested a high frequency (11-26%) of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy. None of these studies used standardized methods for assessment of RLS and sleep. Characteristics and determinants of RLS during pregnancy are poorly known. Methods: Women during (from the 2nd trimester, 1x/month) and after pregnancy (8 weeks post-partum) are prospectively studied. Assessment includes 1) interview about RLS-symptoms and sleep habits/ disturbances: 2) standardized questionnaires (incl. the international RLS-scale (IRLSS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI)); 3) blood tests (incl. hemoglobin, C- reactive protein and ferritin), 4) leg actigraphy (3rd trimester and post-partum). Results: So far 308 women were included. RLS was diagnosed in 28 women (9.1%). 28% of them had a positive family history for RLS, 60% reported onset of RLS-symptoms before the 20th week, 60% had RLS-symptoms daily, 60% had an IRLSS>20, and 85% had a PSQI> 5. Anemia (defined as Hb <11 g/dl in pregnant women) was found in 10% of affected and unaffected women. Ferritin levels <50 were found in 88% of women. Women with (pRLS) and without RLS (nRLS) had similar values in hemoglobin CRP, and ferritin (mean Hb 11.8 mg/dl in pRLS, 12mg/dl in nRLS; Ferritin 19.1 ug/l in pRLS, 13.3 in nRLS). Conclusion: Preliminary results of this ongoing study suggest that RLS in pregnancy: 1) is present in 10% of women; 2) frequently appears early in pregnancy; 3) is often severe/ frequent; 4) may not be related (only) to anemia/low ferritin levels; 5) has a significant impact on sleep quality.

N2  - Aims: To determine trimester-specific risk factors for small-for- gestational-age (SGA) infants. Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks of gestation and followed up until delivery. The sample size was 690. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were gathered on average at 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. SGA was assessed using customised birth centile charts. Multiple logistic regression was applied, and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: The risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were shift work and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters (OR 4.20, 95%CI 1.10-16.0), sleeping for less than or equal to 8 h during 2nd or 3rd or both trimesters (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.08-4.59), walking for less than or equal to 2.5 h per day (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.12-6.31) and alcohol consumption during the 3rd trimester (OR 14.5, 95%CI 2.23-94.7). Poor weekly gestational weight gain was significantly associated with both SGA < 10th and < 5th centiles. None of the other factors became significant for SGA < 10th centile. Conclusions: Risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were sleep deprivation and shift work and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters, less walking hours and alcohol consumption during 3rd trimester. Poor weekly gestational weight gain may be considered as a predictor of delivering an SGA infant. © 2009 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the risk for OSAS among females in the United States. Methods: This is an analysis of data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. adults. The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the risk for OSAS among the U.S. female population. This instrument includes questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders. Results: Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p<0.05), obesity (p<0.001), and menopause (p<0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk. Conclusions: One in four women in America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is classified in five stages according to Quintero staging. However, the efficacy of such staging was recently debated. We reviewed the efficacy of Quintero staging to predict survival rate in TTTS treated with laser therapy. Articles reporting survival rate for each stage in TTTS treated with laser therapy were reviewed. Number of twins alive per pregnancy (NAP) was compared between early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV) stages and within stages. Meta-analysis was performed according to Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Heterogeneity was tested with chi-square for heterogeneity at a significance level of p < 0.10, and random or fixed models were generated as appropriate. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NAP was similar between early (zero survivors: 34/228, 15%; one survivor: 49/228, 21%; two survivors: 145/228, 63%) and advanced stages (zero survivors: 38/214, 18%; one survivor: 64/214, 30%; two survivors: 112/214, 52%; p > 0.05) except for one survivor (p < 0.05). A trend for increased NAP was observed in all stages. Because clinically relevant differences were not observed, laser therapy is the optimal treatment for all stages. As Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, a new staging system is proposed. Copyright © 2009 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Background and Aim: Recognition of cortical perception as an effect of esophageal stimulation is not known in premature neonates. In contrast, mid-esopha- geal sensory stimuli activate adaptive esophageal reflexes (peristaltic reflex, PR and upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex, UESCR, Jadcherla et al., J Pediatr 2003, 2006). We hypothesized that premature infants perceive esophageal stimuli resulting in electro-cortical arousals (ECA) and that arousals are dependent on esophageal neuromotor characteristics. Methods: Eleven healthy infants (27 ± 0.8 wks gestation) were evaluated at 37 ± 0.8 weeks corrected age. 83 mid esophageal infusions (air, water, apple juice) and 27 sham infusions were given in sleep during concurrent manometry, respiratory inductance plethys- mography and video-polysomnography. With stimulus onset as a reference, the response latency, frequency and duration of ECA, PR and UESCR were scored. Changes in respiratory patterns and sleep states (active or quiet sleep) were scored in a blinded fashion. Results: There was no PR, UESCR or ECA with 27 sham stimuli. 46 of 83 stimuli (55%) resulted in ECA (P < 0.0001) within 7.3 ± 2.4 s and lasted for 11.9 ± 4.2 s. Stimulus-response characteristics during ECA vs non-arousals are compared (Table). Table Presented. Conclusions: In sleep, premature neonates can perceive esophageal visceral sensitivity demonstrated by ECA and respiratory rhythm changes suggesting activation of afferent pathways and cortex. Prolonged duration of PR and UESCR are associated with ECA.

N2  - Background: Most antidepressant medications in current use have several disadvantages: a delayed therapeutic effect, side effects, stigmatization and concerns about safety for the developing fetus during pregnancy. Several chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as an alternative. The current article reports the design and the initial outcome results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (wake therapy - WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv) sleep phase advance (SPA). Methods: The study was conducted as a set of 12 single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive volunteering patients. Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis beginning with a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a set of four consecutive morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1-T4),and with a final measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5). Results: A clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies. Conclusions: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well tolerated. It affords many advantages, such as the achievement of a rapid response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up, safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sensorimotor disorder where patients complain of an almost irresistible urge to move their legs. This urge can often be accompanied by pain or other unpleasant sensations, it either occurs or worsens with rest particularly at night, and improves with activity. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group has established four essential criteria for clinical diagnosis of RLS. State of art: Affecting an estimated 7.2 to 11.5% of the adult population, the symptoms of RLS may be associated with significant sleep disturbance and may have a negative impact on quality of life. The prevalence of RLS increases with age, and women are more frequently affected than men. In France, the estimated prevalence is 8.5%. Among sufferers, 4.4% complain of very severe symptoms. Although RLS is mainly idiopathic, several clinical conditions have been associated with it, especially iron deficiency with or without anemia, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. These conditions may share a common pathophysiological mechanism involving a disorder of iron metabolism. By contrast, controversy persists as to whether polyneuropathy, particularly when associated with diabetes, is to be considered as an important cause of secondary RLS. This association is difficult to demonstrate as conventional electromyography is not adequate to detect small fiber neuropathy often associated with diabetes. Conclusion and perspectives: RLS is often underdiagnosed and few subjects receive recommended RLS drug treatment. There is a clear need for complementary education to improve the accurate diagnosis of RLS. Indeed, better knowledge of this syndrome is a prerequisite to prompt an appropriate therapeutic management. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - BackgroundAspirin has been found to prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension and to induce nitric oxide (NO) release from vascular endothelium. Low-dose aspirin has also been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) when administered at bedtime, as opposed to upon awakening, in untreated hypertensive patients and high-risk pregnant women. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on ambulatory BP of aspirin administered at different times of the day in prehypertension.MethodsWe studied 244 subjects with prehypertension, 43.0 13.0 years of age, randomly divided in three groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/day) on awakening; or the same recommendations and aspirin at bedtime. BP was measured for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention.ResultsAmbulatory BP was unchanged in subjects randomized to either nonpharmacological intervention or aspirin on awakening. A significant ambulatory BP reduction was, however, observed in the subjects who received aspirin at bedtime (decrease of 6/3 mm Hg in the 24-h mean of systolic (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP), respectively; P<0.001), without changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline. BP was homogenously controlled along the 24 h after bedtime aspirin administration (6/4 mm Hg reduction in activity mean of SBP/DBP; 6/3 mm Hg reduction in sleep-time mean, respectively).ConclusionsThis prospective trial documents a significant effect on BP of low dose aspirin only when ingested at bedtime by prehypertensive subjects. The timed administration of low-dose aspirin could thus provide a valuable and cost-effective approach for BP control in subjects at elevated risk of developing hypertension. © 2009 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

N2  - Pregnancy-related low back pain is a common problem during pregnancy. More than half of all pregnant women experience low back pain at some time during pregnancy. The pain can vary from a mild discomfort to being severe and disabling. In one-third of these women, pain is a severe problem compromising activities of daily living, work and sleep. The awareness of the possible impact of low back pain on the quality of life and the associated costs to society has increased medical attention over the last decade. Pain usually develops between the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy but may appear as early as the first trimester. Moreover, some women who experience back pain during pregnancy experience persistent back pain in the postpartum period or have an increased risk of back pain in subsequent pregnancies, and many women with chronic back pain link its onset to a pregnancy. Despite its high frequency, there are some ambiguities inherent in the terminology, diagnosis and classification. The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet dearly understood. The etiology of pain is probably related to a combination of mechanical, hormonal and vascular contributing factors. Low back pain in pregnancy is most commonly subdivided into lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain. This subdivision is important in terms of both management and prognosis. Characteristic findings and treatment may differ between the two categories. Accurate assessment and effective treatment are important for managing the low back pain of pregnancy. The purpose of the present article was to provide a summary review of the performed studies on pregnancy-related low back pain.

N2  - Sleep disturbances (SD) are risk factors for adverse health outcomes. SD are associated with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. Excessive inflammation is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We measured the relationship between sleep duration and sleep quality in early gestation and the relationship to circulating cytokines across pregnancy. The inflammatory cytokines IL-2, -6, -8, IFNgamma, TNFalpha and antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4, -5, and -10 were measured by Luminex technology. The proinflammatory:antiinflammatory cytokine ratio was calculated as the mean multiple of the median (MOM) for each relevant cytokine type to normalize the data for comparison. We used nonparametric (cross-sectional data) and mixed models (longitudinal data) analyses. Participants (N=85) were 15 ± 2.8 weeks gestation and 30 ± 4.9 years. Correlations were found between sleep duration and most cytokines but only in the 1st trimester (p's <.05). Short (<7 h) or long (>9 h) sleep in early gestation was positively associated with IL-6 and the ratio across pregnancy. Poor sleep quality in early gestation and loss >1 h of sleep across pregnancy was associated with a higher ratio. This pilot study supports a relationship of disturbed sleep and pro and anti inflammatory cytokines during pregnancy. They are consistent with the non-pregnant literature of a “U” shaped relationship between sleep duration and inflammation. Poor sleep early in gestation may encourage an increase in basal inflammation.

N2  - Study objectives: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2) identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based. Participants: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830). Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPDS ≥ 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression. Conclusions: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.

N2  - Partial sleep loss is associated with adverse effects on metabolic, neuroendocrine and immunological systems (van Cauter et al., 2007; Bryant et al., 2004). After childbirth parental sleep duration can be considerably reduced over months (Gay et al., 2004). We designed two pilot studies to get a first idea of consequences of chronic partial sleep loss in young parents. First, we collected data concerning subjective well-being, sleeping behavior and chronic stress experience of 639 young parents with 1-18 month old infants. Half of all investigated parents reported to suffer from sleep deprivation and described themselves as less effective, more stressed and impaired general health. Second, we determined metabolic, endocrine and immunological parameters in blood and saliva of 105 young parents. Dependent on their self-reported habitual sleep duration before pregnancy and during the last six month subjects have been divided into a partial sleep loss group vs. normal sleep group. Analysis of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein revealed significant group and sex differences with higher values in the sleep loss group and women. We found significant higher Ghrelin-to-Leptin-ratios in the sleep loss group. No differences have been found in salivary cortisol in the evening. Results indicate that alterations in psychological and physiological domains due to chronic partial sleep loss are evident in parents of infants. Hence, a prospective longitudinal study is planned to overcome methodological limitations concerning both pilot studies.

N2  - Purpose of the study: We aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes of pregnant women participating in the largest randomised controlled trial of antenatal hypnosis preparation for childbirth, in late pregnancy1. Methods: Following Research Ethics Committee approval and informed patient consent, 338 pregnant women in their third trimester, >18 years and who had agreed to participate in the Hypnosis Antenatal Training for Childbirth (HATCh) trial, were questioned prior to randomisation, regarding their attitudes and knowledge of hypnosis between January 2006 and December 2008. Results: The overwhelming majority of women believed hypnosis may be a useful method of pain relief 307 (91.1%) and of reducing anxiety 322 (95.6%). Fifty-six women (16.6%) believed hypnosis was a form of sleep or unconsciousness, 39 (11.6%) thought in hypnosis women are under the control of the hypnotherapist, six (1.8%) thought it was a form of playacting or role play and only four (1.2%) thought that one can get “stuck in hypnosis”. Eight women (2.4%) thought that the presence of a hypnotherapist was essential at the birth if hypnosis was to be effective and only seven women (2%) thought that maternal control was decreased when hypnosis was used. Conclusions: This side study of the HATCh trial shows that the majority of participants had a positive attitude and good knowledge of hypnosis consistent with the current scientific literature. Areas of misperception persist, including a belief that relaxation was necessary to experience hypnosis, that patients are under the control of the hypnotherapist and that there is no scientific basis for hypnosis effects.
