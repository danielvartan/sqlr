AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OSA and preeclampsia.Methods: Between 30 and 39 weeks gestation, objective sleep apnea were evaluated in 38 normal pregnant and 40 preeclamptic women. Preeclampsia was defined by having a blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 mmHg on two occasions after the 20th week of pregnancy with excess protein in the urine (> 300 mg in 24 h) or 30 mg persistent proteinuria (+ 1 in dipsticks) in random samples. Objective sleep apnea was evaluated using an overnight in-hospital sleep evaluation using the SOMNOwatch plus Respiratory Screener. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9), and severe (≥ 30).Results: Mean AHI was 33.3 ± 12.1 in preeclamptic women and was 23.8 ± 15.8 in normal pregnant women (p = 0.008). There was significant difference in prevalence of OSA severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) between groups. Out of 33 preeclamptic women, 11 women had moderate and 22 women had severe OSA. Whereas, among 33 normal pregnant women, 8, 13, and10 women had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. Two normal pregnant women had no OSA (AHI< 5).Conclusion: Our study suggests women are susceptible to developing OSA during pregnancy that is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.

AB  - Background: Experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that among nonpregnant adults, sleep duration may be an important risk factor for chronic disease. Although pregnant women commonly report poor sleep, few studies objectively evaluated the quality of sleep in pregnancy or explored the relationship between sleep disturbances and maternal and perinatal outcomes.Objective: Our objective was to examine the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration, timing, and continuity (measured via wrist actigraphy) and maternal cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity specific to pregnancy.Study Design: This was a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women. Women were recruited between 16 0/7 and 21 6/7 weeks' gestation. They were asked to wear a wrist actigraphy monitor and complete a daily sleep log for a period of 7 consecutive days. The primary sleep exposure variables were the averages of the following over the total valid nights (minimum 5, maximum 7 nights): short sleep duration during the primary sleep period (<7 h/night), late sleep midpoint (midpoint between sleep onset and sleep offset >5 am), and top quartile of minutes of wake time after sleep onset and sleep fragmentation index. The primary outcomes of interest were a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational diabetes mellitus. We used χ2 tests to assess associations between sleep variables and categorical baseline characteristics. Crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from univariate logistic regression models to characterize the magnitude of the relationship between sleep characteristics and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. For associations significant in univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was used to explore further the association of sleep characteristics with pregnancy outcomes.Results: In all, 901 eligible women consented to participate; 782 submitted valid actigraphy studies. Short sleep duration and a later sleep midpoint were associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.53; and odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.36, respectively) but not of hypertensive disorders. A model with both sleep duration and sleep midpoint as well as their interaction term revealed that while there was no significant interaction between these exposures, the main effects of both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.19; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.97, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting separately for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity, both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint remained associated with gestational diabetes. No associations were demonstrated between the sleep quality measures (wake after sleep onset, sleep fragmentation) and hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a relationship between short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes. Our data suggest independent contributions of these 2 sleep characteristics to the risk for gestational diabetes in nulliparous women.

AB  - Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control.Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ≥130 mg/dL.Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9±0.9 h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r=-0.28, P=.03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1-0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia.Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied.Material and Methods: Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA.Results: At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe β-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%.Conclusion: OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and β-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia and sleep fragmentation. Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to treatment. This review discusses OSA and summarizes the current literature linking OSA with adverse perinatal outcomes.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group. CITATION: Louis JM, Mogos MF, Salemi JL, Redline S, Salihu HM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), cesarean section (CS), low Apgar score (at 5 minutes after delivery), and preeclampsia in pregnant women with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). STUDY DESIGN: Our subjects included 791 women with OSA and 3955 randomly selected women without OSA. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without OSA. RESULTS: Compared with women without OSA, adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia in women with OSA were 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.40), 2.31 (95% CI, 1.77-3.01), 1.34 (95% CI, 1.09-1.66), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.48-2.04), and 1.60 (95% CI, 2.16-11.26), respectively. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with OSA are at increased risk for having LBW, preterm, and SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia, compared with pregnant women without OSA.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has a distinctive pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment compared with that of older children and adults. Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chest wall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associated with failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction for micrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

AB  - Objective: Pregnancy and the obesity epidemic impacting women of reproductive age appear to predispose women to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. The aim of this study is to examine the association between OSA and adverse maternal outcomes in a national cohort.Methods: The National Perinatal Information Center in the US was used to identify women with a delivery discharge diagnosis of OSA from 2010 to 2014. We used the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision to classify OSA diagnosis and maternal outcomes.Measurements: The sample consisted of 1,577,632 gravidas with a rate of OSA of 0.12% (N = 1963). There was a significant association between OSA and preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-2.54), eclampsia (aOR 2.95, 1.08-8.02), and gestational diabetes (aOR 1.51, 1.34-1.72) after adjusting for a comprehensive list of covariates which includes maternal obesity. OSA status was also associated with a 2.5-3.5-fold increase in risk of severe complications such as cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer (5.1 + 5.6 vs 3.0 + 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and odds of an admission to an intensive care unit higher (aOR 2.74, 2.36-3.18) in women with OSA.Conclusions: Compared to pregnant women without OSA, pregnant women with OSA have a significantly higher risk of pregnancy-specific complications such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes, and rare medical and surgical complications such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. OSA diagnosis was also associated with a longer hospital stay and significantly increased odds for admission to the intensive care unit.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the predictive ability of current obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening tools and the individual questions in these tools at identifying pregnant women who have OSA.Methods: A total of 293 third-trimester patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2012, and 248 patients had sleep monitor results. Recruited participants completed a questionnaire consisting of six OSA screening tools and overnight portable sleep monitoring. Predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA compared with results of the diagnosis from overnight sleep monitoring was estimated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves.Results: Two hundred eighteen (88%) of the patients were OSA-negative, and 30 patients (12%) were OSA-positive based on sleep monitoring results. Compared with OSA-negative patients, OSA-positive patients had greater body mass indices and neck circumferences as well as significantly higher rates of hypertension (chronic and gestational), pregestational diabetes mellitus, asthma, and preeclampsia. The overall predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA was modest (area under receiver operating characteristic curves 0.62-0.695). However, individual components of the questionnaire were strongly associated with OSA.Conclusion: We found that none of the studied OSA screening tools accurately detected OSA in pregnant women in the third trimester. We have identified proposed elements of a new screening tool based on promising components from several tools that may more accurately detect patients with OSA.Level Of Evidence: II.

AB  - Objective:We sought to ascertain the validity of two screening scales for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy and to establish the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy.Study Design:In this prospective observational study, two screening scales were administered. Screen positive subjects were referred for diagnostic polysomnography (PSG); if admitted for antepartum care, screen positive subjects underwent a modified study with a type 3 device (T3D).Result:A total of 1509 subjects underwent OSA screening; 58 completed diagnostic testing. Neither measure was a reliable diagnostic tool for OSA as determined by T3D or PSG (detection rates of 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively). Among screen positive subjects undergoing PSG or T3D testing, 15.5% ultimately met 'gold standard' OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point prevalence of 4.9%.Conclusion:In this prospective trial, screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire or Epworth sleepiness scale was poorly predictive of OSA among gravidae and was associated with a high false referral rate.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with adverse fetal outcomes in some studies. Second trimester Down syndrome screening markers reflect fetal and fetoplacental wellbeing. We aimed to compare markers of fetal and feto-placental wellbeing in women with OSA and low risk controls.Methods: A retrospective case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and available second trimester markers was performed. Controls were screened for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) at the time of delivery using a questionnaire. Women at low risk for OSA were selected. Marker levels were adjusted for gestational age and race and reported as multiples of median and later adjusted for body mass index (BMI).Results: Twenty-four OSA cases and 166 controls were identified. Women with OSA had a higher mean BMI when compared to controls (37.1 ± 12.7 versus 24.1 ± 5.1, p = 0.03). Estriol (uE3) multiples of the median (MoM) levels were lower in women with OSA compared to controls, even after adjusting for BMI, 0.74 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.45) versus 1.06 (IQR 0.38), respectively, p = 0.026. Once adjusted for BMI, alpha feto-protein (AFP) MoM levels were no longer significantly different in women with OSA compared to controls.Conclusion: OSA is associated with reduced serum uE3 levels, independently of BMI, possibly indicating fetal distress.

AB  - We employed accepted, validated symptom-based screening measures to discern attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to adverse pregnancy outcomes, taking into account potential maternal confounders. Commonly employed OSA screening measures (Berlin and Epworth scales) were performed in the second and third trimesters; maternal and neonatal outcome data were thereafter obtained. The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) strata (8.9%, 46%; p<0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently performed. Among nonobese (BMI <30) gravidae, frequency of preeclampsia was significantly higher among women with OSA (adjusted odds ratio=6.58, 95% confidence interval=1.04, 38.51; p=0.035). Among the obese (BMI ≤30) gravidae, infant birth weight ratio (or birth weight by gestational age) was higher with OSA + screening than OSA --(1.099 versus 1.035; p=0.04), and this association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (p=0.05). OSA prevalence increases significantly among obese gravidae, raising concerns for the overall validity of commonly employed screening measures in pregnancy. Nevertheless, OSA status continues to exert an independent influence, as obese and nonobese gravidae are at increased risk for a limited number of adverse perinatal outcomes in multivariate models.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The evidence of a putative causal effect of sleep apnea-induced intermittent hypoxia on the pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is mounting. The present review presents the evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Recent Findings: Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea. Summary: An association between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia.

AB  - According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the leading cause of post-neonatal mortality in the United States is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of deaths from SIDS, education is still vital. Parents and other caregivers need to understand what a safe sleep environment looks like. In addition, information on other factors that put babies at risk for SIDS must be emphasized, such as smoking during pregnancy. In this issue of Patient Education Management, we explore the issues pertaining to SIDS and discuss where education is needed and the information more parents need to know.

AB  - Ontogeny of arousal data constitute a vital supplement to the sparse literature on spontaneous neuronal activity. These data demonstrate that measurable infant spontaneous arousals (SAs) with an inherent oscillatory entrainment occur six times more in active sleep than in quiet sleep of the same duration and are identifiable as a human neurobiologic function. These SAs are not significantly associated with race or ethnicity, gender, total hours spent sleeping, percent time spent in active or quiet sleep, preterm status, history of a life-threatening event, having had a sibling who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or having had a mother who smoked during this pregnancy. As measurable neurophysiologic events, SAs establish parameters for research at molecular and molar levels focusing on several critical areas: (1) the neuronal control of SA related to neurotransmitters, (2) as a significant antecedent factor in clinical cardiorespiratory events occurring in infants at high epidemiologic risk for SIDS; (3) as a regulatory biologic factor underlying temperament and executive cognitive functioning, and (4) morbidity and mortality effects possibly related to therapeutic interventions that alter SA levels.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zürich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano).Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels <35 µg/l or hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dl were included in the study. RLS was graded according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Study Group rating scale. All participants had a score of ≥20 or had RLS ≥3 times/week. Based on the Hb levels, 500 or 700 mg of FCM was administered over 20 min. The primary end point was a ≥ 50% reduction in the mean IRLS score one week after FCM infusion. The secondary end points included periodic limb movements (PLMs; assessed using nocturnal foot actigraphy), sleep quality (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and safety.Results: The IRLS score decreased from 23 ± 7 (baseline) to 13 ± 7 (P <0.01), whereas the PLM index decreased from 35 ± 26 (baseline) to 25 ± 20 (P <0.001). Significant improvement in sleep quality was also reported (P <0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to treatment.Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is warranted.

AB  - Background and Aim: Neonatal opioid use for pain management and therapeutic sedation may contribute to untoward patterns of brain function, or change rhythmic cycles that form the basis for sleep structure. This study aimed to: 1) describe differences in pattern characteristics of limited channel EEG, and 2) evaluate changes in brain wave signal variability with quantification of cyclicity by spectral density distribution before and after standard morphine administration.Method: This within-subject naturalistic experiment acquired EEG data by limited channel amplitude-integrated (aEEG) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Participants were recruited in two phases: 1) medically stable (n=16, 28-32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) and 2) critically ill receiving morphine for pain or sedation (n=9, 26-39 weeks PMA). The first phase established feasibility, the second employed aEEG to describe brain function before and after opioid administration. Amplitude-integrated EEG signal was quantified by measures of bandwidth voltage, lower border voltage, and variance of each with two simple quantitative measures of peak counts 10 microV above baseline, and proportion of time below 10 microV. Further analysis presented frequency changes across time to describe morphine effect on EEG spectral measures in younger infants who received morphine in the NICU.Results: Less mature infants had higher peak counts and more time at low voltage within epoch: median peak counts 3.625 (SD1.740), median proportion less than 10 microV 22% (SD 0.200). Except for spectral edge frequency (SEF50), morphine effect did not emerge until focused analysis included mini-bands (2Hz) of spectral power. Moreover, the log transformed 'mini-band' of 14-16 Hz showed a significant difference in mean rank (n=9, chi 2 = 5.444, df=1, p<.020) between 15 minutes prior and 60 minutes after the dose. Younger infants demonstrated high power in lower frequency (delta) bands. Among older infants, shifts within the spectrum after morphine administration were observed from high frequency bands toward lower frequencies.Conclusion: Description of brain function patterns is quantifiable. Although morphine effects may be masked by the heavy presence of power in the delta range early in gestation, exploration of spectral densities offers a framework for understanding shifts of spectral frequencies in premature infant brain function.

AB  - Background: Among the various factors that may influence the pharmacological response to opioids, genetic polymorphisms [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)] have generated some interest.Objectives: To examine the influence on morphine dose requirements and adverse events in the postoperative period of four SNP [opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) ex-21 and ex-26, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] in candidate genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.Design: A single centre prospective study.Setting: University Hospital, Paris, France, from 2 January 2007 to 15 November 2011.Patients: A total of 438 white adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery (spine, hip and knee) under general anaesthesia. The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive dysfunction.Interventions: Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 Met (rs4680)] were analysed.Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for 24 h.Main Outcome Measures: The dose of morphine required to achieve pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine 3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the proportion of morphine-related adverse events.Results: A total of 404 patients completed the study to final analysis. The mean ± SD morphine dose to achieve pain relief was 15.8 ± 8.8 mg in the PACU and 22.7 ± 18.6 mg during patient-controlled intravenous administration. Morphine-related adverse events were observed in 37%. There was no relationship between any genetic polymorphisms and morphine dose, morphine 3-gluguronide and morphine 6-glucuronide concentration, morphine-related adverse events or pain level. In the PACU only, P-glycoprotein polymorphisms (ex-21; ex-26) were significantly associated with morphine concentration but the prediction of the model was poor (R = 0.04) CONCLUSION: No major relationship has been demonstrated between SNP of OPRM1, ABCB1, COMT and morphine requirement, pain level or adverse effects in the postoperative period.Trial Registration: NCT00822549 (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

AB  - Organic anion and cation transporters (OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs) mediate the proximal tubular secretion of numerous clinically important compounds, including various commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. Here, we report determination of the ontogeny of these transporters and of NaP(i)2 and SGLT1, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to determine expression levels of transporter genes in rat embryonic kidneys on each day of gestation from embryonic day (ed) 13 to ed18, in cultures of induced and uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (MM), and on each day of 1 week of whole embryonic kidney (WEK) culture. We also examined ontogeny of Oat1 protein expression in rat embryonic kidney by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we used uptake of fluorescein (FL) as a novel in vitro functional assay of OAT expression in WEK and MM. Developmental induction of OAT and OCT genes does not occur uniformly: some genes are induced early (e.g., Oat1 and Oat3, potential early markers of proximal tubulogenesis), and others after kidney development is relatively advanced (e.g., Oct1, a potential marker of terminal differentiation). The ontogeny of transporter genes in WEK and MM is similar to that observed in vivo, indicating that these organ culture systems may represent convenient in vitro models to study the developmental induction of OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs. Functional transport was evidenced by accumulation of FL in the developing tubule in WEK and MM organ cultures. Our findings on the renal ontogeny of OATs and OCTs could carry implications both for the development of more rational therapeutics for premature infants, as well as for our understanding of proximal tubule differentiation.

AB  - Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction, usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors.

AB  - Abstract The development of synaptic connections in the foetus' brain peaks during the third trimester of gestation. In case of preterm birth, the infant is vulnerable in the neonatal intensive care unit because of its immature and rapidly developing neurologic system. Therefore, developmental care interventions (DCI) are particularly important during the NICU hospitalization to optimize short and long-term outcomes, as well as neurodevelopment, in infants born prematurely. The aim of this article is to provide a narrative overview by summarizing findings of a thorough literature review on the latest findings regarding the effectiveness of six DCI on preterm infant's outcomes such as sleep, stress and neurodevelopment. Various DCI have been evaluated in empirical studies. Research related to these interventions is rapidly evolving but is still a priority in the neonatal research field.

AB  - Background: The objective of our study was to determine demographic characteristics, health and sexual behaviors, and psychological health associated with pregnancy ambivalence. We used a cross-sectional design for our study. Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August 2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent females. Results: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger ( p=0.03), had fewer children living at home ( p<0.01), and were less likely to have been previously pregnant ( p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more likely to smoke ( p<0.01), sleep poorly ( p=0.02), have had more sexual partners in the past month ( p<0.01) and in their lifetime ( p=0.01), not used contraception at last sex ( p=0.01), be a victim of violence ( p=0.01), and have experienced pregnancy coercion ( p<0.01). In addition, these women exhibited higher scores on scales measuring depressive symptoms ( p=0.01) and perceived stress ( p<0.01). Conclusions: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive education through contraceptive counseling.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adopted children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications. METHODS: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder--not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3-2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. METHODS: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

AB  - Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is a musculoskeletal condition that affects 20% of gravid women. Pelvic girdle pain can have a marked impact on an individual's quality of life, sleep and functional activities, and can result in absenteeism from work. Part 1 of this paper presented the quantitative results of a mixed-methods service evaluation of the introduction of a manual therapy approach to usual care. There is a paucity of literature on patients' experience of receiving manual therapy for PGP during pregnancy. Therefore, the second aim of the service evaluation was to gain an insight into women's experiences of manual therapy treatment for PGP. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with seven women who had received manual therapy, and thematic framework analysis was applied to the data. Qualitative analysis revealed five distinct themes: living with PGP; practicalities of entering the physiotherapy system; patient expectation pre-treatment; response to manual therapy; and relationship with physiotherapist. Overall, women reported reduced pain and improved function after receiving manual therapy alongside usual care.

AB  - Objectives To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m, p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ≥10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes and less mental well-being. In pregnant women with a mental disorder, who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients and healthy controls during pregnancy. METHODS: This observational study was embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status. RESULTS: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted [beta] = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.03-0.53, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

AB  - Background: In low-resource settings, a significant proportion of fetal, neonatal, and maternal deaths can be attributed to intrapartum-related complications. Certain risk factors, such as non-cephalic presentation, have a particularly high risk of complications. This qualitative study describes experiences around non-cephalic births and highlights existing perceptions and care-seeking behavior specific to non-cephalic presentation in rural Sarlahi District, Nepal.Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 34 individuals, including women who recently gave birth to a non-cephalic infant and female decision-makers in their households. We also conducted two focus groups with mothers (have two or more children, with at least one child under age five) and two focus groups with grandmothers in the community.Results: Several women described scenes of obstructed labor and practices like provision of unspecified injections early in labor to assist with the delivery. There were reports of arduous care-seeking processes from primary health centers to tertiary facilities, and mixed quality of care among home birth attendants and facility-based health workers respectively. Very few women were aware of the fetal presentation prior to delivery, and we identified no consistent understanding among participants of the risks of and care strategies for non-cephalic births. Risk perception around non-cephalic presentation varied widely. Some participants were acutely aware of potential dangers, while others had not heard of non-cephalic birth. Many interviewees said that the position in which a pregnant woman sleeps could impact the fetal position. Several participants had either taken or heard of medication intended to rotate the fetus into the correct position.Conclusions: Our findings suggest the mixed quality of and access to care associated with non-cephalic birth and a lack of consistent understanding of the risk of and care for non-cephalic births in rural Nepal. The high risk of the condition and the recommended tertiary care present a dilemma in low-resource settings; the logistical difficulties and the mixed quality of care make care-seeking and referral decisions complex. While public health stakeholders strive to improve the quality of and access to the formal health system, those players must also be sensitive to the potential negative implications of promoting institutional care-seeking.

AB  - Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding depressed pregnant women’s perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 ± 6.8; n = 1032) included pregnant women ≥8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey, depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P < .001) and stress (P < .001) and had poorer sleep quality (P < .001), mindfulness (P < .001), and social support (P < .001) compared to nondepressed pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

AB  - Having the right care is essential for the wellbeing of all people with diabetes. There is a minimum level of health care that every person with diabetes should expect. In 2010, Diabetes UK produced a list of 15 essential checks and services that people with diabetes should expect to receive. We wanted to assess whether we were adequately achieving all of these targets in our own diabetes service and assess whether the targets were themselves adequate and appropriate. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 200 randomly selected patients attending the diabetes review clinic in a district general hospital. We recorded whether the parameters outlined in the Diabetes UK '15 health care essentials' had been achieved in the last 12 months and then collated the data. The data showed that we scored well in terms of monitoring HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, retinal screening and cholesterol. However, we scored sub-optimally in terms of the following parameters: smoking cessation, pregnancy planning, structured education, measurement of waist circumference and psychological assessment. In conclusion, the Diabetes UK 'essentials' checklist may be viewed as mechanistic, but it provides a useful starting point to assess the effectiveness of a diabetes service in providing the basics of patient care in much the same way as the WHO surgical checklist reduces adverse outcomes. We have been able to see where the deficiencies in our own service lie and have made amends to ensure that these areas are covered in future. One issue that arose is that there are certain other 'essentials' that would be good to include in such a checklist, such as: erectile dysfunction (as suggested by the NICE guidelines), obstructive sleep apnoea, vitamin D deficiency, neuropathy screening and monitoring of liver function to rule out incipient steatohepatitis/fatty liver disease.

AB  - This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I2 = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I2 = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (≤20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.56; I2 = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed. Registration: PROSPERO registration CRD42015025848.

AB  - Background: This study assessed potential early-life factors and their interrelationships with obesity among young Canadian children.Methods: Data from a nationally representative sample of children aged 6 to 11 years in the Canadian Health Measures Survey were analyzed. The associations of perinatal and early childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity. This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50; 0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth weight, respectively.Conclusions: This study identified multiple perinatal and childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children. Effective prevention strategies targeting four modifiable maternal and child risk factors may reduce childhood obesity by up to 54% in Canada.

AB  - Purpose: A population at great risk is pregnant homeless adolescents and young adult women. Research shows that about 20% of homeless young women become pregnant (Bender, & Thompson, 2007). These pregnant young women are at an increased risk for low birth weight infants and a high infant mortality due to inadequate health care, poor dietary habits, and a knowledge deficit related to maintaining good health during pregnancy and to care of the infant and growing child. A transitional shelter may offer many psychosocial services to assist the women in becoming independent; however, a significant gap exists regarding the medical care of this population. The purpose of this DNP Project was to develop an educational program in a transitional homeless shelter focused on the health care of the pregnant woman and the newborn infant in order to bring awareness of the special needs of this high risk population and to attempt to change unhealthy behaviors. This program was coupled with an In- Service Program for staff members related to Best Practices for the Mother- Infant Dyad. Significance of the project: Knowledge can be empowering and save lives. Through months of interaction and time spent with new mothers in a transitional shelter, the enormous lack of evidence based practices in regards to infant and child care has become evident. This vulnerable population has the highest rate of infant mortality. Education can improve the health outcomes of these women and children. These mothers are eager to learn and want to give their children a chance for a healthy life. They are lacking the information to do so. Methods: The project was implemented in a transitional homeless shelter for women ages 18 to 23 based on a needs assessment. The project implementation contained two parts. Informal education sessions took place with pregnant women and women having recently given birth. 10 Education Intervention Program There were both individual and group sessions. The topics included labor and delivery preparation, diet during pregnancy, care of the newborn, and safety issues related to sleep and feedings. As the infants have grown over the months the sessions have evolved to meet the needs of the growing infant and child. The second part of the project contains a series of learning modules comprising of four hours of narrated lectures and power point presentations developed for the staff. Project Outcomes: The project initiatives were received by all involved wholeheartedly. The project brought to the shelter directors and staff members a new awareness of the crucial need for evidenced based practice in the care of the newborn and mother. Clinical observations have shown a readiness for several of the mothers to follow lessons learned. Significant changes in behaviors related to care of the infant have been observed. A level of trust has developed between the educator and the residents of the shelter. The educator has assumed the role of advocate and mentor. Clinical Relevance: Women head up 90 percent of the families that use shelters. A third of the homeless are women and children, and the numbers are exploding. Through education, advocacy and developing a means of quality health care the lives of these women and children will be made better and healthier. A best practice model for care of the pregnant homeless women and her infant is needed.

AB  - Background: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep.Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep.Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum.Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures.Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and maternal and neonatal morbidities in a cohort of obese gravid women.Methods: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to screen for OSA and describe the possible risk factors for and outcomes of OSA among obese (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2] 30 or higher) pregnant women. Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA.Results: Among 175 women, OSA prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8±12.2 compared with 38.1±7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with 32.4%, P=.02). Maternal complications included maternal death (n=1, amniotic fluid embolus [no OSA group]) and cardiac arrest (n=1, intraoperative at cesarean delivery [OSA group]). One previable birth and two stillbirths occurred in the no OSA group. Among live births, OSA was associated with more frequent cesarean delivery (65.4% compared with 32.8%; P=.003), preeclampsia (42.3% compared with 16.9%; P=.005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (46.1% compared with 17.8%; P=.002). After controlling for BMI, maternal age, and diabetes, OSA (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.3), previous preeclampsia (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.09-7.19), and hypertension (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.67-10.77) were associated with development of preeclampsia.Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea among obese pregnant women is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and cesarean delivery.Level Of Evidence: II.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific perinatal factors are associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. All cases of OSAS were obtained from a tertiary pediatric hospital between April 2013 and April 2016. A total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood OSAS.Results: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68) were significantly associated with OSAS. Exposure of the mother to smoke (aOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.57-4.26) was also associated with an increased risk of childhood OSAS. Mothers aged 35 years and above, performing manual labor, and living in suburban areas significantly increased the risk of childhood OSAS. Multiparous mothers decreased the risk of childhood OSAS (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83). Maternal education, gravidity, prenatal care times, pregnancy-induced hypertension, multiple pregnancies, sex of the child and birth weight were not significantly associated with OSAS in children.Conclusion: Perinatal risk factors are important for predicting childhood OSAS. Our findings provide evidence regarding several potentially useful factors for recognizing OSAS in children, which could be important in diagnosis of pediatric OSAS by physicians.

AB  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is unknown during pregnancy, but the syndrome is likely underdiagnosed and rising in frequency along with the obesity epidemic. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse outcomes, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm, and cesarean delivery. Obese pregnant women should be screened and referred to a sleep medicine specialist for evaluation. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice with demonstrated safety and compliance in pregnancy. Early anesthesia consultation allows for preparation and implementation of a peripartum plan that includes early labor analgesia, avoidance of respiratory depressants, and closer monitoring of oxygenation.

AB  - Background Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy. It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes. Objectives To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Design A longitudinal, prospective cohort design. Setting One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women’s homes. Participants A total of 204 pregnant women. Methods First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester. Results Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR = 1.04, p < 0.001), if they reported snoring (OR = 6.75, p < 0.001), and if they had elevated depressive symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy (OR = 1.09, p = 0.01). Conclusions Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.

AB  - It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1-7, 2002), and Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1-3):163-173, 2009)) compared to women who were not pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395-400, 2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women ( n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant ( n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants' responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) ( N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) ( N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.

AB  - Background: Detailed associations between physical activity (PA) subcomponents, sedentary time, and body composition in preschoolers remain unclear. Objective: We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration. Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine whether they were independently related to adiposity. Results: VPA was the only intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity [P < 0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P ≥ 0.077). No associations were shown between-the lime spent sedentary and body composition (P ≥ 0.11). Conclusions: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate-intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity. These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit from prioritizing VPA.

AB  - Background: Physiological structure and hormonal changes in women during pregnancy may alter physical activity behavior and sleep quality, both of which are factors that influence the method of fetal delivery. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships between physical activity, sleep quality, and unplanned cesarean section. Methods: This study employed a prospective and descriptive correlational design. A total of 184 pregnant women in their third trimester at 2 medical centers participated in the study. A 3-day physical activity scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate, respectively, physical activity-related energy expenditures and sleep quality. Results: Subjects had a comparatively low level of energy expenditure on physical activity and performed a lower than normal amount of moderate-to-heavy physical activity. Three-quarters (77.2%) of subjects had poor sleep quality, and 40.7% reported being unsatisfied with their sleep quality. The main cause of poor sleep quality was sleep disturbance. Using logistic regression, results indicated that the odds of undergoing cesarean section increased to 1.22 (95% CI =1.01 -- 1.48) when sleep quality was 'poor'. By contrast, odds decreased to 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 -- 0.97) when physical activity energy expenditures rose. Conclusions / Implications for practice: Results support the need to obtain physical activity and sleep quality data on women during pregnancy. Appropriate assistance and health education are important during perinatal care to reduce the incidence of unplanned cesarean sections.

AB  - Aims: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with placenta-mediated adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed at comparing placenta-secreted proteins, such as first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers which have been linked to preeclampsia, and markers of angiogenesis in pregnant women with OSA, and pregnant controls at low risk for OSA. Methods: A case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and controls at low risk for OSA was performed. Levels of first and second trimester markers were reported as multiple of median (MoM), and adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Stored samples were tested for markers of angiogenesis and adjusted for gestational age, BMI, and chronic hypertension. Results: A total of 24 women with OSA and 166 controls had screening markers. BMI was higher in cases compared to controls, P=0.01. MoM levels of placenta associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were significantly lower in cases versus controls, even after adjusting for BMI (0.52 IQR 0.48 vs. 1.01 IQR 0.63, P=0.009). The ratio of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 to placental growth factor was significantly higher in cases than controls, even after adjusting for confounders (4.42 IQR 2.52 vs. 2.93 IQR 2.01, P=0.009). Conclusion: Circulating placenta-secreted glycoproteins and markers of angiogenesis are altered in pregnant women with OSA.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women.Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates.Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women.Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression.
