N2  - Acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy (AASN) is a rare neuropathy characterized by acute autonomic dysfunction and objective sensory disturbances. A 26-year-old pregnant woman with severe autonomic and sensory dysfunction is reported. This patient suddenly developed marked nausea and vomiting in about 2 days after having a sore throat. She then developed signs of autonomic dysfunction including dilated non-reactive pupils, dryness of the eyes and oral mucous membranes, generalized anhidrosis, paralytic ileus, orthostatic hypotension, and continuous tachycardia. She also had severe generalized sensory impairments of all modalities, and all deep tendon reflexes were absent. Sensation was almost totally lost for all modalities below the neck. There was marked pseudoathetosis and sensory ataxia in all extremities. Motor examination was normal. She had inability to urinate. At this time she was 38 weeks pregnant, and when she showed signs of fetal distress, a Caesarean section was performed. Albumino-cytological dissociation was seen in the CSF. Serum noradrenalin was reduced, no sensory nerve action potentials could be elicited, and reduced coefficient of variation of the R-R interval on electrocardiography was observed. Plasma exchange was performed every other day for 3 days for about 3 weeks after the onset of the illness, but no favorable effects. Seven months after the onset, her autonomic dysfunction slightly improved, but there was no recovery from the sensory disturbances. Many symptoms and signs that characterize AASN occurred in this patient, and each was severe. The patient developed SIADH, sleep apnea, personality change, and amenorrhea in the course of the disease. We suggest that AASN patients might have both peripheral and central nervous system manifestations including seizures and personality changes.

N2  - A link between prenatal malnutrition and hypertension in human populations has recently been proposed. Rat models of prenatal malnutrition have provided major support for this theory on the basis of tail-cuff measurements. However, this technique requires restraint and elevated temperature, both potential sources of stress. To determine the effect of prenatal protein malnutrition on blood pressure under nonstress conditions, 24-hour radiotelemetric measurements were taken in the home cage. Male rats born to dams fed a 6% casein diet for 5 weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy were studied in early adulthood (from 96 days of age). During the waking phase of their cycle but not the sleep phase, prenatal malnutrition gave rise to small but significant elevations of diastolic blood pressure and heart rate compared with well-nourished controls. Direct effects of stress on blood pressure responses were determined in a second experiment using an olfactory stressor. Prenatally malnourished rats showed a greater increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures compared with well-nourished controls during the first exposure to ammonia. A different pattern of change of cardiovascular responses was also observed during subsequent presentations of the stressor. These findings of a small baseline increase in diastolic pressure consequent to prenatal malnutrition, but an augmented elevation of both systolic and diastolic pressures after first exposure to stress, suggest the need to reevaluate interpretation of the large elevations in blood pressure previously observed in malnourished animals using the stressful tail-cuff procedure.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring holds great promise as a useful tool in the management of hypertensive pregnancies and pregnancies considered 'at risk' for development of preeclampsia. The purpose of this study was to define ambulatory blood pressure monitoring parameters throughout normal pregnancy, including women considered at risk for development of hypertension who continued to have a completely normal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred seventy-six 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring studies were made cross-sectionally with use of a Spacelabs 90207 device (validated for use in pregnancy), at one or more of 9 to 17, 18 to 22, 26 to 30, and >30 weeks' gestation. Upper limits of normal were defined as the mean plus 2 SDs for awake and sleep ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results at each stage. RESULTS: Average awake upper limits of normal were 130/77, 132/79, 133/81, and 135/86 mm Hg at the four stages of pregnancy, respectively. Systolic blood pressure fell significantly by 12% to 14% (p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure by 18% to 19% (p < 0.0001) during sleep at all stages of pregnancy. Awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring systolic measurements were 11 to 12 mm Hg higher than 'clinic' measurements (p < 0.001) and diastolic measurements were 5 to 11 mm Hg higher (p < 0.0001) throughout pregnancy. Maximum blood pressure variability ranged from 8 to 13 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The upper limits of normal ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived measurements rise slightly as pregnancy progresses. Awake measurements are higher than 'clinic' measurements recorded under relaxed conditions by a clinical researcher. The diurnal blood pressure fall and variabilities are similar during pregnancy to those seen in nonpregnant subjects. These data should provide valuable references for further studies of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in high risk pregnancies.

N2  - Parturition is a multifactorial physiological process that involves multiple interconnected positive feedforward and negative feedback loops. Each of these loops is connected to others in a carefully time-regulated fashion. When parturition occurs normally, both fetal and maternal processes are involved. Recent research in pregnant sheep and nonhuman primates shows clearly that the fetus determines the duration of gestation and the mother determines the time of day at which labor begins. The fetal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a fundamental role in stimulating increased estrogen production in late gestation. Estrogen then activates maternal circadian rhythms that increase oxytocin secretion. As a result, uterine contraction patterns are switched from contractures to contractions.

N2  - Dyspnea is so common during pregnancy that it is often referred to as 'physiologic' dyspnea. Generally this dyspnea occurs with exercise rather than at rest, but it is not a cause of significant exercise limitation. Although the mechanical impediment of the gravid uterus is often blamed, hyperventilation due to increased progesterone levels probably is the most important mechanism. It is essential to distinguish this physiologic dyspnea from breathlessness caused by disorders complicating pregnancy or diseases that may coexist with pregnancy. Sleep-disordered breathing is a much less studied phenomenon. Obstructive sleep apnea probably occurs in 1.5 to 2% of the population of child-bearing age. Only few data are available suggesting that pregnancy may cause or exacerbate this disorder, and most cases may simply represent the coexistence of two common conditions. Pregnancy does not appear to cause central sleep apnea. Since hypoxemia can cause intrauterine growth retardation and adverse fetal outcome, sleep-disordered breathing should be treated when of significant degree.

N2  - The possible effects of a wide range of sociodemographic and environmental factors on the incidence and distribution of petechiae were investigated in 485 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases from the New Zealand Cot Death Study. The number (nil, few, many) of macroscopic petechial hemorrhages in the visceral pleura, capsule of thymus, and epicardium was recorded in 458 of 474 autopsied SIDS cases. Other information was obtained from parental interview and obstetric records. Univariate analysis showed highly significant relationships (P < or = 0.005) between the frequency of petechiae at one or more sites and socioeconomic status, parity, breast feeding, age at death, time of death, sleep position, and head covering at death and lesser but significant relationships (P < or = 0.05) with Maori ethnicity, birth weight, gestation, pacifier use, and bed sharing. After multivariate analysis, significant associations remained between increased frequencies of thymic petechiae and parity (P = 0.0001), age at death (P = 0.0003), Maori ethnicity (P = 0.0019), pacifier use (P = 0.0001), and head covering at death (P = 0.0032); between increased frequencies of epicardial petechiae and head covering at death (P = 0.008) and an estimated time of death between 00:00 and 05:59 h (P = 0.056); and between increased frequencies of pleural petechiae and maternal smoking (P = 0.058) and parity (P = 0.022). There was a decreased frequency of pleural petechiae in infants placed prone for their final sleep (P = 0.058). The distribution and frequency of petechiae are affected by environmental factors, including known risk factors for SIDS, but these factors occur inconsistently across the three sites. The findings imply differences in the pathogenesis at each site but do not provide consistent support for previous theories of causation of petechiae.

N2  - It has previously been reported that active glottic adduction is present during prolonged apneas but absent during periods of breathing movements in fetal lambs in utero. The present study was aimed at examining the precise coordination between fetal breathing movements [diaphragm electromyographic (EMG) activity (Di EMG)] and glottic adduction [thyroarytenoid muscle EMG activity (TA EMG)]. Electrodes for electroencephalogram, eye movements, TA EMG, and Di EMG and an arterial catheter were surgically implanted in fetal lambs 123-142 days postconception. Polygraphic recordings were performed without sedation while the ewe breathed room air (n = 11) or various gas mixtures (hypoxia, n = 5; hyperoxia, n = 4; hypercapnia, n = 5; hypercapnia+hyperoxia, n = 5). Tonic TA EMG was observed throughout >90% of apneas (>6 s) in both non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep, and when Di EMG frequency decreased in rapid-eye-movement sleep. In all but two fetuses, TA EMG was immediately inhibited when Di EMG appeared. Altering blood gases did not modify these results. In conclusion, Di EMG and TA EMG are well coordinated in late gestation in fetal lambs, except in a few cases. These findings may have consequences for understanding the pathogenesis of mixed/obstructive apneas of prematurity.

N2  - A kinetic parameter (the V(m)/K(m) ratio), an index of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase catalytic efficiency, was studied in 36 women with normal pregnancies at 16-20 weeks' gestation. On each blood sample, determinations were achieved on enzyme extracted from maternal granulocytes by monitoring the phosphohydrolytic activity at 400 nm on a spectrophotometer equipped with software for computation of kinetic parameters. Infant sex was recorded at the delivery for all women included in this study. The recent introduction of NAP as a marker for some pathological pregnancies requires a better knowledge of the behaviour of that enzyme in physiological conditions. Data reported focus attention on fetal sex. It appears to be one of the factors involved in variations of kinetic parameters observed in maternal NAP. Sex-linked differences in placental maturation could explain these results.

N2  - Sleep log study, which was designed to study sleep characteristics by questionnaire, was performed on 172 pregnant women about the relationship between their pregnancy and their night sleep. Sleep behavior by sleep log revealed that they woke more frequently during the course of their pregnancy and that their total sleep time decreased gradually toward the end of their pregnancy. According to their subjective evaluations, these shortages of night sleep could not be made up with the morning naps in the multiparas as was the case of the primiparas. These changes in sleep characteristics have been studied from biological, psychological and social factors view points.

N2  - We studied basic sleep changes in pregnant rats in order to understand how pregnancy alters sleep. In the rat, pregnancy increased nocturnal nonREM sleep across the entire period but increased REM sleep only in the early period. By the end of pregnancy, diurnal sleep was decreased, showing that pregnancy in rats causes biphasic sleep changes as it does in humans. Termination of pregnancy returned the enhanced sleep to baseline as in the estrous cycle. Therefore, significant changes in the pattern of sleep occurred during pregnancy in rats, suggesting that the animal model may contribute to understanding the mechanism of sleep disorders related to human pregnancy.

N2  - The diurnal change ill baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) of four anencephalic fetuses at 20, 23, 24 and 30 weeks of gestation were examined. The mean baseline FHR in 00.00-06.00 h, 06.00-12.00 h, 12.00-18.00 h and 18.00-24.00 h were compared by one-factor ANOVA and Scheffe's test in each case. The diurnal variations in baseline FHR were recognized in all subjects (P < 0.01). In 3/4 subjects, the lowest values were at 00.00-06.00 h. The diurnal variation in baseline FHR might be caused by maternal factors because it was present even in the anencephalic fetuses that had no central nervous system having the oscillators of the circadian rhythm.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To characterise the relationship between breast cancer and different aspects of the reproductive life, use of drugs and alcohol by family history of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the cancer registry of Girona, Spain, 330 women were identified with histologically confirmed breast cancer during 1986-1989. For each case, a control woman was selected from a random sample of the population living in the matched area to the case by age (+/- 5 yr.). The information was collected by a personal interview and included: family history of breast cancer, reproductive history, presence of acne during the teenage years, use of oral contraceptives and drugs for sleep and anxiety disorders, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: 18.5% of breast cancer cases and 8.9% of all controls had a family history of breast cancer. Family history on a first degree relative (mother or sister) was present in 10.6% of the cases and 2.8% of controls, which represented an odds ratio for breast cancer of 3.7 (95% CI, 1.8-7.8) higher than the general population. Women with a first degree family history of breast cancer were at higher risk for breast cancer if they had a history of acne during the teenage period (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2) and if they referred long menstrual periods in the early years of menarche (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.0). Women with no family history had a higher breast cancer risk if they had a late menarche, long menstrual periods, late first full term pregnancy, and history of acne during puberty. Alcohol consumption and use of drugs for anxiety and sleep disorders were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: First degree family history of breast cancer seems to be the best risk indicator for developing breast cancer. Long menstrual periods and presence of acne during puberty may indicate hormonal imbalance that act independently of the family history in breast cancer development.

N2  - To test for the presence in utero of diurnal periodicity in the amount of time spent in organized behavioral states, seven records of 24-hour duration were obtained from each of five chronically instrumented fetal baboons between 144 and 158 days gestation (term = 175 days). Concordance of fetal breathing activity, heart-period variability, and electroencephalographic parameters were used to define two distinctive patterns of fetal physiological activities. One pattern was characterized as EEG activity dominated by tracé alternant, reduced heart-period variability, and fewer breaths in epochs of fetal breathing. This fetal behavioral state (1FB) is analogous to quiet sleep in infants. A second pattern was characterized by the relative absence of tracé alternant, increased heart-period variability, and fetal breathing activity. This fetal behavioral state (2FB) is analogous to active sleep. Cycles of these states were present 29% of time, with a duration of approximately 26 minutes and a 1.7:1 predominance of 2FB/1FB. Cosinor analysis across fetuses revealed a significant (p < .01) 24-hour periodicity of the time spent by the fetus in organized behavioral states, with a peak around 1400 (lights-on 0700 to 1900) and a peak-nadir fluctuation of 15%. These periodicities in the incidence of organized state were significant (p < .01) in three fetuses, and approached significance (< .09) in the two others. Data demonstrate a diurnal rhythmicity in fetal behavioral states, with less time spent in organized state at night than during the day.

In the literature search we didn't find any similar case report. The present view on OSAS treatment with particular regard to the use of nCPAP is also presented. Through reviewing literature we analysed positive effects of this kind of treatment on mother and fetus. The negative aspects of nCPAP treatment are discussed.

N2  - Melatonin, an indole amine, primarily derived from the pineal gland is secreted during the hours of darkness. Melatonin acts as a hormonal transduction of photoperiod influencing the timing of seasonal and daily (circadian) physiological rhythms. Maternal melatonin crosses the placenta and enters the fetal circulation providing photoperiodic information to the fetus influencing the subsequent circadian and seasonal rhythms of the offspring. The function of melatonin in humans is more obscure. However, melatonin has attained prominence as a treatment for disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep patterns which occur as a result of transmeridian travel, shift work or blindness. The biological clock, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), possesses melatonin receptors, in both the adult and fetal human. This concurs with the reported influence of melatonin on human circadian rhythmicity and indicates that this influence may begin in utero. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the human fetus and occur in both central and peripheral tissue from early in fetal development. Thus, the influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to entraining circadian rhythmicity. Considering the transplacental availability of melatonin to the fetus the ingestion of melatonin by pregnant women may be inadvisable.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations periodically occur with uterine contractures during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia in goats. METHODS: In five chronically catheterized goat fetuses at 125-130 days' gestation, incidence of FHR decelerations was compared between 6 hours' control time and 6 hours' induced hypoxemia with two-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test. Three other fetuses were used as controls for circadian rhythm. RESULTS: Fetal PaO2 was significantly decreased from 26.1 to 16.3 mmHg without acidemia. During hypoxemia, 42 decelerations were induced along with 5 initial decelerations during the acute phase hypoxemia. Incidence of decelerations increased significantly from 0.07 ± 0.15 per hour in 6-hour controls to 1.40 ± 0.28 per hour during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia. Short-term variability and long-term variability of the 42 decelerations were significantly increased. These variabilities were also increased during the 5 initial decelerations. Frequency of uterine contractures did not change during hypoxemia. There was an observable association of FHR decelerations with uterine contractures during hypoxemia. CONCLUSION: Fetal heart rate decelerations occurred periodically in association with uterine contractures during induced 6 hours' hypoxemia, which were characterized by slow onset and recovery with increases in variability.

N2  - The present study was conducted in a population living near a recycling plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to determine whether exposures to these substances were occurring and producing adverse health effects. The plant is situated in a suburb of Monterrey, which is the third most populous city in Mexico and the second most industrialized. A cross-sectional study design was used for the investigation, which was carried out from September 1994 to November 1994. Using cluster sampling procedures, homes in two areas were selected-one exposed through proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed to serve as a control-until the desired sample size was achieved (621 individuals, with an average of five per dwelling). A specially trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to an adult member of each family, soliciting data on the presence of acute and chronic infections, complications of pregnancy, and congenital diseases among the family members. One hundred twenty-seven questionnaires were administered in the exposed population, yielding information on 596 individuals. In the unexposed population, 147 questionnaires were administered furnishing data on 743 individuals. The sex and age distributions of the two populations were similar. The unexposed population had a slightly longer average duration of residence. The most common health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, excessive fatigue, skin problems, otitis, and anemia. The exposed population had significantly higher risks for skin eruptions and diseases, excessive fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, otitis, bronchitis, and allergies. Exposed and unexposed women had comparable prevalences of obstetrical problems, spontaneous abortions, congenitally malformed offspring, and low birthweight. The questionnaire used to detect health problems has low sensitivity and may have generated underestimates of some conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis controlled for several different biases, and thus it can be concluded that a positive association exists between environmental exposure to these wastes and increased risk of disease.

N2  - This study investigated the effects of an intervention for polydrug-using adolescent mothers. The program included educational, vocational, and parenting classes; social and drug rehab; and day care for their infants while they attended school half-day. The drug-exposed infants were similar to the nonexposed infants on traditional birth measures, although they had inferior Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale scores, including habituation, orientation, abnormal reflexes, general irritability, and regulatory capacity. The drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly higher. As early as 3 months (following 3 months of intervention), the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in their interactions; by 6 months, they looked similar on virtually every measure. At 12 months, the infants of drug rehab mothers (versus the drug control group) had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric complications. The drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle variables. They demonstrated a lower incidence of continued drug use and repeat pregnancy, and a greater number continued school, received a high school or general equivalency diploma, or were placed in a job. Thus, a relatively cost-effective high school based intervention had positive effects on both adolescent mothers who had used drugs and their infants.

N2  - Increased body temperature (fever or hyperthermia) is a physiological response to many different stimuli. In fact, fever (a 1-4°C elevation of the body temperature) is not only a clinical symptom common to many infectious diseases but also a side effect of immunostimulating or antiviral therapies. Hyperthermic reactions, on the other hand, can be observed after treatment with antipsychotic drugs, 5-hydroxytryptamine-receptor agonists, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and as a reaction to anesthesia. Moreover, hyperthermic reactions can be related to particularly stressful emotional states, to the menstrual ovulatory cycle, and to pregnancy. Transient hyperthermia or fever is also a common consequence of cerebral ischemic events, and it is present during stress as well as intense physical exercise. This review focuses on fever, one of the main components of the systemic acute-phase reaction to external proinflammatory stimuli. Special emphasis is given to neuronal mechanisms of fever induction, in which the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in both control of the febrile response as well as other centrally mediated neurological signs of inflammation, such as increased sleep, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, anorexia, and sickness behavior. This review pays particular attention to the role of proinflammatory cytokines as endogenous pyrogens.

N2  - Fetal bladder volume and hourly fetal urine production (HFUPR) is calculated on the assumption that the fetal bladder is ellipsoid in shape. A recent validation study demonstrated a progressive overestimation at increasing bladder volumes. This may be due to changes in shape of the fetal bladder at increasing volumes. Two independent papers have shown increased HFUPR during fetal behavioural state 1F (S1F) when compared with S2F. The aim of the present study was to assess whether this increase of HFUPR during S1F, previously observed by others, could be the result of an error introduced by the method of volume calculation. A retrospective evaluation was performed in a series of 208 HFUPR measurements in 123 normal near term pregnant women attending a low-risk antenatal clinic. Adequate bladder filling in both states was identified in 43 recordings. Maximum fetal bladder volumes were greater (> 10 ml) during S1F in comparison to S2F in 56% of these recordings and HFUPR was significantly greater during S1F only in these cases. Bladder volumes are usually lower during S2F as a result of fetal voiding, which occurred in association with 22 of 36 transitions from S1F to S2F, and only 1 of 13 transitions from S2F to S1F (P < 0.001). When disregarding calculated bladder volumes in excess of 20 ml for the purpose of calculating HFUPR, eleven recordings remained. HFUPR calculated in this way was significantly lower in comparison to measurements where larger bladder volumes were included and no difference was observed between states. This implies that the differences observed are the result of the greater error in calculating bladder volumes and HFUPR during S1F, where volumes are usually greater and that calculation of fetal bladder volume should not be performed on the assumption that the bladder is ellipsoid in shape. Alternative techniques include limiting measurements to a maximum volume of approximately 20 ml, when the bladder is usually ellipsoid in shape or basing volume calculation on the surface area of a series of sagittal views as suggested by Hedriana and Moore.

N2  - The World Health Organization (WHO), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and the German and Austrian Governments jointly sponsored an international seminar in November of 1996 on the biological effects of low-level radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. For purposes of this seminar, RF fields having frequencies only in the range of about 10 MHz to 300 GHz were considered. This is one of a series of scientific review seminars held under the International Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Project to identify any health hazards from EMF exposure. The scientific literature was reviewed during the seminar and expert working groups formed to provide a status report on possible health effects from exposure to low-level RF fields and identify gaps in knowledge requiring more research to improve health risk assessments. It was concluded that, although hazards from exposure to high-level (thermal) RF fields were established, no known health hazards were associated with exposure to RF sources emitting fields too low to cause a significant temperature rise in tissue. Biological effects from low-level RF exposure were identified needing replication and further study. These included in vitro studies of cell kinetics and proliferation effects, effects on genes, signal transduction effects and alterations in membrane structure and function, and biophysical and biochemical mechanisms for RF field effects. In vivo studies should focus on the potential for cancer promotion, co-promotion and progression, as well as possible synergistic, genotoxic, immunological, and carcinogenic effects associated with chronic low-level RF exposure. Research is needed to determine whether low-level RF exposure causes DNA damage or influences central nervous system function, melatonin synthesis, permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), or reaction to neurotropic drugs. Reported RF-induced changes to eye structure and function should also be investigated. Epidemiological studies should investigate: the use of mobile telephones with hand-held antennae and incidence of various cancers; reports of headache, sleep disturbance, and other subjective effects that may arise from proximity to RF emitters, and laboratory studies should be conducted on people reporting these effects; cohorts with high occupational RF exposure for changes in cancer incidence; adverse pregnancy outcomes in various highly RF exposed occupational groups; and ocular pathologies in mobile telephone users and in highly RF exposed occupational groups. Studies of populations with residential exposure from point sources, such as broadcasting transmitters or mobile telephone base stations have caused widespread health concerns among the public, even though RF exposures are very low. Recent studies that may indicate an increased incidence of cancer in exposed populations should be investigated further.

N2  - Aldosterone concentrations in the plasma of specific-pathogen-free, domestic, short-hair cats given sodium replete diets were measured by a radio-immunoassay. Plasma samples assayed were taken from male and female cats of 8, 12, 17, 20, 26, 29, 40 and > 52 weeks of age, from adult non-pregnant queens, and from queens in the ninth weeks of pregnancy and in the second and fifth week of lactation. Plasma aldosterone concentration was also measured in samples taken four times over a 24 h period (06:00-06:30, 11:00-11:30, 17:00-17:30 and 23:00-23:30) in a group of seven adult male cats. neither age nor sex had a significant effect on the plasma aldosterone concentration. Also, queens had similar aldosterone concentrations in plasma whether they were non-pregnant, pregnant, or lactating. No circadian rhythm was observed in plasma aldosterone concentrations in adult male cats. The plasma aldosterone concentrations of 148 cats (87 males and 61 females, ranging in ages from 8 to > 52 weeks) had a positive skew distribution with a median of 161 pmol l-1. The upper value for plasma aldosterone concentration in healthy domestic cats as defined by the 95 percentile was 700 pmol l-1.

N2  - Studies in both the human and ovine near-term fetus have identified the clustering of physiologic and behavioral parameters into states. In a recent study in the human fetus a considerable decrease was found in fetal urine production during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) compared with REM sleep. Whether this decrease was caused by decreased renal blood flow or changes in urine concentration is not known. This prompted us to investigate the relation between fetal urine production rate and electrocortical activity in the near-term ovine fetus. We hypothesized that in the ovine fetus urine production and renal blood flow during REM [comparable to low voltage electrocortical activity (LV ECoG)] would be lower than during non-REM [(high voltage (HV) ECoG)]. In eight fetal sheep between 123 and 127 d of gestation (term 147 d), ECoG, renal blood flow, urine flow, and urine osmolality were measured continuously for 6 h on 2 consecutive days. Data were analyzed into HV ECoG and LV ECoG whereafter urine flow, urine osmolality, and renal blood flow data were averaged per state. We found no significant differences in urine flow, urine osmolality, or renal blood flow between the two behavioral states in the ovine fetus. Because these data are in sharp contrast to those found in the human fetus, we conclude that the observed dissimilarities in renal responses between the human and sheep fetus add to the already known differences in behavioral states between the two species.

N2  - The objective was to study the impact of birth weight on the relationship between the ambulatory blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion in children and adolescents. The study included 134 healthy children (61 boys), all Caucasians, who were born at term after a normotensive pregnancy. For each subject, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a complete urine collection were simultaneously performed according to the protocols designed. Average ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and the urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, and creatinine were calculated separately for 24-hour, awake, and sleep periods defined by a mini-diary. The excretion rate of sodium during sleep time was positively correlated with ambulatory systolic BP; such a positive relationship was not found for waking hours. Consequently, the impact of birth weight on the relationship between blood pressure and the urinary sodium excretion rate was analyzed during sleeping hours. Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that although current weight was the strongest predictor for the sodium excretion rate during sleep (P<.001), there was also an independent significant direct relationship for birth weight (P<.04) after controlling for age, sex, and the average of systolic BP during sleep. Adjusted for current weight, a significant difference in the regression slopes relating urinary sodium excretion rate and systolic BP during sleep exists between children in the lowest (<3.100 kg) and the highest tertiles (>3.500 kg) of birth weight (P<.02). Differences in sodium excretion rates, adjusted for current weight, between the two extreme tertiles of birth weight became significant at the highest systolic BP (P<.04). The children who had the lowest birth weight tended to excrete less sodium during sleep. The results of the present study show a blunted pressure natriuresis curve in children and adolescents with the lowest birth weight. Whether this abnormal renal sodium handling may be present as an initial or as an intermediate mechanism leading to highest BP values must be assessed in additional studies.

N2  - The vibroacoustic characteristics of sound generated by artificial larynxes may not be the most suitable for fetal stimulation. To examine this, a study was made of the changes in fetal behavior produced by activating a larynx on the mother's abdominal wall in a sample of healthy pregnant women at term compared with a control group in which the larynx was not activated. In every case, the fetus was in a F1 steady state of deep sleep at the time of the test. Eighty percent of the fetuses in the study group entered a state of 4F behavioral agitation after the stimulus, 4% passed to a 2F state of active sleep, and 16% were incapable of coordinating a stable behavioral state. No changes in behavior were observed in the control group in response to the mock stimulus. The sound usually used for fetal stimulation produces an excessive reflex fetal response.

N2  - This study was conducted in Mexico among residents of an area near a recycling plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to find out if these substances produce various adverse health effects in the population that may come in contact with them. The plant is in a municipality close to Monterrey, which is Mexico's third most populous and second most industrialized city. A cross-sectional comparative design was used for the research, which took place from September to November 1994. By means of quota sampling, houses were selected in two areas-one exposed, by virtue of its proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed, which served as a control-until the desired sample size was reached (621 individuals, an average of five per household). In each dwelling, a trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to one of the older family members to gather data on the presence of acute and chronic illnesses, problems during pregnancy, and congenital illnesses among the household members. In the exposed population, 127 questionnaires were completed, providing information on 596 persons; in the unexposed population, data on 743 persons were gathered via 147 questionnaires. The sex and age distributions were similar in the two populations, and the length of residence in their respective area was slightly longer among unexposed individuals. The most frequently reported health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, fatigue, skin problems, ear infections, and anemia. The prevalence ratios for the exposed versus unexposed populations were significant with regard to skin eruptions and other skin diseases, fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, ear infections, bronchitis, and allergies. Women from the two groups did not show significant differences in the prevalence of obstetric problems, miscarriages, or children born with congenital deformities or low birthweight. The sensitivity of the questionnaire used to detect health problems was poor, which could have resulted in an underestimation of some disorders. Nevertheless, various types of information bias were controlled, permitting the conclusion that the exposed population had a greater risk of suffering certain diseases and disorders than the unexposed population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could have adverse consequences on their motor and mental development. DESIGN: A prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom, followed to 18 months of age. SUBJECTS: The children were participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon, with expected date of delivery from April 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992. Questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age and sets of standardized questions on development at 6 and 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Social, communication, fine and gross motor, and total developmental scales based on the Denver Developmental Screening Test at 6 and 18 months. RESULTS: After adjustment for 27 factors using multiple regression, 3 of the 10 scales and subscales significantly distinguished between front and back sleeping position. At 6 months of age, infants put to sleep on their front had a mean score 0.38 SD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.49) higher on the gross motor scale, 0.11 SD (95% CI: 0.00, 0.23) higher in the social skills scale, and a total development score 0.20 SD (95% CI: 0.10, 0.30) higher than those on their backs. These differences were no longer apparent at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in a reduced developmental score at 6 months of age, but this disadvantage appears to be transient. Weighing this against the adverse health effects demonstrated with the prone sleeping position, these results should not change the message of the Back to Sleep Campaign.

N2  - Pregnancy usually induces alterations in maternal sleep patterns: sleepiness is the most common feature during the first three months and is mainly dependent on the central actions of progesterone. Conversely, women often complain of insomnia during late pregnancy. Vigilance states progressively develop during the fetal life. Paradoxical sleep first emerges from the undifferentiated sleep-like state of the fetus, followed by quiet sleep and by short periods of arousal. Paradoxical sleep is most prominent during fetal and early postnatal life. A birth, the neonate losses its fetal circadian sleep pattern and shows prolonged spontaneous wake periods. The sleep pattern then rapidly changes during the third month of postnatal life. At that time, the infant recovers a circadian sleep pattern, displays slow-wave sleep onset, acquires electroencephalographic features similar to those of adult sleep, while paradoxical sleep duration rapidly decreases. This knowledge of sleep alterations during pregnancy and of the development of fetal an neonatal sleep helps to deal with the frequent complaints about and infant's sleep during this period, and to better delineate normal or pathologic changes in sleep patterns.

N2  - Although a relationship between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk has been known for long, there are many contradictions between different studies, and a connection with a biological mechanism has not yet been found. Recently, new details have been revealed about different effects of pregnancy on breast cancer risk. During pregnancy breast cancer risk is strongly reduced, while inversely some years after giving birth the risk is increased. Furthermore, risk is strongly reduced in women whose consecutive births of four or more children occur after short intervals and are terminated before the age of 30. Recently, we have postulated rhythmicity in the occurrence of breast cancer in a subgroup of young women. By analogy with circadian rhythms it may be assumed that circannual rhythms too are influenced by synchronizers and masking effects. In circadian rhythms masking may be by external or internal periodic factors, such as the sleep/wake cycle, meal timing and activity. Over the year pregnancy may be such a periodic factor, with alternation of an empty uterus and one which gradually enlarges as a consequence of a developing fetus. A masking factor is active only as long as present. Therefore the circannual rhythmicity of breast cancer is attenuated or nullified only during pregnancy. After giving birth, the temporal deficit of the rhythmic increase of tumor growth may be restored, leading to a rebound effect expressed as an increased clinical detection of malignancy some years later. When several consecutive pregnancies occur after short intervals the masking effect continues uninterruptedly, accompanied by a strong reduced breast cancer risk. The same biological mechanism may underly the remission during pregnancy in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease. The immune system, crucial in autoimmune disorders, is build up of several constituents which are clearly rhythmic, e.g. the lymphocytes. Masking of one or more of these rhythmicities may lead to disease attenuation, followed by relapses as soon as the masking factor has been eliminated.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify key predictive variables of functional status after childbirth. DESIGN: An investigative survey design. SETTING: Primary health care maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population. All were aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure. Three variables predictive of functional status after childbirth were identified, namely, satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and perceived lack of support following childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Return to full functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery after childbirth. Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion, overload and dysfunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To help women avoid the additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a postnatal support plan. Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of baby care.

N2  - Melatonin is the mammalian fetus's window to periodicity of the outside world. Through melatonin, the fetus "knows" what time of year it is and, in all likelihood, also knows the time of day. The best known function of melatonin during development is to communicate information about photoperiod and thereby adaptively regulate reproductive development. A second likely function of melatonin during development, which may be related to but more widespread than the first, is to entrain the developing circadian pacemaker. Prenatal maternal entrainment occurs in all of the eutherian mammals in which it has been examined, and in Syrian hamsters exogenous melatonin during development causes entrainment. The broader distribution and greater abundance of melatonin receptors during development, relative to mature animals, suggests that developmental effects of melatonin are greater and more diverse. The human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus expresses melatonin binding sites and is therefore likely to be affected by both endogenous and exogenous melatonin with consequences for the prenatal and postnatal expression and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Caution is warranted, not only concerning the use of exogenous melatonin during pregnancy and lactation but also concerning behavior that might disrupt the mother's endogenous melatonin rhythm.

N2  - Substance abuse in women of childbearing age is global public health problem. The most common drugs of abuse are cocaine, diamorphine (heroin) and alcohol. Fetal drug exposure can be identified by maternal history (which is not always reliable), maternal and infant urine toxicology screening, and meconium and infant and maternal hair analysis. The opioids most commonly associated with withdrawal in neonates are diamorphine, morphine and methadone. Neonatal withdrawal or abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurs in 50 to 80% of infants exposed to opioids in utero, usually within the first 24 to 72 hours after birth. Only 5 to 20% of these infants will have sever symptoms and need pharmacotherapy. Signs of withdrawal include effects arising from the central nervous, vasomotor, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. The most serious problems are vomiting and diarrhoea resulting in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, bodyweight loss, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory alkalosis from tachypnoea, and seizures. There are a number of scales that can be used for assessing the need for pharmacotherapy in NAS. The goal of treatment is for the infant to be comfortable and able to sleep between feeds without being deeply sedated. Pharmacological agents used for treating opioid NAS include both opioid and non-opioid drugs. The most commonly used drugs are paregoric, diluted tincture of opium, and phenobarbital (phenobarbitone). Paregoric, a solution of opium alkaloids - morphine and codeine (analgesics), narcotine and papaverine (anti-spasmodics) - is used in doses of 3 to 6 drops every 4 to 6 hours. Tincture of opium alkaloids, for use in the neonate, must be reconstituted (25-fold dilution) by the hospital pharmacy to a concentration of 0.4% to reduce the content of morphine to that in paregoric (0.4 mg/ml). This avoids the adverse effect associated with the presence of other ingredients in paregoric. Phenobarbital is an analgesic and anticonvulsant. It has a prolonged half-life and is especially useful in reducing the hyperactive behaviour associated with NAS. It is important to closely monitor the efficacy of therapy by assessing patient response through the use of objective measures. The psychosocial aspects of drug abuse are important to keep in mind, as the infant continues to be at high risk for neglect, abuse and foster care placement.

N2  - The high rate of progesterone synthesis by the placenta in late gestation exposes the ovine fetus to high concentrations of progesterone and its metabolites that may affect activity of the fetal brain. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inhibiting maternal progesterone synthesis on sleep-wake activity in fetal sheep. Fetal and maternal vascular catheters, a fetal tracheal catheter, and electrodes for recording fetal electrocortical (ECoG), electro-ocular (EOG) and nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity were implanted. At 128-131 days gestation, progesterone production was inhibited by an injection of trilostane (50 mg), a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor. Vehicle solution or progesterone (3 mg h-1) was then infused into the ewe between 6 and 12h after the trilostane treatment. Maternal progesterone concentrations were significantly reduced from 1-24 h after trilostane treatment (P < 0.05) when followed by vehicle infusion. Fetal breathing movements (FBM), EOG, nuchal muscle EMG, and behavioural arousal increased 12 h after trilostane treatment (P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no change in fetal arousal, EOG, EMG or FBM activities when progesterone was infused after the trilostane treatment. These findings show that progesterone can influence fetal behaviour, and indicates that normal progesterone production tonically suppresses arousal, or wakefulness in the fetus.

N2  - We studied 142 preterm infants (mean gestation 31 weeks, mean birthweight 1364 g) fed prospectively varied protein and energy intakes. Infants were grouped as either slow or rapid growers based on rate of weight gain. Rapid growers had increased heart rates (166 vs 160 beats/min), respiratory rates (55.7 vs 53.9 bpm), energy expenditure (64.8 vs 61.6 kcal kg-1 day-1), urinary C-peptide levels (1.59 vs 0.79 ng ml-1) and time in active sleep (78.0 vs 75.2%), and decreased spectral edge frequency in the electroencephalogram (2.96 vs 4.45 Hz) compared to slow growers. We conclude that preterm infants growing at varying rates manifest physiological and behavioral differences, and that these patterns may reflect altered autonomic balance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have been published on postnatal depression (PND) over the last 10 years. A controversy has arisen regarding the specificity of the diagnostic concept. It is based on 2 points: the hormonal environment and the course and recurrence of PND. EEG Sleep studies are also numerous, but this paper presents the first study on EEG sleep profile during PND. METHODS: 24 women suffering from major depression according to RDC were placed in 3 groups: 1) Group A (n =8): PND ; 2) Group B (n = 8): depression with a past history of PND ; 3) Group C (n = 8): depression without a past history of PND. Women were agematched and according to the Hamilton 24 item severity score. Group A patients were delivered within less that 6 months, groups B and C within a minimum of 3 years. None were pregnant or alcoholic, and none were physically ill. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups B and C. Group A was characterised by a significantly longer stage IV sleep. There was also a strong tendency to a shorter stage I sleep and a better quality of sleep (total sleep time and number of awakenings) during PND. DISCUSSION: Our study shows that, even if similar to major depression, specific polysomnographic alteration can be found during post-partum depression. This finding is relevant to the hypothesis of PND's diagnostic specificity. The perfect similarity between groups B and C strengthens this evidence. Nevertheless, the significance of SWS alterations are difficult to explain and additional studies are required. CONCLUSION: The EEG Sleep profile during PND differs from major depression of the same severity. This appears to favour the specificity of the diagnostic concept.

N2  - We performed a questionnaire survey about 42 patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 who were currently alive. Information was obtained on their age, sex, birth weight, gestation, parental consanguinity, other family members affected, age of onset of jaundice, neonatal and postneonatal bilirubin values, neonatal and postneonatal therapy, problems faced with phototherapy, liver transplantation, current growth status, current neurologic status, and the status of hearing. Patients were between 2 months and 21 years of age. There were 18 males and 24 females. Thirty-nine patients had been born at full term gestation and 3 had been preterm. Jaundice was noted on postnatal day 1 in 34%, between days 2 and 4 in 55%, and after day 11 of life in 11% of patients. In the neonatal period bilirubin values (mean +/- SD) were typically 19.8 +/- 4.5 mg/dL. Eighty-six percent of patients had neonatal peak bilirubin values of >20 mg/dL. Parental consanguinity was present in 44% and a history of Gilbert's disease in one parent was present in 10% of patients. Causes of exacerbations of jaundice reported were respiratory infections, febrile illnesses, vaccinations, fasting, surgery, emotional stress, and noncompliance with treatment. Neonatal therapy consisted of exchange transfusion in 28%, phototherapy in 79%, phenobarbitone in 20%, and cholestyramine, albumin, infusions, and plasmapheresis in one case each. The mainstay of postneonatal therapy was home phototherapy for 10 to 16 hours, primarily at night during sleep, using blue lights or a combination of blue and fluorescent lights. Some patients used innovatively designed phototherapy units. Problems reported with phototherapy were decreased effectiveness with age, poor compliance, restriction of activity and play, inability to travel or take vacations, irritation from eye shades, difficulty keeping eye protection on, difficulties in temperature maintenance, tanning of the skin, embarrassment from the need to be nearly nude during phototherapy, and difficulty in procuring phototherapy lamps. Other therapies that had been tried included oral agar, albumin infusions, antioxidants, acupuncture, bilirubin oxidase, calcium infusions, clofibrate, cruciferous vegetables, cholestyramine, chlorpromazine, flumecinol, plasmapheresis, tin mesoporphyrin, ursodeoxycholic acid, and urinary alkalinization. Fifteen children had undergone liver transplantation (5 auxiliary and 10 orthotopic). All 42 patients are reportedly of normal height and weight. Neurodevelopmental status is said to be normal in 77% of patients. Two patients have kernicterus, 4 have cerebellar symptoms, and 1 each has developmental delay, mild intention tremor, and mild speech delay. Hearing was reported to be normal in 94% of patients. The 2 children with hearing loss have conductive loss from otitis media. With home phototherapy prolonged, survival free of neurologic deficits is possible in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, but there are many problems associated with phototherapy. Avoiding exacerbations of jaundice is an important aspect of management. Liver transplantation offers the prospect of cure but its risk versus benefit ratio is undetermined. Hearing loss was absent in the patients surveyed despite prolonged exposure to high bilirubin levels, which suggests that bilirubin may not be as ototoxic as is commonly believed.

N2  - Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone secreted by the lactotroph of the anterior pituitary. Secretion of PRL is regulated negatively by hypothalamic hormone. Dopamine is the major physiologic prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF). PRFs as TRH, VIP and oxytosin have prolactin releasing activity. Prolactin secretion is induced by sleep, stress, sexual intercourse and suckling stimulus. Serum level of PRL is increased by estrogen. Therefore, PRL level is higher in women, especially in the late follicular phase and during pregnancy. Lactation is the major biologic function of PRL in humans and essential to reproduction. Other function of PRL, such as regulation of ovarian function, osmoregulation and immunoregulation is not fully established. Many action of PRL remained to be clarified.

N2  - The general pharmacology of azelnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, was investigated. The results obtained were as follows: Effects on the central nervous system. Sedation was observed in rats and mice treated with azelnidipine at 300 mg/kg p.o.. In mice, except for a decrease in locomotor activity and prolongation of thiopental-induced anesthesia, azelnidipine at 100 mg/kg p.o. neither affected general activity, behavior or reflex, nor did it cause anti-seizure effects or analgesia. In rats, the agent at 100 mg/kg p.o. did not affect body temperature. With regard to spontaneous EEG in rats, azelnidipine at 100 mg/kg p.o. increased the arousal pattern and decreasEd the paradoxical sleep pattern. Effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In anesthetized dogs, azelnidipine at cumulative doses of 0.03, 0.07, and 0.2 mg/kg i.v. lowered blood pressure and increased cardiac output in a dose-dependent manner. A transient increase in the respiration rate and suppression of the pressor response to norepinephrine were observed only after the highest dose. EKG was not affected. The agent at concentrations up to 10-6 g/ml did not affect the contractile force or beat rate of isolated guinea pig right atrium. Effects on smooth muscle. Azelnidipine at a concentration of 10-6 g/ml suppressed the spontaneous movement of isolated rabbit ileum and both pregnant and non-pregnant rat uterus. In the isolated guinea pig trachea, the agent produced no changes in the basal tonus or histamine-induced contraction. At 10-7 g/ml, the agent showed non-specific inhibitions on histamine- and barium chloride-induced contraction of isolated guinea pig ileum. Effects on the digestive system. Azelnidipine induced stimulation of gastric secretion at 1 mg/kg i.d. and inhibition at higher doses of 100 mg/kg i.d.. When administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. in mice, the agent inhibited intestinal propulsion but did not affect defecation time. Effects on renal function. Azelnidipine at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg p.o. dose- dependently decreased urine volume and urinary electrolyte excretion in rats. Effects on blood function. An oral administration of azelnidipine up to 100 mg/kg in rats did not affect blood coagulation. The agent at concentrations up to 10-4 g/ml did not affect hemolysis in human blood and ADP-induced guinea pig platelet aggregation. Miscellaneous effects. Azelnidipine at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg p.o. dose-dependently increased blood glucose levels in rats. One and 5% suspensions of azelnidipine neither affected the corneal reflex in guinea pigs, nor did they induce local irritating effects on the rabbit eye. In conclusion, when administered at much higher doses than the effective doses in pre-clinical studies, azelnidipine produced some general pharmacological effects, most of which are shared by other dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists.

N2  - The last decade has seen increased interest in the role of hormones, including oestrogens, not only in regulating growth, sexual development and reproduction but in maintaining a sense of psychological well-being. Episodes of change in oestrogen levels, whether increasing or decreasing, are high-risk periods for the emergence of psychological symptoms in some women. This may be due to a 'kindling effect' for women with previous psychological disturbance, an effect on circadian rhythm activity and therefore altered neurovegetative functions, or an effect on central rhythmic functioning between the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex, all mediated by effects on neurotransmitter systems. Data supporting these hypotheses come from animal studies as well as converging research in several areas including the study of psychological side-effects of oral contraceptives, the study of mood and cognitive disturbances related to the menstrual cycle, the studies of states of hormonal change such as pregnancy and the menopause and, of course, studies of women with psychiatric disorders such as major depression, seasonal affective disorder and dementia. Improvement in such symptoms via hormonal therapies or other interventions will probably lead to better quality of life for women and may actually impede the deterioration associated with ageing and certain medical illnesses. Current data support a relationship between oestrogen and psychological well-being.

N2  - Studies in rodents suggest the presence of a dopaminergic system that influences the function of a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). To provide insights into mechanisms of dopamine action in the SCN, we studied transgenic mice that had either one allele (+\-) or both alleles (-/-) of the D1 dopamine receptor gene deleted, along with normal (+/+) littermates. As expected, receptor labelling autoradiography studies using [125I] SCH 23982 showed a complete absence of D1 dopamine receptor binding sites in the SCN of -/- animals. When pregnant mice from +\- X +\- matings were injected with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393, or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR 12909 at day 19 of gestation, c-fos mRNA expression was observed in the SCN of +/+ fetuses. In contrast, c-fos mRNA induction was not seen in -/- or +\- litter mates. Injection of cocaine into pregnant dams also resulted in robust SCN c-fos mRNA expression in +/+ mice. Increases in SCN c-fos mRNA expression were also seen in +\- and -/- mice suggesting that cocaine action in the SCN involves both D1 receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Collectively, our studies of transgenic mice deficient in D1 receptors support the presence of a functional dopaminergic system in the fetal SCN. We also identify D1 receptors as the prominent transducer of dopamine action in the fetal SCN.

N2  - Objective: The heart rate (HR) responses to high and low intensity sounds reflect different central nervous system processes. The HR acceleration evoked by high intensity stimuli is part of a defensive reaction to limit sensory intake, and the HR deceleration elicited by low intensity stimuli is a specific physiological correlate of cognitive processing. The fetal defensive reaction to vibroacoustic stimulation has been studied extensively, but little is known regarding the fetal response to low intensity sounds. This study was undertaken to evaluate the HR response to a low intensity speech sound in 58 human fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation. Methods: The fetal cardiac electrical signal was sampled transabdominally at a resolution of 1 ms, and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. A 30-s speech sound was delivered at an intensity of 83 dB while fetuses were in quiet sleep. For each fetus, the HR response was analyzed in consecutive 10-s periods (P1, P2, P3) using very conservative statistical criteria; HR changes during stimulation were then compared with spontaneous changes in HR in a 10-s control period. The HR response was examined in terms of maternal (abdominal wall thickness, placental location, and amniotic fluid volume) and fetal (gestational age, prestimulus HR and HR variability, and prestimulus respiratory pattern) variables. Results: Compared with the control period, a HR deceleration occurred more often (38 (65.5%) versus 11 (19.0%), P < 0.001) and was of greater amplitude (-5.8 ± 3.2 bpm versus -2.6 ± 1.0 bpm, P = 0.003) during stimulation period P1. More fetuses exhibited a HR deceleration in P1 compared with either P2 (P = 0.011) or P3 (P = 0.017), although the frequency of a HR deceleration in these latter two periods was still significantly greater than in the control period (P2 versus control: P = 0.038; P3 versus control: P = 0.022). These results were independent of maternal characteristics. However, fetuses with increased prestimulus HR variability exhibited a greater decrease in HR than fetuses with relatively lower base-line variability (r = 0.591, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Approximately two-thirds of low risk human fetuses exhibited a HR deceleration during the first 10 s following the onset of an 83-dB speech sound. The frequency and magnitude of the HR deceleration were independent of maternal factors, raising the possibility that the HR deceleratory response may provide a physiological measure of fetal cognition.

N2  - Objective. Prone sleeping is a strong risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We investigated whether the combined effect of prone sleeping position and prenatal risk factors further increased the SIDS risk. Methods. In the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study, parents of SIDS victims in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden completed a questionnaire on potential risk factors for SIDS. Forensic pathologists verified the SIDS diagnosis. Four controls of the same gender, age, and place of birth were selected. This matched case-control study, which included 244 SIDS cases and 869 controls from 1992 to 1995, was analyzed by conditional logistic regression. Results. Odds ratios (ORs) for prone and side sleeping compared with supine sleeping for the last sleep were 13.9 (98% confidence interval 8.2-24) and 3.8 (2.1- 8.7). Infants 13 to 24 weeks old had particularly high risk in prone and side sleeping, at 28.5 (7.9-107) and 8.9 11.6-22). OR for prone sleeping was higher in girls, at 30.4 (11-88), than in boys, 10.3 (5.5-19). We found strong combined effects of sleeping position and prenatal risk factors (more than multiplicative). The OR for prone and side sleeping was increased for infants with birth weight <2500 g, at 83 (25-276) and 36.6 (13-107); for preterm infants, at 48.8 (19-128) and 40.5 (14-115); and for intrauterine growth retarded, at 38.8 (14-108)and 9.6 (4.5-22), compared with supine position in infants without these prenatal factors. The combined effect of nonsupine positions and intrauterine growth retarded was highest among 13- to 24-week-old infants. Effects of combined presence of nonsupine sleeping positions and each of the factors of smoking in pregnancy, young maternal, age, higher parity, low level of maternal education, and single motherhood were more than additive. Attributable fractions in the population for prone and side sleeping were 18.5% and 26.0%. Conclusions. Both prone and side sleeping increased the risk of SIDS. The risk was increased fUrtHer in low birth weight infants, preterm infants, and infants at the age of 13 to 24 weeks, suggesting that SIDS may be triggered by nonsupine sleeping in infants with prenatal risk factors during a vulnerable period of postnatal development.

N2  - 1) Maternal blood pressure (BP) decreased in the 2nd trimester and increased in the 3rd trimester, while heart rate (HR) increased until term, and these changes during pregnancies were more prominent in chronic hypertensive pregnancies. Although the circadian rhythm of BP and HR were obvious in normal and chronic hypertensive pregnancies, the amplitude of circadian variation of BP and HR decreased as gestational age advanced. The continuous high BP and low HR observed in severe preeclampsia resulted in decreased diurnal variation in BP and HR. The parasympathetic control examined by using nonspectral (RR50, %RR50, Lorenz plot) analysis were functionally decreased as gestational age advanced. 2) Fetal circadian rhythms were correlated obviously to maternal circadian rhythms such as HR, 1/f and especially to core body temperature. In severe preeclamptic pregnancies, the parasympathetic control was more pronounced in the mother, while it was reduced in the fetus. 3) The neonatal HR increased by the 30th day after delivery and thereafter decrease and these changes were inversely related to the value of width calculated by Lorentz plot. The circadian rhythm of HR in neonate and/or juvenile infant appeared from the 30th day and clearly established from the 100th day postpartum. 4) Melatonin from the mother might be one of the factors for materno · fetal entrainment and melatonin and D1-Dopamine in the milk for the materno-neonatal entrainment. The binding sites of melatonin receptors in rat pups SCN were up regulated and that of B1-Dopamine receptor were modulated by reduction of maternal melatonin after pinealectomy on the 7th day of pregnancy. The establishment of Locomotor activity circadian rhythms were delayed by prenatal infusion of D1-Dopamine antagonist from 15th day to delivery whereas prenatal timed injection of D1-Dopamine agonist at 8: 00 am to SCNX rat entrain the litters locomotor activity.

N2  - A team approach with close communication among the obstetrician, neurologist, pediatrician, and patient will result in an uneventful pregnancy in most epileptic women. Women should be counseled regarding the greater than 90% likelihood of a favorable outcome. Maternal and neonatal outcome can be optimized by carefully evaluating the clinical necessity of anticonvulsant medications preconceptionally. One can then prescribe an appropriate choice based on seizure type and history of response, with a goal of achieving monotherapy at the lowest effective dose. Nonpharmacologic intervention, such as avoiding high levels of stress and sleep deprivation, will also help the patient to remain seizure-free during the pregnancy. In addition, folic acid and vitamin K can help optimize neonatal outcome. In short, most epileptic women will experience a normal pregnancy, labor, and delivery of a healthy baby and can breastfeed if desired. Although the incidence of congenital malformations with any anticonvulsant is increased, the actual incidence remains relatively low. Despite the shortcomings and risks of anticonvulsants, adequate therapy is clearly preferable to uncontrolled seizure activity. Women should be encouraged to optimize their anticonvulsive therapy prior to pregnancy, usually resulting in adequate therapy throughout the pregnancy and postpartum, with a happy and healthy outcome for mother and infant.

N2  - With the aim to describe the circadian pattern of noninvasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 759 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 71 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 28 with gestational hypertension, and 14 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group (complicated versus uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. A highly statistically circadian pattern is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P<.001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first trimester to the second and rises again in the third for healthy pregnant women. For women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, blood pressure is stable during the first half of pregnancy and then continuously increases until delivery. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (always P<.001). This study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable circadian variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Those differences are found when both systolic and diastolic blood pressures for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological range of blood pressure variability.

N2  - Objective: To examine frequency domain measures of heart rate variability and their circadian rhythms in pregnancy. Design: A longitudinal study. Setting: University hospital in Turku, Finland. Participants: Sixteen healthy women between 11 and 27 weeks of pregnancy; 12 women before pregnancy; and four women postpartum. Main outcome measures: Heart rate variability as measured in frequency domain from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. Results: Pregnancy was associated with a lower standard deviation of R-R intervals (P < 0.01), with reduced very low (P < 0.05), low (P < 0.01), and high frequency (P < 0.05) power spectral components of heart rate variability. The high frequency power was lower at night in pregnancy, but similar in the daytime in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Conclusions: Pregnancy is associated with an overall reduction in heart rate variability, most markedly reflected in the low frequency component. This suggests altered baroreflex or sympathetic modulation of heart rate, and decreased vagal activation at night.

N2  - Autonomic nervous activity in the fetus was chronobiologically examined by spectral analysis of fetal heart beat fluctuation and time-frequency analysis with a wavelet transform. Spectral analysis of fetal heart beat fluctuation was performed by an autoregression method. In the low frequency domain, a 0.025-0.125 cycle/beat, in the spectral analysis of the heart beat fluctuation was closely associated with sympathetic nervous activity in fetal lamb. In the human fetus, the time series of beat-to-beat intervals obtained by Doppler ultrasound can be used for the spectal analysis instead of those of R-R intervals obtained by scalp electrode guided ECG as far as the low frequency domain is concerned. Autonomic activity of the fetus, measured by the integration of the low frequency domain and designated low frequency area in the power spectrum, develops as the pregnancy proceeds from 20 to 37 weeks gestation, and particularly around 28 weeks of gestation it develops remarkably. The low frequency area correlated well with the fetal blood gas of a growth-restricted fetus obtained by percutaneous funipuncture, suggesting the promising possibility of the use of spectral analysis in fetal well-being monitoring. The ultradian rhythm of autonomic activity in the fetus as well as the mother was examined in five volunteers from 35 to 37 weeks of gestation. There was a characteristic 12 hour cycle rhythm in the fetus which was not detected in the mother. A 12 hour rhythm also was found in the low frequency area of the arterial blood pressure fluctuation hi lamb fetus. Two-component cosinor analysis based on the 12 hour rhythm in the fetus showed that the amplitude of the rhythm was larger in the night than in the daytime. In a growth-restricted fetus, this ultradian rhythm was not obvious because the amplitude of the rhythm was so small. We successfully analyzed real time change in the low frequency domain of the fetal heart beat fluctuation by time-frequency analysis with a wavelet transform. Looking at the pattern of the wavelet transform, the power of the low frequency domain fluctuated every 10 seconds and made another rhythm. Spectral analysis of the rhythm of low the frequency domain showed that it consisted of four daughter rhythms. In other words, the low frequency domain forms a fractal structure in terms of rhythm. The difference between the night and the daytime is not due to the change intrinsic rhythm structure but to the change in amplitude of the rhythm. Moreover, in the hypoxemic growth-restricted fetuses, the rhythm structure was maintained and formed the so-called 1/f, although the amplitude became very small. This decrease in the amplitude of the daughter rhythms can be brought about by external maternal stress such as cooling the hand in an ice bath, particularly when the mother suffers from a vascular disorder due to preeclampsia.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could have adverse health consequences. DESIGN: A prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom (UK), followed to 6 months of age. The children were part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Subjects. Singletons born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon in the period June 1991 to December 1992, and for whom questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age (n = 9777); for these infants 8524 questionnaires were also completed at 6 to 8 months of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective measures of health, the presence of specific signs and symptoms, duration of sleep at night, and calling the family doctor to the home. RESULTS: Of 43 outcomes considered, after adjustment for 12 factors using logistic regression only 2 were associated with raised risk among infants put to sleep on their back (diaper rash and cradle cap). Infants put to sleep prone had increased risk of a number of health outcomes, including cough and possibly pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in increased morbidity, although changes in prevalence of rare disorders would not have been identified.

N2  - Objective. - To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection. Design. - After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold. Setting. - Quarantine. Participants. - A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant. Outcome Measures. - Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication. Results. - In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds. Conclusions. - More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.

N2  - Melatonin has clear acute and delayed effects on sleep and circadian rhythms. Decrements in core temperature and alertness have been found at different times of day following low pharmacological and physiological doses of melatonin. When correctly timed, melatonin induces both phase advances and phase delays of the circadian system in humans. When timed to advance, the decrement in temperature and alertness and the degree of shift are closely related to dose. In both stimulation and field studies, correctly timed melatonin can alleviate some of the problems of shiftwork and jet lag, notably enhancing sleep and alertness and hastening adaptation of rhythms to the imposed schedule. Performance effects and changes in sleep architecture need to be fully evaluated. The optimization of dose and formulation is also an area that requires furter work. Whether or not recently developed melatonin analogs will prove more or less useful than melatonin in adapting to phase shift remains to be seen. If incorrectly timed, melatonin has the potential to induce deleterious effects. While short-term studies indicate that it has very low toxicity, there are no long-term safety data. All of the studies reported here concern healthy adult volunteers and the use of a preparation licensed for human experimental use and available on a named patient basis on prescription. There are not data on uncontrolled preparations available over the counter in some countries. Its effects in pregnancy, interaction with other medications, and many other considerations remain to be addressed. Thus, while melatonin is useful in well-controlled conditions, the indiscriminate use of unlicensed preparations is not advisable.

N2  - The aim of this study was to describe the circadian pattern of non-invasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, and to compare sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis based on the average of the blood pressure series with the values obtained on the basis of casual measurements. We analyzed a total of 745 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours in each of several occasions in 189 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 71 with gestational hypertension, and 29 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group (complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. Highly statistically different circadian patterns are demonstrated for systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P < 0.001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first trimester to the second and raises again in the third for healthy pregnant women, but continuously increases during gestation in women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (P < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing gestational hypertension based on the circadian mean are 73% and 48%, respectively, too low for a proper individualized diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. This study confirms the predictable circadian variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy, but the use of the 24-hour mean BP does not provide a good approach for early diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Parental and maternity leave policies are a popular fringe benefit among childbearing employed women and a benefit employers frequently are required to offer. However, few rigorous evaluations of the effect of maternal leave on maternal health exist. METHODS: Using a hybrid of the household and health production theories of Becker and Grossman and a sample of women identified from state vital statistics records, a nonlinear relationship between maternal postpartum health and time off work after childbirth was estimated. RESULTS: For women taking more than 12 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on vitality. With more than 15 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on maternal, mental health, and with more than 20 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on role function. Subjects' mental health scores were comparable and vitality scores slightly lower than age- and gender-specific norms; 70% of women studied reported role function limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest employed women experience problems in well-being at approximately seven months postpartum. Variables associated with improved health include: longer maternity leaves, fewer prenatal mental health symptoms, fewer concurrent physical symptoms, more sleep, increased social support, increased job satisfaction, less physical exertion on the job, fewer infant symptoms, and less difficulty arranging child care.

N2  - Pregnant Syrian hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) received single injections of melatonin or the D1-dopamine receptor agonist, SKF 38393 on day 15 of gestation (1 day before birth). Pups were weaned on postnatal day 20 and their freerunning activity rhythms recorded for 3-4 weeks. The pups' phases on the day of weaning were significantly clustered in both of the treatment groups, but the average phases differed by approximately 180°. The results demonstrate that a single prenatal stimulus is sufficient to set the phases of the hamsters' rhythms and that the phase established depends on the stimulus. Both c-fos mRNA and Fos protein were expressed in the fetal SCN alter SKF 38393 injection but neither were expressed after melatonin injection. Simulations showed that a single stimulus could produce the observed synchrony from a population of uniformally distributed phases if the phase shifts were three to four times the magnitude of the adult barrister light phase response curve (PRC). A light pulse PRC mimicked tile effect of an SKF 38393 injection and a dark-pulse PRC mimicked the effects of a melatonin injection. Together these results suggest that dopamine and melatonin either are, or mimic, maternal entraining signals that represent day and flight.

N2  - An animal model was used to see if maternal genetic factors contribute to ethanol-induced fetal malformations. Susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice were used in a reciprocal cross-breeding design. This design produced four fetal genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and SSSS litters and hybrid B6SS and SSB6 litters. Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg of ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin on day g of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on day 18 of pregnancy and assessed for soft tissue and gross malformations. Results show different prenatal treatment effects on malformations depending on the fetal genotype. Mean percentage of total malformations in ethanol-treated groups were 61% (B6B6), 28% (B6SS), 3% (SSB6), and 16% (SSSS), respectively. Litters exposed to maltose-dextrin showed low (≤4%) malformation rates regardless of fetal genotype. The difference in teratogenic response between genetically identical hybrid litters (B6SS and SSB6) suggests a maternal genetic contribution to susceptibility. Of the two major types of malformations, forelimb but not kidney malformations showed a pattern characteristic of a maternal genetic effect. It was concluded that maternal genetic effects can be distinguished from fetal genetic effects responsible for ethanol teratogenesis. Genetically based physiological responses to alcohol in the mother may confer varying degrees of risk for prenatal alcohol effects in the child.

N2  - We previously reported a marked enhancement of nocturnal sleep in pregnant and pseudopregnant rats and suggested a possible involvement of prolactin (PRL) in the modulation of sleep during pregnancy. In the present study, the release of PRL was blocked by a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine (CB-154), and time-course changes in sleep were analyzed in pregnant rats. After pregnancy was induced by fertile mating with males (Day 1), rats (n = 5) were injected with I mg of CB-154 subcutaneously 3 h before the onset of darkness for a 3-day period (Days 1-3 or 6-8). Electroencephalogram and electromyogram for evaluating the state of sleep and wakefulness were monitored continuously up to the reappearance of an estrous cycle in the treated rats. The CB-154 treatment resulted in abortion in all rats and suppressed the pregnancy-associated nocturnal increase in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). The CB-154 treatment also decreased the diurnal amount of NREMS significantly. The sleep-suppressing effect of CB-154 on Days 6-8 was induced more promptly than that on Days 1-3. In the night of proestrus following the termination of pregnancy (Day 4 or Day 12), both NREMS and REMS decreased to the baseline level observed at prepregnant proestrus. Thus, our results indicated that CB-154 neutralized the pregnancy-associated sleep changes, which might be due to the inhibition of the PRL release. It is suggested that PRL is at least partially responsible for the regulation of sleep during pregnancy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although both expectant mothers and expectant fathers complain of fatigue during the last trimester of pregnancy, studies have focused exclusively on mothers. This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or evening fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of fatigue. METHODS: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples, who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary. RESULTS: Expectant mothers but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers and mothers did not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained. Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and postpartum experience.

N2  - With close cooperation and communication among the obstetrician, neurologist, pediatrician, and patient, most women with idiopathic epilepsy who become pregnant will have an uneventful pregnancy with an excellent outcome. To optimize the neonatal outcome in a patient requiring medication, using a single drug at the lowest possible dose that keeps her free of seizures is preferable. The prevention of tonic-clonic seizures, however, is of utmost importance. Simple interventions such as avoiding sleep deprivation, having the patients take folic acid before conception, and giving the infant a vitamin K injection at birth will help optimize the outcome. There is an increase of congenital malformations in infants born to women with epilepsy; however, the incidence is low. Most women with epilepsy will experience normal pregnancy and labor and will have spontaneous vaginal deliveries of healthy babies.

N2  - Since urine contains cross-reacting substances to anti-cortisol(F) antibody, we extracted F from urine samples with dichloromethane. Using this specific assay system for F with TDX dynapack(fluorescence polarization immunoassay system), clinical significance of urinary F was tested by measuring urine samples from normal subjects, patients with pituitary-adrenal diseases and liver cirrhosis, and pregnant. The circadian rhythm of urinary F was evaluated by using samples collected every 4-hour period. The amount of urinary excretions of F during 4 hours were the highest during between 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then gradually decreased reaching at the lowest level at between 0 a.m. and 4 a.m. in normal volunteers. Such circadian rhythm was not found in 6 patients with Cushing's syndrome. The urinary F levels in pregnant women started to increase in the samples from between 21 to 30 weeks of gestation, and the level was maintained even at the 5th day of post-partum. The urinary F levels in patients with liver cirrhosis were significantly lower than those for age-matched healthy volunteers. In patients with abnormal steroidogenesis, the urinary F levels in patients with Cushing's syndrome were extremely high, 165-3358 micrograms/day. On the other hands, those in patients with deficient steroid synthetase were 2.8-26.5 micrograms/day, and those in patients with neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma were 7.8-43.8 micrograms/day. The urinary F levels were about 50-fold higher in the patients with Cushing's syndrome than those in the normal reference interval, whereas serum F and urinary 17-OHCS levels were only 2.5-fold and 7-fold higher than those healthy volunteers, respectively. These results indicate that the assay of urinary F extracted with dichloromethane is the most useful test for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

N2  - Children of substance abuse mothers have an increased risk of severe pathological disorders such us perinatal diseases (prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, infections) with their neurological and respiratory complications and sequelae, and transmission of drug addiction related infections, ie human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, syphilis. Many of these children present a drug withdrawal syndrome characterized by restlessness and jitteriness during the neonatal period. This is frequently followed by a post withdrawal period of several weeks duration with crying, excitement, sleep and feeding difficulties. Although these drug withdrawal manifestations have no incidence on the vital prognosis, it severely impairs the mother-infant interaction. Despite these disorders it appears that the outcome of these children is mainly related to their familial environment which is exposed to many risk factors: mother-child separation, violence, delinquency, precariousness, unhealthy housing, prostitution, drug dependency, parental death or imprisonment... Early medico-psycho-social intervention starting during pregnancy and a prolonged support for several years are the only way to improve their spontaneously poor outcome.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus intensity on heart rate response in 18 low-risk human fetuses between 37 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated in quiet sleep with a 30-s voice sound at intensities of 80 dB and 90 dB. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal-processing techniques. We found that fetuses generally exhibited a 5- to 10-s decrease in heart rate following stimulus onset at an intensity of 80 dB. The response pattern changed from deceleratory to acceleratory when stimulus intensity was increased to 90 dB. Our findings suggest that a heart rate deceleration at low-stimulus intensity may be a component of the orienting reflex in the human fetus.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of consistency in behavioral state organization for 30 low-risk human participants examined as fetuses at 38-40 weeks gestation and again as neonates at approximately 2 weeks postnatal age. Behavioral states were assigned similarly for fetuses and neonates in terms of heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. We found that the time spent in a sleep period was distributed among quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), and indeterminate states in virtually identical proportions for fetuses and neonates. However, the only within-subject consistency between the fetal and neonatal periods was in the duration of complete QS epochs. Fetuses made fewer transitions between QS and AS, but neonates had shorter and more structured AS-->QS transitions. These findings suggest that, whereas central nervous system processes governing QS do not change appreciably, the control of AS undergoes significant changes in the 4 weeks spanning the fetal and neonatal periods. We believe that the duration of enclosed QS epochs provides the only stable measure of behavioral state development between the prenatal and postnatal periods.

N2  - Although thyroid fuction has been extensively investigated in pregnancy, the data have failed to identify clearly true changes in thyroid status mainly because various artefacts affect the results of several TSH (thyroid- stimulating hormone) and free thyroid hormone assay techniques. To overcome the problem, serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured in 74 and 71 women in early and late pregnancy respectively and compared with those in 63 non-pregnant women using a highly-sensitive and specific immunoradiometric TSH assay (IRMA), free of any bias due toa pregnancy serum effect, and a two-step FT4 assay previously validated against an equilibrium dialysis reference method. In addition, the circadian changes of TSH in early and late pregnancy were studied in an effort to identify possible alterations related to feto-placental unit function. The median TSH level in early pregnancy (1.07, range: 0.27-3.76 mU/I) was found to be significantly lower than in late pregnancy (1.27, range: 0.26-3.57 mU/I, P<0.001) and in the control group (1.30, range: 0.35-3.38mU/I, P<0.001). Conversely median FT4 level was found to be significantly higher in early (16.85, range: 11.0- 24.20 nmol/l) than in late pregnancy (14.00, range: 10.60 20.40 nmol/l, P<0.001) and in the control group (14.50, range: 10.40-18.80 nmol/l, P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the median TSH or FT4 levels in the late pregnancy population and the control group. A normal TSH circadian rhythm was observed in both early and late pregnancy groups. In conclusion, a mild increase in thyroid activity is observed in early pregnancy, while the thyroid status in late pregnancy is unmodified.

N2  - Preliminary data have suggested that female infertility due to corpus luteum insufficiency may be caused by subclinical hypothyroidism [exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation]. L-Thyroxine supplementation has been recommended to achieve pregnancies in subclinical hypothyroid women. This controlled study was carried out in order to investigate the biochemical diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism as a possible infertility factor. Five infertile patients (aged 25-36 years) with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 4, stimulated TSH > 20 μU/ml) or primary hypothyroidism (n = 1) and five healthy controls (aged 22-39 years) with normal thyroid function (stimulated TSH < 15 μU/ml), regular cycles and no history of infertility were studied in the early follicular phase. In the pre-study evaluation, eight of 23 volunteers (34.8%) had to be excluded because of subclinical hypothyroidism with stimulated TSH values (TSH(s)) > 15 μU/ml. Cycle function of patients and controls was compared by the method of LH pulse pattern analysis. Therefore blood samples were drawn every 10 min during a 24 h period. Sleep was recorded from midnight to 7 a.m. Repetition of the TRH tests at the end of the 24 h blood sampling period confirmed the difference in stimulated TSH values of the two study groups. Pulse analysis for luteinizing hormone (LH), TSH and prolactin showed no differences between patients and controls for pulse frequency, amplitude, height, length, area under curve (AUC) and the 24 h mean. Even the hypothyroid patient had a normal LH pulse pattern. Additional measurement of melatonin in pooled sera every 30 min gave the well-documented diurnal profiles during day and night for both groups. Patients had significantly higher melatonin values at seven time points during the night. Peaks for LH, TSH, prolactin and cortisol were correlated with the sleep stages wake, rapid eye movement, 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. We concluded that corpus luteum insufficiency in female infertility cannot be explained by subclinical hypothyroidism and thus should not be treated with L-thyroxine for fertility reasons.

N2  - Texas' health objectives include reducing the infant mortality rate from 8.1 per 1000 live births in 1990 to no more than 7 per 1000 by the year 2000. To help target potentially preventable causes of infant mortality, we examined the underlying cause of each of the 2545 infant deaths that occurred in Texas during 1990. Potential existed for primary prevention of the underlying cause of at least some of 778 infant deaths and for secondary prevention by treating the underlying causes of 1127. The following appear to be the most promising targets and strategies for prevention: causes of neonatal mortality by improving the clinical care of high-risk newborns; sudden infant death syndrome by having infants sleep in the supine position; respiratory complications of preterm birth by preventive and therapeutic surfactant; death from bacterial infections by optimal antibiotic therapy; injuries and accidents by optimal parental supervision; preterm birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes by optimal prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care; and neural tube defects by adequate paraconceptual folic acid.

N2  - The early development of circadian rhythms in primates, including man, was reviewed. Continuous 24-h recordings were carried out for maternal and fetal circadian rhythms during gestation as well as in preterm infants. Several propositions were made based on these new findings: 1. The fetal biological clock is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian rhythms and responding to maternal entraining signals long before the moment of birth. 2. Through the fetal biological clock, maternal circadian rhythms influence the fetal overt rhythms. 3. Maternal rhythms influence the fetus, and fetal rhythms feed back to the mother (via the placenta). Disruption of this fetal-maternal interaction during gestation leads to: a. disturbances of maternal and fetal circadian rhythms; b. disappearance of circadian rhythms at the time of birth; c. a gestational period which is either too short or too long (see also Honnebier and Swaab, 1973); d. delayed or impaired maturation of the circadian rhythms of the infant.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an over-the-counter mechanical nasal dilator during sleep in pregnant women with nasal congestion. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with symptoms of nocturnal nasal congestion not attributed to allergies or 'cold' symptoms were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either a spring-loaded device or placebo device without a spring. Each patient assessed breathing and sleep quality for a three-day baseline and three-day treatment period. A 10-question diary was utilized to assess breathing, ease of falling asleep, sleep quality, and continuity and depth of sleep. Averaged scores for each question were computed for baseline and treatment periods, and differences were calculated. Statistical analyses were by the sign test, Fisher's exact test and Student's t test. RESULTS: Thirty-four (21%) of 160 screened patients were enrolled into the study; 24 (15%) completed the study. All agreed to being assigned to receive either the spring-loaded device (n = 12) or a placebo (n = 12) device. Responses to 8 of the 10 questions favored the former as compared with the placebo (P = .05, sign test). Moreover, patients treated with the spring-loaded device gave more favorable responses to the question, 'Overall, compared with most nights, how easy was your breathing throughout last night?' (P = .02, t test). CONCLUSION: Use of this drug-free external nasal dilator improved the ease of breathing among patients with pregnancy-related nocturnal congestion.

N2  - Relationships between wakefulness of mothers and their infants' movements during night sleep in postpartum period were studied under conditions in daily life. Subjects were ten primiparae, aged 23-31 yrs (mean age, 26.8 yrs), who had a normal course of pregnancy and delivery. Eight of their infants were breast-fed, and two were formula-fed. Mother's polysomnograms, (EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG) and actigrams of infants' legs were simultaneously recorded using Medilog 9000 at home in the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. Mothers' sleep stages and their infants' movements were visually scored by an epoch of one minute. The infants' movements were classified into four states, MOV0, MOV1, MOV2, and MOV3. We defined MOV0 as no activities during one epoch, MOV1 as less than 20 seconds activities, MOV2 as from 20 to 40 seconds activities and MOV3 as from 40 to 60 seconds activities. The average times of wakefulness on the mothers were 102.6 min (SD = 23.5), 84.8 min (SD = 52.8) and 79.4 min (SD = 40.5) for 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks, respectively. There were no significant differences among them. The mothers' wakefulness coincided with the infants' movements MOV3 was 86.9% for total epochs of MOV3, while deep sleep of the mothers was observed during epochs of MOV0 and MOV1. This trend did not change across the postpartum weeks. The time-lag between the mothers' wakefulness and their infants' movements was calculated. In 85.4% of 48 times of mother's awakenings for feeding their infants, their infants began to move before their mothers woke up. In 63.4% of the cases, the mothers woke up within two minutes after their infants began to move. In the present study, eight of the ten mothers satisfactorily adapted themselves to the life style in the postpartum period, while two had difficulties in adaptation. In conclusion, ten mothers' wakefulness during night sleep in postpartum period was related to their infants' movements, and its relationship did not change through the 1st, 3rd and 6th weeks of delivery.

N2  - Recent trends in the vital statistics of the United States continued in 1995, including decreases in the number of births, the birth rate, the age- adjusted death rate, and the infant mortality rate; life expectancy at birth increased to a level equal to the record high of 75.8 years in 1992. Marriages and divorces both decreased. An estimated 3 900 089 infants were born during 1995, a decline of 1% from 1994. The preliminary birth rate for 1995 was 14.8 live births per 1000 total population, a 3% decline, and the lowest recorded in nearly two decades. The fertility rate, which relates births to women in the childbearing ages, declined to 65.6 live births per 1000 women 15 to 44 years old, the lowest rate since 1986. According to preliminary data for 1995, fertility rates declined for all racial groups with the gap narrowing between black and white rates. The fertility rate for black women declined 7% to a historic low level (71.7); the preliminary rate for white women (64.5) dropped just 1%. Fertility rates continue to be highest for Hispanic, especially Mexican-American, women. Preliminary data for 1995 suggest a 2% decline in the rate for Hispanic women to 103.7. The birth rate for teenagers has now decreased for four consecutive years, from a high of 62.1 per 1000 women 15 to 19 years old in 1991 to 56.9 in 1995, an overall decline of 8%. The rate of childbearing by unmarried mothers dropped 4% from 1994 to 1995, from 46.9 births per 1000 unmarried women 15 to 44 years old to 44.9, the first decline in the rate in nearly two decades. The proportion of all births occurring to unmarried women dropped as well in 1995, to 32.0% from 32.6% in 1994. Smoking during pregnancy dropped steadily from 1989 (19.5%) to 1994 (14.6%), a decline of about 25%. Prenatal care utilization continued to improve in 1995 with 81.2% of all mothers receiving care in the first trimester compared with 78.9% in 1993. Preliminary data for 1995 suggests continued improvement to 81.2%. The percent of infants delivered by cesarean delivery declined slightly to 20.8% in 1995. The percent of low birth weight (LBW) infants continued to climb in 1994 rising to 7.3%, from 7.2% in 1993. The proportion of LBW improved slightly among black infants, declining from 13.3% to 13.2% between 1993 and 1994. Preliminary figures for 1995 suggest continued decline in LBW for black infants (13.0%). The multiple birth ratio rose to 25.7 per 1000 births for 1994, an increase of 2% over 1993 and 33% since 1980. Age-adjusted death rates in 1995 were lower for heart disease, malignant neoplasms, accidents, and homicide. Although the total number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection deaths increased slightly from 42 114 in 1994 to an estimated 42 506 in 1995, the age-adjusted death rate for HIV infection did not increase, which may indicate a leveling off of the steep upward trend in mortality from HIV infection since 1987. Nearly 15 000 children between the ages of 1-14 years died in the United States (US) in 1995. The death rate for children 1 to 4 years old in 1995 was 40.4 per 100 000 population aged 1 to 4 years, 6% lower than the rate of 42.9 in 1994. The 1995 death rate for 5- to 14-year- olds was 22.1, 2% lower than the rate of 22.5 in 1994. Since 1979, death rates have declined by 37% for children 1 to 4 years old, and by 30% for children 5 to 14 years old. For children 1 to 4 years old, the leading cause of death was injuries, which accounted for an estimated 2277 deaths in 1995, 36% of all deaths in this age group. Injuries were the leading cause of death for 5- to 14-year-olds as well, accounting for an even higher percentage (41%) of all deaths. In 1995, the preliminary infant mortality rate was 7.5 per 1000 live births, 6% lower than 1994, and the lowest ever recorded in the US. The decline occurred for neonatal as well as postneonatal mortality rates, and among white and black infants alike. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rates have dropped precipitously since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations that infants be placed on their backs or sides to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. SIDS dropped to the third leading cause of infant death in 1994, after being the second leading cause of death since 1980. Infant mortality rates (IMRs) have also declined rapidly for respiratory distress syndrome since 1989, concurrent with the widespread availability of new treatments for this condition.

N2  - (±)-4-Diethylamino-1,1-dimethylbut-2-yn-1-yl-2 cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy-2- phenylacetate monohydrochloride monohydrate (NS 21) was developed for the treatment of pollakisuria and urinary incontinence. The general pharmacological properties of NS 21 and its active metabolite (±)-4- ethylamino-1,1-dimethylbut-2-yn-1-yl-2-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate (RCC 36) were investigated in various species of animals. The following results were obtained General signs and gross behavior: NS 21 at doses of 100 mg/kg or more p.o. and RCC 36 at doses of 30 mg/kg or more p.o. caused hyperlocomotion and irritability in mice. But, even at 300 mg/kg p.o., NS 21 and RCC 36 did not cause any signs except mydriasis in rats. Central nervous system: NS 21 and RCC 36 prolonged hexobarbital induced sleep in mice at doses of 30 mg/kg or more p.o. RCC 36 at a dose of 300 mg/kg p.o. induced convulsions in combination with subconvulsive dose of pentetrazol in mice NS- 21 and RCC 36 at each dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. had no effect on motor coordination in mice. Neither NS 21 nor RCC 36 at each dose of 300 mg/kg p.o. had any anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant or analgesic effect (tail flick test) in mice, or any effect on locomotor activity, body temperature or conditioned avoidance response in rats. Peripheral nervous system: NS-21 and RCC 36 induced mydriasis (ED50 values: NS-21, 32.0 mg/kg; RCC 36, 25.9 mg/kg) and suppressed pilocarpine induced salivation (ED50 values: NS 21, 25.1 mg/kg; RCC 36, 23.2 mg/kg) in mice. At each dose of 10 mg/kg i.v., they had no effect on the nictitating membrane contractions induced by pre- or post ganglionic nerve stimulation in cats NS 21 and RCC 36 showed surface anesthetic activity in rabbit cornea (EC50 values: NS 21, 0.49%; RCC 36, 0.16%) and infiltration anesthetic activity in guinea pig dorsal skin (EC50 values: NS 21, 0.20%; RCC 36, 0.17%). They inhibited contraction of isolated rat diaphragm induced by phrenic nerve stimulation (IC50 values: NS-21, 3.4 x 10-5 M; RCC 36, 1.5 x 10-5 M). Smooth muscle: NS-21 and RCC 36 at each concentration of 10-4 M elevated resting tensions of isolated rat aorta and isolated guinea pig tracheal muscle. They inhibited K+-induced contraction of isolated rat aorta (IC50 values: NS-21, 7.1 x 10-7 M; RCC 36, 1.9 x 10-6 M) and carbachol induced contraction of isolated guinea pig tracheal muscle (IC50 values: NS 21, 6.6 x 10-6 M; RCC-36, 1.1 x 10-6 M), NS 21 and RCC-36 suppressed motility of isolated rabbit ileum (IC50 values: NS- 21, 9.7 x 10-6 M; RCC 36, 1.1 x 10-5 M) and motilities of uteri isolated from nonpregnant rats (IC50 values: NS 21, 1.1 x 10-6 M; RCC-36, 8.7 x 10-6 M) and pregnant rats of the 20th day gestation (IC50 values: NS-21, 3.5 x 10-7 M; RCC 36, 4.1 x 10-6 M). They inhibited acetylcholine- induced contraction of isolated guinea pig ileum competitively (pA2 values: NS 21, 7.15; RCC 36, 7.89), histamine induced contraction noncompetitively (pD'2 values: NS-21, 5.90; RCC 36, 5.34) and Ba++ induced contraction (IC50 values: NS 21, 2.0 x 10-7 M; RCC-36, 9.3 x 10-7 M). NS-21 and RCC 36 inhibited noradrenaline induced contraction of isolated rat vas deferens noncompetitively (pD'2 values: NS 21, 5.79; RCC-36, 5.45). Gastrointestinal tracts: Intraduodenally administered NS 21 and RCC-36 inhibited gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats at doses of 10 mg/kg or more. At each dose of 300 mg/kg p.o., they had no effect on gastrointestinal transportation of charcoal meal in mice and no ulcerogenic activity on the gastric mucosa of rats. Other systems: NS-21 and RCC-36 inhibited carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats at doses of 100 mg/kg or more p.o.

N2  - As part of a larger study we established a remote physiological monitoring network to investigate cardiorespiratory function during sleep in 400 infants in their homes. The objective of the study was to link measurements made at three weeks and three months of age with detailed measurements of maternal and fetal nutrition during pregnancy and subsequent outcome (growth, development and cardiorespiratory diseases). Five infants per night were monitored anywhere within a radius of 10 miles (16 km) of the remote hub. Of 800 overnight studies on 64 (of 400) infants, 99 were completed. Options allowed downloading data from monitor memory as well as review (on- and off-line) from the infants' or nurses' homes, the hub and the Oxford telemonitoring centre. The reasons for these measurements being made at home were to ensure physiological accuracy and to reduce cost. The network was effectively run by local community nurses; with the exception of the size and cost of the monitors, it had all the elements of a remote primary-care clinical service.

N2  - This study was designed to explore risk factors for breast cancer with emphasis on the detection of clinical markers of the hormonal imbalance during the perimenarche. Three hundred and thirty women diagnosed with breast cancer and 346 population controls were identified and interviewed in Girona, Spain between 1986 and 89. Cases were more likely than controls to have had long menstrual periods in the first 5 years after menarche [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0], to experience menopause at a late age (OR = 1.5) and to report acne during adolescence (OR = 1.6). Family history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk (OR = 2.3). Cases reported a lower use of drug treatments for anxiety and sleep disorders than controls. Moderate alcohol drinkers and smokers were at lower risk for breast cancer. No statistically significant association with breast cancer was observed for number of children, age at last pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, hormonal treatment after menopause and weight perception during the teenage years. Hormonal changes in the years following menarche may be relevant to breast cancer risk. The roles of menstrual period length and acne during adolescence should be further explored.

N2  - The effect of fetal thyroidectomy on thermoregulation in newborn lambs was investigated. Seven of 14 lambs born normally at term were thyroidectomized at Day 127 of gestation. Colonic temperature and oxygen consumption were measured during non-rapid eye movement sleep 6-45 h after birth. All lambs were then killed and perirenal brown adipose tissue was sampled for measurement of thermogenic activity (guanosine diphosphate binding), uncoupling protein and lipid contents. Thyroidectomized lambs tended to have a mean colonic temperature 2.35°C lower (P = 0.067) than controls and two became hypothermic (i.e. colonic temperature < 35°C). Thyroidectomized lambs exhibited lower rates of oxygen consumption (P = 0.05) and an increased incidence of shivering thermogenesis. The perirenal adipose tissue of these lambs had a lower thermogenic activity (P < 0.01), less uncoupling protein (P < 0.01) and higher lipid content (P = 0.072) compared with intact controls. It is concluded that fetal thyroidectomy results in a decreased ability of newborn lambs to utilize nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as well as increasing the incidence of hypothermia. These changes are associated with decreased synthesis of uncoupling protein and functional development of brown adipose tissue in the late gestation fetus.

N2  - Ten term infants who were exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy and 10 age- and sex-matched control infants participated in the study. At the age of 48 hours (+/- 10), all infants underwent a 150- to 200-minute polygraphic study in a soundproof laboratory. Respiratory and heart rates, distribution of sleep states, and oxygen saturation were comparable in the two groups. The number and length of apneic events were similarly distributed in the two groups. The proportion of obstructive apneic events followed by arousal was significantly higher in the control group especially during quiet sleep (p = 0.001). It appears that exposure to smoking during pregnancy is associated with a higher arousal threshold in term infants. This finding could be of relevance in the assessment of maternal smoking as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome.

N2  - The developmental aspects of sleep and breathing are rarely treated as one subject. This report attempts to link the fields of sleep research and developmental pulmonology in a comprehensive description of development and control of sleep and breathing from gestation to adulthood. Unfortunately, much of the investigation in this area is basic physiology and was done some time ago. Although this subject matter need not be updated, some of these references are older; however, this may be new information for the pulmonologist. The second part of this report details the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the development of sleep-disordered breathing in children and adults. In fact, developmental abnormalities that occur in childhood may recrudesce in adulthood. We conclude with a discussion of the familial and genetic aspects of sleep-disordered breathing and consider the place of sudden infant death syndrome in the spectrum of these disorders.

N2  - Autism, Asperger's syndrome and other autistic syndromes are developmental brain disorders that cause serious impairments in communication, social interaction, empathy, mood and play. In addition to such deficits, the autistic syndromes involve pathologically high levels of repetitive, stereotypic, ritualistic, compulsive or obsessive behavior, together with extreme resistance to change. According to the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of rapid eye movement sleep, normal brain development in the fetus and infant depends on undisrupted function of a 'reverse learning' mechanism during rapid eye movement sleep. Could abnormalities in this hypothetical reverse learning during rapid eye movement sleep in the fetus explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes? Does the Crick-Mitchison theory suggest if a drug could interfere with rapid eye movement sleep and cross the placental barrier, then that drug might cause developmental brain disorders in the fetus? Should all pregnant women completely avoid caffeine or any agent that might disrupt serotonergic or cholinergic systems?.

N2  - To investigate the effects of lung distension and oxygenation on umbilical blood flow (UBF) and plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in relation to arousal and stimulation of breathing movements, we studied eight chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 137 and 143 d of gestation. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, nuchal and diaphragmatic electromyograms, arterial pH and blood gas tensions. Hb oxygen saturation, body temperature, and UBF were recorded in each fetus. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, and nuchal electromyograms were used to define sleep states. No sooner than 4 d after surgery, fetal lungs were distended with 100% O2 or N2 in a randomized order via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. PGE2 concentrations were analyzed by RIA. A significant increase in fetal arousal and stimulation of breathing during nonrapid eye movement sleep was observed during lung distension with O2 as compared with control periods and lung distension with nitrogen. In all sleep states, UBF significantly decreased during oxygenation as corn pared with the control values. However, no significant correlation was observed between the time of the onset of arousal and the decrease in UBF. Lung distension with N2 resulted in increased plasma PGE2 concentrations, whereas, no change was observed during oxygenation. Our data suggest that an increase in fetal partial pressure of arterial O2 leads to a decrease in UBF. However, the onset of arousal and stimulation of breathing during lung distension and oxygenation are not dependent on a decrease in plasma PGE2 concentrations.

N2  - Introduction. Infants of mothers who smoke have reduced respiratory function and are more likely to develop wheezing. Little evidence is available on the effect of in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure as opposed to postnatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. We used a previously validated non-invasive method to measure the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) as a proportion of expiratory time (tE) in newborn infants soon after birth to examine the effects of a family history of asthma and in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure on the infants' respiratory function. Methods. We collected respiratory-function data from 500 healthy infants of mothers taking part in the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort Study. During behaviourally defined quiet sleep, measurements were obtained a median of 58 h (range 26-159) after the infants were born. We used uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. The uncalibrated volume signal was differentiated to flow and used to calculate respiratory rate, total inspiratory time, tE, and tPTEF. Mothers answered questionnaires on demographic, medical, and pregnancy characteristics, including smoking history. Serum cotinine measurements were available to validate self-reported smoking history in a subset of mothers (238). Results. Data suitable for analysis were obtained from 461 infants. In multivariate regression analysis, lower values of tPTEF/tE were independently associated with respiratory rate (β coefficient per 10 breaths/min 0.018 [SE 0.005], p < 0.01), age (β coefficient per 10 h -0.008 [0.003], p < 0.01), maternal smoking during pregnancy (> 10 cigarettes daily; β coefficient -0.049 [0.022], p < 0.05), maternal hypertension during pregnancy (-0.037 [0.015], p < 0.02), and a family history of asthma (-0.028 [0.014], p < 0 05). Conclusions. In-utero smoke exposure, a family history of asthma, and maternal hypertension during pregnancy are associated with reduced respiratory function after birth. We speculate that these factors adversely affect lung development in utero.

N2  - The heart rate during whole day, periods of activity and sleep as well as repeatable daily activities were identified in a group of 22 women, aged 19-40, and pregnant for 12-36 weeks, following a 24-hour recording of the heart work. In four women only, mean circadian heart rate was under 87/min, a value considered as normal in moderate active persons. That indicates a significant pregnancy-related increase of heart rate. A considerable great variation of heart rates was observed during a day. The highest heart rate (97-140/min) was caused by mounting the stairs; it was also noted during performing minor household jobs and/or preparing meals. While using transportation means, heart rate ranged from 78 to 130/min, and at leisure form 89 to 108/min. It was found that the level of an acceptable load for women (100 heart beats/min) was already higher than the mean value for the whole period of activity. An analysis of the relationship between heart rate in certain situations and the age of women under study, and the pregnancy advancement, shows that heart rate was, in each period of recording, positively correlated with the women's age. That means an increasing, with age pregnancy-related load. Heart rate during a 24-hour period, periods of activity and sleep, during the use of transportation means, watching television and resting in a sitting position, was positively correlated with the duration of pregnancy. Negative correlation between heart rate and the duration of pregnancy was observed while mounting the stairs, preparing meals and performing other household jobs. The negative correlation indicates that the pace of activities performed can be easily regulated, and thus, the load magnitude adjusted to physical abilities, whereas the positive correlation indicates that such a possibility does not exist in regard to the expenditure of energy (work pace). To sum up, the data presented shows that the use of transportation means increased the women's load but they could easily perform minor household jobs. However, there were no occupationally working women in the study group, it can be concluded that this kind od analysis, and conclusions drawn, can be used in identifying types of work and workplaces which pose too much load to pregnant women.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine resting body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) of healthy pregnant women in Japan and the United States, and if differences exist, to examine if fetal HR and fetal behavior also vary between the groups. Methods: A convenience sample (n = 49) was applied to the study with a cross-sectional design at two data sites (the Kansai region of Japan and the Midwest region of the United States) involving three subgroups, namely Japanese, African-American, and European-American. Healthy volunteers at late gestation (37.2 ± 1.0 weeks; mean ± SD) were recruited. Subjects sat quietly for 30 min in a controlled environment before the data collection began. Maternal BT was measured multiple times by an infrared thermometer, and HR was measured at the radial pulse for 30 s. Both measurements were repeated at 10-min intervals. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal behavior were measured continuously for 60 min by a fetal actocardiograph. Results: Significant differences in BT among the three groups were evident. The mean BT and HR of Japanese participants were significantly lower (35.7 ± 0.5°C; 72.1 ± 6.3 beats/min) than those in their other groups (36.8 ± 0.6°C; 86.2 ± 11.4 bpm for African-Americans and 36.7 ± 0.9°C; 80.9 ± 11.1 bpm for European-Americans) (P < 0.05, ANOVA). The mean FHR of European-Americans and was significantly lower (129 ± 3.5 bpm) than those in the other groups (138 ± 8.0 bpm for African-Americans and 135 ± 9.5 bpm for Japanese) (P < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). European-American fetuses also spent significantly more time in the active sleep phase (P < 0.05, Tukey-HSD). Maternal HR correlated with FHR (r = 0.33; P = 0.01) and with maternal BT (r = 0.27; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Different populations present different normal resting physiological conditions. Given the difference among populations studied, FHR correlates with maternal HR and BT but not with birth weight.

N2  - Sleep disorder during the course of pregnancy has been recently recognized in humans. However, the underlying mechanism of pregnancy- associated sleep disorder remains undetermined, and sleep changes even during normal pregnancy have not been fully understood. To describe the effects of pregnancy on sleep, sleep-wake patterns before and after fertile mating were compared in an animal model. Baseline recordings of sleep and brain temperature were made throughout a normal 4-day estrous cycle in female rats. After the rats became pregnant, the recordings continued across the entire pregnant period. Compared with baseline sleep before mating, both non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep increased significantly from the first night of pregnancy. Although rapid eye movement sleep returned to the baseline level from midpregnancy, nocturnal non-rapid eye movement sleep stayed enhanced during the entire pregnant period. Daytime sleep fluctuated toward the end of pregnancy. Brain temperature was elevated during the early period of pregnancy but did not correlate with enhanced sleep. The results suggest that physiological changes in different stages of pregnancy may contribute to the regulation of maternal sleep and temperature.

N2  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a profile of blood pressure (BP) during daily activities and sleep and could uncover the inter-individual variability of BP. The aims of this study were to establish the normal values of the ABPM during the three trimesters of normal pregnancy, and to compare these values with those obtained in the office. ABPM was carried out on 22 normotensive pregnant women. BP values were compared with those obtained in the office. BP during the third trimester was significantly higher than the BP recorded during the first two gestational periods. In the three trimesters of pregnancy mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were lower than the BP measured in the office in lying and standing positions. On the other hand, mean ambulatory BP (systolic and diastolic) measured during daily activities was not significantly different from the BP measured in the office. Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in all trimesters, while there were not significant differences in the degree of BP fall among the three trimesters. Six women were sequentially studied during the three trimesters of pregnancy and particularly at the 12, 24 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. In these women, a small but significant rise in mean 24 h systolic and diastolic BP was observed at 32 weeks of pregnancy. Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in the three trimesters. No significant difference in the degree of BP fall on the three gestational dates was found. It is concluded that ABPM is a useful tool for the evaluation of BP variability during pregnancy. During normal pregnancy ambulatory BP levels are highest in the day and lowest at night at all gestational ages and increased at the third trimester of pregnancy compared to the values observed during the first two gestational periods.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe the differences between primigravidae and multigravidae women in their experience of sleep efficiency, fatigue and vitality, and level of functioning in the third trimester of pregnancy and the first month postpartum. A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the hypothesis that multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased sleep efficiency and vitality than primigravidae at both phases of the study. Results indicate, however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum. Multigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the third trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no statistically significant difference in level of vitality, primigravidae experienced more fatigue (73.58 +/- 15.22) than multigravidae (64.35 +/- 18.96) at 1 month postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role "acquisition," experienced by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal role "expansion." The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase in fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that health care professionals need to provide anticipatory guidance to primigravidae to help smooth the transition from pregnancy to motherhood.

N2  - General pharmacological effects of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were investigated. 1. Central nervous system: Basic FGF produced almost no effect on the general symptoms and behaviors of mice. Basic FGF did not influence the spontaneous motor activity, hexobarbital-induced anesthesia, electroshock seizure threshold, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in mice and normal body temperature and spinal reflex in rats up to a dose of 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). As regards pain sensation, it inhibited the acetic acid-induced writhing at 1 mg/kg (s.c.). No abnormal waves were observed in spontaneous EEG of the rabbit up to 1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF, but at 0.1 mg/kg it had a slight effect on the ratio of EEG levels and at 1 mg/kg induced an increase in rest period, disappearance in the period of fast wave sleep and a decrease in the period of deep sleep. 2. Somatic nervous system: Basic FGF did not influence the corneal reflex, twitch response of the skin and diaphragm-phrenic nerve preparations. 3. Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: Basic FGF showed little effects on the spontaneous movement of the isolated ileum, contraction induced by various agonists in isolated ileum, resting tension and noradrenaline(NA)-induced contraction of the aorta, resting tension and histamine-induced contraction of isolated trachea, spontaneous movement and 5-HT-induced contraction of isolated strips of stomach fundus, NA-induced contraction of isolated vas deferens of the rat up to the concentration of 10-4 g/ml. Basic FGF augmented the tone of the isolated non-pregnant uterus at the concentrations of 10-5 g/ml and above and inhibited or tended to inhibit the contractile tension of non-pregnant or pregnant uterus at 10-4 g/ml, but it did not influence the spontaneous movement of the uterus, either the nonpregnant or pregnant, under in situ conditions even at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.v.). Basic FGF did not influence the pupil size. 4. Respiratory and circulatory systems: Basic FGF had no effect on the isolated heart. The influence was not exerted on the heart rate for the isolated atria but slight inhibition of contractile force was observed at 10-4 g/ml. In anesthetized dogs a decrease in blood pressure, a slight increase in heart rate and respiratory rate and a decrease in femoral blood flow were observed at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF. Similarly, a slight increase in heart rate and a slight decrease of blood pressure were observed at 1 mg/kg (s.c.) in conscious rats. 5. Digestive system: Administration of bFGF at 1 mg/kg did not result in changes in the transport capacity within the gastrointestinal tract (s.c., i.v.) and the secretion of the gastric juice (s.c.). 6. Urine output and electrolyte metabolism: Basic FGF produced a decrease in urinary Na+ excretion at 1 mg/kg (s.c.), and showed a tendency to increase in urinary volume at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.). At 1 mg/kg (i.v.) urinary excretion of Na+ and Cl- was decreased significantly. It had no effect on the ability of rats to excrete PSP (phenol red) up to 1 mg/kg (s.c.). 7. Blood system: Basic FGF did not influence the coagulation time of the whole blood, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of rats up to 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). It did not influence the aggregation of rabbit platelets induced by collagen and ADP up to 10-4 g/ml. Basic FGF at concentration of 10-4 g/ml exhibited no hemolytic action. 8. Local action: Plantar subcutaneous injection of bFGF at above 0.005 mg/site induced edema by itself on and after the next day, and also reinforced carrageenin-induced edema from 1 day after injection. The results show that bFGF did not produce any acute effects on the somatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system, smooth muscle and blood system. In contrast, bFGF produced slight effects on the circulatory system, central nervous system and kidney function when injected systemically. Subcutaneous administration may produce edema at the site of injection.

N2  - Objective - To investigate the role of sleeping arrangements as risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome after a national risk reduction campaign. Design - Two year population based case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted for each infant who died and for four controls matched for age and date of interview. Setting - Three regions in England with a total population of 17 million people. Subjects - 195 babies who died and 780 matched controls. Results - Prone and side sleeping positions both carried increased risks of death compared with supine when adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestation, birth weight, exposure to smoke, and other relevant factors in the sleeping environment (multivariate odds ratio = 9.00 (95% confidence interval 2.84 to 28.47) and 1.84 (1.02 to 3.31), respectively). The higher incidence of side rather than prone sleeping led to a higher population attributable risk (side 18.4%, prone 14.2%). More of the infants who died were found with bed covers over their heads (21.58; 6.21 to 74.99). The use of a dummy had an apparent protective effect (0.38; 0.21 to 0.70). Bed sharing for the whole night was a significant risk factor for infants whose mothers smoked (9.25; 2.31 to 34.02). No protective effect of breast feeding could be identified on multivariate analysis. Conclusions - This study confirms the importance of certain risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome and identifies others - for example, covers over the head, side sleeping position - which may be amenable to change by educating and informing parents and health care professionals.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea is a common medical condition characterized by periodic apneas during sleep that produce hypoxia and sleep disruption. Several cases of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy have been reported. In the case reported the woman admitted for evaluation and management of preeclampsia was observed experiencing apneic episodes and oxygen desaturation during sleep. Subsequent evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Pregnancy may be complicated by obstructive sleep apnea with potential adverse effects on the mother and fetus. Prompt diagnosis would allow early treatment and may prevent low birth weight and the development of preeclampsia.

N2  - Eight time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation (145 days = term) underwent surgery for placement of fetal vascular catheters, electrodes for recording fetal behavioural state, and maternal venous catheters. Three days later, fetal cerebral and myocardial blood flow were determined by the coloured microsphere technique under four conditions: (1) during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, before fetal cocaine infusion, (2) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the fetus at 0.2 mg/kg per min, (3) during REM sleep, before maternal cocaine infusion, and (4) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the ewe at 0.3 mg/kg per min. Cocaine infusion directly to the fetal lamb did not cause hypoxaemia or significantly change cerebral or myocardial blood flow or oxygen delivery. Cocaine administered to the ewe led to a drop in fetal oxygen tension from 3.0 ± 0.5 to 2.5 ± 0.3 kPa (P < 0.0001) and in fetal oxygen content from 3.8 ± 0.7 to 2.8 ± 0.4 mmol O2/L (P < 0.0001). Prior to maternal cocaine administration, fetal cerebral blood flow was 146 ± 103 mL/100 g per min and during maternal cocaine infusion it went to 184 ± 147 mt/100 g per min (P = NS) while myocardial blood flow increased from 156 ± 92 to 333 ± 178 mt/100 g per min (P < 0.002). This increase in blood flow negated the effects of hypoxaemia so that cerebral oxygen delivery was unaffected while myocardial oxygen delivery increased an average of 67%. It is concluded that cocaine administration to pregnant sheep does not impede fetal cerebral or myocardial oxygen delivery.

N2  - The article examines relationships between pregnancy and maternal sleep. Specifically, sleep as a restorative process is considered with regard for the metabolic and arousal demands of childbearing. The analysis draws attention to the limited number of studies in the area and the need for greater research interest in pregnancy sleep phenomena. The available evidence indicates that maternal slow-wave and rapid eye movement which are key to anabolic activity and neural-cerebral recharge, are protected throughout pregnancy until perhaps the last 3 to 4 weeks before delivery. The sleep disturbances about which term gravidas complain appear to be based on increased periods of wakefulness after sleep onset.

N2  - Descriptions of dreams of women during pregnancy have appeared in the literature for more than a century. Daydreams and sleep dreams are differentiated. A review of the literature published during the last four decades uncovered a limited number of empirical articles. The general consensus is that the sleep dreams of pregnant women are indicative of their concerns regarding safety for self and for the expected child. The most recent information focuses on the use of groups to help pregnant women explore the content of their dreams.

N2  - Objectives: (1) To develop an image analysis method for the measurement of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP); (2) To establish a correlation of urea-resistant fraction of NAP (URNAP)/NAP scoring between the manual and automated methods, and (3) to assess the value of URNAP/NAP in the prenatal screening of Down syndrome. Study Design: Slides from 15 unaffected controls were blindly scored by both methods. The Pearson test was used for correlation analysis. Slides from 15 Down syndrome pregnancies and 25 unaffected controls were scored manually. Results: A coefficient r = 0.93 was obtained comparing the URNAP/NAP scores generated by the two methods. Average time for scoring by the automated method was 8 min. The median URNAP/NAP values for Down syndrome and unaffected controls were 112/86.1 and 51/51.5, respectively, Conclusions: Scores obtained by both methods highly correlate. Automated scoring is threefold faster, Down syndrome cases have higher URNAP/NAP scores compared to unaffected controls, which suggests that URNAP/NAP is an extremely useful marker for mid-trimester prenatal screening.

N2  - Two patients with Type I Klippel-Feil syndrome presented at the antenatal clinic. The first patient, who suffered from sleep apnoea, was delivered of a healthy infant by vacuum extraction. The second, who was profoundly deaf and had marked kyphoscoliosis, developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and urinary tract infection and was delivered at 38 weeks by vacuum extraction. In both cases epidural analgesia was employed to allow pain relief during labour. Anaesthetic management of Klippel-Feil syndrome is discussed and the benefits of early anaesthetic assessment and continued involvement of senior anaesthetic and obstetric staff emphasized.

N2  - Objective. To verify and determine the cause of an increase in the referral of infants with plagiocephaly without synostosis (PWS) to a single tertiary craniofacial center. Design. A chart review was performed for 269 infants with a diagnosis of PWS who presented to a single tertiary craniofacial center between 1979 and 1994. The pattern of referral for PWS was analyzed using both simple linear regression and time series regression analyses. In addition, the referral pattern for PWS was compared with that for infants seen at the same center who received a diagnosis of synostotic plagiocephaly. Changes in the distribution of several demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables during the study period were also assessed. Finally, in an effort to identify correlates of the risk of PWS developing, characteristics of patients who were Missouri residents and presented between 1992 and 1994 were evaluated and compared with those of the 1993 Missouri live birth cohort. Setting. The Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Deformities Institute, St Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University Medical Center. Results. The average annual number of referrals to our center for PWS in the period 1992 to 1994 was more than sixfold greater than that for the preceding 13 years. There was a statistically significant increase in the annual number of referrals to our center during the 16-year study period. Moreover, there was evidence that the average annual increase in referrals was significantly greater during the last 3 years (1992 through 1994) of the study than in the first 13 years. This shift in the referral patterns is roughly contemporaneous with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations regarding infant sleep position. There was no evidence that either the mean number of referrals or the average annual increase in referrals for patients with synostosis changed during the study period. Among patients with PWS, the average age at presentation did not change during the study period. There were also no significant changes in the distribution of other demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables. When compared with the Missouri birth cohort, infants with PWS were significantly more likely to be boys and to have been delivered by forceps. There was also some evidence that patients with PWS were more likely to be born prematurely and to be products of multiple-gestation pregnancies. These associations were, however, of only borderline statistical significance. Conclusion. Referrals to our center for PWS increased markedly in 1992 relative to previous years. The temporal coincidence of this increase with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to avoid the prone sleeping position, to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, suggests a possible causal relationship. If this association is causal, education regarding the need for head position rotation coupled with that for sudden infant death syndrome should obviate positional PWS.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study whether multiple pregnancy at the third trimester predisposes to breathing disturbances and arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Nocturnal breathing, oxygenation, and movement activity were studied in 10 mothers: 8 with twins, 1 with triplets, and 1 with quadruplets. RESULTS: No obstructive and few central sleep apnea episodes were observed. Four subjects had episodes of increased respiratory resistance, but only one, the mother with quadruplets, was significantly affected. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was always maintained above 90%. Periodic leg movements were present in all mothers, with a frequency range of 3.7 to 49.7 movements per hour. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the large uterus in multiple pregnancy, nocturnal breathing and oxygenation are well maintained. Increased motor activity and frequent awakenings suggest poor sleep quality, which may be further compromised by intensive periodic leg movements.

N2  - A questionnaire survey was conducted amongst parents in the military community in British Forces Germany to investigate the prevalence of known and suspected risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Over a thousand questionnaires were returned (response rate 58%) and these showed that the prevalence of babies being placed in the prone position to sleep is now extremely low and the use of room thermometers to help control ambient temperature is widespread. However 29% of the mothers had smoked in pregnancy and 44% of households with a new-born baby had at least one parent who smoked. Additional health promotion activity aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking in pregnancy and amongst the parents of new-born babies is recommended.

N2  - Objective. The third trimester of pregnancy is characterized by a mildly hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, possibly driven by elevated circulating levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) of placental origin. In-vitro studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids and oestrogen stimulate while progesterone inhibits the expression of CRH mRNA and/or protein, suggesting that several potential interactions between the placenta and the HPA axis may exist. Design and patients. To investigate the detailed pattern of circulating immunoreactive (ir) CRH, ACTH, cortisol, oestradiol and progesterone during the third trimester of pregnancy, plasma samples were drawn serially every 30 minutes from 22 healthy pregnant women (age 32.0 ± 1.1 years, mean ± SE) between the 34th and 36th week of gestation. Ten women had plasma samples drawn between 0800 h and 2000 h (daytime group), and 12 between 2000 h and 0800 h (night-time group). The hormone concentrations obtained were analysed for pulsatility by the Detect program, for detection of circadian rhythmicity by comparison between the first and second 6-hour periods within each group by Student's t-test, and for time-dependent correlations by cross-correlation analysis. Results. All five hormones were secreted in a pulsatile fashion. There was no apparent circadian rhythm of CRH or oestradiol secretion, whereas there was a clear circadian rhythm in plasma ACTH, cortisol and progesterone secretion, with the latter in reverse phase (P < 0.05). No significant correlations were observed between CRH and ACTH, whereas, as expected, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were strongly correlated with each other over time (r = 0.32 and 0.70 at lag time 30 minutes for the daytime and night-time groups, respectively), with ACTH leading cortisol. A weak positive correlation was observed between CRH and cortisol concentrations for the night-time group at lag time 0 minute, suggesting that the latter may have a positive effect on the former in vivo. Conclusions. These data suggest that placental CRH, although pulsatile, drives quantitatively the maternal HPA axis in the third trimester of pregnancy in a non-circadian, non-pulsatile fashion. The maternal HPA axis is probably driven in a circadian and pulsatile fashion by another major ACTH secretagogue, most likely AVP or parvocellular paraventricular nucleus origin.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether the prone sleep position was associated with an increased risk of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Study design: Population-based case-control study. Participants: Case subjects were infants who died of SIDS in King County, Washington. Control subjects were randomly selected infants born in King County. Up to four control subjects were matched on date of birth to each case subject. Methods: During the study period, November 1992 through October 1994, sleep-position data were collected on infants who died of SIDS by the King County Medical Examiner's Office during their investigation of the deaths. Parents of infants chosen as control subjects were contacted by telephone, and sleep position information was obtained. Infants who usually slept on their abdomen were classified as sleeping prone; those who usually slept on the side or back were categorized as sleeping nonprone. The adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was calculated with conditional logistic regression after control for race, birth weight, maternal age, maternal marital status, household income, and maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Results: Sleep position data were collected on 47 infants with SIDS (77% of eligible infants) and 142 matched control subjects; 57.4% of infants who died of SIDS usually slept prone versus 24.6% of control subjects (p <0.00001). The unadjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.17, 10.17). After control for potentially confounding variables, the adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position was 3.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 9.03). Conclusion: Prone sleep position was significantly associated with an increased risk of SIDS among a group of American infants.

N2  - Periods of no coincidence (PsNC) among state variables appear to be more predictive of neurobehavioral outcome than the amount of time spent in any particular behavioral state. It has recently been suggested that analysis of the ordering of state variables during a state transition may provide results equivalent to full state analysis. If this were the case, then there ought to be a relationship between the duration of PsNC and fetal heart rate (FHR)-fetal eye movement (FEM) sequencing at the time of a state change. To test this hypothesis, we compared full state analysis with analysis of individual state transitions for 52 normal human fetuses between 38 and 42 weeks of gestation. For the study population as a whole, FHR was the first variable to change in 62 (77%) of 81 1F → 2F transitions and FEM was the first variable to change in 50 (63%) of 79 2F → 1F transitions (χ2 = 67.9, P < 0.001). Ordering of FTIR and FEM at the time of a state change was reversed in 8 (67%) of 12 fetuses with PsNC ≥ 15% and in only 6 (15%) of 40 fetuses with PsNC < 15% (χ2 = 12.5, p < 0.001). We conclude that fetuses who exhibit poor state organization more often display a FHR-FEM sequence at the time of a state transition which is opposite that of fetuses with considerably better state control. However, since only one-third of fetuses with reversed FHR-FEM sequencing actually exhibited more than one such episode, it is unlikely that isolated analysis of state transitions will provide a reliable measure of behavioral state organization in the individual fetus.

N2  - Comparison of 1 mg Gemeprost-Vaginal Suppositories Serial Application versus Sulproston i.v.: Three different regimens for the termination of second and third trimester pregnancies by the use of prostaglandins (PG) were compared in a retrospective analysis. In group A (n = 16) terminations were attempted by continuous i.v. infusion of Sulproston 9 hours after administration of a 3 mg-PGE2-vaginal tablet overnight. In group B (n = 22), i.v. Sulproston was started 2 hours after priming with 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories. The outcome of these two regimens was compared with that of repeated administration of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals (group C, n = 25). In each group, if uterine contractions failed to appear after one day, the treatment was discontinued for a sleep rest over night and then resumed. Genetic disorders or fetal malformations were the most frequent reasons for termination. Patients with intrauterine fetal demise, rupture of the membranes, preterm labour or a ripe cervix (Bishop Score > 3) were excluded. Median time intervals from induction to abortion were 33 hours in group A and 23 hours in each Group B and C. The rate of fetal expulsions within 12, 24 and 36 hours in groups B and C were similar. Women of parity ≥ 1 showed significantly shorter intervals than nulliparae in groups A and C. Only one woman (in group A) failed to expel after induction, in four other cases (in groups A and B) complications (local thrombophlebitis, bronchospasm) were noted. The serial administration of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals showed fewer side effects and seems to be as efficient as sulproston i.v. after cervical ripening.

N2  - Beside well-established clinical benefits, the current doses of ocstrogens may induce clinical side-effects leading to non-compliance and loss of efficacy. During a normal menstrual cycle the incidence of any cyclic discomfort is consistently reported to be lowest during the mid- follicular phase when plasma E2 remains between 60 and 150 pg/ml. The incidence of pregnancy-like symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness and mood swings tends to increase in mid-luteal phase when E2 increases upto 150 pg/ml. On the other hand incidence of asthenia, sleep disturbances, depressive mood, headaches and migraines increase during perimenstrual days when E2 drops to 40 pg/ml or below. Accordingly experimental and human studies in castrated animals and postmenopausal women suggest that plasma E2 around 100 pg/ml is optimal for treatment of hot flushes, prevention of bone loss and cardiovascular protection. Due to large interindividual variation in estrogen clearance rate, it is unlikely that any standardized unique dose of oral or non- oral formulations will reproduce the optimal levels in all postmenopausal users. Efforts for individual titration are mandatory to improve compliance and actual efficacy on a long term. Because older postmenopausal women tend to have a better clinical tolerance to low E2 levels, objective markers of efficacy should also be identified when the aim of HRT is the prevention of osteoporosis or vascular diseases. In addition clinical and metabolic side-effects related to added progestins can be substantially reduced by the use of lower dose inducing amenorrhea and by progesterone instead of synthetic steroids.

N2  - Immunological monitoring of disease progression following HIV infection and seroconversion illness, latency and AIDS, not only helps in the basic investigation of the natural history of the viral infection in man, but also can assist in prognosis and treatment of AIDS-defining illnesses. However, outside clinical trials, these tests should be selected and used in clinical practice only if they are validated as relevant and effective. The absolute CD4+ T-helper lymphocyte count, measured by flow cytometry, has emerged as the best available investigation, but needs care in sampling due to diurnal and circadian rhythms, effects of age, pregnancy, therapy, intercurrent infections and technique. Sampling should provide a baseline and trends-monthly intervals initially, then quarterly in uncomplicated cases. Thresholds may be given for counts (e.g. 200/microliter) below which prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia should be administered, and repeating persistently low counts (e.g. below 50/microliter) is seldom helpful in practice. Serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin and immunoglobulins rarely add information. Physicians and laboratories should have testing guidelines based on clinical audit of best practice, based in turn on scientific understanding of the immunological processes involved.

N2  - The influence of dosing time on the embryotoxicity of sodium valproate (valproic acid, VPA) was investigated in ICR mice under a light-dark (12:12) cycle. A significant circadian rhythm was shown for VPA-induced embryotoxicity, with the highest value at 1700 and the lowest at 0100. A similar pattern of rhythm was also shown for VPA-induced toxicity in pregnant and nonpregnant mice. No significant dosing time-dependent difference between injection at 1700 and 0100 was demonstrated for VPA concentrations in the embryo, plasma and brain. The rhythm in the embryotoxicity seems to be related to the rhythm in the sensitivity of the embryo and dam to the drug. Embryotoxicity and VPA concentrations were significantly higher on gestational day 13 than day 7. The pharmacokinetics of VPA contribute, at least partly, to the gestational stage-dependent embryotoxicity of VPA. The timing of drug administration (i.e., gestational stage and circadian phase) appears to be essential for studies on the embryotoxicity of VPA in mice.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. To compare indicators of fetal outcome in pregnant women with self-reported frequent snoring vs those without snoring. Study design: Prospective, nonrandomized screening and comparison between groups. Patients: Three hundred fifty pregnant women and 110 age-matched nonpregnant women. Methods: Survey evaluating self-reported snoring. For the pregnant women, infant birthweight, APGAR scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were obtained by record review. Results: Frequent snoring was reported in 14% of the pregnant women vs 4% of the nonpregnant women (χ2=6.2; df=1; p<0.05). The pregnant women who reported frequent snoring did not have deliveries resulting in infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcomes. Conclusions: Frequent snoring is reported more often in pregnant than in nonpregnant women. Snoring mothers do not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with fetal compromise as might ha expected with the concomitant occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea.

N2  - The circadian rhythms of fetal and neonatal rodents are entrained by their mother. This entrainment is dependent upon the maternal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but the mechanism of entrainment is unknown. Administration of the pineal hormone melatonin to pregnant, SCN-lesioned female Syrian hamsters entrains the activity rhythms of their hamster pups. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin injected directly in neonatal Syrian hamsters is able to entrain circadian rhythms and, if so, for how long this effect persists during development. Injection of melatonin in two groups of hamster pups at opposite phases on postnatal days 1-5 entrained the onset of activity rhythms on the day of weaning to two phases 10.67 h apart. Melatonin injection did not entrain activity rhythms to opposite phases on either postnatal days 6-10 or 21-25. Vehicle injection did not entrain animals to opposite phases at any of the ages studied. These results demonstrate that melatonin is able to act directly on the neonate to cause entrainment and that this effect disappears after postnatal day 6.

N2  - The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlations between retrospective and prospective assessments of sleep. Subjective reports of sleep characteristics and sleep quality were obtained from 146 young (20-40 years, average age 29.15) healthy men (n = 43), nonpregnant (n = 70) and from 146 young (20-40 years, average age 29.15) healthy men (n = 33). Three types of subjective sleep reports were obtained: (1) general estimates of sleep habits (retrospective measures); (2) sleep logs completed upon awakening on three successive workdays (prospective measures); and (3) general sleep complaints. Men showed the greatest stability in the sleep log reports, followed by nonpregnant women, with pregnant women showing the least stability. Significant positive correlations between prospective (log reported) and retrospective (general estimates) sleep measures were found only for men. However, for measures of sleep quality, such as feelings of fatigue upon awakening, women showed greater agreement between their general estimates and three nightly reports. The limitations of using retrospective estimates in sleep surveys are discussed.

N2  - Objectives: To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight, height, age and sex. Design: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE - BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc). Results: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated. Conclusions: There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the sleep-wake patterns of fullterm (≥ 37 weeks) newborns and to evaluate the effects of specific factors including maternal gestational diabetes, infant size and anthropometric measures, gender, gestational age and delivery variables. Methods: Two-hundred twenty newborns were studied in the hospital nursery for a continuous 24-h period with miniature activity monitors attached to the infants' ankles. The sample consisted of 102 infants of gestational diabetic mothers (IGDM) and 118 controls. Anthropometric measurements were obtained and maternal and infant characteristics were recorded. Results: The newborns had a discernible diurnal sleep pattern and slept twice as much during the nighttime as daytime hours (P < 0.001). Higher skinfold measurements correlated significantly with increased quiet and motionless sleep (P < 0.05) for the IGDM but not for controls. Sleep of infants born at later gestational ages was characterized by increased percent of quiet and motionless sleep (P < 0.0001). No direct gender effects were identified. Conclusions: Multiple factors were associated with the sleep-wake patterns of the newborns on our study cohort including maternal glucose values during pregnancy, increased measures of adiposity in IGDM, increased gestational age, mode of delivery and delivery Sequence. Investigation of the sleep-wake characteristics of neonates using activity monitors is a noninvasive method for gaining new understanding of the relationships between sleep wake activity patterns and infant characteristics.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome is characterized by unpleasant, deep-seated paresthesias in the legs and sometimes the arms. These sensations occur at rest and are relieved by movement. Sleep disturbance is common. Many patients also have periodic movements of sleep. Mild symptoms of restless legs occur in up to 5% of the population. Restless legs syndrome is idiopathic in most patients, but it may be the presenting feature of iron deficiency and is also common in uremia, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyneuropathy. Treatment of the underlying cause, when possible, usually relieves the symptoms. For patients with severe symptoms, levodopa, bromocriptine mesylate, opioids, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and clonidine hydrochloride have proved to be effective.

N2  - Thyroid hormone production is regulated via pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) modulation of thyroxine (T4) prohormone secretion by the thyroid gland and regulation of active triiodothyronine (T3) production in peripheral tissues via metabolic events influencing activities of the iodothyronine monodeiodinase enzyme systems. Control at both levels is developmentally regulated and modified in serious nonthyroidal illness (trauma, infection, cancer, metabolic diseases). Racial and gender differences are of little significance except for the effects of placental estrogens and thorionic gonadotropin during pregnancy. There is a circadian rhythm of TSH secretion, with peak values at the onset of sleep and nadir concentrations during the afternoon hours. Peak and nadir concentrations differ by ~±50%. The effect on circulating T4 and T3 concentrations is not significant because of the large size of the extrathyroidal T4 pool. In healthy subjects there is no significant impact of body weight, physical training, body habitus, posture, immobilization, exercise, or ambulatory status on thyroid function, and no significant geographic environmental variation. Nutrition also has a minimal impact except for variation in iodine intake. Subthreshold concentrations of iodine intake are associated with increased TSH secretion, goiter, increased thyroid iodine uptake, decreased T4 production, an increased T3/T4 secretion ratio, and an increased ratio of circulating T3/T4 concentrations. Excessive iodine intake can block thyroid hormone biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic process, resulting in reduced T4 secretion, increased TSH concentrations, goiter, and hypothyroidism if the iodine excess is chronic.

N2  - Women's experiences during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period were examined relative to time of discharge from the hospital. Women who were discharged in 3 days or sooner were compared to women who were discharged after 3 days or sooner were compared to women who were discharged after 3 days, with respect to fatigue. A rest and activity questionnaire was completed by the women in the third trimester of pregnancy, in postpartum Week 1, and in postpartum Week 4. Few differences were found with respect to hours slept, number of sleep interruptions, perceptions of tiredness, and impact of tiredness on daily life; tiredness was a major aspect of women's experience, regardless of how long they stayed in hospital. The information will help nurses preparing women for their late pregnancy and postpartum experiences and will ease the concern of those who believe women will be more tired if they leave hospital soon after birth.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in sleep patterns during pregnancy to better understand sleep regulation during pregnancy. We uninterruptedly recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and brain temperature (Tbr) throughout pregnancy in rats. The duration of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep decreased after day 5 of pregnancy associated with an inverse increase in the number of non-REM sleep episodes. Thus, the amount of total non-REM sleep time remained constant throughout pregnancy. The amount of total REM sleep time decreased on day 17 of pregnancy after which the reduced state was sustained. That was mainly due to a decrease in the number of REM sleep episodes. Brain temperature (Tbr) gradually decreased as pregnancy advanced, reaching its lowest value 3 days before delivery. These observations provide a better understanding of the sleep patterns during pregnancy, and useful information for investigation of mechanisms of sleep regulation during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To ascertain whether circadian rhythms for fetal movements and fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics are detectable in early pregnancy with three one-hour observations. Methods: Ten nulliparous women were studied at 13 weeks gestation by real-time ultrasound observations, and 10 additional nulliparous women were studied at 22 weeks by real-time ultrasound observations synchronous with computerised fetal heart rate recordings. All the observations took place at 8:00, 14:00 and 22:00 hours. Results: No circadian rhythms were found at 13 weeks. At 22 weeks significant circadian changes were observed for motor activity in terms of total activity and gross body and breathing movement distribution over time. The lowest values were found in the morning and the highest in the evening. No circadian rhythms were found for the incidence of accelerations and decelerations at 22 weeks. However, circadian rhythms were observed for both basal FHR and FHR variability, with basal FHR being lowest in the evening observations and FHR variability in the morning observations. Conclusions: At 22 weeks of gestation circadian rhythms are detectable for fetal movements, basal FHR and FHR variability, even with three one-hour observations. This procedure is no far from common clinical practice, thus confirming the importance of considering circadian rhythms when performing biophysical examinations, also in the early pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: The aims of this work were to establish automated blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) standards during the three trimesters of pregnancy and to analyze the chronobiological trend of blood pressure during gestation. Methods: A longitudinal study using 24-h ABPM was performed on 192 healthy pregnant women, (aged 20-42 years, mean ± S.D. 28 ± 5) both nulliparas (n = 85) and multiparas (n = 107), and also on 26 pregnant women with chronic hypertension and 132 preeclamptic patients. The arterial pressure (AP) of the healthy women, at the start of the pregnancy, was < 140/90 mmHg, as measured by the standard mercury sphygmomanometer, and it remained so at subsequent check-ups throughout the pregnancy and puerperium. AP was monitored using the Spacelabs 90207 (Nippon Collin, Takeda UA 751), beginning at 08:00 h. Results. The normal pregnancies demonstrated an AP circadian rhythm with daytime systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) values about 8-9 mmHg (P < 0.01) higher than at night. In the normal pregnancies, the mean 24-h AP values, like mean daytime and night-time, SAP and DAP values, remained the same in the first two trimesters, while a slight but significant increase occurred in the third (P < 0.05). Conclusions. This study enabled a range of normal pressure values to be deduced for each hour of the day throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy. This may facilitate a more accurate evaluation of individual pressure readings in pregnant women so as to ensure a more reliable and timely diagnosis of hypertension.

N2  - Genetically based alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects. To examine this question, measures of growth and survival were examined in offspring of the alcohol sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines following prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant LS and SS mice received an ethanol dose of either 6 or 8 g/kg/day from days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Control groups received a maltose-dextrin solution made isocaloric to the 8 g/kg/day dose. Ethanol and maltose-dextrin solutions were administered as split doses, 6 h apart, via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow control groups were also included for both mouse lines. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred stock. Pregnancy was longer for ethanol-treated LS dams compared to maltose dextrin and lab chow LS control groups, whereas pregnancy length for ethanol- treated SS dams was similar to SS controls. Prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in dose-related growth deficits in LS but not in SS litters. Line differences in postnatal growth deficits in response to prenatal alcohol exposure suggest maternal or fetal alcohol sensitivity influence alcohol- related birth defects.

N2  - Acetylcholine has been implicated in brainstem mechanisms of cardiac and ventilatory control, arousal, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and cranial nerve motor activity. Virtually nothing is known about the developmental profiles of cholinergic perikarya, fibers, terminals, and/or receptors in the brainstems of human fetuses and infants. This study provides baseline information about the quantitative distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in fetal and infant brainstems. Brainstem sections were analyzed from 6 fetuses (median age: 21.5 postconceptional weeks), 4 premature infants (median age: 26 postconceptional weeks), and 11 infants (median age: 53 postconceptional weeks). One child and three adult brainstems were examined as indices of maturity for comparison. The postmortem interval in all cases was less than or equal to 24 hours (median: 10 hours). Muscarinic receptors were localized by autoradiographic methods with the radiolabeled antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB). Computer-based methods permitted quantitation of [3H]QNB binding in specific nuclei and three-dimensional reconstructions of binding patterns. By midgestation, muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding is already present and regionally distributed, with the highest binding levels in the interpeduncular nucleus, inferior colliculus, griseum pontis, nucleus of the solitary tract, motor cranial nerve nuclei, and reticular formation. During the last half of gestation, [3H]QNB binding decreases in most, but not all, of the nuclei sampled. The most substantial decline occurs in the reticular formation of the medulla and pons, a change that is not fully explained by progressive myelination and lipid quenching. Binding levels remain essentially constant in the inferior olive and griseum pontis. Around the time of birth or shortly thereafter, the relative distribution of binding becomes similar to that in the adult, with the highest levels in the interpeduncular nucleus and griseum pontis, although binding levels are higher overall in the infant. In the rostral pontine reticular formation, paramedian bands of high muscarinic binding are present which do not correspond to a cytoarchitectonically defined nucleus. By analogy to animal studies, these bands may comprise a major cholinoreceptive region of the human rostral pontine reticular formation involved in REM sleep. In the human interpeduncular nucleus in all age periods examined, muscarinic binding localizes to the lateral portions bilaterally, indicative of a heterogeneous chemoarchitecture. Muscarinic binding is high in the arcuate nucleus, a component of the putative respiratory chemosensitive fields along the ventral surface of the infant medulla. This observation is consistent with the known effects of muscarinic agents on chemosensitivity and ventilatory responses applied to the ventral medullary surface in animal models. The nonuniform distribution of muscarinic binding in the caudorostral plane in individual brainstem nuclei, as illustrated by three-dimensional reconstructions, underscores the need for rigorous sampling at precisely matched levels in quantitative studies. This study provides basic information toward understanding the neurochemical basis of brainstem disorders involving dysfunction of autonomic and ventilatory control, arousal, and REM sleep in preterm and full-term newborns and infants and for developing cholinergic drugs for such disorders in the pediatric population.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between fetal behavior and maternal anxiety during pregnancy. The study population consisted of 18 uncomplicated human pregnancies at 38 to 40 weeks gestation. Maternal anxiety was assessed one time using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After an overnight fast, each mother was given a standard meal on arrival to the fetal testing unit. Each fetus was examined for 4 hours using heart rate monitoring and real-time sonography. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. We found that, compared with fetuses of mothers with low trait anxiety scores, fetuses of mothers with relatively high trait anxiety scores spent significantly more time in quiet sleep and exhibited less gross body movement when in active sleep. The results of this pilot study raise the possibility that maternal anxiety during pregnancy may have a significant effect on fetal behavior.

N2  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a circadian oscillator in mammals and shows day-night changes in metabolic activity. To investigate whether the fetal sheep SCN behaves as a circadian oscillator, day-night changes in c-fos expression, a marker of neuronal activity, were measured. Eight fetal sheep were sacrificed at 135 days gestation--four at day-time (1200 hours) and four at night-time (2400 hours). Fetal brains were fixed, removed and cut in 40-microns serial coronal sections. Alternate sections were incubated with anti-Fos antibody (1:500) and Fos expression was revealed with extra-avidin-peroxidase and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine or stained with cresyl violet. The number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) neurons per mm2 in the rostral, intermediate and caudal regions of the fetal sheep SCN was counted. Fetuses sacrificed in the day-time showed a higher number of Fos-ir neurons per mm2 (mean +/- s.e.; 516.7 +/- 60.1) in the three regions of the SCN than fetuses sacrificed at night-time (140.5 +/- 21.8). In addition, at night-time Fos-ir neurons were mainly localized to the ventrolateral area of the SCN. These findings demonstrate day-night changes in molecular activity consistent with the presence of a circadian oscillator in the fetal sheep SCN.

N2  - This review, based on the fourth International Consensus Conference on Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring by noninvasive intermittent techniques is widely used despite artifacts due to cuff size, movement, body position, short-term blood pressure variability, and interference with sleep. The performance of the currently available monitors under truly ambulatory conditions and during exercise remains a matter of debate, as are the procedures required to validate portable monitors under these circumstances. There is general agreement that whenever a monitor is to be used in special populations, such as a older subjects or pregnant women, or in special conditions, such as exercise, a specific demonstration of its accuracy in these defined subgroups or conditions is warranted. Whether the auscultatory or oscillometric method is preferred remains controversial because each technique has specific advantages and disadvantages and because both can provide accurate results. Most experts in the field strongly believe that manufacturers should disclose the algorithms of their devices and that they should specify all changes made to the hardware and software of a previously validated monitor. Finally, the development of the volume-clamp method, which makes continuous noninvasive registration of blood pressure at the finger possible in both stationary and ambulatory conditions, opens new perspectives in research, in particular in relation to short-term blood pressure variability.

N2  - Knowledge of the natural history of different types of OI permits planning of rehabilitation goals for children with OI. Notwithstanding this knowledge, rehabilitation will need to be modified to accommodate unexpected fractures and the highly variable chance of deformity in each individual. Immobilisation should be minimized to avoid immobilization osteoporosis. New rehabilitation issues include basilar impression, recommencement of fractures in postmenopausal women with OI, pregnancy related bone loss and sleep apnoea.

N2  - Wistar rats were exposed to dichlorvos [CAS number 62737]. Doses were 1/25; 1/50; 1/75; and 1/100 LD50, that is 3.88; 1.94; 1.46; and 0.97 mg kg-1 DDVP, respectively, throughout gestation (GD1-birth) and during suckling via oral dosing to the dams, and then via the same doses by gavage for the rest of their lives. The offspring were tested in an open field (OF), a multiple T-maze, and in a 'novelty-induced-grooming' test to assess behavioural competence as adults. Dose-related increases in running time and incorrect choices in the maze were observed during the first 2 weeks of a 3-week study at 9-11 weeks of age. Horizontal activity was increased, vertical activity decreased, and defecation decreased in the OF at 9-12 weeks of age; these changes were again dose-related. Sleep was also affected at 12 weeks of age. AChE activity in the brain and in blood at sacrifice was roughly 40% to 65% of control, again reflecting the doses administered. The significantly changed behavioural profile of DDVP treated rats may serve as a useful biomarker to judge functional damage of CNS properties.

N2  - Background: A growing number of residents are having babies during residency training. While many businesses are working to improve maternity conditions and benefits for their employees, residency programs are often not prepared to accommodate pregnant residents. This study was conducted to examine the maternity leave experiences of women who delivered infants during their family practice residency training. Methods: Program directors from each of the 394 family practice residency programs listed in the 1993 Directory of Family Practice Residency Programs were asked to distribute surveys to female residents who gave birth during their residency training and had returned to work by the time of the study. Results: Of 199 known eligible residents, 171 (86%) completed surveys; these women represented 127 programs located in 36 states and Puerto Rico. Only 56.8% of women were aware of their program having a written maternity leave policy. The average length of maternity leave was 8 weeks; 76% had leaves of 10 weeks or less. For many, the maternity leave was derived from more than one source, including vacation, sick time, or a mother-child elective. Nearly all (88.3%) the women breast-fed, and the mean duration of breast-feeding was more than 19 weeks. In general, participants believed that having a baby during residency was somewhat difficult. Problems frequently encountered by women after their return to work included sleep deprivation and tiredness, difficulty arranging for child care, guilt about child care, and breast-feeding. Factors that detracted most from the childbirth experience were too little sleep, problems arranging for child care, and lack of support from the partner, residency faculty, and other residents. Conclusions: Having a baby during residency is somewhat difficult for the average female resident. Factors that may ease this difficulty include getting adequate sleep and receiving support from one's partner, faculty, and other residents.

N2  - Nocturnal nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is increasingly used to treat chronic respiratory failure in a wide variety of conditions (myopathies, Ondine's curse, kyphoscoliosis, etc.) and allows a normal everyday life. Some of these diseases affect women of childbearing age. We report on a young woman suffering from primary alveolar hypoventilation, who presented with limitation of daytime activities, severe oxygen desaturation during sleep, polycythaemia and pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities completely reversed after a few months of NIPPV applied through a nasal mask. Whilst under ventilatory assistance during sleep, she had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery of a normal baby. We suggest that in selected patients requiring NIPPV, pregnancy can be contemplated with a reasonable level of safety both for the mother and the child, provided that adequate mechanical ventilatory assistance during sleep is maintained throughout pregnancy.

N2  - There is considerable evidence that the childbearing years represent a time when women are highly vulnerable to developing mood disorders. Prospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective studies have demonstrated that more than 10% of new adult mothers will experience a major depressive episode during the first postpartum year. Changes in the health care delivery system will result in increased pressure on the obstetrician/gynecologist to identify and treat women with postpartum-onset depression. Despite shortcomings in the available literature, prospective studies have identified risk factors for developing postpartum depression. Furthermore, the clear overlap between the normal sequelae of childbirth and the symptoms of major depression, including alterations in sleep, energy, libido, appetite, and body weight, underscores the need to develop guidelines for early identification. We furnish a brief overview of postpartum mood disorders with a primary focus on the antenatal and postnatal risk factors for developing postpartum depression. Based on the extant literature and our clinical experience, a set of recommendations for early identification and treatment is provided.

N2  - This study assessed effects of prolonged prenatal cocaine exposure on respiratory pattern and sleep-wake states in a postnatal porcine model. Yucatan miniature sows received 2 mg/kg cocaine intravenously four times daily during 0.66-1.0 gestation. At birth, cocaine-exposed litters were fostered to unexposed paired sows and their litters. Chronically instrumented piglets were studied at 3-9 (young) and 21-31 days (older). Sleep-wake states were determined from electrocorticogram, eye movements, submental electromyogram, and behavior, and respiratory patterns were determined from diaphragmatic and posterior cricoarytenoid electromyograms (EMGdi and EMGpca, respectively). Under baseline conditions, prenatal cocaine 1) increased the number of apneas expressed by silence of EMGdi or EMGpca and prolonged the duration of EMGpca-related apneas at both ages; 2) increased the number of periodic breathing episodes at both ages; 3) increased percent time of active sleep and decreased that of wakefulness at both ages; and 4) increased time in quiet sleep in the older animals, producing in them a sleep-wake distribution similar to that of the young neonates. Whereas the findings in the youngest piglets may have been influenced by persistent systemic cocaine, these in the older preexposed piglets, devoid of systemic cocaine, imply that chronic prenatal cocaine retards the postnatal maturation of state and respiratory pattern.

N2  - Measures of autonomic nervous system functioning have received considerable attention because of the recognition that differences in sympathetic-parasympathetic balance may account for differences in neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this study was to determine if human fetuses could be categorized as either sympathetic-dominated or parasympathetic-dominated based on an analysis of the resting heart rate variability power distribution. The study population consisted of 17 normal human fetuses in quiet sleep between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. The fetal electrocardiogram was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted from the raw data using adaptive signal processing techniques. The fetal R-wave interbeat intervals (IBIs) were converted to equally spaced, time-based data, and linear detrending was accomplished by subtracting the mean heart period from each weighted IBI. Total power (TP, 0.0-2.5 Hz) was divided into respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, 0.4-1.0 Hz) and low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.2) regions. Cluster analysis divided fetuses into two groups: one group (N = 9) had a large RSA component (>20% of TP) and a small LF/RSA ratio (<1.5), indicating relatively high parasympathetic tone; and the other group (N = 8) had a small RSA component (<20% of TP) and a large LF/RSA ratio (>1.5), indicating relatively high sympathetic tone. With increasing TP, fetuses classified as sympathetic- dominated exhibited a greater increase in LF power and less of an increase in RSA power than did fetuses classified as parasympathetic dominated. The finding that fetuses can be classified according to the degree of sympathetic-parasympathetic balance may have important implications regarding the appearance of certain behavioral tendencies early in life.

N2  - The aim of our study was to evaluate by means of ambulatory 24 h monitoring the diurnal systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure profiles in a group (n = 18) of gravid patients with pre-eclampsia compared with a group (n = 17) of healthy control subjects matched for age and week of gestation to assess whether: (i) ambulatory BP is also raised in pre-eclampsia; (ii) the increase of BP, if present, occurs to the same extent during both daytime and night; and (iii) a blunted BP pattern is consistently present in preeclampsia. BP was recorded at intervals of 15 min for 25 h using a TM2420 non-invasive pressurometer. The presence of a circadian rhythm of BP was assessed by cosinor analysis. SBP was higher in women with pre-eclampsia (24 h average 115 ± 11 vs. 136 ± 12, P = 6 x 10-6; daytime 117 ± 12 vs. 139 ± 13, P = 6 x 10-6; night 110 ± 11 vs. 129 ± 14, P = 5 x 10-5) as well as DBP (24 h average 67 ± 5 vs. 86 ± 6, P = 8 x 10-12; daytime 69 ± 6 vs. 89 ± 5, P = 2 x 10-11; night 62 ± 4 vs. 80 ± 8, P = 5 x 10-10). DBP percentage reduction from day to night did not differ between the control subjects and the women with pre-eclampsia (9.6 ± 6.5 vs. 9.8 ± 4.6, P = 0.96), whereas SBP percentage reduction was greater in the latter group (5.4 ± 4.6 vs. 8.1 ± 5.5, P = 0.13). Cosinor analysis demonstrated the presence of a significant circadian rhythm of BP (P < 0.0001) in both the control and pre-eclampsia groups. In conclusion, the results of our study show that ambulatory SBP and DBP are raised in pre-eclampsia and that a blunting of the diurnal BP pattern is not present in most women with the disease.

N2  - A low-molecular-weight form of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), urinary gonadotropin peptide (UGP), has been isolated from the urine of pregnant women and of patients with cancer, mainly of gynecological origin. The clinical value of UGP measurement in gynecological diseases is under investigation but a preliminary study is necessary in order to ascertain whether there is a circadian rhythm in UGP production, to clarify the best way to express the results, and to establish the cutoff and decisional values. In our work we demonstrated a significant correlation between the UGP output and the UGP excretion normalized for urinary creatinine. A very significant agreement was even found in 24-hr urine collections and UGP concentration of a single morning specimen from the same patients. No evident circadian rhythm was found, although some patients presented morning levels of UGP higher than in other collections. UGP postmenopausal levels were higher than premenopausal. The cutoff level, adopting the 95.0 percentile, was 200 pmol/mol creatinine.

N2  - Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration circadian rhythm is abolished in many endocrine and non-endocrine diseases. In the present study we have measured serum TSH concentration over 24 h every 2 h in second and third trimester pregnant women. During the 24-h period, serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations did not change significantly. In contrast, serum TSH concentrations demonstrated significant circadian variations both in the second and third trimester pregnant women (p < 0.02 and p < 0.005, respectively). In summary, second and third trimester pregnancy is associated with a normal circadian TSH rhythm.

N2  - To establish normal values for flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the preterm period, we analyzed 356 records from 63 neurologicall normal infants (26-35 weeks gestation) followed longitudinally. Using both sleep and drowsy state recording within he same session and a mean of 5.7 weekly recording sessions per infant, we hypothesized that the prominent negative wave (N1) consisted of 2 negative components, N1a (early) and N1 (late). This hypothesis could explain the previously reorted variability in VEP indices. With a precise definition of the N1 peak, we were able to establish reference ranges for N1 peak latencies at various postmenstrual ages (PMA) which, unlike those previously reported, are narrow enough to be clinically useful. From a cross-sectional analysis we found that the N1 peak latency decreased with maturation at about 4.6 msec/week between 30 and 40 weeks PMA (P < 0.001). We also analyzed the N1 wave form and demonstrated its developmental maturation during this period. There were significant decreases in the amplitudes of both the N1 and Nib peaks with maturation (P < 0.001), but the decrease of the N1 amplitude was steeper than that of Nib. The N1 wave form changed from a wave in which the early peak (N1) was higher than the late peak (Nib) into the reverse with Nib higher than N1a. This wave change may be related to developmental processes in the visual system. Longitudinal follow-up revealed that extra-uterine life may accelerate the maturation of the N1 wave form but has no effect on the decrease of the absolute values of peak latencies.

N2  - Maternal cigarette smoking has a high correlation with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a condition in which cardiorespiratory failure occurs during an hypoxic episode, as in sleep apnea. Pregnant rats were given nicotine infusions of 2 or 6 mg/kg/day throughout gestation, regimens that produce plasma nicotine levels spanning the range in smokers. The day after birth, animals in the high dose group displayed excessive mortality during hypoxic challenge. These animals were found to be deficient in an essential response component, namely adrenomedullary catecholamine release that is required to maintain neonatal cardiac rhythm during hypoxia; the defect was in adrenal cell function rather than in altered innervation or nicotinic receptor desensitization. We also examined brainstem and forebrain noradrenergic mechanisms that are involved in neonatal respiratory control. The nicotine group showed suppressed spontaneous neuronal activity, but were hyperresponsive to hypoxia. As these projections are inhibitory for respiration, the nicotine-induced sensitization would be expected to contribute to respiratory arrest during hypoxia. Prenatal nicotine exposure may thus provide a useful animal model with which to study the physiological mechanisms that underlie Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, while at the same time providing a biological explanation for the association of the syndrome with smoking.

N2  - The diagnosis of Gushing's Disease during pregnancy is complex because the biochemical features are obscured by changes in the normal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis that occur during gestation. To date, treatment has not been successful and there is a high incidence of maternal and fetal complications. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with Cushing's disease who presented during her 16th week of pregnancy. Diagnosis was confirmed by the finding of elevated serum and urinary free cortisol levels with loss of the normal circadian rhythm of serum cortisol. Cortisol levels failed to suppress after a low-dose dexamethasone test but suppressed after a high-dose test, There was an exaggerated serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). Magnetic resonance (MR) scanning demonstrated a pituitary tumour and cure was effected by transsphenoidal surgery where tumour immunostaining for ACTH was removed. Postoperatively the patient made an uncomplicated recovery; serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels were undetectable at 9 days following surgery and recovery of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis occurred at 99 days after surgery. Caesarean section was performed at 38 weeks of pregnancy and a healthy but small female infant was delivered. This case illustrates the biochemical features of Gushing's disease during pregnancy and is the first report of the use of CRH testing and MR scanning in this clinical situation. The cure by surgery and successful outcome for mother and infant, with preservation of normal anterior pituitary function, suggest that transsphenoidal surgery may be the treatment of choice.

N2  - Babies born after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are increasing in number, and, although these babies are considered as very precious, no data are available regarding their risk for sudden infant death or apnoea. To evaluate the respiratory maturity of IVF babies, we evaluated the incidence of apnoea during an 8-h polysomnography in 50 consecutively presented IVF babies and in a group of 50 unselected naturally conceived babies. All infants were in good health and matched for term (born > 38 weeks of gestation), birth weight, sex and age at the time of investigation (6-11 weeks post term, median 8.0). There were 24 twins in the IVF and 6 twins in the control group. The-incidence of obstructive and isolated central apnoea was comparable in the IVF and control group. However, IVF babies had significantly more periodic breathing episodes than control babies (median 2.30 (range 0-15.30) in IVF, and 1.02 (range 0-11.2) in control babies; P < 0.01). This difference was not related to the higher number of twins in the IVF group. Single IVF babies had significantly more short central apnoeas (5-10s) than IVF twins (5-10s) (mean 38.80±18.63 and 22.33±13.35; P < 0.001). This difference between single and twin babies was not found in the control group. Conclusion. IVF babies have more periodic breathing episodes indicating an immature respiratory pattern than normally conceived babies.

N2  - Objective. To determine whether there is a demonstrable abnormality in control of breathing in infants of substance-abusing mothers during the first few days of life. Methods. We enrolled 12 drug-free control infants and 12 infants of substance abusing mothers (ISAMs). These infants experienced otherwise uncomplicated term pregnancies and deliveries. The infants were assigned to a group based on the results of maternal histories and maternal and infant urine toxicology screens. Studies were performed during quiet sleep during the first few days of life. We measured heart rate, oxygen saturations via a pulse oximeter, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET-CO2) level, respiratory rate, tidal volume, and airflow. The chemoreceptor response was assessed by measuring minute ventilation and the ET-CO2 level after 5 minutes of breathing either room air or 4% carbon dioxide. Results. The gestational ages by obstetrical dating and examination of the infants were not different, although birth weights and birth lengths were lower in the group of ISAMs. Other demographic data were not different, and there were no differences in the infants' median ages at the time of study or in maternal use of tobacco and alcohol. The two groups had comparable baseline (room air) ET-CO2 levels, respiratory rates, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation. When compared with the group of ISAMs, the drug-free group had markedly increased tidal volume and minute ventilation on exposure to 4% carbon dioxide. These increases accounted for the difference in sensitivity to carbon dioxide, calculated as the change in minute ventilation per unit change in ET-CO2 (milliliters per kg/min per mm Hg). The sensitivity to carbon dioxide of control infants was 48.66 ± 7.14 (mean ± SE), whereas that of ISAMs was 16.28 ± 3.14. Conclusions. These data suggest that ISAMs are relatively insensitive to challenge by carbon dioxide during the first few days of life. We speculate that this reflects an impairment of the chemoreceptor response.

N2  - Objective: Studies on the effects of cocaine in fetal animals have been limited to acute exposures to the drug. We hypothesized that a prolonged infusion of cocaine to the fetal sheep would initially interrupt normal behavioral state cycling but the effects would be short lived as the fetus gained tolerance to the drug. Study design: The study was performed in a university laboratory on six time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation. Fetal sheep, surgically instrumented 3 days before study, were given cocaine hydrochloride 0.6 mg/min for 6 hours. Fetal behavioral state before, during, and after the infusion was compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Infusion of cocaine caused a drop in the percentage time that the fetuses spent in both rapid-eye-movement (p < 0.03) and non-rapid-eye-movement (p < 0.001) sleep, which was sustained throughout the 6-hour infusion. This was related to a decrease in the number of rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement episodes as opposed to a decrease in the lengths of these behavioral states. With cessation of cocaine infusion, the fetal sheep showed an increase in rapid-eye-movement sleep, with a higher percentage than during control periods (p < 0.02). Conclusions: Cocaine disrupts fetal rapid-eye-movement sleep without evidence for tolerance to the drug over a 6-hour period. 'Catch-up' rapid-eye-movement sleep occurs with cessation of cocaine infusion. Neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with in utero cocaine exposure may be caused by chronic disruption of rapid-eye-movement sleep.

N2  - Little is known about the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics during pregnancy. Experiments were therefore carried out on six chronically instrumented pregnant ewes (125-133 days of gestation) to investigate the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics. Because nonlabor myometrial activity influences uteroplacental hemodynamics, we made measurements during quiet wakefulness, quiet sleep, and active sleep in the presence and absence of myometrial activity. Cardiac output, heart rate, and systemic arterial pressure were decreased in active sleep compared with quiet wakefulness; these variables were not significantly altered by myometrial activity. The interaction between sleep and myometrial activity was such that the lowest values of uteroplacental blood flow, as estimated from middle uterine artery blood flow to the pregnant uterine horn and, hence, uteroplacental oxygen delivery occurred during active sleep in the presence of myometrial activity (i.e., decreased ~19% compared with quiet wakefulness and the absence of myometrial activity). Further investigation is required to determine the possible fetal consequences of a reduced uteroplacental perfusion in the presence of myometrial activity during sleep.

N2  - In consideration of the frequent association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and also taking into account the acceleration of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy by hypertension there are the following special uses of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in diabetic patients: Support in achieving the day and night tight blood pressure control according to the goals set by US recommendations on 130/85 mmHg for counterbalancing the increased cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. After a 10-year history of diabetes even normoalbuminuric diabetics have a reduced circadian blood pressure variation compared to newly diagnosed diabetic patients or to controls. A higher blood pressure load because of a reduced fall of blood pressure during night is a typical sign of all forms of diabetic nephropathy, beginning in the stage of microalbuminuria and probably even in a 'prealbuminuric' stage of high normal urinary albumin excretion. 10-30% of all nephropathic diabetic patients have an inverse circadian rhythm of blood pressure with higher blood pressure during night compared to daytime values. These 'inverters' have an advanced form of autonomic neuropathy and also of orthostatic symptoms. Recent analyses of heart period variability in 24-hour electrocardiogram have shown objective signs of autonomic neuropathy not only for advanced, but also for the early form of microalbuminuric nephropathy. This form of autonomic neuropathy is usually associated with a reduced circadian blood pressure variation. In pregnancy and in autonomic hypotension after insulin-injection 24-hour blood pressure monitoring is an important aid for risk analysis.

N2  - Objective. To assess the physical and neurodevelopmental status of children born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) as well as the family condition. Design. Follow-up study including physical and developmental examination in available families, and/or interviews of parents/pediatricians/teachers/social workers. Setting. The Port-Royal neonatal intensive care unit and follow-up clinic. Subjects. From 1.1.1987 to 31.12.1992, in 32 single, 71 twin, 28 triple, and one quadruple pregnancies resulting from IVF (total 132), one or more neonates were admitted to the Port-Royal NICU. The outcome is presented for the 99 families followed longer than two years (199 neonates, 166/199 born prematurely). Main outcome measures. Neurological sequelae (minor, moderate, major), developmental quotients, school level, behavioral disturbances, family conditions. Results. From 21 singletons (2 deaths, 1 lost), 18 survivors were followed: 17 were normal above 2 years (10 above 3 years went to school), 1 had a severe cerebral palsy with low IQ. From 57 twin pregnancies (7 fetal and 9 neonatal deaths), the 98 survivors were followed: 78 were normal above 2 years (65 above 3 years went to school), 20 had some neuro-developmental deficits (of 14 above 3 years, 12 went to school); 25 families had had or still had problems (deaths and/or anomalies (9 cases) and/or sequelae); 3 mothers were single parents (2 divorces and one split). From 20 triple pregnancies (1 fetal and 3 neonatal deaths), 54 out of 56 survivors were normal above 2 years (33 above 3 years went to school); 3 siblings (1 deaf and 1 with cataract) were put in foster care after severe maternal beating; 2 mothers were single parents (one divorce and one split); 4 mothers had repeated breakdowns; one father tried suicide. From one quadruple pregnancy (one fetal and one neonatal deaths), the 2 survivors were normal above 3 years and went to school. Most sequelae involved very low birthweight babies, in association with a number of sleep and behavioural disturbances. From 98 mothers, 16 had 18 spontaneous pregnancies (11 full-term newborns, 5 miscarriages, 1 extra-uterine pregnancy, 1 abortion) and 3 mothers had another IVF pregnancy (a few others had IVF failures). Conclusions. The data indicate a high rate of sequelae and deaths in the group of twin births, in contrast to a low rate of sequelae or deaths in the group of triplets in which pregnancies were carefully prolonged; however, families with triplets are highly dissatisfied in the 3 first years after birth, mainly from fatigue. We advocate more restrictive indications of IVF, a thorough evaluation of parents to be, more information of 'sterile' couples about the risks of multiples pregnancies, more preventive hospitalization and education of mothers for twin pregnancies, and more social help in the first 3 years of triplets.

N2  - Repeated alteration in episodes of quiet sleep and active sleep is a basic feature of behavioral state organization in human fetuses. When compared to normal fetuses, at-risk fetuses generally exhibit extended periods of no coincidence (PsNC), that is, associations between state variables that cannot be classified as a sleep state. The purpose of this study was to determine if fetuses with extended PsNC differ in other state measures from fetuses with short PsNC. Fetal heart rate and fetal eye and gross body movements were collected simultaneously on 85 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks gestation for a total of 9, 135 minutes (mean 108.8 ± 12.7 minutes, range 85-130 minutes). We found that as percent PsNC increased, the frequency (r = 0.464, p < 0.0001) of state changes increased and the time spent in active sleep (r = 0.456, p < 0.0001) and the number of fetuses entering an awake state (x2 = 4.26, p < 0.039) decreased. In contrast, percent PsNC was independent of the length of time spent in quiet sleep (r = 0.070, p > 0.05). We interpret these findings as an indication that extended PsNC may be the result of disruption of homeostatic control mechanisms during active sleep.

N2  - The rate of fetal urine production and the incidence of fetal micturition was compared in periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Sonography and fetal heart rate monitoring were concomitantly performed on 12 normal term pregnancies. Fetal bladder volumes were serially calculated, and the rate of urine production and micturition were compared between the periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition occurred almost exclusively during periods of fetal awakeness (p = 0.001). There were no demonstrable differences in the rates of urine production during periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition is behavioral-state dependent. Nevertheless, the fetal behavioral state is not a necessary consideration when applying urine production measurements as a test of fetal well-being.

Selection required that the infants were born between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation, had a normal head ultrasound and were studied at term post-menstrual age. Multi-channel pen recordings of sleep state, movement, breathing and acid reflux were made. In term and preterm infants the frequency and duration of reflux were greatest in active sleep, rare in quiet sleep and significantly less in preterm than term infants in wakefulness and active sleep (p < 0.05). The fewer and shorter episodes in preterm infants could not be explained by sleep state, movement, gestational or postnatal age, days intubated, days on oxygen or the lowest pH of reflux episodes.

N2  - Objective: The hypothesis was tested that circadian variations in urinary albumin excretion of pregnant women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy are different from nonpregnant individuals. Design: Circadian variability in urinary albumin excretion was studied both in pregnant women and in nonpregnant controls either during normal daily activities or in contrast during continuous bedrest with standardised fluid and food intake to study endogenously generated rhythm. Setting: Outpatient department and metabolic ward of a university hospital. Main outcome measures: Urinary albumin excretion during fixed time periods over the day and the night. Results: Both ambulant pregnant and nonpregnant women have circadian rhythm in urinary albumin excretion but pregnant women have, firstly, a higher 24 h urinary albumin excretion, secondly, smaller relative day-night differences than nonpregnant controls and thirdly, in the metabolic ward some pregnant women demonstrate absence of rhythm. Conclusions: The higher albumin excretion during pregnancy in 24 h urine collections can largely be explained by a higher excretion during the night, compared with that of nonpregnant women. The day-night difference in urinary albumin excretion of ambulant pregnant women is exogenously determined.

N2  - The long-term developmental outcome of a large cohort of children suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was studied in an interdisciplinary project. Assessments using structured psychiatric interviews and intelligence tests took place during preschool age, early school age, and late school age period. There was an excess of psychopathology with a wide variety of psychiatric syndromes in this cohort. Hyperkinetic disorders, emotional disorders, sleep disorders, and abnormal habits and stereotypies persisted over time. Interview findings were largely cross-validated by parents' and teacher questionnaire findings. Only one third of the patients showed normal intellectual functioning at first examination. Intelligence test findings displayed high stability at follow-up. There was no significant correlation between the amount of morphological damage and intelligence. The persisting severe developmental disorders resulting from maternal alcoholism during pregnancy are also reflected in the poor school careers. Environmental factors and education do not appear to be strong compensating factors.

N2  - Chronic sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) was performed on female rats 30 days before impregnation. The offspring, maintained in the dark from birth, had disruption of the malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythm in the testes at 25 days of age. A daily injection of melatonin (1 mg/kg s.c. at 10:00 or 18:00 h) to denervated mothers from the 14th day of pregnancy up to the 10th day postpartum produced one daily phase in the enzyme activity of testes in the offspring. Entrainment of daily enzyme activity also was obtained when the hormone was administered orally to the pups during the postnatal period or when pups were reared by intact (not denervated) foster mothers. The results indicate the involvement of the maternal pineal gland in the maternal transfer of photoperiodic information necessary for the coordination of the circadian system in young rats.

N2  - Prior studies have found an increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes of pregnancies in asthmatic mothers, but these studies have been poorly controlled for asthma therapy and other confounding factors. The purpose of this study was to assess perinatal outcomes in actively managed pregnant asthmatic women as compared with matched nonasthmatic controls. Using an inception cohort design, we studied a volunteer sample of 486 pregnant (< 28 wk) women with documented asthma and 486 pregnant nonasthmatic controls with normal pulmonary function. Cases and controls were matched for age, smoking status, parity, and year of delivery. Asthma was managed with step therapy to prevent acute asthmatic episodes and asthma symptoms that interfered with sleep or normal activity. Chronic hypertension was significantly more common (p = 0.007) in asthmatic subjects (3.7%) than in matched controls (1.0%). However, no significant differences in incidences of preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm births, low-birth-weight infants, intrauterine growth retardation, or congenital malformations were observed in the pregnancies of the asthmatic women as compared with the matched controls. Trends were observed toward relationships between more severe asthma requiring emergency therapy or corticosteroids and increased incidences of preeclampsia and low-birth-weight infants, but these associations were not statistically significant. These data suggest that the overall perinatal prognosis for women with actively managed asthma during pregnancy is comparable to that for the nonasthmatic population.

N2  - Objective. - To examine the relationship between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and smoking during pregnancy; postnatal tobacco smoke exposure from the mother, father, live-in adults, and day care providers; and postnatal smoke exposure from breast-feeding. Design. - Case-control study. Setting. - Five counties in Southern California. Participants. - A total of 200 white, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian parents of infants who died of SIDS between 1989 and 1992 were compared with 200 control parents who delivered healthy infants. Case infants were matched to control infants on the basis of birth hospital, birth date, gender, and race. All information was detained from a detailed telephone interview and validated with medical records. Main Outcome Measures. - Risk of SIDS associated with passive smoking by the mother, father, live-in adults, and day care providers; smoking in the same room as the infant; total number of cigarettes smoked by all adults; and maternal smoking during the time period of breast-feeding. Results. - Conditional logistic regression resulted in overall adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for SIDS associated with passive smoke from the mother of 2.28, the father of 3.46, other live-in adults of 2.18, and all sources of 3.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 6.75), while simultaneously adjusting for birth weight, sleep position, prenatal care, medical conditions at birth, breast-feeding, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. A dose-response effect was noted for SIDS associated with increasing numbers of cigarettes, as well as total number of smokers. Breast-feeding was protective for SIDS among nonsmokers (OR=0.37) but not smokers (OR=1.38), when adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions. - Passive smoking in the same room as the infant increases the risk for SIDS. Physicians should educate new and prospective parents about the risks of tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life.

N2  - The comparative efficacy of Brucella suis strain 2 (S2) and Brucella melitensis strain Rev. 1 (Rev. 1) live vaccines in protecting sleep against B. melitensis infection was evaluated by clinical and bacteriological examination of ewes vaccinated conjunctiually with a dose of 1 x 109 c.f.u. when 4 months old and then challenged with 5 x 107 c.f.u. of the B. melitensis virulent strain 53H38 (H38) at the middle of the first or second pregnancy following vaccination. Animals were considered to be protected when no abortion, no excretion of the challenge strain and no infection at slaughter occurred. The percentages of protection in Rev. 1-vaccinated groups challenged during either first (80%) or second (62%) pregnancy were significantly different (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared with those of the relevant unvaccinated control groups. In contrast no significant difference in protection was found between the S2-vaccinated and control groups.

N2  - A mailed questionnaire survey was conducted on a population of 123 mothers of twins and 96 mothers of triplets to study problems in the families and maternal fatigue symptoms. The following results were obtained. 1) The prevalence rate of handicap was 9.7 per 100 for triplets, and 4.9 per 100 for twins. The risk of handicap in triplet pregnancy was approximately 25%, and in twin pregnancy was approximately 10%. Therefore 1 in 4 mothers with triplets and 1 in 10 mothers with twins had one and more handicapped children. 2) Mothers with triplets aged 0-11 months reported significantly poorer sleep quality than mothers with triplets aged one year or more with shorter sleeping time, greater frequency of awakening during the night, and more complaints of inadequate sleep. Mothers with twins aged 0-11 months showed a greater tendency for poor sleep quality than mothers with twins aged one year or more. 3) Approximately 70% of mothers with twins and triplets aged up to two reported lack of time to care for the other children. When the age of twin was 3 or more, lack of time to take care of other children was reported by only 13.3% of mothers, while it was 41.7% for mothers with triplets. 4) Mothers of twins and triplets who did not receive assistance from others for childcare reported severe physical fatigue, compared to mothers who received assistance from others. Mothers of twins and triplets aged 3 or more showed a tendency of less physical fatigue, compared to mothers of twins and triplets aged up to two.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that sleep disruptions would be evident in 3-year-old children with a history of prenatal marijuana exposure. Design: A prospective study using stratified random sampling beginning in the fourth month of pregnancy. Marijuana and other substance use were assessed by interviews at multiple time points. Offspring were followed up through age 3 years with multidomain assessments at fixed time points, including electroencephalographic sleep studies in the newborn period and at age 3 years. Setting: Primary care, prenatal clinic at a university hospital. Subjects: The sample included 18 children with prenatal marijuana exposure (mean [±SD] age, 39.0±4.4 months) and 20 control children (mean [±SD] age, 39.7±4.4 months). The two groups were similar in relationship to maternal age, race, income, education, or maternal use of alcohol, nicotine, and other substances in the first trimester. Main Outcome Measure: Sleep variables from polysomnographic recordings at age 3 years. Results: Children with prenatal marijuana exposure showed more nocturnal arousals (mean [±SD], 8.2±5.3 vs 3.2±4.6; P<.003), more awake time after sleep onset (mean [±SD], 27.4±20.0 vs 13.7±12.4 min; P<.03), and lower sleep efficiency (mean [±SD], 91.0±3.8 vs 94.4±2.1; P<.03) than did control children. Conclusion: Prenatal marijuana exposure was associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep at age 3 years.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the effectiveness of "facilitated tucking," a nonpharmacologic nursing intervention, as a comfort measure in modulating preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses to minor pain. DESIGN: Prospective, repeated measure, random sequencing, and experimental. SETTING: Level III neonatal intensive-care unit of a tertiary care university pediatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty preterm neonates, 25-35 weeks gestation. INTERVENTIONS: Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and sleep state were recorded 12 minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after two heelsticks, one with and one without facilitated tucking. HYPOTHESIS: Premature neonates will have less variation in heart rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, shorter crying and sleep disruption times, and less fluctuation in sleep states in response to the painful stimulus of a heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. RESULTS: Neonates demonstrated a lower mean heart rate 6-10 minutes post-stick (p < 0.04), shorter mean crying time (p < 0.001), shorter mean sleep disruption time (p < 0.001), and fewer sleep-state changes (p = 0.003) after heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. CONCLUSION: Facilitated tucking is an effective comfort measure in attenuating premature neonates' psychologic and behavioral responses to minor pain.

N2  - Objective. To examine the behavioural state dependency of renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility index and hourly fetal urinary production rate (HFUPR) in the normal term fetus. Design. An observational study. Subjects. Twenty-three healthy women with a normal singleton pregnancy between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. Main outcome measures. Renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices were established using pulsed Doppler ultrasound. HFUPR (ml) was estimated using real-time ultrasound. Fetal behavioural states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) were determined from combined recordings of fetal heart rate, eye movements and body movements. Results. An inverse correlation between pulsatility index and fetal heart pattern was established for both the renal artery (r = 0.60; SD = 0.22; P = 0.0001) and the descending aorta (r = 0.73; SD = 0.16; P = 0.0001). The difference in mean pulsatility index between states 1F and 2F adjusted for fetal heart pattern was 0.09 (SD 0.23) for the renal artery (P = 0.02) and 0.26 (SD 0.19) for the descending aorta (P = 0.0001). Mean HFUPR was significantly higher (44.8 %, P = 0.01) in state 1F (96 ml) compared with state 2F (54 ml). During the urinary filling phase, a poor correlation existed between renal artery pulsatility index and HFUPR (r = 0.04) and between descending aorta pulsatility index and HFUPR (r = 0.01). Conclusions. In the normal term fetus renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices are reduced during fetal behavioural state 2F, suggesting reduced downstream impedance at the fetal trunk and in particular at renal level. This behavioural state is, however, also associated with reduced micturition. No correlation exists between renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices and fetal urinary output.

N2  - The impairment of sleep quality is a common complaint during pregnancy. To investigate the changes in sleep in the course of pregnancy, the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and analyzed in nine healthy women on 2 consecutive nights during each trimester of pregnancy. Waking after sleep onset increased from the second (TR2) to the third (TR3) trimester, whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased from the first trimester (TR1) to TR2. Spectral analysis of the EEG in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep revealed a progressive reduction of power density in the course of pregnancy. In comparison to TR1, the values in TR2 were significantly lower in the 10.25-11.0-Hz and 14.25-17.0-Hz bands. In TR3, the significant reduction extended over the ranges of 1.25-12.0 Hz and 13.25-16.0 Hz. The largest decrease (30%) occurred in the 14.25-15.0-Hz band. In REM sleep, the spindle frequency range was not affected, and a minor reduction of power density in some frequency bins below 12 Hz was present only in TR3. The study documents major alterations of the sleep EEG that are not evident from the sleep scores and that may be associated with the characteristic hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy.

N2  - The development of fetal behaviour and of fetal behavioural states (FBS) has been well defined in preterm and term fetuses. However, FBS have not yet been studied after term, although this is a potentially very dangerous period and clinical management is controversial. We investigated fetal behaviour in normal pregnancies after 41 weeks of gestation (287 days, menstrual age, GA) as compared to control term fetuses. Furthermore, we wanted to see if the findings might have consequences for clinical management. Twelve healthy women with GA between 289 and 298 days participated. All pregnancies were reliably dated and at the time of the study, there was a normal amount of fluid. Twelve healthy women with GA 273-287 days served as controls. All subjects underwent a behavioural study using cardiotocography to record the heart rate (CTG), and two ultrasound scanners to observe body and eye movements, as described previously. All fetuses in both groups clearly exhibited FBS IF-4F which fitted the definitions of Nijhuis et al. The median percentage of FBS 3F and 4F ('awake states') increased significantly from 6% in the term group to 21.5% in the fetuses after 41 weeks (P = 0.014). FBS IF ('quiet sleep') and 2F ('active sleep') decreased from 92 to 78% (P = 0.014), mainly at the expense of FBS 2F which decreased from 78 to 58% (P = 0.002). This indicates increasing wakefulness in utero. The fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP) associated with FBS 3F and 4F were impressive. For example, in FBS 4F, the FHRP showed large amplitude, prolonged accelerations which fused into a sustained tachycardia with only short periods of return to the baseline, resembling tachycardia with decelerations. We conclude that in normal pregnancies after 41 weeks, the development of the fetal central nervous system continues, resulting in an increasing percentage of 'fetal wakefulness'. The CTG-patterns that result from these behaviours can easily mimic fetal distress and one should be aware of this phenomenon. Whether behavioural studies can be used to distinguish 'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses after term awaits further study.

N2  - Immunoreactivity, cytochemical, immunocytochemical characteristics and subcellular distribution of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) were investigated in blood and/or smear samples from 18 women aged 23-46 years (mean 32.5 years) with trisomy 21 fetuses (17-21 weeks) and 28 women aged 20-42 years (mean 31 years) with normal fetuses (17-22 weeks). Immunochemical NAP investigations were carried out in 8 pathological and 8 normal pregnancies; cytochemical and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out in 18 pregnant women with trisomy 21 fetuses and 28 controls. NAP from women with trisomy 21 fetuses is characterized by: (1) a significant decrease in reactivity with anti-liver-type alkaline phosphatase (AP) and anti-NAP antisera; (2) low or very slight reactivity with antiplacental or anti-intestinal antibodies; (3) marked dispersion of NAP lead citrate reaction products or anti-NAP antibody colloidal gold-labelling in neutrophil cytoplasms, as detected by electron microscopy. This subcellular AP distribution (extramembranous) is different from that of normal NAP sites associated with plasma membrane, nuclear membrane and secretory vesicles. The NAP immunochemical. and cytochemical characteristics suggest that neutrophils of a woman with a trisomy 21 fetus contain two AP isoenzymes: the liver/bone type and an atypical AP.

N2  - Whereas conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and heart rate may mislead, influenced as they are, among other factors, by the individual's emotional state, position, diet and external stimuli generally, the chronobiologic evaluation of predictable variability in these physiologic variables assesses early cardiovascular disease risk in pregnancy by (a) the use of fully ambulatory devices and (b) the proper processing of the time series thus obtained. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized circadian characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. The results were then compared with those obtained from data sampled after the second pregnancy. Blood pressure and heart rate were automatically monitored, at 1-h intervals, each time for at least 48 consecutive hours, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each 48-h profile of measurements by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian rhythm-adjusted mean of blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressures up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an increase up to the day of delivery. This pattern of variation is not found for data similarly sampled during non-pregnancy on the same woman. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

N2  - This article describes some of the experiences encountered by two women with spinal cord injuries (SCI) during pregnancy. Pregnant women, with or without a SCI, encounter some common experiences. Common complaints of pregnancy for both include urinary tract infections, sleep problems, and constipation. Complaints specific to those women with a SCI centered around issues such as increased urinary incontinence, autonomic dysreflexia and delayed wound healing. The women with SCI neither developed pressure areas nor experienced premature deliveries, major complications predicted by literature. Women with SCI have felt that they were victims of inadequate environmental designs that hindered their mobility and inhibited their independence. Many of the psychosocial aspects studied proved to be common to pregnant women in general and not specific to individuals with spinal cord injury.

N2  - This study was designed to characterize behavioural states in the fetal baboon. Automated methods were developed and validated to recognize behavioural states based on relationships among three physiologic variables (EEG patterns, eye movements, heart period variability). Data included twelve 16-h records from 3 chronically instrumented fetal baboons at 0.8-0.9 of term. Randomly generated control records were used to differentiate occurrences of state from chance association of the variables. For 41.2 ± 4.6% (mean ± S.E.) of the time, the physiologic variables were synchronous and formed cycles of state with a mean duration of 34.4 min. Components of these cycles had mean ± S.E. durations of 7.2 ± 0.3 min for state 1FB (the analogue of quiet sleep in the human infant and state 1F in the human fetus), 20.7 ± 1.2 min for the state 2FB (the analogue of active sleep in the human infant and state 2F in the human fetus), and 3.6 ± 0.2 min for state transitions. For 24.6 ± 2.4% of the time, the state variables exhibited coincidental, state-like agreements, that were not part of state cycles. Finally, for 34.3 ± 2.7% of the time, there was no systematic agreement among the three variables. These data provide convincing evidence that organized behavioural states are present in the fetal baboon as early as 0.8 of term gestation.

N2  - The general pharmacological properties of lazabemide, a novel MAO-B inhibitor, alone or in combination with MADOPAR were examined in mice, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits, cats and dogs. The p.o. administration of lazabemide to mice and rats did not produce any gross behavioral changes at any dose. Lazabemide did not exert any effect on rectal temperature, pupil size, spontaneous locomotor activity, Metrazole-induced convulsions or methylhexabital-induced sleep in mice nor did it show any analgesic action in mice and muscle relaxation in rabbits. Lazabemide did not markedly modify the spontaneous EEG activity and EEG arousal responses to sensory stimulations (the midbrain reticular formation and algetic stimulation) in cats. Treatment with lazabemide in combination with MADOPAR neither inhibited nor augmented the effects of MADOPAR on gross behavior or methylhexabital-induced sleep in mice. Lazabemide, when given together with MADOPAR, showed no inhibitory effect on metrazole-induced convulsions, but tended to produce convulsions in a dose-dependent manner (2.5-40 mg/kg p.o.). Nevertheless, the EEG arousal elicited by MADOPAR at 100 mg/kg was not modified by combined treatment with lazabemide. In anesthetized beagle dogs, the i.v. administration of lazabemide caused no overt changes in cardiovascular function, electrocardiographic characteristics, and respiratory function. Lazabemide was devoid of relevant influence on gastrointestinal function (intestinal propulsive motility in mice), and on renal functions (urine volume and urinary excretions of electrolytes in saline-loaded rats). In isolated smooth muscle preparations (guinea-pig ileum and trachea), lazabemide applied at a low concentration did not affect the spontaneous muscle tonicity and contractility. However, at a high concentration (10-5g/ml) it augmented the constrictory and relaxatory responses to agonists, reflecting secondary actions accompanied by an increase in basal tone. The spontaneous motility of the uterus excised from pregnant or non-pregnant rats remained unchanged in the presence of lazabemide. Based on these results, it is suggested that lazabemide has no serious untoward effects on central or peripheral functions except for an increase in the basal tone of isolated smooth muscle preparations. Moreover, lazabemide, when given in combination with MADOPAR, did not modify the effects of MADOPAR. Thus, lazabemide was proven to be safe and well tolerated in laboratory animals.

N2  - The general pharmacological profile of grepafloxacin (GPFX), a novel antibacterial agent, was evaluated. In the central nervous systems, GPFX showed analgesic effect in mice at 1000 mg/kg p.o., tendency to augment the pentetrazol-induced convulsion in mice at 100 mg/kg i.v. suppression of spontaneous locomotor activity, body temperature and motor coordination in mice at 60 mg/kg i.v., and decrease in the threshold voltage of EEG arousal response in rabbits at 30 mg/kg i.v. However, no effects were observed in general activity and behavior, electroshock- and strychnine-induced convulsion, hexobarbital-induced hypnosis in mice and spontaneous EEG and sleep-wakefulness cycle in rabbits. On the other hand, GPFX showed increase in wakefulness in rats at 3 mg/kg i.v. and higher. In the somatic nervous systems, GPFX did not exhibit muscle relaxation in mice, local anesthetic activity in guinea pigs or any effects on the neuromuscular transmission in cats. In autonomic nervous systems and smooth muscle, GPFX suppressed the contraction of the nictitating membrane in cats at 10 mg/kg i.v. and higher. GPFX revealed slight anti-acetylcholine effect at 3 x 10-4 M in isolated guinea-pig ileum. However, the compound did not show anti-histamic and anti-barium action in isolated guinea-pig ileum, anti-norepinephrine action in isolated non-pregnant rat vas deferens, anti-oxytocin action in isolated rat uterus and any effect in isolated guinea-pig trachea. GPFX slightly suppressed the spontaneous movement of nonpregnant rat uterus in situ at 100 mg/kg i.v. and isolated pregnant rat uterus at 3 x 10-5 M and higher. In the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, GPFX revealed transient decrease in blood pressure at 3 mg/kg i.v. and higher and elevated in heart rate at 10 mg/kg i.v. and higher in anesthetized dogs. The compound decreased the heart rate and increased contractile force of the isolated guinea-pig atrium at 10-4 M and higher. In the digestive systems, GPFX suppressed the intestinal propulsion in mice at 60 mg/kg i.v., gastric motility and gastric secretion in rats at 100 mg/kg i.v. In the others, GPFX did not reveal any effect on urine volume and urinary electrolytes excretion and anti-inflammatory effect in rats. But the compound showed hyperemia in the conjunctiva of guinea-pigs when instilled with a 1% solution.

N2  - Temperament differences between cotwins at least 15% discordant for birthweight were compared for a group of 66 preterm twin pairs and a group of 70 fullterm twin pairs, assessed in the neonatal period. The assessment focused on irritability, resistance to soothing, activity, reactivity, and reinforcement value. For the most part, significant differences were not obtained between discordant preterm cotwins. Previous research had demonstrated that the larger fullterm twin of discordant pairs was more irritable, more difficult to soothe, more active while awake and during sleep, less reactive to visual and auditory stimuli, and less reinforcing to the examiner than the smaller cotwin. It was concluded that, for the behavioral variables measured, the fullterm group is at higher risk than the preterm group, and that both the lighter and the heavier discordant twins displayed signs of early behavioral risk. The findings suggested that the continued gestation for cotwins discordant in weight may be a risk period for early temperament development of the twins.

N2  - The awareness of the inherent risks attached to medication use during pregnancy is increasing. There is, however, a paucity of information available following childbirth. We have conducted a prospective study in women who gave birth in hospital with the objective of analysing the use of medication in this lying period. The results show that, in addition to the vitamins and minerals routinely prescribed for every young mother and the antipyretics administered as required, the following medicaments were most often used: analgesics (by approx. 9%), antiinflammatory agents (49%) and the antibiotics (38%). The antibiotics were either used prophylactically or, in cases of proven infection, administered therapeutically. The use of antibiotics appears more intensive compared to western countries, presumably due to the greater risk of infection in this group in India. On the other hand, the use of sleep inducing medication and tranquillizers during the lying in period appears, in comparison to other studies, almost negligable. The majority of the women were unaware of the potential side-effects of medication during breastfeeding.

N2  - The teratogenic effect of caffeine has been clearly demonstrated in rodents. The sensitivity of different animals species is variable. Malformations have been demonstrated in mice at 50-75 mg/kg of caffeine, whereas the lowest dose usually needed to induce malformations is 80 mg/kg in rats. However, when caffeine is administered in fractioned amounts during the day, 330 mg/kg/day are necessary to reach teratogenicity in rats. In rodents, the most frequently observed malformations are those of the limbs and digits, ectrodactyly, craniofacial malformations (labial and palatal clefts) and delays in ossification of limbs, jaw and sternum. Nevertheless, even in rodents, caffeine can be considered as a weak teratogenic agent, given the quite large quantities of caffeine necessary to induce malformations and the small number of animals affected. In humans, caffeine does not present any teratogenic risk. The increased risk of the most common congenital malformations entailed by moderate consumption of caffeine is very slight. However, caffeine potentiates the teratogenic effect of other substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and acts synergistically with ergotamine and propranolol to induce materno-fetal vasoconstrictions leading to malformations induced by ischemia. Therefore, even though caffeine does not seem to be harmful to the human fetus when intake is moderate and spread out over the day, some associations, especially with alcohol, tobacco, and vasoconstrictive or anti-migraine medications should be avoided. Maternal consumption of caffeine affects brain composition, especially in case of a low-protein diet and also seems to interfere with zinc fixation in brain. Maternal exposure to caffeine induces also long-term consequences on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity, and anxiety in rat offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to ascertain long-term behavioral effects of caffeine ingestion by pregnant mothers.

N2  - The heart transplantation program was started in Taiwan in 1987. Now an 88% operation success rate has been achieved, with a 68.9% one-year survival rate recorded. To better understanding patients' adjustment to life after transplantation, a study was done of 30 patients. The qualitative method was used, and interviews were conducted during the period November 1992 through February 1993. Results showed that idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common first diagnosis. Infection was the leading cause of death. Most patients reported that their physical functioning, sleep and exercise were much improved following surgery. Over 86% expressed satisfaction with their current health condition. Eleven patients returned to their work, five had chosen to retire, eight planned to work or return to school. One was unable to work for medical reason. The remaining five carried on their usual lives. Factors found to negatively affect return to work included: (1) family objections; (2) personal, psychological reason; (3) age; (4) insurance problems; (5) medical restrictions. Of the 30, 77% claimed the disease had not affected marital relationships, yet 81% reported decreased sexual activity. Libido decrease was the most common postoperative problem. Factors reported as affecting sexual life were: (1) effect of drugs; (2) apprehension that sexual activity would provoke cardiac accident; (3) fear of pregnancy; (4) sex identity problem; (5) an extra-marital affair; (6) poor marital relations. Most patients showed good compliance with medical advice and had a positive attitude toward life. In summary, heart transplantation is growing in acceptance in Taiwan. Improving patient adaptation to everyday life should receive more attention, probably through education and counseling.

N2  - White male rats, intact and pregnant females were subjected for 3 days to deprivation of paradoxical sleep by the technique of Jouvet. The main resulting vectors of the extreme state outcome, i.e., lethality, susceptibility to stress, and neurotization, made it possible to establish corresponding levels of resistance. A relationship of each of the levels with the ability to form conditioned reflexes, initial functional interhemispheric asymmetry and behavioural status, expression of protective reactions and paradoxical sleep under conditions of an insoluble conflict situation was followed. High resistance of pregnant rats is considered to be associated with the formation of gestational ambilaterality of the brain of intact animals. Such an increase in resistance is selective as far as it concerns the organism of the pregnant and it does not ensure stability of the feto-maternal complex under extreme conditions. It was established that there was an inverse relationship between the expression of neurotic disorders of the higher nervous activity and vegeto-morphological features of acute stress. This gives reason to define more exactly the role of neurotic disorders in the pathogenesis of stress and mechanisms of resistance to extreme factors.

N2  - The response of prolactin (PRL) and that of the pituitary-testicular axis to inhibitory photoperiods were compared in immature and young adult hamsters. In the first experiment, 14-day-old hamsters were transferred from 14L:10D to 12L:12D or 8L:16D. At 21, 28, 35, and 49 days of age, body weights, testes weights, and plasma LH were similar in all groups. In contrast, the levels of PRL were lower in animals on 8L:16D or 12L:12D than in those on 14L:10D at 35 and 49 days of age. In a second experiment, 80- day-old hamsters were transferred from 14L:10D to either 12L:12D or 8L:16D. At 5-wk intervals, they were weighed and bled by cardiocentesis and the length of the testes was measured. Photoperiods of 12L:12D and 8L:16D induced testicular regression, which was complete by 15 wk. Thereafter, augmented levels of FSH preceded spontaneous recrudescence of the testes in animals on both photoperiods. Serum PRL levels were significantly depressed within 5 wk after transfer to either 8L:16D or 12L:12D. After 15 wk as the testes were increasing in size in both groups, circulating PRL levels increased in animals exposed to 8L:16D, whereas in animals exposed to 12L:12D, PRL remained at or below the sensitivity of the assay. In a final experiment, on the day before parturition, pregnant hamsters were transferred to either 6L:18D, 6L:30D, 6L:42D, or 6L:54D or were held on 14L:10D. There were no differences in testicular weights, plasma LH, or plasma thyroxine (T4) of the pups from these dams at 21, 36, or 48 days of age. On the other hand, PRL levels at these ages were elevated in the 6L:30D and the 6L:54D groups as compared to the 6L:18D and the 6L:42D groups. The results suggest that the response of PRL to photoperiod may be experimentally dissociated from that of the hypothalamo-pituitary-testis axis to photoperiod. Like the response of the reproductive system in the adult the response of PRL incorporates a circadian oscillator in the system that measures day length.

N2  - In 14 normally developing term fetuses, the relationship between the blood flow velocity waveforms at cerebral arterial level (internal carotid artery, anterior, middle and posterior cerebral artery) and fetal behavioural states was studied using Doppler colour flow imaging. Behavioural state dependent changes in absolute flow velocities occurred in all vessels, except for the middle cerebral artery. These changes suggest preferential blood flow to the left heart resulting in increased flow to the cerebrum during fetal behavioural state 2F (active sleep) when compared with fetal behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep). The middle cerebral artery supplies the neocerebrum. This developing part of the cerebrum does not seem to take part in the regulation of fetal behaviour. In the internal carotid artery, an inverse relationship between peak systolic velocity and fetal heart rate could be established, which can be explained by a shorter rapid filling phase at raised fetal heart rate according to the Frank-Starling Law.

N2  - Background. This study sought explanations for the proneness to respiratory events in young Australian children. Methods. Prospective respiratory symptom diaries on 836 children collected data on respiratory symptoms and episodes. Questionnaires to mothers and birth and pregnancy records provided 56 known and possible predictors which were tested against two summary respiratory outcomes in each of the first and second years of life. Results. The two summary respiratory variables recorded for first and second year of life give four outcome variables, In fitting multivariate regression models to predict outcomes, use of child care in early childhood and mothers' experience of respiratory illness in the 12 months before birth were significant predictors for all four outcomes. Number of siblings was a predictor for three of the four outcomes. Sleep difficulty during pregnancy in the mother, and respiratory hospitalization of the infant in the first year, were significant predictors for both first-year outcomes. Unexpected and unexplained findings emerged for alcohol intake during pregnancy, passive smoking and breastfeeding in relation to the second year respiratory outcomes. Less than 9% of variance in outcome scores was explained in any of the four multiple regression models but this rose to between 24% and 31% when a corresponding score from the other year was added to the model. Conclusions. Proneness to respiratory illness is an important entity; its determinants are largely unknown and events in pregnancy or the perinatal period explain only a small proportion of the between-infant variability.

N2  - Oxygenation produced by distending the lungs with 100% O2 increases the occurrence of arousal and fetal breathing movements (FBM), particularly during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, in fetal sheep of ≥135 days of gestation. We studied the breathing and behavioral responses to a rise in arterial PO2 (Pa(O2)) without lung distension in fetuses between 128 and 132 days of gestation. Twelve fetuses were chronically instrumented to record FBM, behavioral state blood pressure, arterial blood gas tensions, and pH. Fetal Pa(O2) was raised by having the ewe breathe 100% O2 at 3 atmosphere absolute pressure spontaneously (group 1, n = 5, 129 ± 1 days of gestation) or with mechanical ventilation to control fetal arterial PCO2 (group 2, n = 7, 131 ± 1 days of gestation). Hyperbaric oxygenation raised fetal Pa(O2) by 20 Torr in both groups. During hyperbaric oxygenation, the occurrence of arousal increased severalfold in both groups. The occurrence of FBM increased during arousal in both groups, during rapid-eye-movement sleep in group 1, and during NREM sleep in group 2. The timing of diaphragmatic activity during arousal and the variability of diaphragmatic activity during NREM sleep were different than those in rapid-eye-movement sleep. We conclude that oxygenation without lung distension increases the occurrence of arousal and of FBM, principally during arousal and NREM sleep, in fetuses of ≤135 days of gestation.

N2  - This report examines the hypothesis that the characteristics of breathing activity of the fetal baboon are modulated with respect to sleep state in a fashion similar to that observed in the human fetus. The pattern of fetal breathing activity was examined in relationship to electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep state in studies of six fetuses of chronically monitored pregnant baboons at 143-148 days of gestation (term, 175-180 days). Fetal breaths were defined by fluctuations of tracheal fluid pressure. EEG sleep states were defined with an automated method for discrimination of EEG patterns that are standard indices of quiet and active sleep in immature primates. During more than 250 h of recorded data, the fetuses spent on average 33.3 ± 3.9% of time in EEG quiet sleep. In comparisons across state the fetuses spent significantly (P = 0.001) less time breathing during quiet than active sleep (49.5 ± 6.8 vs. 69.0 ± 3.8%). The inspiratory and expiratory time intervals of fetal breaths were not differentiated by EEG state but, the mean breath to breath interval was significantly (P < 0.001) longer in EEG quiet sleep. In addition to these differences in incidence and time interval of breaths, during epochs of breathing, there was a significantly slower rate, lower amplitude, and lower variability of rate of breathing in quiet sleep (all P-values < 0.02). Thus, periodic breathing activity in the fetal baboon is present in both quiet and active EEG sleep states. Sleep states have a powerful influence on patterns of fetal breathing in the non-human primate, directly comparable to the human fetus.

N2  - Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a clinical manifestation of the parasympathetic nervous system which can be identified in the high-frequency region of the heart rate variability (HRV) power spectrum. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of RSA to overall HRV for human fetuses in quiet sleep. The study population consisted of 13 normal human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation for whom data were collected during spontaneous breathing and normally occurring apneic periods. Fetal breathing was monitored continuously using real-time sonography. The fetal electrocardiogram was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted from the raw signal using adaptive signal processing techniques. Fetal behavioral state was determined at the beginning and end of each 3-min data collection period. The fetal R-wave interbeat intervals (IBIs) were converted to equally-spaced, time-based data, and linear detrending of the time series was accomplished by subtracting the mean heart period from each weighted IBI. Total power (TP, 0.0-2.5 Hz) was divided into RSA (0.4-1.0 Hz), high-frequency (HF, 0.2-2.5 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.2 Hz), and very-low-frequency (VLF, 0.0-0.04 Hz) regions, and the power densities were summed to determine the absolute power for each frequency component. A total of 81 3-min blocks (mean per subject 6.3, range 2-14) were available for analysis. Eleven (85%) of 13 fetuses demonstrated a HF peak during fetal breathing, and RSA accounted for approximately 20% of the TP. Although HF amplitude was reduced in the absence of fetal respiratory activity, RSA did not invariably disappear during periods of apnea, as the HF peak was recognized in seven (54%) fetuses when no respiratory activity was observed. Total power was approximately evenly distributed between the VLF, LF, and HF regions, and this distribution was independent of whether the fetus was breathing or not. However, the absolute power was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during breathing as compared to non-breathing for TP and for the VLF, LF, HF, and RSA components. We conclude that RSA is common in normal human fetuses and is a significant factor contributing to HRV.

N2  - By identifying a change in fetal activity state, fetal movement counting may help to reduce the possibility of stillbirth. Concern has arisen that such a focus on fetal activity may cause undue maternal anxiety. A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or other deleterious psychological effects in low-risk primigravidas. A sample of 613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group. State and trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation. Participation rates were high (91.4%) across all groups. Most women (90%) assigned to count fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days). No significant changes in psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self-monitoring conditions. Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks. Internal locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and feelings of well-being decreased slightly for all women. It was concluded that women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does not cause deleterious psychological effects in low-risk pregnant women.

N2  - Prenatal treatment with the D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 or cocaine induces expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the fetal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Weaver et al., 1992). Because the induction of c-fos gene expression in the SCN has been implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light in mature animals, the present study investigated whether prenatal dopaminergic activation entrains the fetal circadian pacemaker. Injections of SKF 38393 (8 mg/kg) were given to pregnant, SCN- lesioned hamsters during the last 5 d of gestation and the phases of the offspring's wheel-running activity rhythms were measured on postnatal day 20. Pregnant hamsters were each given two injections/day 12 hr apart, but only one of the injections each day contained SKF 38393. One group of hamsters received the drug at 0800 hr while another group received the drug at 2000 hr. The offspring from these treatment groups showed average phases that differed by 11.3 hr, demonstrating that prenatal SKF 38393 set the phase of the offspring's circadian rhythms. These results suggest that the fetal circadian pacemaker can be entrained by dopaminergic activation. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes demonstrated that a single injection of SKF 38393 on the last day of gestation induced c-fos gene expression in the fetal hamster SCN and that mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptor was present in the SCN at that time. It is possible that maternal entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker, which normally occurs during development, is mediated by dopaminergic activation within the fetal hypothalamus.

N2  - We examined cardiac reactivity in the first 45 seconds following a single 1 second vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) to determine if the prestimulus fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern was predictive of the immediate post-VAS heart rate response. Forty-nine normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation were observed to enter quiet sleep and remain in that state for 3 to 5 minutes before testing. In general, VAS elicited an initial acceleratory response of approximately 20 beats/min above the mean prestimulus heart rate followed by a deceleratory response to an average of approximately 4 beats/min below baseline values. Fetuses with different average prestimulus heart rate patterns generally differed in their early cardiac response to VAS: when compared to a high baseline FHR, a low resting heart rate was associated with a greater increase in heart rate above baseline (r = -0.401; P = 0.03), a greater decrease below prestimulus values (r = -0.312; P = 0.03), and a greater difference between maximum and minimum heart rates (r = -0.465; P = 0.001). Higher baseline heart rates were associated with lower FHR variability in the prestimulus period (r = -0.422; P = 0.009). When we examined the time course of the early response, we found that fetuses that achieved a maximum heart rate quickly exhibited less of an increase above prestimulus values (r = 0.894; P = 0.005), displayed a greater decrease below baseline (r = 0.507; P = 0.0002), and reached the minimum heart rate faster (r = 0.575; P = 0.0001) than fetuses that required longer to achieve a maximum cardiac response. In light of the relationship between heart rate and autonomic nervous system activity, these findings suggest that cardiac reactivity in the human fetus may reflect individual differences in resting sympathetic-parasympathetic balance.

N2  - We investigated the possible effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors controlled by the medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic epidural electroencephalographic (EEG) and temporal muscle electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were placed in cycling female rats. After a week of recovery, rats were injected intraperitoneally at 3.00 pm on the day of proestrus with either saline or highly purified hCG or indomethacin or hCG plus indomethacin. Three hours after injection, EEG, EMG and behavioral activities were recorded for 3.5 h. The administration of hCG increased high and low amplitude sleep, resting phase and decreased active awake phase, walking, sniffing and chewing as compared to the controls. While the administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited hCG effects. Medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus contain immunostaining for LH/hCG receptors. The administration of hCG resulted in an increase of immunoreactive PGD2 and a decrease of PGE2 in median preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus as compared to the controls. In summary, hCG administration affects sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors in rats which can collectively be described as decreased activity. These effects are probably mediated by increasing PGD2 and decreasing PGE2 in areas of brain which control these activities. The above findings may be relevant to pregnant women who experience decreased activity when hCG is present in the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid.

N2  - Narcolepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep phenomena such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Although stimulants are the only effective treatment for the sleepiness of narcolepsy, no clinical guidelines on the use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy have been published that address the following factors: appropriate doses; development of tolerance; potential for side effects, adverse reactions and abuse; and use in children and pregnant or breast- feeding women. These practice parameters from the American Sleep Disorders Association provide the first clinical guidelines on the appropriate use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy.

N2  - We examined the 24 hour plasma profiles of prolactin and β-hCG in 7 women with preterm labour between the 30th and 34th week of gestation. The results showed that, despite preterm labour, the circadian rhythm of prolactin was maintained. The β-hCG levels showed a wide scattering in the normal range which is also characteristic of pregnancy with no complications. In addition we examined the prolactin and β-hCG levels during the last 6 hours preceding delivery. Here we found significant higher hormone concentrations of hCG in the mothers delivered of female babies than in the mothers of males. This higher hormone level declined continuously during the delivery, however, without significance We also observed concordant secretion patterns of prolactin and β-hCG in these cases. Normal hCG and prolactin values were found in mothers delivered of male babies.

N2  - Health visitors and general practitioners are often asked for help because of what parents perceive as a baby's sleeping problem. Many parents expect that the baby will be sleeping continuously through the night from a given age, often as early as six weeks old. The conflict between the parents' expectations and the baby's behaviour leads the parents to seek help. Analysis of the first 640 questionnaires received from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Study show that many six-month-old babies have broken nights. Only 16% slept through the night at six months old. Half woke occasionally, 9% woke most nights, 5% woke once every night and a further 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times. For 16% of six-month-olds there was no regular sleeping pattern. Parents use a variety of strategies when the baby wakes at night, including rocking or cuddling, giving a dummy or feeding with milk or another drink. By six months old, 61% of babies slept in a room on their own, but 15% were always or usually brought into the parents' bed if they woke, and 34% sometimes 28% of babies aged six months routinely slept in the parents' bedroom. Knowing that their baby's behaviour pattern is "normal" and shared by many other babies of the same age is often reassuring to parents.

The potential effects of coffee consumption on fertility, spontaneous abortion and prematurity are not clearly established but appear to be quite limited. In rodents, caffeine can induce malformations but this effect appears in general at doses never encountered in humans. Indeed, as soon as the quantity of caffeine is divided over the day, as is the case for human consumption, the teratogenic effect of caffeine disappears in rodents. Coffee ingested during gestation induces a dose-dependent decrease in birth weight, but usually only when ingested amounts are high (i.e. more than 7 cups/day), whereas coffee has no effect at moderate doses. Caffeine consumption during gestation affects hematologic parameters of the new-born infant or rat. In animals, caffeine induces long-term consequences on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety, whereas, in children, the effects of early exposure to coffee and caffeine on behavior are not clearly established. The quantities of caffeine found in maternal milk vary with authors, but it appears clearly that caffeine does not change maternal milk composition and has a tendency to stimulate milk production. In conclusion to this review, it appears that maternal coffee or caffeine consumption during gestation and/or lactation does not seem to have measurable consequences on the fetus of the newborn, as long as ingested quantities remain moderate. Therefore, pregnant mothers should be advised to limit their coffee and caffeine intake to 300 mg caffeine/day (i.e. 2-3 cups of coffee or 2.5-3 l of coke) especially because of the increase of caffeine half-life during the third trimester of pregnancy and in the neonate.

N2  - Ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed in 8 patients with normotensive pregnancy by means of an oscillometric ABPM monitor (Spacelab 90207) to investigate trimenon-specific differences in 24-hour blood pressure profiles. All patients showed a significant decline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) throughout pregnancy. Circadian rhythm was prevailed in all the pregnants investigated, i.e. they showed a nocturnal decrease or dipping of blood pressure of more than 10% as compared with daily BP. 24-hour BP was lowest in the second trimenon due to a significant fall in night BP in comparison with the first and third trimenon (p<0.01). Diastolic BP that initially declined in the first trimenon constantly increased to reach normal values in the third trimenon again.

N2  - Several 24-h rhythms have been observed in the mother and in the fetus during primate gestation. In the mother, 24-h rhythms occur in biophysical variables. pregnancy-associated plasma hormones and preparturient myometrial activity. In addition, both pregnant non-human primates and pregnant women deliver preferentially during the night and early morning hours. A crucial question pertaining circadian rhythms is whether 24-h rhythms that may be observed during pregnancy are endogenous in nature and entrained by the light-dark cycle or whether the daily photoperiod is a causal stimulus. Our work has addressed the role of the maternal and fetal circadian system for 24-h rhythms in pregnancy-associated maternal plasma hormones, preparturient myometrial activity and parturition in human and non-human primate pregnancy. In the present review. the results of some of our studies are being discussed in combination with data available from the literature. It is apparent that 74-h rhythms that may be observed during primate pregnancy are determined by the maternal circadian system, suggesting that the developing fetus receives information about the ambient time of the day via the mother. Fetal entrainment by the mother may ensure fetal cooperation so that parturition occurs at the most favorable time of the day. We conclude that the functioning of the maternal circadian system is integral to the pregnant state. Thus, proper care and management of pregnant women and the ultimate outcome of obstetrics may benefit from more timely methodologies. A chronopharmacological attitude towards the prevention of premature labor and the induction and augmentation of labor at term may yield new therapeutic strategies. Such an approach will enable delivery to take place under optimal conditions for mother and child.

N2  - Excitatory amino acid neurotransmission is an essential component of the neuroendocrine transmission line that regulates anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. Excitatory amino acids (EAAs), such as glutamate and aspartate, are found in large concentrations in presynaptic boutons of a variety of important hypothalamic nuclei, including the arcuate nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the preoptic area. EAA receptors can be divided into two broad groups, namely, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are subdivided into NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), kainate, and AMPA (DL-α-amino-3-hydroxy- 5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors. Their main mode of action is by the modulation of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ion channels. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, act by a G-protein-stimulated release of intracellular Ca2+ or modulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The different EAA receptor subtypes are found in a variety of areas of the hypothalamus and the brain. In a variety of species, the administration of glutamate, NMDA, or kainate leads to LH release mediated through the stimulation of hypothalamic gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. The major site of NMDA action appears to be the preoptic area-where GnRH cell bodies reside. AMPA and kainate appear to act primarily at the arcuate nucleus/median eminence, the site of GnRH nerve terminals. NMDA may also act upon noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus to influence hypothalamic GnRH release. The steroid-induced LH surge in ovariectomized animals and the preovulatory surge of LH in cycling animals and in pregnant mare's serum gonadotropic-primed animals are blocked by the NMDA antagonist MK801 and the AMPA/kainate antagonist DNQX. MK801 also suppressed FSH surges in most instances, whereas DNQX had no effect on FSH surges. In the ovariectomized female rat, both the NMDA antagonist AP5 and the AMPA/kainate antagonist DNQX, lowered mean LH levels, LH pulse amplitude, and LH pulse frequency. Activation of NMDA receptors advanced the time of vaginal opening in the immature female rat, while kainate and DNQX were without effect. Gonadal steroid removal (castration) did not alter NMDA receptor levels or affinity in the hypothalamus of female or male rats. Likewise, steroid replacement to castrate rats did not affect hypothalamic NMDA receptor levels or NMDA R1 mRNA levels. Similarly, NMDA and kainate receptor levels in the hypothalamus did not change during the time of puberty in the female rat. In contrast, AMPA receptor (GluR1) immunoreactive levels in the magnocellular preoptic area (mPOA), the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were found to be markedly elevated during the time of the LH surge in estradiol-progesterone-treated castrate rats compared to those of the vehicle-only-treated castrate rat. The release rates of glutamate and aspartate in the POA were found to be significantly elevated during the steroid-induced LH surge in the ovariectomized adult rat. Hence, the induction of the LH surge by steroids may involve enhanced EAA neurotransmission mediated by steroid-induced elevations in the release of glutamate and aspartate in the POA and AMPA receptors in the POA, the ARC, and the SCN. Evidence also exists supporting a role of EAAs in the release of other pituitary hormones, such as prolactin, ACTH, growth hormone, oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as circadian rhythm induction and regulation. The above evidence points to a pivotal role of EAAs acting at the level of the hypothalamus in the neuroendocrine regulation of a variety of hormonal systems with the largest amount of data available on the control of gonadotropin secretion.

N2  - Objectives: To establish the reproducibility of flow velocity waveforms in the human ductus venosus and to assess the influence of fetal behavioural states on these waveforms in normal term fetuses. Design: Reproducibility of Doppler waveform recording and analysis was studied in 10 normal pregnancies. The relation between ductus venosus flow velocities and behavioural states was investigated in 19 other term fetuses. Time-averaged, peak systolic, peak diastolic velocity, peak systolic/diastolic ratio and period time were calculated in both cross sectional studies. Setting: Outpatient clinic, department of obstetrics (prenatal diagnosis section), Academic Hospital, Rotterdam-Dijkzigt. Subjects: Twenty-nine women with normal singleton pregnancies at 36 to 39 weeks of gestation, resulting in uncomplicated births of healthy infants. Results: Within-patient coefficients of variation, ductus venosus waveform recordings were approximately 8 to 10% except for the peak systolic/diastolic ratio (4.3%). A decrease of approximately 30% was established for peak systolic, peak diastolic velocity and time-averaged velocity during behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) as compared with state 2F (active sleep). Conclusions: Flow velocity waveform recording in the ductus venosus demonstrates acceptable reproducibility. Fetal behavioural state- dependent changes were observed, suggesting a redistribution of umbilical venous blood through the ductus venosus shunt during the quiet sleep state.

N2  - While the number of mothers resuming employment soon after the birth of a child is growing, knowledge about the effect that having both a baby and a job has on mental and physical health is still scarce. In this paper, we studied the health of 141 Italian first-time mothers, who were all employed during pregnancy. When their child was 15 months old, 84% were back at work; 24-36% suffered from lack of sleep, extreme tiredness and backache; more than half had experienced some feelings of depression since the birth Considering the whole sample, poorly educated and unmarried mothers reported more physical health problems. Being employed per se showed no influence, but poorly educated mothers and those with a less qualified job reported more problems. On the basis of our results, we suggest that future research on new mothers, work and health should systematically include 'domestic' variables and the characteristics of the paid job; and should analyze more thoroughly the influence of marriage status and educational level on health.

N2  - The aim of the second part of this review is to critically discuss the efficacy, safety and clinical aspects of nicotine replacement therapies. Nicotine replacement therapy is the only simple smoking cessation intervention to have had its efficacy confirmed by randomised clinical trials. It is appealing to smokers because most wish to quit without assistance from formal cessation programs. Nicotine replacement is effective in smokers who are well motivated to quit and who are significantly nicotine dependent. Transdermal nicotine is the easiest form of nicotine delivery to use and has the lowest dependence potential. Concurrent smoking and use of nicotine replacement products is inadvisable but represents a low risk to healthy individuals. The pooled odds ratios of long-term abstinence rates in randomised clinical trials are: nicotine chewing gum 1.7 and transdermal nicotine 2.3. Common adverse effects of 24 hour transdermal nicotine are transient application site itch, sleep disturbance and local skin reactions. Nicotine replacement therapies should be a last resort for the treatment of smokers with unstable coronary artery disease, or women who are pregnant, because of theoretical risks associated with treatment. In conclusion, nicotine replacement therapy is a logical approach for motivated, significantly nicotine-dependent smokers unable to quit by simpler means. Results can be augmented by the inclusion of other interventions, such as cessation counselling.

N2  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep was examined longitudinally in 34 obstetrically healthy volunteers recruited early in pregnancy. All women were free of current psychiatric disorder. Fourteen women had a personal history of affective disorder, and 20 had no history of any psychiatric disorder. EEG sleep was recorded in subjects' homes at specified points from 12 weeks' gestation through 8 months' postpartum to examine the impact of childbearing on sleep and psychiatric symptoms in women with a history of affective disorder. EEG sleep measurements, as well as clinical ratings of sleep, indicated that sleep disturbances were most pronounced over the first 2 to 3 months' postpartum and were characterized primarily by interrupted sleep. The obstetrical course of these women was uneventful, and the outcome with respect to affective disturbances was highly favorable. Nevertheless, childbearing was associated with greater changes in total sleep time and with rapid eye movement (REM) latency reduction in women with a history of affective disorder, even in the absence of clinically significant mood changes. Findings suggest that the sleep system of women with a history of affective disorder may be more sensitive to the psychobiological changes associated with childbearing, as evidenced by earlier onset of sleep disruption over the childbearing course and a reduction in REM latency in the final trimester that persisted throughout the eighth postpartum month.

Although stimulants are the only effective treatment for the sleepiness of narcolepsy, no clinical guidelines on the use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy have been published that address the following factors: appropriate doses; development of tolerance; potential for side effects, adverse reactions and abuse; and use in children and pregnant or breast-feeding women. These practice parameters from the American Sleep Disorders Association provide the first clinical guidelines on the appropriate use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy.

N2  - Repeated alterations in episodes of quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) is a basic feature of behavioral state organization in human fetuses. Activation of the reticular formation (RF) is important in the transition from QS to AS, and intrinsic changes in central nervous system (CNS) activity govern RF activation. Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) can alter RF activation and thus delay the occurrence of QS. We hypothesize that if intrinsic RF activation in human fetuses is greatest just after entering AS and is decreasing as an AS-to-QS transition is approached, then fetuses ought to be in an active period longer if stimulated just after entering AS than if stimulated closer to an AS-to-QS transition. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis. We examined 87 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation. Behavioral states were assigned based on fetal heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of fetal eye and gross body movements. All fetuses were observed to enter AS before being randomized to a particular group. After remaining in AS for 3 min, the fetus either was not stimulated (N = 30), received a single 1-s VAS after 3-5 min of AS (N = 30), or received a single 1-s VAS after 44-46 min of AS (N = 27). Heart rate and eye and body movements were monitored continuously until the fetus either returned to QS and remained in that state for 3 min or did not return to QS within 60 min. All 57 fetuses who were stimulated in AS responded to VAS with gross body movement and an increase in heart rate, indicating that there was no effect of prestimulus state duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Fetuses stimulated after 3-5 min of AS behaved similarly to fetuses who had entered AS spontaneously. However, fetuses who were stimulated after being in AS for 44- 46 min remained in an active period for a significantly shorter length of time following VAS than fetuses who either had been in AS for 3-5 min before VAS (19.6 min versus 36.4 min; P = 0.0001) or had entered AS spontaneously (19.6 min versus 44.2 min, P = 0.0001). When we included our results from a previous study examining state organization following VAS delivered in QS, we found that stimulation of the fetus around the time of a spontaneous AS-to- QS transition elicited a significantly different behavioral response than VAS delivered around the time of a spontaneous QS-to-AS transition: regardless of whether fetuses were in AS or QS at the time of stimulation, fetuses who were stimulated in close proximity to an AS-to-QS transition returned to QS sooner than fetuses who were stimulated closer to a QS-to-AS transition (18.7 min versus 37.2 min, P = 0.0001). We conclude that underlying changes in CNS activity, which continue to occur in the absence of overt behavioral changes, place relatively strict requirements on the amount of AS and QS during fetal life.

N2  - Objective. To investigate the effect of prenatal smoking on infant respiratory behavior during sleep. Methods. A questionnaire concerning family habits and infants' history was completed for 550 healthy infants before a 9- hour night polysomnographic study. Because the data for 41 infants were not available for analysis, 509 subjects were studied: 115 were newborns evaluated within 1 week after birth, and 394 were healthy infants admitted at 11 weeks of life (range 5 to 29 weeks) after various research protocols. Results. According to the smoking frequency of the mothers during pregnancy, the subjects were defined as 'nonsmokers' (no cigarette smoked during pregnancy; n = 400), 'light smokers' (1 to 9 cigarettes per day; n = 37), or 'smokers' (10 or more cigarettes per day; n = 72). Compared with nonsmokers and light smokers, 'smoking' mothers had a significant increase in the number of episodes of uterine bleeding during the pregnancy. Their infants had lower birth weights and more frequent episodes of profuse sweating during sleep. Infants of smokers also had more frequent and longer obstructive sleep apneas than those of the two other groups. For infants of smokers the relative risk for obstructive apneas was 2.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.63 to 4.69; P = .001) The relation between prenatal smoking and postnatal manifestation of obstructive sleep apneas demonstrated a dose-response pattern. Paternal smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of obstructive apneas only in the infants of smoking mothers, but not in those of the two other groups. Maternal smoking after birth did not add significantly to the risk of obstructive apneas. The effect of smoking was seen in older infants, as well as in the newborns not yet exposed to ambient cigarette smoke. A stepwise logistic regression, using obstructive sleep apneas as the dependent variable identified three significant independent variables: smoking during pregnancy (P = .001), profuse sweating during sleep (P = .001), and birth weight (P = .010). No explanation was found for the effect of prenatal smoking on obstructive sleep apneas. Conclusion. Prenatal smoking by mothers correlated with an increase in frequency and length of obstructive apneas and a decrease in birth weight of their infants. The infants were under greater risk for obstructive apnea if both parents smoked. Explanations for our results are unknown to us, but these findings may be of interest in the study of infant breathing behavior and epidemiological characteristics of sudden infant death syndrome.

N2  - The auditory brainstem response (ABR) was recorded in utero from chronically instrumented fetal sheep prior to and following exposure of pregnant ewes to intense broadband noise (120 dB SPL for 16 h). ABRs were elicited by clicks and tone bursts (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) delivered through a bone oscillator secured to the fetal skull. Latency-intensity functions for most of the four vertex-positive waves (labelled I-IV) were prolonged and ABR thresholds were temporarily elevated by an average of 8 dB following the noise exposure. Results show that exogenous sounds can penetrate the uterus and result in alterations of the fetal ABR.

N2  - Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been few studies on sleep characteristics in pregnancy. In this study, all women attending the antenatal clinic at Sapporo Medical College Hospital for 1 month during autumn and 3 months during winter were surveyed with a questionnaire and sleep log. Of the 192 patients, 169 (88.0%) stated that sleep was altered from their usual experience. A principal components analysis identified three sleep factors from the ten items in the measure of sleep used (Sleep Log). The three factors were: Sleep Duration and Quality, Insomnia and Daytime Alertness. Although no significant differences across trimesters were found on the three sleep factors, Sleep Duration and Quality, and Insomnia were worst during the first trimester. Sleep normalized in the second trimester, but the third trimester was characterized by increased Insomnia and decreased Daytime Alertness. The most frequent reasons cited by women for sleep alterations were urinary frequency, backache or ache in the hips and fetal movement. Contingency χ2 analyses were used to investigate a relationship between the frequency of reporting the reasons and the trimester of pregnancy. Significant increases were found in reporting as the reasons for sleep difficulties, fetal movement in the third trimester, and heartburn, nausea and vomiting in the first trimester. The description of sleep patterns during pregnancy has clinical relevance as sleep alterations in pregnancy are common.

N2  - Spontaneous breathing movements are present during fetal life and they are important for normal development of the lung. Early in gestation they seem to represent free-running activity of the respiratory centers, not controlled by peripheral mechanisms but probably dependent on a tonic CO2 drive. Maturation of sleep states brings into play powerful brainstem inhibitory mechanisms which control FBM. At birth these mechanisms must be overridden to allow the establishment of continuous breathing.

N2  - Differences in state-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral values are described between groups of preterm and full-term neonates at comparable postconceptional term ages. Eighteen healthy preterm neonates of ≤32 weeks gestation were selected from an inborn population of a neonatal intensive care unit. Twenty-four-channel recordings were obtained at a full- term age and compared with studies of 22 healthy full-term neonates. The initial three hours of each 12-hour study were recorded on paper from which EEG sleep state scores per minute were visually assessed. Six mean spectral values (i.e. total EEG, electromyogram, delta, theta, alpha and beta energies) were calculated from each corresponding minute of digitized data, which was also assigned one of six EEG sleep states. Each neonatal group displayed statistically significant differences among sleep-state segments for all spectral values. The alpha- and beta-range spectral values of the preterm group, compared to the full-term control group, were lower during all sleep state segments. Spectral values for the theta band were lower during both quiet sleep segments only, whereas spectral values for delta were lower during all sleep stages, except trace-alternant quiet sleep. Significant differences in EEG spectral values were noted among states of sleep for both preterm and full-term infants of similar postconceptional term ages. These data also suggest differences in central nervous system maturation between neonatal populations. These findings strengthen our previously stated contention that there is a functional alteration in brain development of the preterm infant as reflected in sleep organization that results from a prolonged extrauterine experience and/or prematurity.

N2  - In Rwanda, a central African country, the prevalence of HIV infection now exceeds 30% in urban adults. This study identifies the social services and counseling needs of women who are already infected with the HIV virus, the outcome after disclosure of the woman's HIV test result to her partner and estimates the social support available to the women from their partners and relatives. Fifty-five HIV-positive women in Kigali were interviewed in 1988 and 47 of this group were interviewed again in 1991. The social services most needed by the women in 1988 were housing, employment and money. By 1991, the women prioritised food, housing and money as their current needs and food, childcare and money were their future needs in the event they became ill. The preferred sources of support in 1988 were individual counseling and women's support groups. By 1991, the preferred sources of support were individual counseling and their priest. In 1988, almost 75% of the women did not expect a supportive reaction from their partners after disclosure of the test result. In 1991, acceptance, understanding and sympathy were the most common reactions of the partners after disclosure. However, 8 (21%) had not told their partner their test result. After disclosure, 18 of the 37 partners were subsequently tested. Of those tested, 75% were HlV-positive and 25% were HIV-negative. Condom use was almost twice as high when the partner was informed of the test result, although in couples overall, a third were not using condoms despite knowing the test result. There were 23 births since 1988 and pregnancy was equally likely whether the test result was known or if the partner tested. The women overall reported good morale in 1991, bolstered by their religion. Chronic difficulties with sleep, performing daily routine and feelings of depression were reported by a third of women. Conclusions are that basic survival services are needed for affected families, and a program of testing and counseling for partners is required.

N2  - The position adopted during sleep by 52 pregnant women and 31 age-matched nonpregnant control subjects was studied. The pregnant group were all beyond the 30th week of gestation. In the pregnant group, 40 (77%) adopted a left tilt, 11 (21%) a right tilt and one (2%) was supine. In the control group, eight (26%) adopted a left tilt, 10 (32%) a right tilt, 12 (39%) were supine and one (3%) was prone. Closer analysis of the position adopted by the pregnant group showed: 33 adopted a full left 90° tilt, five a left 60° tilt, two a left 30° tilt, 11 adopted a full 90° right tilt and only one was supine. There was a significant difference between the sleeping positions of the pregnant and the control groups (p < 0.001). The majority of the pregnant group adopted a sleeping position that reduced the likelihood of aortocaval compression syndrome.

N2  - Occulted hyperprolactinemia (OHP) is a clinical subtype of the hyperprolactinemia, which causes several kinds of ovulatory disturbances, sterility and galactorrhea. The same clinical disorders as in the apparent hyperprolactinemia are also observed in women with OHP, which is caused by a transient increase in prolactin. OHP is defined as transient hyperprolactinemia during sleep or in the pre-ovulatory period of the menstrual cycle, and accompanied by increased prolactin secreting capacity. Prolactin secreting capacity determined by the TRH, metoclopramide or estradiol-loading-test reveals hyperresponsiveness in OHP, while the basal level of prolactin does not show apparent hyperprolactinemia. The usefulness of bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) has been established not only in the treatment of apparent hyperprolactinemia but also in OHP. Following bromocriptine administration, 83% of OHP patients have returned to normal ovulatory cycles and 50% of them have become pregnant.

N2  - Mothers in postpartum periods are forced to be awake at night in order to take care of their babies. It is important to investigate relationships between the sleep patterns of postpartum mothers and their babies' activities under conditions in daily life to determine effects on their health. In this study, changes in sleep parameters of young women from late pregnancy to the 6th postpartum week were studied using the ambulatory EEG monitoring system. Subjects were 10 primiparae, aged 23-31 yrs (mean age of 26.8 yrs), who had a normal course of pregnancy and delivery. EEG, EMG, EOG and ECG of the mothers and their babies' actigrams from legs during sleep were simultaneously recorded using Medilog 9000 at home at four points: during late pregnancy (36 weeks), and the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. In the late pregnancy period, mean sleep efficiency for the 10 subjects was 94.5%, and mean total sleep time was 368.8 min. We compared the sleep parameters of four points using a two-way analysis of variance (point x subject). Total sleep time showed no significant differences among the four points (postpartum 1st week: 336.8 min, 3rd: 314.2 min, 6th:312.6 min.). Percent of waking time after sleep onset in the 1st postpartum week (21.1%) significantly increased compared with late pregnancy (5.4%), but did not change through the 3rd (19.7%) and 6th week (20.7%). The percent of stage 3 + 4 and stage REM did not change across the four points, but the percent of stage 2 in the postpartum period (1st week: 39.7%, 3rd: 41.2%, 6th: 41.0%) significantly decreased compared with late pregnancy (59.6%). There were no significant differences in the number of awakening among the four points. In conclusion, wakefulness after sleep onset during postpartum period increased compared with late pregnancy. The mothers' sleep pattern did not change through the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. These findings suggested strongly that their sleep was interrupted by their babies' activities, as shown in another abstract.

N2  - Objective: To review current knowledge of the efficacy, safety and cost of transdermal nicotine therapy for smoking cessation. Data sources and study selection: 1. Published and unpublished reports of randomised, double-blind trials of at least 12 weeks' duration, in smokers motivated to cease smoking, identified by a search of the MEDLINE database, article and book bibliographies, Current contents, and by a request to the Medical Department of Ciba-Geigy (Australia) Ltd. 2. A clinical trial of 1500 smokers using transdermal nicotine (S Gourlay, unpublished data). Data synthesis: Transdermal nicotine more than doubles the success rates of smoking cessation attempts in motivated subjects who smoke at least 10-15 cigarettes per day (odds ratio 12 months after quitting, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.4). Application site reactions are not uncommon (erythema or burning ≤ 16%, transient itch <50%) and cause discontinuation of therapy in up to 10% of subjects. Sleep disturbance due to nocturnal nicotine absorption occurs in up to 13% of subjects when patches are worn overnight. Smoking or nicotine chewing gum used concurrently with transdermal nicotine could raise peak nicotine levels but is unlikely to adversely affect individuals with established tolerance to nicotine. Smoking and (theoretically) nicotine replacement therapies should be avoided in pregnancy or patients with unstable coronary artery disease. In such patients, the risk-benefit ratio of nicotine replacement therapies may be favourable for nicotine-dependent smokers unable to cease smoking by alternative methods. Conclusions: Transdermal nicotine is an effective smoking cessation therapy for motivated, nicotine-dependent smokers. As most smokers can cease smoking on their own, and the patches are costly, they should be recommended only for smokers who are unable to quit by simpler means and those likely to suffer severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

N2  - The present review is devoted to effects on the newborn of maternal ingestion of caffeine during gestation and lactation. In rodents, caffeine is able to induce malformations, but usually at high doses never encountered in humans; indeed, when caffeine is administered in fractioned quantities during the day, as it is the case with human caffeine intake, caffeine is no longer a teratogen in rodents. Caffeine ingested during gestation induces a dose- dependent decrease in body weight, but only for large doses (>7 cups/day of coffee), whereas it has no effect at moderate doses. Maternal caffeine consumption during gestation affects hematologic parameters in both rat and human infants and induces long-term effects on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety in rodent offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to determine the consequences of early caffeine exposure on behavior. Investigators do not agree on the quantities of the methylxanthine found in breast milk, but caffeine does not change breast milk composition, and rather, stimulates milk production. We conclude in this review that maternal caffeine consumption in moderate amounts during gestation and lactation has no measurable consequences on the fetus and newborn infant. Pregnant mothers, however, should be advised to consume coffee and caffeinated beverages in moderation, especially because of the prolonged half-life of caffeine both during the last trimester of pregnancy and in the newborn infant.

N2  - The effects of prenatal and postnatal protein malnutrition on the major and minor somatic axes of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) cells of the rat were investigated. Female rats were fed either 6%, 8% or 25% casein diet 5 weeks before mating, during gestation and lactation. After weaning the pups were maintained on the same diet until sacrifice at 30, 90 or 220 days of age. The major and minor axes in fusiform, multipolar and ovoid cells were measured in Nissl-stained SCN slices. Although the 8% diet group displayed significant reductions in fusiform and ovoid cells, the 6% diet group showed the most intense reductions in cell size of the three cell types. In the 6% diet group, cell size was significantly lower at 30 days but the difference with the other nutritional groups ameliorated at 90 days and almost reached control values at 220 days. These data suggest that malnutrition maintained during gestation and postnatal life reduces the somatic size of SCN cells. This alteration may be a morphological substrate underlying sleep and behavioral circadian alterations observed in malnourished rats.

N2  - Cocaine use by pregnant women has been reported to cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that human neonates exposed to cocaine via maternal use during pregnancy might manifest changes in beat- to-beat heart rate variability, similar to those described in experimental animals. In this preliminary report, we present findings from the first systematic analysis of heart rate dynamics in a small group of (n = 5) neonates exposed in utero to cocaine compared to gestationally age matched controls (n = 6) without known drug exposure. Overall heart rate spectral power during ten minute periods of quiescent sleep was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in the cocaine-exposed group, reminiscent of the changes recently reported in an animal model. In two other cocaine-exposed newborns, a quiescent sleep period could not be found. We discuss the special methodological problems associated with collection and interpretation of such data.
