TI  - Infant sleep environments depicted in magazines targeted to women of childbearing
      age.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of
      childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
      guidelines for safe infant sleep practices. METHODS: Magazines were included in
      this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of
      >900000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met
      these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and
      parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of
      infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in 
      issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for
      decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 391
      unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57
      pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed
      the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed 
      as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep
      environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP.
      CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines
      geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep
      position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not
      consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent 
      with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep 
      safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

TI  - Sleep apnea, respiratory cooling and thermoregulation.
PG  - 900-5
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.055 [doi]
AB  - This article will suggest that moderate sleep apnea may have an adaptive benefit,
      the reduction of nocturnal, respiratory heat loss, that may have caused it to be 
      selected for despite the associated disadvantages. Sleep apnea is caused by the
      collapse of the throat, specifically the pharyngeal airway, during sleep and can 
      result in discomfort and hypoxia. The large size of the fleshy structures in the 
      pharynx and hypotonicity of the pharyngeal musculature are what cause humans, and
      many other species of mammals, to be susceptible to apnea. There are many
      functional and anatomical parallels between sleep apnea and a well known,
      thermoregulatory response that minimizes respiratory cooling in the lower airways
      known as reflex bronchoconstriction. Bronchoconstriction involves the
      constriction of the inner airways, the bronchioles, in response to cold air, a
      reaction that acts to warm inspired air before it makes contact with the more
      sensitive lower airways and alveoli. Because air is colder at night and body
      temperature drops severely during sleep, sleep apnea may represent a similar
      protective, thermoregulatory adaptation. When the pharynx is collapsed, the
      diameter of the pharyngeal airway decreases, allowing increased intermolecular
      collisions between inspired air and the epithelial walls of the upper airway. An 
      increase in the number of collisions facilitates the transference of both warmth 
      and humidity to inspired air before it reaches the more sensitive lower airway
      resulting in the maintenance of internal, core temperature and alveolar heat
      retention. In fact, sleep apnea can be conceptualized as a functional reversal of
      the thermoregulatory process of panting, where the pharynx is highly dilated
      instead of collapsed. Given the disorder associated with sleep apnea, the absence
      of a disease state secondary to surgical correction, the fact that the disorder
      is exclusive to warm-blooded animals, the high proclivity for collapse documented
      in pregnant mothers, and the functional similarities between collapse and reflex 
      bronchoconstriction, it appears that the phenomenon may represent an evolutionary
      trade-off that helped to minimize respiratory cooling.

AB  - AIMS: To determine trimester-specific risk factors for small-for-gestational-age 
      (SGA) infants. METHODS: A population-based prospective cohort study was conducted
      in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or
      before 16 weeks of gestation and followed up until delivery. The sample size was 
      690. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were
      gathered on average at 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. SGA was assessed
      using customised birth centile charts. Multiple logistic regression was applied, 
      and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
      (95%CI). RESULTS: The risk factors for SGA less than 5th centile were shift work 
      and exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters (OR
      4.20, 95%CI 1.10-16.0), sleeping for less than or equal to 8 h during 2nd or 3rd 
      or both trimesters (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.08-4.59), walking for less than or equal to 
      2.5 h per day (OR 2.66, 95%CI 1.12-6.31) and alcohol consumption during the 3rd
      trimester (OR 14.5, 95%CI 2.23-94.7). Poor weekly gestational weight gain was
      significantly associated with both SGA < 10th and < 5th centiles. None of the
      other factors became significant for SGA < 10th centile. CONCLUSIONS: Risk
      factors for SGA less than 5th centile were sleep deprivation and shift work and
      exposure to physical and chemical hazards during 2nd and 3rd trimesters, less
      walking hours and alcohol consumption during 3rd trimester. Poor weekly
      gestational weight gain may be considered as a predictor of delivering an SGA
      infant.

TI  - Serotonin discontinuation syndrome following in utero exposure to antidepressant 
      medication: prospective controlled study.
PG  - 846-54
LID - 10.1080/00048670903107583 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms
      previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication
      in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a
      prospective and controlled design. METHOD: A prospective case-control study
      recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched
      controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27
      women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of
      these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery
      women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed 
      questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions
      pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about
      pregnancy and delivery complications. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of
      discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late
      pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were
      found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying,
      jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for <3 h after a
      feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the 
      special care nursery. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy 
      is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with
      the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of
      symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous
      system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated
      with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.

TI  - The role of the neural sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in diurnal and
      sleep state-related cardiovascular rhythms in the late-gestation ovine fetus.
PG  - R998-R1008
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.90979.2008 [doi]
AB  - The efferent mechanisms mediating the well-known diurnal cardiovascular rhythms
      in the late-gestation fetus are only partially understood. In the present study, 
      we evaluated the contribution of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous
      systems (SNS) to these rhythms. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at a mean
      (SE) of 122 (1) days gestation (term is 147 days) underwent either chemical
      sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine the day after surgery (n = 8), vagotomy at
      surgery (n = 8), or were sham controls (n = 8). Fetal heart rate (HR), fetal HR
      variability (HRV), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), carotid blood flow (CaBF),
      electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity, and nuchal activity were measured
      continuously for 24 h. Changes between sleep states were determined in a 6-h
      interval. Control fetal sheep showed consistent diurnal rhythms in fetal HR, HRV,
      MAP, and CaBF, with maximal activity in the evening, but not in nuchal activity. 
      Sympathectomy was associated with a significant reduction of both fetal HR and
      HRV, while vagotomy was associated with a fall in fetal HRV (P < 0.05) but no
      change in HR. Despite this, most animals in the two intervention groups still
      showed diurnal rhythms for fetal HR, HRV, MAP, and CaBF, although peak HR may
      have been delayed in the sympathectomy group (mean 02:22 vs. 23:54 h in controls,
      P = 0.06). There was no effect of either intervention on sleep state cycling,
      although state-related cardiovascular rhythms were significantly modulated. These
      data indicate that, neither the SNS nor vagal activity, in isolation at least, is
      essential for generating cardiovascular diurnal rhythms in the late-gestation
      fetus.

TI  - Sleep and depression in postpartum women: a population-based study.
PG  - 847-55
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for
      postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2)
      identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore 
      associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional. SETTING: Population-based. PARTICIPANTS: All women (n = 4191)
      who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September
      2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was
      68% (n = 2830). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was measured
      using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using
      the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep
      problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression,
      defined as EPDS > or = 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep
      duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep
      problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger
      or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor
      sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant
      risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous
      depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep
      disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly
      associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep was associated with
      depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk 
      of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also
      associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting
      symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ilio-caval stenting now represents the first line treatment for
      disabling obstructive ilio-caval lesions. Most patients are young women of
      child-bearing age. We herein report our experience of pregnancy in women who have
      a history of ilio-caval stenting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 1995 to
      April 2008, 119 patients had ilio-caval stenting for obstructive venous disease
      in our department. Of these, 62 women were able to become pregnant. When
      pregnancy occurred, they received preventive treatment with low molecular weight 
      heparin (LMWH) from the 3rd month of pregnancy to 1 month after delivery and had 
      to wear elastic stockings. Patients also had to sleep on their right side if
      possible. They were followed during the pregnancy by duplex scanning at 3, 6, and
      8 months, and then 1 month after delivery. RESULTS: Eight pregnancies occurred in
      6 patients (mean age 26.5 years) who had a patent self-expanding stent (1 patient
      had 3 pregnancies). They had stenting for May-Thurner disease in 3 patients, for 
      post-deep venous thrombosis (DVT) left common iliac vein occlusion in 1 patient, 
      and during venous thrombectomy in 2 patients. All stents were self-expanding
      metallic stents located on the left common iliac vein. One patient had unrelated 
      spontaneous abortion after 2 months of pregnancy. No DVT or symptomatic pulmonary
      embolism occurred during pregnancy, delivery, or during the postpartum period.
      Four patients needed cesarean delivery and none had hemorrhagic complications.
      None of the patients had adverse effects from the treatment. Duplex scan showed
      compression of the stent(s) at 8 months in 4 patients with inflow obstruction in 
      3 patients. Postpartum duplex-scan showed no remaining stenosis in all patients. 
      No stents had structural damage. CONCLUSION: Ilio-caval stent compression can
      occur during pregnancy but does not lead to structural damage to the
      self-expanding stents. Despite this, no cases of DVT occurred with preventive
      LMWH treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that
      remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated 
      tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to
      evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the
      risk for OSAS among females in the United States. METHODS: This is an analysis of
      data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The
      NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. adults.
      The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of
      pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the
      risk for OSAS among the U.S. female population. This instrument includes
      questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness,
      hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep
      problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders. RESULTS:
      Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for
      OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring 
      (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. 
      Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless
      legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently
      reported. The risk increased with age (p < 0.05), obesity (p < 0.001), and
      menopause (p < 0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more
      frequently reported among women at high risk. CONCLUSIONS: One in four women in
      America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical
      community of this disorder in females should thus be increased.

TI  - Sleep deprivation during pregnancy and maternal and fetal outcomes: is there a
      relationship?
PG  - 107-14
LID - 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly
      prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities
      at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's
      daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is
      associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is
      important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine
      levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such 
      as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep
      deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the
      existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and
      fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep
      deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and
      postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in 
      the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying
      data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and
      non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or
      non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is
      needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse
      maternal and fetal outcomes.

TI  - Infant bed-sharing practices and associated risk factors among births and infant 
      deaths in Alaska.
PG  - 527-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Alaska Division of Public Health has stated that infants may
      safely share a bed for sleeping if this occurs with a nonsmoking, unimpaired
      caregiver on a standard, adult, non-water mattress. Because this policy is
      contrary to recent national recommendations that discourage any bed sharing, we
      examined 13 years of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred while bed sharing to
      assess the contribution of known risk factors. METHODS: We examined vital
      records, medical records, autopsy reports, and first responder reports for 93% of
      Alaskan infant deaths that occurred between 1992 and 2004. We examined deaths
      while bed sharing for risk factors including sleeping with a non-caregiver, prone
      position, maternal tobacco use, impairment of a bed-sharing partner, and an
      unsafe sleep surface. We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data to
      describe bed-sharing practices among all live births in Alaska during 1996-2003. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen percent (n=126) of deaths occurred while bed sharing; 99% of
      these had at least one associated risk factor, including maternal tobacco use
      (75%) and sleeping with an impaired person (43%). Frequent bed sharing was
      reported for 38% of Alaskan infants. Among these, 60% of mothers reported no risk
      factors; the remaining 40% reported substance use, smoking, high levels of
      alcohol use, or most often placing their infant prone for sleeping. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Almost all bed-sharing deaths occurred in association with other risk factors
      despite the finding that most women reporting frequent bed sharing had no risk
      factors; this suggests that bed sharing alone does not increase the risk of
      infant death.

TI  - [Restless legs syndrome. Features and impact on sleep].
PG  - 230-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic neurological disorder
      that has a negtive influence on sleep. We describe clinical spectrum,
      polysomnogram and impact on sleep of patients' series with RLS. METHODS: We
      studied 49 patients with RLS. We analyse socio- demographic information, clinical
      features, therapy and impact on sleep. We realized differents questionnaire:
      Index of Severity of Sleep, Epworth Scale, Index-RLS, Questionnaire Quality of
      Life-RLS and Questionnaire from limitation of laboral productivity. RESULTS: Mean
      age is 60.33+/-14.27 with similar distribution enter gender. They presented a
      positive family history in 36,73% with predominant in early onset of symptoms.
      Secondary causes more frequent associated were rheumatoid arthritis,
      iron-deficiency, uremia, pregnancy and polineuropathy. Significative prevalence
      of insomnia (73,43%) and periodic limb movement disorder (51,02%), obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome (22,45%) and hipersomnia (22,45 %). Pharmacological
      treatment more used were dopaminergic drugs. We didn't find significant stadistic
      differences enter clinical feature and therapy, so tendency to better quality of 
      life with dopaminergic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: It's an neurological disorder with
      important delay in diagnosis. Early detection is needed because important impact 
      on sleep efficiency and quality of life, and improvement with therapy, solely
      dopaminergic drugs.

PG  - 256-60
LID - 10.1097/01.NMC.0000357921.63971.9e [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary
      data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term
      gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group,
      cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary
      divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment 
      over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding
      and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data.
      Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days 
      of data. RESULTS: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables 
      did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using
      increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r > or = 0.80)
      when 3 days of data were used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical measures should be
      valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake
      pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information.
      These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to
      reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess
      maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in
      clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

TI  - Voices of the women: feedback from women of child-bearing age who are living with
      HIV can help improve efficacy of psychosocial interventions.
PG  - 274-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that voluntary counselling and testing during
      pregnancy are necessary but not sufficient to provide the holistic psychosocial
      support needed by Jamaican women living with HIV and/or AIDS. Based on this
      hypothesis, we investigated a range of coping methods and support systems used by
      HIV-infected women and a group of their HIV-negative counterparts before, during 
      and immediately after their pregnancies. METHODS: Women attending obstetric
      clinics in urban Jamaica completed a quantitative survey aimed at discovering
      coping behaviours, social and spiritual support systems. Pre-survey focus group
      studies and key informant interviews contributed to the design of the
      questionnaire while post-survey focus groups were used to probe the validity of
      the data gleaned from the questionnaire survey Survey data were analyzed using
      non-parametric tests for trend with independent univariate tests. RESULTS:
      Fifty-five HIV-infected women and 51 HIV-negative women completed the survey
      Compared with HIV-negative women, more HIV-infected women reported both feeling
      depressed (p = 0.07) and having difficulty concentrating (p = 0.05) during the
      month immediately prior to the study. Other statistically significant differences
      included: HIV-infected women were more likely to pray, to sleep and to change
      eating habits in response to worry and stress (p = 0.001 in each instance).
      Although several women declared religious faith, significantly fewer HIV-infected
      women were willing to talk to a religious leader about their problems compared to
      their HIV-negative counterparts (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Participation of
      HIV-infected women in post-survey focus groups augmented the survey findings.
      Many of the women reported negative emotions and some indicated serious
      challenges in accessing social support. The results point to the need for
      systematic documentation of psychosocial profiles as part of the approach to
      caring for these women. In addition, in the Jamaican sociocultural context, we
      recommend improved training of religious leaders and healthcare providers in
      psychosocial issues.

      Ethanol: a teratogen in developing brain.
PG  - SP273-8
AB  - Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences
      on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD).
      Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system 
      dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic
      cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children 
      born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by
      a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure 
      during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat 
      model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing
      2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol
      consumption by these dams was 11.53 +/- 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed
      to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal
      mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol 
      during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing
      system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan
      is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with 
      the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of
      FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels
      warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies.
      Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the
      only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol
      during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

TI  - New approaches in the management of insomnia: weighing the advantages of
      prolonged-release melatonin and synthetic melatoninergic agonists.
PG  - 341-54
AB  - Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT(1) and
      MT(2) receptors, especially those in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic
      nucleus, which acts on the hypothalamic sleep switch. Therefore, they differ
      fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists primarily favor
      sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent
      sleep, as required in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A major obstacle for the 
      use of melatonin to support sleep maintenance in primary insomnia results from
      its short half-life in the circulation. Solutions to this problem have been
      sought by developing prolonged-release formulations of the natural hormone, or
      melatoninergic drugs of longer half-life, such as ramelteon, tasimelteon and
      agomelatine. With all these drugs, improvements of sleep are statistically
      demonstrable, but remain limited, especially in primary chronic insomnia, so that
      GABAergic drugs may be indicated. Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day
      hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence. They do not induce behavioral
      changes, as sometimes observed with z-drugs. Despite otherwise good tolerability,
      the use of melatoninergic drugs in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy
      has been a matter of concern, and should be avoided in autoimmune diseases and
      Parkinsonism. Problems and limits of melatoninergic hypnotics are compared.

TI  - Sleep complaints: Whenever possible, avoid the use of sleeping pills.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - (1) Most sleep complaints involve difficulties in getting to sleep or staying
      asleep, or not feeling refreshed on awakening. Misconceptions and worrying over
      the lack of sleep and its consequences can contribute to reinforcing these
      disorders; (2) How can patients who complain of poor-quality sleep be helped,
      without resorting to treatments that can have adverse effects? To answer this
      question, we conducted a systematic review of the literature based on the
      standard Prescrire procedure; (3) One effective approach is to explain the basic 
      physiology of sleep, to discuss misconceptions, and to adopt a strategy of
      "stimulus control". This method has a similar efficacy to prescribing a
      benzodiazepine. and the effect is longer lasting; (4) Moderate, regular physical 
      exercise, especially in the morning, seems to help some patients, but the
      evidence is weak; (5) Some clinical trials of phytotherapy have shown a positive 
      risk-benefit balance of weak aqueous or hydroalcoholic valerian extracts.
      Efficacy is limited, however; (6) A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials
      showed that benzodiazepines and related drugs increase the duration of sleep and 
      help patients to fall asleep sooner. However, none of these trials provides
      comparative data spanning periods of more than two weeks. Efficacy is uncertain
      in the longer term, as patients quickly develop a tolerance to the hypnotic
      effects of benzodiazepines; (7) The adverse effects of benzodiazepines include
      frequent memory disorders, daytime drowsiness, falls, fractures and road
      accidents, and a withdrawal syndrome after treatment cessation. Related drugs
      such as zolpidem and zopiclone provoke similar adverse effects; (8) Sedative
      antihistamines have not been as well-evaluated as benzodiazepines in this
      setting. Small comparative trials of doxylamine and diphenhydramine showed no
      major difference in efficacy versus benzodiazepines and related drugs. The main
      adverse effects of sedative antihistamines are daytime drowsiness and altered
      vigilance, and atropinic effects; (9) Case-control studies showed a statistical
      link between benzodiazepine use in early pregnancy and birth defects such as
      cleft lip. In contrast, data on the use of doxylamine during pregnancy are
      reassuring; (10) Other sedative psychotropics have not been adequately tested in 
      this setting or have been shown to have a negative risk-benefit balance; (11) In 
      practice, patients who complain of poor-quality sleep should be given appropriate
      information on the mechanisms of normal sleep and related misconceptions, on the 
      best methods for getting to sleep, and on the dangers of sedative psychotropics
      (dependence, withdrawal syndrome). When prescribing or dispensing a
      benzodiazepine to a woman of child-bearing age, the risk of birth defects,
      although not clearly demonstrated, must be mentioned.

TI  - [Diagnosis and symptom rating scale of restless legs syndrome].
PG  - 533-8
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an
      irresistible urge to move the legs and usually accompanied or caused by
      uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of
      rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movement and is
      exacerbated or occurs mainly in the evening or night. People suffering from RLS
      are estimated to represent 2-3% of the general Japanese population, which is
      relatively lower than the estimated prevalence in western countries. Supportive
      diagnostic critevia include family history, the presence of periodic-leg
      movements (PLM) when awake or asleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic
      treatment. RLS phenotypes include an early onset form that is usually idiopathic 
      with frequent familial history and a late onset form that is usually secondary to
      other somatic conditions that are causative factors in RLS occurrence. In all
      patients presenting with complaints of insomnia or discomfort in the lower limbs,
      diagnosis of RLS should be considered. RLS should be differentiated from
      akathisia, which is an urge to move the whole body in the absence of
      uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested
      immobilization test (SIT) can detect PLM in patients that are asleep or awake.
      RLS may cause severe sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and
      anxious symptoms, and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Secondary 
      RLS may occur due to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy,
      peripheral neuropathy and drug use including antipsychotics and antidepressants. 
      Small fiber neuropathy can trigger RLS or mimic its symptoms. RLS is associated
      with many neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease and multiple system
      atrophy; althoughit does not predispose to these diseases. A symptom rating scale
      for RLS authorized by the International RLS Study Group (IRLS) would facilitate
      accurate diagnosis of this condition.

TI  - [Prevalence of restless legs syndrome].
PG  - 515-21
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder wherein sensory motor 
      symptoms are observed in the limbs mainly during sleep and quiet wakefulness. The
      diagnostic criteria for RLS were established in 1995 by the International RLS
      Study Group (IRLSSG) and revised in 2003. The prevalence of RLS in Europe and
      North America was reported to be between 5% and 12%. On the other hand, the
      prevalence of RLS in Asia was lesser than that in Europe and North America: it
      was estimated to be less than 4%. This difference might be associated with
      vacial, cultural, and language differences. Genetic factors are known to
      contribute to the etiology of RLS in up to two-thirds of these patients.
      Furthermore, RLS might complicate an already existing medical condition. The
      development of secondary RLS is associated with renal failure, iron deficiency,
      frequent blood donation, Parkinson disease, neuropathy, as well as pregnancy.
      Generally, these medical condition are more frequently complicated in patient
      with RLS than in healthy controls. However, there is no conclusive evidence to
      prove an association between these medical conditions and RLS. Genetic
      contribution, environmental factors and other covariates such as gender, age,
      iron deficiency, as well as medical conditions play an important role in the
      development of RLS. In conclusion, epidemiological evidence suggests that both
      the primary and secondary forms of RLS are common neurological disorders. Future 
      epidemiological studies are required to determine the potential risk factors
      contributing to the development of this disorder.

AB  - Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this
      longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among
      infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and
      (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five 
      mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at
      assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12
      months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal
      cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and 
      concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing
      behaviors mediated the relations between these domains.

TI  - [Efficiency of the "disk-over-water" method without feedback for sleep
      deprivation in rats].
PG  - 245-51
AB  - The "disk-over-water" method, where animals are awakened by disk rotation
      triggered by sleep EEG signals, was efficiently used in many studies involving
      sleep deprivation. Recently, the modification of this method has been developed
      where, during the period of deprivation, the disk was rotated in accordance with 
      a pre-set program (the "disk-over-water" method without feedback). We considered 
      this modification as a potentially promising one for investigation of
      relationship between maternal sleep and litter development. However, none of
      these methods has been used in experiments on female rats, and efficiency of the 
      method without feedback has never been tested using electrophysiological
      estimation of sleep-wake states either. Performing these tasks was the goal of
      the present study. Cortical EEG, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor
      activity were recorded in 14 female Wistar rats underwent sleep deprivation in
      the "disk-over-water" setup without feedback. Three days long during the
      deprivation periods from 11:00 to 14:00 the disk was rotated for 8 s with 15 s
      intervals. REM sleep was totally eliminated during these periods, and amounts of 
      slow wave sleep did not exceed 10% of 3 h. The results were identical both for
      pregnant and non-pregnant rats. The rate of sleep reduction during deprivation
      periods in our experimental conditions did not differ from that in the original
      system with the feedback. Thus the simplified "disk-over-water" method without
      feedback can be used in the studies involving relatively short sleep deprivation 
      periods.

LID - 10.1007/s00404-009-1111-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the normal ranges of sleep-wake cycles in normal fetuses.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 600 fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings were
      studied from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at a gestational age between 30 
      and 40 weeks with a 1-h recording. Two obstetricians interpreted all the FHR
      recordings independently. RESULTS: The mean baseline FHR was 141.6 (7.6)
      beats/min. The median relative percentage time spent in a quiet state was 26%
      (0-88.6). The median duration of time spent in a quiet state was 15.7 min
      (0-53.2) within a 1-h recording. Both quiet and active states were established in
      84% of cases. The number of FHR accelerations per hour in an active state
      increased with advancing gestational age, whereas the baseline FHR gradually
      decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Normal ranges of fetal sleep-wake cycles were
      established. Fetuses between 30 and 40 weeks had wide variations in the
      percentage of time spent in sleep-wake states.

TI  - Infant sleep disturbance is associated with preconceptional psychological
      distress: findings from the Southampton Women's Survey.
PG  - 566-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is
      associated with infant sleep disturbance. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
      SETTING: Southampton, UK. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of women from the Southampton
      Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed 
      through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant
      pairs were involved in the study. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Preconceptional
      psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire
      (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to
      report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight
      and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological
      distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of
      age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and
      other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated
      with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23, 95% CI
      1.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confidence
      intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: Women with preconceptional psychological 
      distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy,
      independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

TI  - Leg cramps and restless legs syndrome during pregnancy.
PG  - 211-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jmwh.2009.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbance during pregnancy can result in excessive daytime sleepiness,
      diminished daytime performance, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the
      potential for an increased length of labor and increased risk of operative birth.
      Sleep disturbance may be the result of a sleep disorder, such as leg cramps, a
      common yet benign disorder, or restless legs syndrome, a sensorimotor disorder.
      Both disrupt sleep, are distressing to the pregnant woman, and mimic one another 
      and other serious disorders. During pregnancy, up to 30% of women can be affected
      by leg cramps, and up to 26% can be affected by restless legs syndrome.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure control with bedtime aspirin administration in subjects
      with prehypertension.
PG  - 896-903
LID - 10.1038/ajh.2009.83 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin has been found to prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension
      and to induce nitric oxide (NO) release from vascular endothelium. Low-dose
      aspirin has also been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) when administered at
      bedtime, as opposed to upon awakening, in untreated hypertensive patients and
      high-risk pregnant women. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on ambulatory 
      BP of aspirin administered at different times of the day in prehypertension.
      METHODS: We studied 244 subjects with prehypertension, 43.0 +/- 13.0 years of
      age, randomly divided in three groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary
      recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/day) on awakening; 
      or the same recommendations and aspirin at bedtime. BP was measured for 48
      consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention. RESULTS: Ambulatory 
      BP was unchanged in subjects randomized to either nonpharmacological intervention
      or aspirin on awakening. A significant ambulatory BP reduction was, however,
      observed in the subjects who received aspirin at bedtime (decrease of 6/3 mm Hg
      in the 24-h mean of systolic (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP), respectively; P < 0.001), 
      without changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline. BP was homogeneously controlled
      along the 24 h after bedtime aspirin administration (6/4 mm Hg reduction in
      activity mean of SBP/DBP; 6/3 mm Hg reduction in sleep-time mean, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This prospective trial documents a significant effect on BP of low
      dose aspirin only when ingested at bedtime by prehypertensive subjects. The timed
      administration of low-dose aspirin could thus provide a valuable and
      cost-effective approach for BP control in subjects at elevated risk of developing
      hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe different sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness in a
      French population of randomly selected young women during pregnancy and to
      evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters
      of pregnancy. METHODS: Cross-sectional design with retrospective survey of
      pre-pregnancy, symptoms and prospective survey of current symptoms. Mothers were 
      interviewed during pregnancy with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep before 
      pregnancy and to assess alterations in their sleep according to the trimester.
      RESULTS: 871 pregnant women completed the questionnaire. The rate of pregnant
      women with insomnia with non-refreshing sleep and frequent awakenings increases
      during the second and the third trimester reaching more than 75% of the women,
      essentially due to an urge to urinate, movements of the fetus, backache and
      restless legs syndrome. Snoring also increases throughout the pregnancy with more
      than 18% of them snoring every night. Conversely, more than 75% of the women
      complained of a decrease in their vigilance and a need to nap inreased during the
      pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as 
      the first trimester of pregnancy and increases throughout the pregnancy, except
      for excessive daytime sleepiness which was more frequent during the first
      trimester.

TI  - Ethanol teratogenesis in five inbred strains of mice.
PG  - 1238-45
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.00949.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated individual differences in
      susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Many
      factors, including genetic differences, have been shown to play a role in
      susceptibility and resistance, but few studies have investigated the range of
      genetic variation in rodent models. METHODS: We examined ethanol teratogenesis in
      5 inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J (B6), Inbred Short-Sleep, C3H/Ibg, A/Ibg, and 
      129S6/SvEvTac (129). Pregnant dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol
      (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD) on day 9 of pregnancy. Dams
      were sacrificed on day 18 and fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for gross
      morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was then either
      placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and
      placed in ethanol for subsequent skeletal analyses. RESULTS: B6 mice exposed to
      ethanol in utero had fetal weight deficits and digit, kidney, brain ventricle,
      and vertebral malformations. In contrast, 129 mice showed no teratogenesis. The
      remaining strains showed varying degrees of teratogenesis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Differences among inbred strains demonstrate genetic variation in the teratogenic
      effects of ethanol. Identifying susceptible and resistant strains allows future
      studies to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying prenatal alcohol
      phenotypes.

      partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on 
      synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women
      participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without
      children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and
      non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and 
      earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age.
      Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children
      was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5 h on the
      weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children.
      The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children,
      0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and 
      child. Partners' chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and 
      child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother's
      lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first months of life, and that
      children are a more important social factor than the male partner.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sensorimotor disorder
      where patients complain of an almost irresistible urge to move their legs. This
      urge can often be accompanied by pain or other unpleasant sensations, it either
      occurs or worsens with rest particularly at night, and improves with activity.
      The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group has established four
      essential criteria for clinical diagnosis of RLS. STATE OF ART: Affecting an
      estimated 7.2 to 11.5% of the adult population, the symptoms of RLS may be
      associated with significant sleep disturbance and may have a negative impact on
      quality of life. The prevalence of RLS increases with age, and women are more
      frequently affected than men. In France, the estimated prevalence is 8.5%. Among 
      sufferers, 4.4% complain of very severe symptoms. Although RLS is mainly
      idiopathic, several clinical conditions have been associated with it, especially 
      iron deficiency with or without anemia, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy.
      These conditions may share a common pathophysiological mechanism involving a
      disorder of iron metabolism. By contrast, controversy persists as to whether
      polyneuropathy, particularly when associated with diabetes, is to be considered
      as an important cause of secondary RLS. This association is difficult to
      demonstrate as conventional electromyography is not adequate to detect small
      fiber neuropathy often associated with diabetes. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES: RLS
      is often underdiagnosed and few subjects receive recommended RLS drug treatment. 
      There is a clear need for complementary education to improve the accurate
      diagnosis of RLS. Indeed, better knowledge of this syndrome is a prerequisite to 
      prompt an appropriate therapeutic management.

LID - 10.1063/1.3100546 [doi]
AB  - An approach combining time-continuous nonlinear stability analysis and a
      parametric bispectral method was introduced to better describe cortical
      activation and deactivation patterns in the immature fetal electroencephalogram
      (EEG). Signal models and data-driven investigations were performed to find
      optimal parameters of the nonlinear methods and to confirm the occurrence of
      nonlinear sections in the fetal EEG. The resulting measures were applied to the
      in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation when organized
      sleep states were not developed and compared to previous results at 0.9
      gestation. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already 
      at this early gestational age, suggesting the presence of premature sleep states.
      This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected
      ECoG synchronization effects during premature sleep states associated with
      nonrapid eye movement sleep later in gestation. Thus, the combined nonlinear and 
      time-variant approach was able to provide important insights into the properties 
      of the immature fetal ECoG.

PG  - 106-17
LID - 10.1080/15402000902762394 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality in late pregnancy and
      recurrence of postpartum major depression (PPMD) through 28 weeks postpartum. The
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 36 weeks gestation was assessed in 51
      non-depressed women with a history of PPMD; recurrence was determined by the
      21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Schedule for Affective
      Disorders and Schizophrenia. Sleep quality in late pregnancy was not related to
      recurrence per se, but it was related to timing of recurrence (Kruskal-Wallace = 
      9.78, p = .008). Rapid recurrence (within 4 weeks post delivery) was preceded by 
      fewer sleep complaints (mean PSQI for early recurrers = 4.8 vs. 7.3 for
      non-recurrers, p = .09). Recurrence after 4 weeks postpartum was preceded by more
      sleep complaints in late pregnancy (mean PSQI for late recurrers = 9.9 vs. 7.3
      for non-recurrers, p = .02). Sleep quality in late pregnancy may help in
      identifying women at risk for a PPMD recurrence.

TI  - Prenatal NAP+SAL prevents developmental delay in a mouse model of Down syndrome
      through effects on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid
      receptors.
PG  - 524.e1-4
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2009.01.052 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Down syndrome (DS) affects 1/800 infants. Prenatal NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and 
      SALLRSIPA (SAL) (NAP+SAL) prevent developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, a mouse
      model of DS. We investigated whether this finding involves N-methyl-D-aspartic
      acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant
      Ts65Dn mice were treated with placebo or NAP+SAL on gestational days 8-12. After 
      developmental delay prevention was shown, 4 trisomic (Ts), 4 control, and 3
      Ts+NAP+SAL adult offspring brains (from 3 litters) were collected.
      Calibrator-normalized real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using
      primers for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subunits NR2A and NR2B, and for GABA
      subunits GABA(A)alpha5 and GABA(A)beta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
      dehydrogenase standardization. Statistics included analysis of variance and
      Fisher PLSD with P < .05 as significant. RESULTS: NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3
      levels were decreased in Ts vs control (all P < .05). Prenatal NAP+SAL increased 
      NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 to levels similar to control (all P < .05). A
      significant difference in GABA(A)alpha5 levels was not found. CONCLUSION:
      Prenatal NAP+SAL increases NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 expression in adult DS
      mice to levels similar to controls. This may explain how NAP+SAL improve
      developmental milestone achievement.

TI  - Sleep duration in the United States: a cross-sectional population-based study.
PG  - 1052-63
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwp023 [doi]
AB  - Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk
      factors, depression, automobile and workplace accidents, and prospective
      mortality. Little is known, however, about sleep patterns in the US population.
      The 2004-2007 National Health Interview Survey-Sample Adult Files provide
      nationally representative data for 110,441 noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18
      years or older, and multinomial logistic regression examines whether variables in
      5 domains-demographic, family structure, socioeconomic, health behavior, and
      health status-are associated with long or short sleep duration. Being older,
      non-Hispanic black, or a current or former smoker; having low levels of
      education, income, or few income sources; consuming few or numerous drinks in a
      week; or reporting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, underweight, or 
      activity limitations is associated with increased odds of both long and short
      sleep duration. Other variables are associated with shorter (e.g., living with
      young children, being unmarried, working long hours, more frequent binge
      drinking) or longer (e.g., being younger, Mexican American, pregnant, or having
      low levels of physical activity) sleep hours. The authors identify numerous risk 
      factors for long and short sleep; many of those variables are potential
      confounders of the relation between sleep hours and other health outcomes.

TI  - How disturbed sleep may be a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 273-80
LID - 10.1097/OGX.0b013e318195160e [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with significant maternal and
      infant morbidity are on the rise in Western society despite advances of medical
      technology. Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest
      risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors 
      to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy,
      yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep
      disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular
      disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. 
      Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which
      chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose
      a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of
      pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia,
      intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.
      TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Leaning
      Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to
      outline data linking sleep disturbances with an increased risk of some systemic
      disorders, recall characteristics of pregnancy complications which support the
      hypothesis that sleep disturbances may be related to these pregnancy outcomes,
      and summarize the likelihood and types of sleep disturbances that are common in
      pregnant women.

TI  - The efficacy of Quintero staging system to assess severity of twin-twin
      transfusion syndrome treated with laser therapy: a systematic review with
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 537-44
LID - 10.1055/s-0029-1215430 [doi]
AB  - Severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is classified in five stages
      according to Quintero staging. However, the efficacy of such staging was recently
      debated. We reviewed the efficacy of Quintero staging to predict survival rate in
      TTTS treated with laser therapy. Articles reporting survival rate for each stage 
      in TTTS treated with laser therapy were reviewed. Number of twins alive per
      pregnancy (NAP) was compared between early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV)
      stages and within stages. Meta-analysis was performed according to Meta-analysis 
      Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Heterogeneity was tested
      with chi-square for heterogeneity at a significance level of P < 0.10, and random
      or fixed models were generated as appropriate. A P value < 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. NAP was similar between early (zero survivors: 34/228,
      15%; one survivor: 49/228, 21%; two survivors: 145/228, 63%) and advanced stages 
      (zero survivors: 38/214, 18%; one survivor: 64/214, 30%; two survivors: 112/214, 
      52%; P > 0.05) except for one survivor ( P < 0.05). A trend for increased NAP was
      observed in all stages. Because clinically relevant differences were not
      observed, laser therapy is the optimal treatment for all stages. As Quintero
      staging does not provide information about prognosis, a new staging system is
      proposed.

TI  - Onset of labour: women's experiences and midwives' assessments in relation to
      first stage duration.
PG  - 899-905
LID - 10.1007/s00404-009-0990-7 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The study aimed to assess the time of labour onset and its symptoms as
      perceived by women in labour and midwives, and the relationship between these and
      first stage duration. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study of women with a
      singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation was performed in 41 maternity units.
      The sample comprised 1,170 women, 611 nulliparae (np) and 559 multiparae (mp),
      who answered two standardized questions on the onset of labour and selected the
      applicable symptoms of labour onset from a list of eight. A multivariate Cox
      regression model was computed covering further perinatal factors. RESULTS: The
      median durations of the first stage of labour as assessed by the women themselves
      were 11 (np) and 6.5 h (mp), and as assessed by the midwives 7 (np) and 4 h (mp).
      Median time intervals between the start of labour onset symptoms as perceived by 
      the women concerned and the midwives' diagnoses varied greatly: the shortest
      related to watery fluid loss (np = 1.5 h, mp = 0.0 h), the longest to alterations
      in sleep patterns (np = 11.5 h, mp = 4.5 h). Irregular pain, watery fluid loss
      and the time between self-diagnosed and professionally diagnosed onset of labour 
      were just as closely associated with the duration of the first stage of labour as
      perinatal factors. Significant perinatal factors were induction with oxytocin,
      herbal remedies and PROM. CONCLUSIONS: The perceptions of women in labour are as 
      important as perinatal factors in determining the duration of the first stage of 
      labour and should be taken into account in intrapartum care.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy.
PG  - 158-68
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2009.02.080057 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy is associated with many physiologic and hormonal changes along with
      changes in sleep architecture, placing pregnant women at risk for the development
      of sleep-disordered breathing or worsening of preexisting sleep apnea. Snoring,
      the most common symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is markedly increased
      during pregnancy. The exact prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant
      women is unknown. Because the apneic episodes are commonly associated with
      oxyhemoglobin desaturations, the combination of obstructive sleep apnea and
      pregnancy can be potentially harmful to the fetus given the low oxygen reserves
      during pregnancy. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased
      risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the
      possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In
      this clinical review, we discuss the physiologic changes of pregnancy that
      predispose pregnant women to the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the
      effects of sleep-disordered breathing on pregnancy outcomes. We also review the
      recommendations regarding evaluation for sleep apnea and treatment options during
      pregnancy and postpartum.

TI  - Diabetes is an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese
      patients. A case-control study.
PG  - e4692
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two of the
      main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition, obesity is the
      most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a
      condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown
      whether patients with diabetes have more severe SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. 
      The aim of this cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate whether obese 
      patients with T2DM are more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic
      subjects. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic
      women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and smoking
      status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a university hospital. 
      The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking habit,
      neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and
      pregnancy. Examinations included a non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary
      function testing, and an awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures
      included the percentage of time spent at saturations below 90% (CT90). A high
      prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM:80%, nondiabetic:78.3%). No
      differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events between diabetic and
      non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in diabetic patients, a
      significantly increase in the CT90 was detected (20.2+/-30.2% vs. 6.8+/-13,5%; p 
      = 0.027). In addition, residual volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM
      (percentage of predicted: 79.7+/-18.1 vs. 100.1+/-22.8; p<0.001). Multiple linear
      regression analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with
      CT90. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep,
      becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese
      patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, the
      screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory.

TI  - Older men are having children, but the reality of a male biological clock makes
      this trend worrisome.
PG  - 14-7
AB  - Couples are waiting longer to have children, and advances in reproductive
      technology are allowing older men and women to consider having children. The lack
      of appreciation among both medical professionals and the lay public for the
      reality of a male biological clock makes these trends worrisome. The age-related 
      changes associated with the male biological clock affect sperm quality,
      fertility, hormone levels, libido, erectile function, and a host of
      non-reproductive physiological issues. This article focuses on the potentially
      adverse effects of the male biological clock on fertility in older men. Advanced 
      paternal age increases the risk for spontaneous abortion as well as genetic
      abnormalities in offspring due to multiple factors, including DNA damage from
      abnormal apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. Increased paternal age is also
      associated with a decrease in semen volume, percentage of normal sperm, and sperm
      motility. Older men considering parenthood should have a thorough history and
      physical examination focused on their sexual and reproductive capacity. Such
      examination should entail disclosure of any sexual dysfunction and the use of
      medications, drugs, or lifestyle factors that might impair fertility or sexual
      response. Older men should also be counseled regarding the effects of paternal
      age on spermatogenesis and pregnancy.

TI  - Effects of alcohol and smoking during pregnancy on infant autonomic control.
PG  - 234-42
LID - 10.1002/dev.20366 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol increases the risk for Sudden Infant
      Death Syndrome (SIDS). Physiological changes associated with these exposures are 
      not well studied. Full-term infants were tested within the first 3 days of life. 
      We hypothesized that maternal alcohol consumption and/or smoking during pregnancy
      would alter autonomic nervous system function. Newborns whose mothers smoked
      during pregnancy had lower beat-to-beat heart rate variability in quiet sleep.
      Infants whose mothers consumed alcohol had lower global heart rate variability,
      but only in active sleep. Unexposed infants demonstrated increases in heart rate 
      with head-up tilt and decreases in heart rate with head-down tilt, but smoking
      and alcohol-exposed infants showed no significant responses. These results
      indicate that autonomic function is altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol and
      smoking. Such markers may provide early identification of infants at greatest
      risk for SIDS.

TI  - Elevated estradiol plasma levels in women with restless legs during pregnancy.
PG  - 169-74
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless 
      legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between 
      pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. DESIGN: 
      Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third 
      trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood
      hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone,
      follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin,
      hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and
      RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and
      the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. SETTING: Sleep
      laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for
      RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol.
      INTERVENTIONS: N/A. RESULTS: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol
      during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 +/- 6397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 +/- 7990 
      pg/mL, P<0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before
      and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P<0.05).
      PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P<0.05); sleep efficiency
      increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P<0.05). No
      significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in
      plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron,
      ferritin or hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: RLS in pregnant women goes along with
      transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens 
      play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

TI  - A multistage chronobiologic intervention for the treatment of depression: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 201-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2009.01.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most antidepressant medications in current use have several
      disadvantages: a delayed therapeutic effect, side effects, stigmatization and
      concerns about safety for the developing fetus during pregnancy. Several
      chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as 
      an alternative. The current article reports the design and the initial outcome
      results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised
      of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half
      of the night (wake therapy--WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in
      combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv)
      sleep phase advance (SPA). METHODS: The study was conducted as a set of 12
      single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive volunteering patients.
      Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis
      beginning with a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a set of four consecutive
      morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1-T4),and with a final
      measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5). RESULTS: A
      clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was
      demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the
      intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient
      satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the
      Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature
      of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by
      several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their
      ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement
      along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was 
      some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. 
      This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well
      tolerated. It affords many advantages, such as the achievement of a rapid
      response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up,
      safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results
      warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials.

TI  - Household possession, use and non-use of treated or untreated mosquito nets in
      two ecologically diverse regions of Nigeria--Niger Delta and Sahel Savannah.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-30 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current use of treated mosquito nets for the prevention of malaria
      falls short of what is expected in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), though research
      within the continent has indicated that the use of these commodities can reduce
      malaria morbidity by 50% and malaria mortality by 20%. Governments in sub-Sahara 
      Africa are investing substantially in scaling-up treated mosquito net coverage
      for impact. However, certain significant factors still prevent the use of the
      treated mosquito nets, even among those who possess them. This survey examines
      household ownership as well as use and non-use of treated mosquito nets in Sahel 
      Savannah and Niger Delta regions of Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: This survey employed
      cross-sectional survey to collect data from households on coverage and use of
      mosquito nets, whether treated or not. Fever episodes in previous two weeks among
      children under the age of five were also recorded. The study took place in August
      1 - 14 2007, just five months after the March distribution of treated mosquito
      nets, coinciding with the second raining period of the year and a time of high
      malaria transmission during the wet season. EPI INFO version 2003 was used in
      data analysis. RESULTS: The survey covered 439 households with 2,521 persons
      including 739 under-fives, 585 women in reproductive age and 78 pregnant women in
      Niger Delta Region and Sahel Savannah Region. Of the 439 HHs, 232 had any
      mosquito nets. Significantly higher proportion of households in the Niger Delta
      Region had any treated or untreated mosquito nets than those in the Sahel
      Savannah Region. In the Niger Delta Region, the proportion of under-fives that
      had slept under treated nets the night before the survey exceeded those that
      slept under treated nets in the Sahel Savannah Region. Children under the age of 
      five years in the Niger Delta Region were four times more likely to sleep under
      treated nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region. CONCLUSION: This study
      found that despite the fact that treated nets were distributed widely across
      Nigeria, the use of this commodity was still very low in the Sahel Savannah
      region. Future campaigns should include more purposeful social and health
      education on the importance and advantages of the use of treated nets to save
      lives in the Sahel Savannah region of Nigeria.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnoea and its association with gestational hypertension.
PG  - 559-65
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00122607 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension develops in 10% of pregnancies. Snoring, a marker of obstructive
      sleep apnoea, is a newly identified risk factor for gestational hypertension.
      Moreover, obstructive sleep apnoea is an independent risk factor for incident
      hypertension in the non-pregnant population. The aim of the present study was to 
      test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with new onset of
      hypertension among pregnant females. A case-control study was performed involving
      17 pregnant females with gestational hypertension and 33 pregnant females without
      hypertension. Subjects were frequency-matched for gestational age and recruited
      in a tertiary obstetrical centre. Obstructive sleep apnoea was ascertained by
      polysomnography and defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) of >or=15 events x
      h(-1), without requirement for desaturation. The mean+/-sd AHI for normotensive
      pregnant females was 18.2+/-12.2 events x h(-1) compared with 38.6+/-36.7 events 
      x h(-1) for females with hypertensive pregnancies. The crude odds ratio for the
      presence of obstructive sleep apnoea given the presence of gestational
      hypertension was 5.6. The odds ratio was 7.5 (95% confidence interval 3.5-16.2), 
      based on a logistic regression model with adjustment for maternal age,
      gestational age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, prior pregnancies, and previous
      live births. In conclusion, gestational hypertension appears to be strongly
      associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea.

TI  - Potential determinants of obesity among children and adolescents in Germany:
      results from the cross-sectional KiGGS Study.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-9-46 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health
      problem. The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of
      obesity and risk groups among 3- to 17-year old children and adolescents to
      provide a basis for effective prevention strategies. METHODS: Data were collected
      in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and
      Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on
      health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body
      height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified
      according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450
      non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association
      between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for
      this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple
      logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also
      calculated. RESULTS: The strongest association with obesity was observed for
      parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with
      both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking
      during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal
      weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes
      of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages,
      as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with
      overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated
      with obesity among 3- to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more
      often among children and adolescents with low SES. CONCLUSION: Parental
      overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families
      with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention.

TI  - Depression during pregnancy: rates, risks and consequences--Motherisk Update
      2008.
PG  - e15-22
AB  - Affective illness is common in women, and the puerperium is a time of particular 
      vulnerability. Gender differences in the expression of affective disorders have
      been attributed to the impact of hormonal influence, socialization, and genetics.
      Dramatic fluctuations in gonadal hormones that occur following childbirth,
      influences the increased incidence of mood disorders during this time. Numerous
      tools including the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale can be used to screen
      for depression during pregnancy and postpartum. While screening tools may assist 
      with appropriately identifying women who should be further assessed, their use
      alone does not significantly increase treatment seeking in women, even when their
      providers are notified about risk. Many studies demonstrate that only a small
      number (18%) of women who meet criteria for major depressive disorder seek
      treatment during pregnancy and postpartum. Additionally, common symptoms of
      depression (sleep, energy and appetite change) may be misinterpreted as normative
      experiences of pregnancy.Treatment engagement is important as untreated
      depression during pregnancy may have unfavorable outcomes for both women and
      children. Complications of pregnancy associated with depression include:
      inadequate weight gain,under utilization of prenatal care, increased substance
      use, and premature birth. Human studies demonstrate that perceived life-event
      stress, as well as depression and anxiety predicted lower birth weight, decreased
      Apgar scores, and smaller head circumference, and small for gestational age
      babies. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common clinical disorder occurring in
      15% of deliveries,making it one of the most frequent conditions to complicate
      pregnancy. Risk factors include past personal or family history of depression,
      sing marital status, poor health functioning, lower SES, and alcohol use. Women
      who have a prior history of postpartum depression, particularly with features of 
      bipolarity or psychosis may be at particularly high risk.

TI  - Postnatal parental education for optimizing infant general health and
      parent-infant relationships.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period and it is
      important to examine interventions being used to educate new parents about caring
      for themselves and their newborns during this time. OBJECTIVES: To assess the
      effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an
      individual or group on maternal/paternal and infant outcomes and health services,
      and whether the effects of structured postnatal education vary by length or type 
      of intervention and by population. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane
      Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2007), MEDLINE (1950
      to September 2007), CINAHL (1982 to September 2007), ERIC (1966 to September
      2007), HealthSTAR (1966 to September 2007), PsycINFO (1806 to September 2007),
      Sociological Abstracts (1974 to September 2007), ClinicalTrials.gov (August
      2007), Current Controlled Trials (August 2007), Trialscentral.org (August 2007)
      and The National Research Register (August 2007). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included
      randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided by an
      educator to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months
      post birth related to the care of an infant or of the family. We excluded studies
      of educational interventions for parents of infants in neonatal intensive care
      units. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors assessed trial quality and
      extracted data from published reports. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 trials (2934 
      women) and excluded 24. Of the 14 included studies, education tested included:
      four on infant sleep enhancement, four on infant behaviour, two on general
      post-birth health, three on infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills
      with infants. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment,
      blinding of outcome assessors, and/or participant accrual/loss were often not
      reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only five were measured similarly enough by
      more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses and these included the same
      two studies. Of these five meta-analyses, only one was found to have a low enough
      level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect; education on
      sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of sleep in 24
      hours (95% confidence interval 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of educational programs to participants and their
      newborn infants remain unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to
      increase infant sleep although more and larger studies are needed to confirm
      this.

TI  - Assessing sleep during pregnancy: a study across two time points examining the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and associations with depressive symptoms.
PG  - 45-51
LID - 10.1016/j.whi.2008.10.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive
      symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep
      quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores
      across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. METHODS: Each of the 252
      participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep
      quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. RESULTS: PSQI total scores showed good
      internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal
      structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep
      Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep
      Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors.
      Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance
      scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted
      increases in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the PSQI is 
      useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems 
      are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during
      pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early
      pregnancy.

TI  - Nonlinear properties of vagal and sympathetic modulations of heart rate
      variability in ovine fetus near term.
PG  - R702-7
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.90474.2008 [doi]
AB  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is commonly used although clinical studies
      questioned its diagnostic value. Sophisticated FHR variability (fHRV) measures
      such as fHRV complexity may improve the sensitivity and specificity of FHR
      monitoring. A more detailed understanding of the physiology underlying fHRV
      complexity is essential to harness its use for monitoring fetal health. To
      examine the specific effects of vagal and sympathetic modulations on fHRV
      complexity, we blocked vagal activity with atropine and sympathetic activity with
      propranolol in near-term fetal sheep (n = 7, 0.85 gestation). Under these
      conditions, we analyzed the linear and nonlinear parts of fHRV complexity from
      autonomic information flow. Overall fHRV complexity decreased with both drugs
      compared with nonrapid eye movement sleep baseline (P < 0.05). With atropine,
      this was because of a decrease of the linear part of fHRV complexity on the
      long-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that vagal modulation of fHRV is
      adequately described by linear fHRV measures. With propranolol, the nonlinear
      part of fHRV complexity decreased on the short-term time scale (P < 0.05),
      suggesting that sympathetic influences on fHRV can be detected by the nonlinear
      part of fHRV complexity. Thus the complex interplay of vagal and sympathetic
      modulations of fHRV is reflected differently and specifically in the linear and
      nonlinear properties of fHRV complexity, and on different time scales. Analysis
      of linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV may improve sensitivity and
      specificity of FHR monitoring.

TI  - [Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in women: a specific entity?].
PG  - 1279-88
AB  - Despite a variable prevalence in the literature, OSAS is characterized by a
      higher frequency in men. This study involved a review of published data
      describing the impact of gender on features of OSAS. In women, OSAS seems to be
      associated with certain anatomical factors such as more significant obesity, a
      thinner oropharyngeal junction, a shorter uvula and reduced upper airway (UA)
      collapsibility, in comparison with men. Sleep related breathing disorders
      observed during pregnancy are more likely UA resistance syndrome than true OSAS, 
      and are associated with severe fetal and maternal complications that could be
      improved by the use of nasal CPAP. Though OSAS symptoms are underestimated by
      women, the Epworth score as well as snoring are not influenced by gender. Gender 
      does not seem to be a risk factor for increased mortality. Compliance with nasal 
      CPAP is identical in both sexes, but oral appliance seem to be more effective in 
      women. Further studies are needed to produce the required complementary data to
      confirm specific sex-related features in the diagnosis and treatment of OSAS.

TI  - Progesterone, but not estradiol, synchronizes circadian oscillator in the uterus 
      endometrial stromal cells.
PG  - 31-8
LID - 10.1007/s11010-008-9981-4 [doi]
AB  - The circadian oscillator is generated within the suprachiasmatic nuclei and
      synchronizes circadian clocks in numerous peripheral tissues. The molecular basis
      is composed of a number of genes and proteins that form transcriptional and
      translational feedback loops. Such molecular oscillators are also operative in
      peripheral tissues, including in the uterus. Although ovarian steroids regulate
      the function of uterine endometrial stromal cells, the modulation of ovarian
      steroids on the circadian rhythms remains unknown. Here we investigate the
      possibility that estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) modulate the circadian
      oscillator of the stromal cells. The study using transgenic rats constructed with
      Period 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase (Per2-dLuc) gene, with the
      real-time monitoring system of Per2-dLuc oscillation. The stromal cells displayed
      constant Per2-dLuc oscillation after treatment with dexamethasone, suggesting
      that the circadian oscillator is operative. However, the circadian oscillator was
      disrupted by in vivo administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
      following equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), although it was altered into a
      rhythmic pattern 4 days later following hCG. Chronic treatment with P4 induced
      constant Per2-dLuc oscillation in the stromal cells from eCG-treated immature and
      pregnant rats, whereas E2 did not promote such a rhythmic Per2-dLuc oscillation. 
      Collectively, P4 synchronizes the circadian oscillator of the uterus endometrial 
      stromal cells through transcriptional and translational feedback loops of the
      clockwork system.

TI  - The influence of in utero exposure to smoking on sleep patterns in preterm
      neonates.
PG  - 1683-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain
      regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact
      with the neurophysiological development of neonates. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The
      present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep
      patterns in the preterm neonate. DESIGN: Overnight sleep patterns were
      polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure
      were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, 
      quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and 
      duration of body movements were also analyzed. SETTING: The neonatal intensive
      care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France). PARTICIPANTS: Healthy
      preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 +/- 6.0 weeks) were enrolled
      according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy
      (control group, n=19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, Slow,
      n=10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, Sheavy n=10) than 10 cigarettes per
      day throughout pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Neonates born to
      heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls
      (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less
      overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet
      sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls,
      neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result,
      more disturbed sleep. CONCLUSIONS: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep 
      patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing
      nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions 
      of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on
      the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

      > 70 kg/m2), uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and required a
      repeat cesarean delivery. The patient was admitted to the hospital several times 
      throughout her pregnancy for congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and
      headaches. Two years previously the patient received a diagnosis of peripartum
      cardiomyopathy 3 weeks after the delivery of her second child. This case report
      illustrates the recognition of peripartum cardiomyopathy and the risks early in
      pregnancy. It also describes the appropriate medical management, including
      transesophageal echocardiography and the need for collaboration of multiple
      medical specialists before and during delivery to provide the best possible
      outcome for both mother and infant.

TI  - Comorbidities in polycystic ovary syndrome: their relationship to insulin
      resistance.
PG  - 295-304
AB  - The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of child-bearing age,
      and the diagnosis carries with it associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk
      factors that are likely linked to insulin resistance. Consequently, women
      affected by PCOS are at significant risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Aggressive screening for
      glucose intolerance and cardiovascular risk factors should be performed in all
      PCOS patients, and, when indicated by symptomatology, affected women should be
      screened for sleep apnea. Long-term goals of therapy should focus on prevention
      of these comorbidities.

TI  - Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein-derived peptide, NAP, preventing
      alcohol-induced apoptosis in fetal brain of C57BL/6 mouse.
PG  - 1426-35
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.11.021 [doi]
AB  - Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been
      investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in
      neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. I focused in this study on
      investigating the neuroprotective effects of one of these peptides with regard to
      the determination of the downstream signaling pathways involved in
      neuroprotection. This peptide with the sequence NAPVSIPQ, known as NAP, a
      fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, demonstrated a potent
      protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On
      embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched C57BL/6 pregnant females were assigned the
      following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v)
      ethano-derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, 
      (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections of d-NAP (ALC/d-NAP, 
      20 or 30 microg/20 g body weight), (5) PF/d-NAP control group. On E13, fetal
      brains were collected and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
      staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c detection. My
      results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of
      the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration
      significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in
      primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of
      downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this
      peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of
      caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP
      significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic 
      cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial
      cytochrome c. These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target,
      and the downstream mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential
      therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages.

TI  - [Self-care deficiencies in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus: a
      contribution to nursing].
PG  - 374-81
AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus can be controlled and its complications prevented, 
      provided clients take part in self-care actions. The objective of the present
      study was to identify self care deficiencies in pregnant women suffering from
      diabetes, and to provide inputs for their educational support. This descriptive
      study included 12 pregnant women cared at a diabetes and hypertension reference
      institution in Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil, in April and May, 2007. Data were
      collected using a semistructured interview. Analysis was based on Orem's Nursing 
      General Theory. Self-care deficiencies were related to eating habits, physical
      activities, sleep and rest, and social interaction. Nurses must provide
      educational support to these patients, evaluate their self-care capacity, and
      propose actions that involve the family, as well as group activities in health
      services.

TI  - Association of prematurity, lung disease and body size with lung volume and
      ventilation inhomogeneity in unsedated neonates: a multicentre study.
PG  - 240-5
LID - 10.1136/thx.2008.101758 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that preterm birth with or without
      subsequent chronic lung disease is associated with reduced functional residual
      capacity (FRC) and increased ventilation inhomogeneity in the neonatal period. We
      aimed to establish whether such findings are associated with the degree of
      prematurity, neonatal respiratory illness and disproportionate somatic growth.
      METHODS: Multiple breath washout measurements using an ultrasonic flowmeter were 
      obtained from 219 infants on 306 test occasions during the first few months of
      life, at three neonatal units in the UK and Australia. Tests were performed
      during unsedated sleep in clinically stable infants (assigned to four exclusive
      diagnostic categories: term controls, preterm controls, respiratory distress
      syndrome and chronic lung disease). The determinants of neonatal lung function
      were assessed using multivariable, multilevel modelling. RESULTS: After
      adjustment for age and body proportions, the factors gestation, intrauterine
      growth restriction and days of supplemental oxygen were all significantly
      associated with a reduced FRC. In contrast, increased ventilation inhomogeneity
      (elevated lung clearance index) was only significantly associated with duration
      of supplemental oxygen. After adjusting for continuous variables, diagnostic
      category made no further contribution to the models. Despite using identical
      techniques, unexpected inter-centre differences occurred, associated with the
      equipment used; these did not alter the negative association of preterm delivery 
      and disease severity with lung function outcomes. CONCLUSION: Reduction in FRC is
      independently associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction and
      severity of neonatal lung disease. Determinants of lung function shortly after
      birth are highly complex in different disease groups.

LID - 10.1080/00981380802173509 [doi]
AB  - Empirical and clinical literature suggests a temporal thread running through
      family narratives of hereditary disease, linking past experiences to current
      beliefs about risk. This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing
      hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer
      and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family
      development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration
      completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts
      were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key
      themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct
      priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have
      children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to
      have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at
      finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer
      world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further,
      participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve
      desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer
      diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery. Clinical practice and research
      implications are discussed.

      during low and high malaria transmission seasons.
PG  - 1204-10
LID - 10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.10.018 [doi]
AB  - Sleeping arrangements under long-lasting impregnated nets (LLIN) were recorded in
      2467 households during the low malaria transmission season (May-June 2007) and
      the same families were followed up during the high malaria transmission season
      (December 2007-January 2008) in two malaria-endemic areas of Sri Lanka.
      Approximately 800 households each from the three main ethnic groups were studied.
      The number of families lost to follow-up was 68. A significant increase was seen 
      in the proportion of households using LLINs the previous night during the high
      transmission season (96%) compared with the low transmission season (90%) (P< or 
      =0.001 for all three ethnic groups). When sleeping arrangements of the entire
      population were considered, priority to sleep under the LLIN was given to
      children under 5 years during both seasons. The percentage of children under five
      who slept under a LLIN increased from 75% during the low transmission season to
      90% during the high transmission season. Utilisation of LLINs by pregnant women
      was low; only approximately 45% of pregnant women reported sleeping under a LLIN 
      during both seasons. The study suggests the possible need for re-focusing of
      health education messages regarding the importance of LLIN use among pregnant
      women.

PG  - 766-73
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.90575.2008 [doi]
AB  - Very low-birth-weight premature infants often suffer from a variety of
      respiratory problems, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), hypopnea and
      periodic breathing, and apnea. These conditions are likely related to immaturity 
      of the respiratory centers; yet how respiratory rhythms originating from these
      centers, including their complexity, relate to demographic measures of
      prematurity remains largely unknown. In 39 neonates with mild RDS (22 males, 28
      +/- 2 wk gestational age, 1,036 +/- 234 g body wt), we derived the univariate
      association between complexity of two respiratory rhythms [respiratory rate (RR) 
      and tidal volume (Vt)] and postmenstrual age, gestational age, postnatal age, and
      weight at time of study. RR and Vt rhythm complexities were assessed using
      approximate entropy, sample entropy, base scale entropy, and forbidden words
      entropy estimated for 300 consecutive breaths determined from respiratory
      inductance plethysmography, irrespective of breathing effort rate or amplitude,
      collected during sleep while the neonates were exposed to nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (4-6 cmH(2)O). RR and Vt exhibited increased complexity 
      with increased maturity, but only in terms of base scale entropy and forbidden
      words entropy, which are based on pattern matching, rather than approximate
      entropy and sample entropy, which are based on conditional probabilities.
      Specifically, RR complexity as measured by forbidden word entropy increased with 
      increasing weight (r = 0.502), postconceptional age (r = 0.423), and gestational 
      age (r = 0.493). As measured by base scale entropy, RR complexity increased with 
      increasing weight (r = 0.488) and postconceptional age (r = 0.390). Vt
      complexity, measured by base scale entropy, was greater with increased postnatal 
      age (r = 0.428). Our results indicate that respiratory rhythms become more
      complex with increasing levels of maturity, as indicated by increased weight and 
      several age parameters. This emphasizes the importance of the later weeks of
      gestation in the maturation of respiratory centers in the brain and suggests a
      promising use of entropy measures in exploring respiratory maturation in infants.

TI  - Fatigue: an overview.
PG  - 1173-9
AB  - Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work
      performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of
      fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and
      treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical
      conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should 
      focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia,
      pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory
      studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results
      are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of 
      fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that
      consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and
      modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps
      are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such
      as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with
      depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior
      therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent
      appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management.

TI  - Exploring the relationship of second-trimester corticotropin releasing hormone,
      chronic stress and preterm delivery.
PG  - 788-95
LID - 10.1080/14767050802379031 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the impact of chronic stress on the relationship between
      second-trimester serum corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) concentrations and
      preterm delivery (PTD) in working women. METHODS: Birth records from mothers of
      364 PTD and 730 controls in Southern California were linked to stored
      mid-pregnancy maternal serum analysed for CRH. Association of CRH with stressors 
      reported in post-partum interviews was examined in cases and controls separately.
      Stratified multivariable logistic regression analyses examined moderating
      influence of seven chronic stressors on CRH in predicting PTD. RESULTS: Mean log 
      CRH was lower among women with chronic stressors. Chronic stressors were not
      related to an increased risk of PTD, but did strengthen the association of CRH
      with PTD. Adjusted for confounders, the odds of PTD were 1.5-times higher per
      unit increase in log CRH in the overall study population, but were two-to-three
      times higher in subjects who reported unfulfilling jobs, little sleep or strong
      anger in the second trimester. CONCLUSION: The relation of CRH with PTD is
      moderated by exposure to chronic stressors during pregnancy.

TI  - Effects of mutual health organizations on use of priority health-care services in
      urban and rural Mali: a case-control study.
PG  - 830-8
LID - S0042-96862008001100012 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a community-based mutual health organization
      (MHO) on utilization of priority health services, financial protection of its
      members and inclusion of the poor and other target groups. METHODS: Four MHOs
      were established in two districts in Mali. A case-control study was carried out
      in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787
      non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas
      without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period.
      Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures
      and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household 
      and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as
      determined through a household survey in 2004. FINDINGS: MHO members who were up 
      to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest
      health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for 
      fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with
      diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at
      home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal visits; and twice as likely, 
      if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P
      < 0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative
      predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries.
      Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated
      with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOs 
      seemed to provide some financial protection for their members. CONCLUSIONS: MHOs 
      are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use
      to increase financial access to - and equity in - priority health services.

AB  - Dopa-responsive dystonia, also known as hereditary progressive dystonia with
      diurnal fluctuation or Segawa's syndrome, is a rare hereditary progressive
      dystonia with two striking clinical features: a marked diurnal fluctuation of
      symptoms with symptoms worsening throughout the day and improving after sleep,
      and a dramatic response to levodopa therapy. Whilst rare, it is treatable, with
      function being normal or near normal after levodopa therapy. We present our
      experience of providing anaesthesia for caesarean section in a patient with
      dopa-responsive dystonia and discuss the safety of levodopa therapy during
      pregnancy and the anaesthetic management of these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue
      at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. DESIGN:
      Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. SETTING: Recruitment from 2 hospital
      postpartum units. Data collected in parents' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Eight
      primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation.
      METHODS: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy
      and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue,
      and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables.
      RESULTS: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour 
      sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after
      twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a
      linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not
      significantly different between parents and remained constant over time.
      CONCLUSION: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins
      experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is
      needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors
      that influence sleep in parents of twins.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe sleep characteristics in high-risk antepartum inpatients. 
      DESIGN: Prospective descriptive design. SETTING: Tertiary hospital in southern
      California. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 39 antepartum women. METHODS:
      Data were collected from participants' medical records, questionnaires (General
      Sleep Disturbance Scale), actigraphy on days 3 to 4 after admission, and a sleep 
      diary that included reasons for awakening and morning and evening fatigue
      ratings. RESULTS: Week gestation ranged from 24 to 35 weeks. Sleep time varied
      from 310 to 492 minutes and averaged 6.7 hours/night. The women were awakened 9
      to 32 times/night and averaged 18 awakenings. They napped an average of 124
      minutes throughout the day. Women averaged 3.9 on the General Sleep Disturbance
      Scale when retrospectively considering 7 days before hospitalization and scored
      4.1 when considering the current 3 days of hospitalization. In the diary, most
      rated their sleep quality as Fairly Good or Very Good (62%-71%), but 29% said
      Very Bad on night 2, and 38% said Very Bad on night 3. CONCLUSION: Frequent
      interruptions during the night do not allow for mothers to receive the
      restorative sleep they need.

AB  - Post-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with diminished lung growth
      during school age. The current authors aimed to determine whether pre-natal
      exposure to air pollution is associated with lung function changes in the
      newborn. In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal
      breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) 
      were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to
      particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm (PM(10)), nitrogen
      dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)), and distance to major roads were estimated
      during pregnancy. The association between these exposures and lung function was
      assessed using linear regression. Minute ventilation was higher in infants with
      higher pre-natal PM(10) exposure (24.9 mL x min(-1) per microg x m(-3) PM(10)).
      The eNO was increased in infants with higher pre-natal NO(2) exposure (0.98 ppb
      per microg x m(-3) NO(2)). Post-natal exposure to air pollution did not modify
      these findings. No association was found for pre-natal exposure to O(3) and lung 
      function parameters. The present results suggest that pre-natal exposure to air
      pollution might be associated with higher respiratory need and airway
      inflammation in newborns. Such alterations during early lung development may be
      important regarding long-term respiratory morbidity.

      birthweight outcomes.
PG  - 10-6
LID - 10.1016/j.infbeh.2008.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed
      women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late
      pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety,
      anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both
      prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater
      incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the
      depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity
      and low birthweight among black women.

      rats at different stages of pregnancy: behavioral study].
PG  - 611-9
AB  - In Wistar rats, pregnant or not pregnant, sleep-wakefulness parameters were
      registered for 2 days from 10:00 till 14:00. Later, these rats were subjected to 
      3-hour (11:00-14:00) daily sleep deprivation (SD) during 3 consecutive days. To
      prevent sleep, the following manipulations were used: acoustic stimulation from
      moving of the food pellets, opening or horizontal rotation of the cage and gentle
      handling. Control pregnant or not pregnant rats were placed in individual cages
      in the same room, but their sleep was not disturbed. On average, not pregnant
      rats spent about 65% of the time in sleep. Sleep episodes were mostly short (less
      than 1 min) or medium (1-15 min). After the beginning and with advance of
      pregnancy, the amount, deepness and duration of sleep episodes increased. With
      the methods of SD used, not pregnant rats did not sleep almost at all during the 
      SD session. In pregnant rats, the quantity and intensity of stimuli used for SD
      increased as compared to control, which was indicatives of the growth of "sleep
      pressure" during pregnancy.

TI  - Supplementation of a low dose of DHA or DHA+AA does not prevent peripartum
      depressive symptoms in a small population based sample.
PG  - 49-52
LID - 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.10.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The decrease of maternal docosahexaenoic (DHA) status during
      pregnancy has been associated with postpartum depression, especially in women
      with a low intake of DHA. Since the DHA intake in the Netherlands is low, we
      investigated whether supplementation of low doses of DHA or DHA plus arachidonic 
      acid (AA) during pregnancy and lactation could prevent depressive symptoms and
      sleep disturbances in this period. METHODS: Women were supplemented daily with
      placebo, DHA (220 mg) or DHA+AA (220 mg each) from week 16 of pregnancy till
      three months postpartum. Fatty acid analyses were performed in the available
      plasma samples at 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were measured
      in weeks 16 and 36 of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum using EPDS and within
      one week postpartum using a blues questionnaire. RESULTS: 119 women completed the
      study. The average frequency of fish intake was low, 0.94 times per week, and did
      not differ between the groups. The supplementation groups did not differ in mean 
      EPDS scores or changes in EPDS scores, nor in incidence or severity of postpartum
      blues. Red blood cell DHA, AA and DHA/AA ratio did not correlate with EPDS or
      blues scores. Indices of sleep quality did not differ between the groups.
      CONCLUSION: Supplementation of 220 mg/day DHA or DHA+AA (220 mg/day each) does
      not prevent peri-partum depressive symptoms, in a population based sample with
      low background DHA intake. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Register nr.

TI  - No effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on activity in three inbred strains of
      mice.
PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.1093/alcalc/agn082 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing
      fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are
      attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in
      rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects
      in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure 
      on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep
      (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). METHODS: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation,
      mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E)
      or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC)
      litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and
      150 days of age. RESULTS: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol
      exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline
      activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all
      activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy
      than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex
      effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many
      phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal
      ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in
      mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing
      behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2
      weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive
      for producing behavioral effects.

TI  - Cardiovascular stress hyperreactivity in babies of smokers and in babies born
      preterm.
PG  - 1848-53
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.783902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Being born preterm, small, and to a mother who smokes are common
      perinatal complications with major public health implications. Evidence suggests 
      that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase
      susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2
      routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient "silent" programming of
      cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born
      babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day),
      and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same
      age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood
      pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO(2) for 4 minutes or to 
      passive head-up tilt to 60 degrees . BP was measured continuously from a wrist
      cuff. CO(2) exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt
      increased their BP by 5%. CO(2) elicited the expected BP but no heart rate
      response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate 
      response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP 
      from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular, cardiac, and
      blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The
      findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal "programming" of human 
      cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction
      may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or
      complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances
      in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with
      major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women.
      METHOD: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15
      healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy 
      comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum.
      Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim
      light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin
      levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following
      measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak
      concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of
      covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding
      status, and body mass index as covariates. RESULTS: Morning melatonin levels from
      2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major
      depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were
      significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time
      intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women
      with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current
      diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset
      times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant
      healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels
      increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among
      postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours,
      were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women
      relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing
      measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of
      depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the
      melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression.

PG  - 271-8
LID - 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60492-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence of asthma in developed countries increased between the
      1970s and the 1990s. One factor that might contribute to the trends in asthma is 
      the increased use of acetaminophen vs aspirin in children and pregnant women.
      OBJECTIVE: To examine relationships between in utero exposure to acetaminophen
      and incidence of respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. METHODS: A total
      of 345 women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy and followed up
      with their children through the first year of life. Use of acetaminophen in
      pregnancy was determined by questionnaire and related to incidence of respiratory
      symptoms. RESULTS: Use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy
      was significantly related to wheezing (odd ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval,
      1.1-3.0) and to wheezing that disturbed sleep (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.1-3.8) in the first year of life after control for potential
      confounders. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that use of acetaminophen in middle 
      to late but not early pregnancy may be related to respiratory symptoms in the
      first year of life. Additional follow-up will examine relationships of maternal
      and early childhood use of acetaminophen with incidence of asthma at ages 3 to 5 
      years, when asthma diagnosis is more firmly established.

TI  - Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus in newborn infants of opioid dependent mothers.
PG  - 69-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.01010.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and risk 
      factors for benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) in infants with neonatal
      abstinence syndrome (NAS) treated with opioids or sedatives, compared with
      control infants. METHODS: This is a single centre observational case control
      study. Seventy-eight near term and term infants with neonatal opiate abstinence
      syndrome confirmed by meconium analysis were included. Exclusion criteria were
      cerebral malformation, intracranial haemorrhage and perinatal asphyxia. The
      babies were assessed eight hourly with a modified Finnegan score that included
      sleep myoclonus. Seventy-eight infants not exposed to opiates during pregnancy,
      hospitalized for at least 14 days and matched for gestational age were used as
      controls. RESULTS: The median gestational age was 38 (1)/(7) (95% CI: 35
      (3)/(7)-41 (2)/(7)) weeks, birth weight 2730 (95% CI: 1890-3600) g, umbilical
      artery pH 7.25 (CI 7.10-7.37) and Apgar score at 5 minutes 9 (95% CI: 7-10). The 
      control infants did not differ in these characteristics. Sleep myoclonus was
      diagnosed in 52 (67%) of the infants with NAS and 2 (2.6%) of the controls (OR 26
      [95% CI: 7-223], p < 0.001). Myoclonus appeared as early as day 2 and as late as 
      day 56 of life (median day 6) and lasted for 1 to 93 days (median 13 days). All
      infants had serum glucose > 2.5 mmol/L at first occurrence. The neurological
      examinations as well as cerebral ultrasound scans were normal. An
      electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in 18 infants showed no signs of epileptic
      activity. CONCLUSION: BNSM has a high incidence in infants with NAS. The
      diagnosis can be made clinically. In the absence of other neurological symptoms
      further investigations such as EEG are not necessary and anticonvulsive treatment
      is not indicated.

TI  - Economic antecedents of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers.
PG  - 678-81
LID - 10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.07.001 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Black infants die from sudden infant death syndrome at twice the
      incidence observed among non-Hispanic white infants. Explanations for this
      disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant
      sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the
      contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the
      risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers. METHODS: I retrieved
      data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black
      mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment
      Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for
      individual characteristics and state and time trends. RESULTS: Black mothers
      exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following
      statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline =
      1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for
      individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and 
      prone placement among white mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Statewide economic decline may 
      reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, 
      but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should
      determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep
      placement.

AB  - Choline supplementation of the maternal diet has long-term facilitative effects
      on spatial and temporal memory processes in the offspring. To further delineate
      the impact of early nutritional status on brain and behavior, we examined effects
      of prenatal-choline availability on hippocampal oscillatory frequency bands in 12
      month-old male and female rats. Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were
      given a deficient level of choline (DEF=0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON=1.1
      g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP=3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days 
      (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the
      hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode 
      patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions
      revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave 
      sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline
      status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of
      gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle.
      These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal
      oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across
      multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the
      hippocampus.

TI  - Epidemiologic associations of carpal tunnel syndrome and sleep position: Is there
      a case for causation?
PG  - 127-34
LID - 10.1007/s11552-007-9035-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is thought to be due to compression of
      the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It is known that carpal tunnel pressures
      are elevated in wrist postures of flexion and extension and in those patients
      with CTS. Classic symptoms of CTS include night waking with pain, tingling, and
      numbness. These classic symptoms stimulated our interest in the relationship of
      sleep to the development of CTS. METHOD: We reviewed the literature surrounding
      the epidemiology of CTS and the literature regarding sleep disturbances. Through 
      careful distillation of these studies and a process of reasoning, we have
      developed a hypothesis for a causal mechanism of CTS. RESULTS: Epidemiologically,
      it has been shown that CTS is associated with age, gender, increased body mass
      index (BMI), diabetes, pregnancy, and is more common in some populations. The
      same associations noted above for CTS are strongly associated with sleep
      disturbances. Sleep disturbances due to age, gender, BMI, pregnancy, and
      population variations are all associated with sleeping in the lateral position
      supporting the hypothesis that a common causative mechanism of CTS is sleeping in
      a lateral position. DISCUSSION: We believe that the epidemiologic associations
      with CTS act through a common causative mechanism, increased sleeping in the
      lateral position which puts the wrist at increased risk of flexion or extension, 
      compressing the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. This hypothesis is simple and 
      explains the connection between a previously unconnected group of epidemiologic
      associations. This realization has real clinical significance in that it focuses 
      our attention on the early disorder when it is completely reversible. It
      clarifies previously confused clinical circumstances, creates research questions 
      that can be tested, and it invites us to change our clinical perspective in this 
      most common form of nerve compression.

TI  - Infant sleep position in Oklahoma: evidence from PRAMS.
PG  - 182-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The supine (back) sleep position has been found to be an important
      factor in the reduction of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This paper will
      examine infant sleep position in Oklahoma and offer recommendations to increase
      safe sleep practices for Oklahoma infants. METHODS: Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk
      Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were used to estimate prevalence of
      sleep position among demographic maternal groups and related health behaviors.
      Chi-square tests were used to determine significance at p< 0.05. Logistic
      regression modeling was used to produce adjusted odds ratios to measure the
      association of selected independent variables and sleep position. RESULTS:
      Fifty-six percent of Oklahoma newborns were placed on their backs to sleep most
      of the time, far short of the Healthy People 2010 goal of 70%. Almost 1 in 5
      infants were placed on their stomachs to sleep, a known risk factor for SIDS.
      Women between 100-184% of the federal poverty level, African American women and
      mothers with more than one child were those least likely to place their infants
      on their backs to sleep. CONCLUSION: Overall, the issue of not utilizing the
      recommended safe sleep position, the supine position, is pervasive among all
      maternal groups in Oklahoma. Significant differences were present for only a few 
      variables (race, income, parity) indicating a strong need for a consistent
      message on sleep position for all Oklahoma parents and grandparents.

TI  - Shift work and its effects on the cardiovascular system.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - The practice of shift-work scheduling has long been part of normal work duties in
      emergency services such as health and security. It is only recently, in the wake 
      of growing job opportunities and booming industries, where more employees are
      needed to keep services running over 24-hour periods that studies on the effects 
      of shift work on workers' health have begun to delve deeper. The
      desynchronisation that occurs in circadian rhythms, with respect to sleep cycles,
      predisposes employees to coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal disturbances,
      increased risk of breast cancer and poor pregnancy outcomes. This literature
      review focuses on circadian rhythms, their molecular components, disturbances of 
      these rhythms as a result of shift work and the adverse effects thereof on the
      cardiovascular system.

PG  - 35-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2008.07.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is more
      common in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disease and fetal growth
      restriction. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study comparing pregnant women with
      these two complications with normal pregnant women and non-pregnant women in two 
      UK maternity hospitals. Each participant completed a sleep apnoea questionnaire
      and underwent nocturnal oxygen saturation monitoring. RESULTS: Using a strict
      definition of obstructive sleep apnoea confirmed by oxygen saturation monitoring 
      only two mild cases were seen, 0/50 non-pregnant women, 1/69 of normal pregnant
      women, 0/48 women with various types of hypertensive disease, and 1/33 women
      carrying fetuses affected with fetal growth restriction. Even using less strict
      definitions and self-reported sleepiness scores there was no relation between
      sleep apnoea and either fetal growth restriction or hypertensive diseases.
      CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnoea is at most a rare cause of either growth
      restriction or hypertensive disease in pregnancy.

      fetal growth.
PG  - 137-43
LID - 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60201-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding potential harmful effect of medications on fetuses
      often result in inadequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy, whereas risks posed 
      by poorly controlled maternal asthma are often underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To
      evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth.
      METHODS: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of
      Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between 
      February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed 
      asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based
      on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and
      reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations.
      The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth
      restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom
      control and exacerbation measures. RESULTS: The incidence of preterm delivery was
      significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during
      the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma
      control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma
      during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with
      asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect 
      seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates.
      Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight
      varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly
      controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the
      importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal
      asthma control.

AB  - Oncofertility is one of the 9 NIH Roadmap Initiatives, federal grants intended to
      explore previously intractable questions, and it describes a new field that
      exists in the liminal space between cancer treatment and its sequelae, IVF
      clinics and their yearning, and basic research in cell growth, biomaterials, and 
      reproductive science and its tempting promises. Cancer diagnoses, which were once
      thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet 
      the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in
      premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is
      especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men
      and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of 
      fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days 
      of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges.
      Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing
      cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the
      decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be
      preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to
      produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully
      outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging.
      Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is
      intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families,
      illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if
      understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice
      central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the
      moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the
      implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping
      the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can
      be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue?

TI  - [Conduct disorders in seven-year-old children--results of ELSPAC study. 2. Risk
      factors].
PG  - 311-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conduct disorders related to hyperactivity and significant attention 
      deficit are caused by several types of risk factors-genetic, biological,
      environmental and psychosocial. A cohort of children was followed longitudinally 
      in a prospective study during the pregnancy and childhood (ELSPAC). In the age of
      7 years, marked behavioural divergences were described in 4,4% of children by
      their attending physicians. These children were also more often afflicted by
      other pathological symptoms (hyperactivity, sleep and psychomotor disorders).
      From the data collected from parents and physicians in the previous phases of
      investigation we selected possible risk factors which affect the prenatal and
      postnatal periods: prenatal exposure of children to smoking, alcohol, chemical
      substances, prenatal development complications, the level of education of
      parents, family dysfunction, alcoholism of both parents, conflicts with the
      police, mother's disturbed mental health. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the sample of
      3752 children from the city of Brno, no behavioural divergence was found in 96.5%
      of cases. The presence of one or two of the four observed divergences occurred in
      3.2% and 3 to 4 conduct disorder symptoms occurred in 0.3% children,
      significantly more often in boys. The children with conduct disorders compared to
      the children with no symptoms had significantly lower average birthweight, lower 
      head circumference, their mothers had more often lower education, smoked and had 
      psychological problems in childhood and as adults and the fathers had more often 
      conflicts with the law. CONCLUSIONS: The ELSPAC study did not have the
      methodological possibility of studying the genetic-environmental interactions;
      nevertheless it contributes to the evidence supporting that some factors can
      negatively effect the foetal development and the unfavourable family environment 
      can participate in the development of conduct disorders which can progress during
      lifetime.

TI  - The male biological clock is ticking: a review of the literature.
PG  - 197-201
LID - S1516-31802008000300012 [pii]
AB  - The term biological clock is usually used by physicians and psychologists to
      refer to the declining fertility, increasing risk of fetal birth defects and
      alterations to hormone levels experienced by women as they age. Female fecundity 
      declines slowly after the age of 30 years and more rapidly after 40 and is
      considered the main limiting factor in treating infertility. However, there are
      several scientific reports, chapters in books and review articles suggesting that
      men may also have a biological clock. The aim of our study was to conduct a
      review of the literature, based on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval 
      System Online (Medline), to evaluate the male biological clock. After adjustments
      for other factors, the data demonstrate that the likelihood that a fertile couple
      will take more than 12 months to conceive nearly doubles from 8% when the man is 
      < 25 years old to 15% when he is > 35 years old. Thus, paternal age is a further 
      factor to be taken into account when deciding on the prognosis for infertile
      couples. Also, increasing male age is associated with a significant decline in
      fertility (five times longer to achieve pregnancy at the age of 45 years).
      Patients and their physicians therefore need to understand the effects of the
      male biological clock on sexual and reproductive health, in that it leads to
      erectile dysfunction and male infertility, as well as its potential implications 
      for important medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - A woman's sleep is impacted by biology (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause),
      sleep disorders (that may manifest differently than in men), and role in the home
      and workplace. A Women and Sleep Workshop, sponsored by the National Sleep
      Foundation, in March 2007 reviewed these topics. It was concluded that
      understanding the relationship between sleep and gender will result in a
      scientifically based approach to women's sleep problems.

AB  - Sleep disorders affect women differently than they affect men and may have
      different manifestations and prevalences. With regard to obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate
      treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of
      menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less
      severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic
      issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The
      prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout
      most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately
      1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with
      age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be
      attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life 
      transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence
      of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is
      important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as 
      well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology
      and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is
      little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and
      specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs
      syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during
      periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population.
      This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is
      increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life,
      highly effective treatment is available.

PG  - 544-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.07.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol
      consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. METHOD: 344
      institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006.
      Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous
      questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were 
      examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:
      The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol
      consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6%
      and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated
      with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of
      pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol
      consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy,
      ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice
      regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime
      sleepiness. CONCLUSION: It is important to have a more comprehensive
      understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of 
      pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future
      policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

AB  - Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction
      and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is
      secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which
      exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators
      of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep.
      Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in
      hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The
      administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence
      of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological
      hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished
      from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The 
      causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this 
      article.

TI  - Inconsolable night-time awakening: beyond night terrors.
PG  - 311-4
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181829f4c [doi]
AB  - Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents
      who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated 
      that she has frequent (>6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming
      and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes increased in
      intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a
      bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and touching mother's
      nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within 1 hour she
      awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be
      comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a 
      sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern.
      Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine
      including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion
      from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking,
      hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes.
      Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal
      hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum
      bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks,
      daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to
      sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not
      successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and
      difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in
      the first year. Occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed 
      by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture
      aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal 
      interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones
      appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and
      infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking 
      and a paternal history of sleep walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily
      schedule. Sleep deprivation, different parental child-rearing practices, social
      isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as
      significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30
      minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first
      word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the
      developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment,
      she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 235-40
AB  - Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic movement disorder that affects
      approximately 10 percent of adults. Of those affected with this condition,
      approximately one third have symptoms severe enough to require medical therapy.
      Restless legs syndrome may be a primary condition, or it may be secondary to iron
      deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. The
      diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by 
      an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and
      worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome causes
      sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative
      effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs
      syndrome may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Currently, there is
      little information regarding the effects of lifestyle changes on the symptoms of 
      restless legs syndrome. If medications are needed, dopamine agonists are the
      primary medications for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome. Other
      medications that may be effective include gabapentin, carbidopa/levodopa,
      opioids, and benzodiazepines.

TI  - Current issues: women and bipolar disorder.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - While the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) is typically complex, the treatment 
      of women with bipolar disorder is even more challenging because clinicians must
      also individualize treatment based on the potential for pregnancy, drug
      interactions with oral contraceptives, and an increased risk of endocrine
      diseases that can either impact the course of illness or become manifest with
      some treatments. Women with BD should be checked for hypothyroidism, and if
      prescribed antidepressants, carefully watched for rapid cycling or a mood switch 
      to mania, hypomania, or a mixed state. Several medications interact with oral
      contraceptives or increase the risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome.
      Consideration of possible pregnancy is essential, and should be planned in
      advance whenever possible. Rates of recurrence have been shown to be equal in
      pregnant and nonpregnant women with BD. Risks of medication to the fetus at
      various points of development must be balanced against the risks of not treating,
      which is also detrimental to both fetus and mother. The postpartum period is a
      time of especially high risk; as many as 40% to 67% of women with BD report
      experiencing a postpartum mania or depression. The decision to breastfeed must
      also take into account the adverse impact of sleep deprivation in triggering mood
      episodes. In order to best address these issues, clinicians must be familiar with
      the data and collaborate with the patient to assess risks and benefits for the
      individual women and her family.

TI  - [Is the assessment of serum creatinine reliable?].
PG  - 392-5
AB  - Chemical and enzymatic methods are used to measure creatinine in serum and urine.
      Chemical methods are mostly based on the reaction of creatinine with alkaline
      picrate (Jaffe reaction). The Jaffe reaction is not specific for creatinine, the 
      same reaction resulting in Jaffe-like chromogens show many interfering substances
      (ascorbic acid, bilirubin, proteins, ketones, cephalosporins and other drugs).
      Chemical and enzymatic methods show similar accuracy and day-to-day precision.
      Chemical methods are cheaper than enzymatic methods. Enzymatic methods require
      low sample volume and are not affected by the interfering substances as the
      chemical methods. Presented case report shows an unusual occurrence of drug
      interference in the enzymatic creatine deaminase procedure. Biological factors
      (circadian rhythm, pregnancy, hemodialysis, transplantation, stress, exercise),
      analytical and preanalytical factors (pH, glucose, pyruvate, bilirubin, fatty
      acids, sample storage and sample collection - gel tubes) and biological
      variability of creatinine play significant role in the creatinine examination.

TI  - [Restless-legs syndrome].
PG  - 701-21
LID - 10.1016/j.neurol.2008.06.006 [doi]
AB  - Restless-legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an
      irresistible urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable
      and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or
      inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or
      occurs at night and in the evening. RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the
      general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family
      history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a 
      positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early 
      onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form,
      usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype
      without PLM and l-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in
      childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included
      in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in
      the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to 
      move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies
      and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an l-DOPA
      challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may
      cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious
      symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In most cases, RLS 
      is idiopathic. It may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal
      disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and
      antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS
      is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's
      disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS
      includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable
      role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and
      three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment
      begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when
      deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses of l-DOPA
      or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic
      agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or
      neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid
      (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the prospective relationship
      between depressive symptoms and anxiety across pregnancy and the early
      postpartum. METHODS: Participants (N=207) completed the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory Trait subscale, Beck Depression Inventory, and social support and sleep
      quality measures at two time points during pregnancy and once in the early
      postpartum period. RESULTS: After accounting for the relative stability of
      anxiety and depression over time, depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy
      predicted higher levels of anxiety in late pregnancy and anxiety in late
      pregnancy predicted higher depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum. A
      bi-directional model of depression and anxiety in pregnancy was supported.
      LIMITATIONS: Data were based on self-reports and participating women were
      predominantly tertiary educated with high family incomes. CONCLUSION: Our
      findings suggest that depressive symptoms precede the development of higher
      levels of anxiety and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict
      higher depressive symptoms. Clinicians are advised to screen for anxiety and
      depression concurrently during pregnancy.

PG  - 173-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to clarify the alcohol consumption status of pregnant women 
      in Japan and the characteristics of pregnant women who abstained from alcohol
      after their pregnancy had been confirmed, a nationwide questionnaire-based study 
      of alcohol consumption behavior was performed. We also examined the factors
      associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the
      confirmation of pregnancy. METHODS: After random sampling, 260 institutions
      participated in the survey; these were selected from a list of survey points
      fixed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The study was 
      conducted on pregnant women with confirmed pregnancies by using self-administered
      anonymous questionnaires during the period from February 1 through 14, 2002.
      RESULTS: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported in 11.1% of the study 
      participants, and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy, in 76.9%.
      Significant associations were recognized between higher education and both
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after pregnancy confirmation.
      Furthermore, alcohol consumption was significantly associated with parity,
      smoking, and shorter sleep duration, whereas abstention was significantly
      associated with less frequent alcohol consumption and knowledge regarding the
      risk of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: The results clarified the factors
      associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the
      confirmation of pregnancy in Japan.

TI  - Adaptive responses of the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during
      pregnancy and lactation.
PG  - 764-76
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01735.x [doi]
AB  - Over the past 40 years, it has been recognised that the maternal
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes adaptations through pregnancy
      and lactation that might contribute to avoidance of adverse effects of stress on 
      the mother and offspring. The extent of the global adaptations in the HPA axis
      has been revealed and the underlying mechanisms investigated within the last 20
      years. Both basal, including the circadian rhythm, and stress-induced
      adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid secretory patterns are altered.
      Throughout most of pregnancy, and in lactation, these changes predominantly
      reflect reduced drive by the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurones in the
      parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). An accompanying profound
      attenuation of HPA axis responses to a wide variety of psychological and physical
      stressors emerges after mid-pregnancy and persists until the end of lactation.
      Central to this suppression of stress responsiveness is reduced activation of the
      pPVN CRF neurones. This is consequent on the reduced effectiveness of the
      stimulation of brainstem afferents to these CRF neurones (for physical stressors)
      and of altered processing by limbic structures (for emotional stressors). The
      mechanism of reduced CRF neurone responses to physical stressors in pregnancy is 
      the suppression of noradrenaline release in the PVN by an up-regulated endogenous
      opioid mechanism, which is induced by neuroactive steroid produced from
      progesterone. By contrast, in lactation suckling the young provides a neural
      stimulus that dampens the HPA axis circadian rhythm and reduces stress responses.
      Reduced noradrenergic input activity is involved in reduced stress responses in
      lactation, although central prolactin action also appears important. Such
      adaptations limit the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure on the
      foetus(es) and facilitate appropriate metabolic and immune responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that circadian physiological rhythms of the
      fetus are affected by oscillators in the maternal brain that are coupled to the
      environmental light-dark (LD) cycle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study the
      link between fetal and maternal biological clocks, we investigated the effects of
      cycles of maternal food availability on the rhythms of Per1 gene expression in
      the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver using a transgenic rat model
      whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although the maternal SCN remained
      phase-locked to the LD cycle, maternal restricted feeding phase-advanced the
      fetal SCN and liver by 5 and 7 hours respectively within the 22-day pregnancy.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that maternal feeding entrains 
      the fetal SCN and liver independently of both the maternal SCN and the LD cycle. 
      This indicates that maternal-feeding signals can be more influential for the
      fetal SCN and particular organ oscillators than hormonal signals controlled by
      the maternal SCN, suggesting the importance of a regular maternal feeding
      schedule for appropriate fetal molecular clockwork during pregnancy.

TI  - Pregnancy and epilepsy:update on pregnancy registries.
PG  - 246-52
AB  - In the United States, about 1 million women of childbearing age have epilepsy.
      Estimates vary as to the percentage of these women who consider pregnancy, but
      epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition encountered in pregnancy. Women 
      with epilepsy express significant interest in receiving guidance about pregnancy 
      and the effects of seizures and anticonvulsant treatments on the developing
      fetus, but clinicians often are hard-pressed to find accurate and relevant
      information to share. In our practice, we devote many hours of clinical time to
      the counseling required when such a request is made. We begin by providing
      information about the risks of pregnancy for any woman, comparing the data for
      women with and without epilepsy; this gives patients perspective on the increase 
      in the risk of fetal malformations associated with anticonvulsant therapy. We
      then proceed with an evaluation of whether the patient could consider withdrawing
      one or more anticonvulsants, particularly during the first trimester of
      gestation. For women who must continue taking anticonvulsants to prevent
      seizures, we explain that the increase in metabolism during pregnancy will
      require an increase in oral dosing to maintain prepregnancy concentrations of
      anticonvulsants. It is hoped that by maintaining prepregnancy blood levels during
      pregnancy, a woman with epilepsy can maintain the same level of seizure control
      during pregnancy that she had before conception. Additional time is spent
      discussing the need for adequate hydration, regular meals, and proper sleep
      during pregnancy and in the postpartum time to avoid behavioral alterations that 
      can trigger seizures. As seizure medicines will need to be decreased after
      delivery, when a patient will be sleep-deprived and under the influence of
      hormonal changes that can increase the seizure tendency, our nurses meet with
      patients throughout pregnancy to develop plans for partner or family assistance
      with care of the neonate. Patients report appreciation for this type of
      personalized counseling but express frustration that we cannot provide absolute
      guidance with respect to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy. Therefore we
      often have to return several times to the topic of the limitations of scientific 
      research regarding decision-making in pregnancy. Much of the information we have 
      about the safety of anticonvulsant use in pregnancy comes from the registry
      studies discussed in this article. These studies can be difficult to interpret
      and compare because of the diversity of the methods used.

TI  - Peptidergic agonists of activity-dependent neurotrophic factor protect against
      prenatal alcohol-induced neural tube defects and serotonin neuron loss.
PG  - 1361-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00722.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prenatal alcohol exposure via maternal liquid diet consumption by
      C57BL/6 (B6) mice causes conspicuous midline neural tube deficit (dysraphia) and 
      disruption of genesis and development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe
      nuclei, together with brain growth retardation. The current study tested the
      hypothesis that concurrent treatment with either an activity-dependent
      neurotrophic factor (ADNF) agonist peptide [SALLRSIPA, (SAL)] or an
      activity-dependent neurotrophic protein (ADNP) agonist peptide [NAPVSIPQ, (NAP)] 
      would protect against these alcohol-induced deficits in brain development.
      METHODS: Timed-pregnant B6 dams consumed alcohol from embryonic day 7 (E7, before
      the onset of neurulation) until E15. Fetuses were obtained on E15 and brain
      sections processed for 5-HT immunocytochemistry, for evaluation of morphologic
      development of the brainstem raphe and its 5-HT neurons. Additional groups were
      treated either with SAL or NAP daily from E7 to E15 to assess the potential
      protective effects of these peptides. Measures of incomplete occlusion of the
      ventral canal and the frequency and extent of the openings in the rhombencephalon
      were obtained to assess fetal dysraphia. Counts of 5-HT-immunostained neurons
      were also obtained in the rostral and caudal raphe. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol
      exposure resulted in abnormal openings along the midline and delayed closure of
      ventral canal in the brainstem. This dysraphia was associated with reductions in 
      the number of 5-HT neurons both in the rostral raphe nuclei (that gives rise to
      ascending 5-HT projections) and in the caudal raphe (that gives rise to the
      descending 5-HT projections). Concurrent treatment of the alcohol-consuming dams 
      with SAL prevented dysraphia and protected against the alcohol-induced reductions
      in 5-HT neurons in both the rostral and caudal raphe. NAP was less effective in
      protecting against dysraphia and did not protect against 5-HT loss in the rostral
      raphe, but did protect against loss in the caudal raphe. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings further support the potential usefulness of these peptides for
      therapeutic interventions in pregnancies at risk for alcohol-induced
      developmental deficits. Notably, the ascending 5-HT projections of the rostral
      raphe have profound effects in regulating forebrain development and function, and
      the descending 5-HT projections of the caudal raphe are critical for regulating
      respiration. Protection of the rostral 5-HT-system may help prevent structural
      and functional deficits linked to abnormal forebrain development, and protection 
      of the caudal systems may also reduce the increased risk for sudden infant death 
      syndrome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

TI  - Persistent neonatal thyrotoxicosis in a neonate secondary to a rare
      thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor activating mutation: case report and
      literature review.
PG  - 479-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a neonate presenting with nonautoimmune
      thyrotoxicosis and failure to thrive in whom an activating TSHR mutation was
      suspected. METHODS: We describe the clinical and laboratory findings in a neonate
      who presented with nonautoimmune thyrotoxicosis and failure to thrive, including 
      results of DNA analysis of TSHR, which encodes the thyroid-stimulating hormone
      receptor (TSHR). Relevant literature is also reviewed. RESULTS: The proband was
      born spontaneously at 35 weeks' gestation, and his early neonatal period was
      remarkable for meconium aspiration, pneumothorax, hepatomegaly with associated
      elevated transaminases, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. On days 9 and 11 of life, 
      thyroid function studies revealed hyperthyroidism, which remained persistent on
      day 26 of life. On day 44 of life, the infant was admitted to the hospital. The
      mother reported he had an increased activity level, disturbed sleep, jitteriness,
      and exaggerated startle response. Weight was at the third percentile. After
      additional workup, Lugol's iodine solution, propanolol, and propylthiouracil were
      prescribed, which led to improvement in thyroid function. No TSHR antibodies were
      detected in the mother's or patient's sera. Analysis of the patient's DNA
      revealed a heterozygous T-to-C substitution at amino acid 568 in exon 10
      (Ile568Thr), which predicts an isoleucine to threonine conversion in the second
      extracellular loop of TSHR. The mutation was not identified in the parents' DNA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A mutation causing constitutive activation of TSHR was confirmed in 
      this patient, a finding that has implications for genetic counseling and
      consideration of total thyroidectomy or long-term thionamide therapy followed by 
      radioiodide ablation as treatment options. Although rare, TSHR mutations should
      be considered in an infant presenting with thyrotoxicosis in absence of
      demonstrable TSHR antibodies in serum.

AB  - Although fatigue is a common experience for pregnant women and new mothers, few
      measures of fatigue have been validated for use with this population. To address 
      this gap, the authors assessed psychometric properties of the Multidimensional
      Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was used in 2 independent samples of
      pregnant women. Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the scale
      were very similar across samples and time points. The scale possesses a high
      level of internal consistency, has good convergent validity with measures of
      sleep quality and depression, and discriminates well from a measure of social
      support. Contrary to previous evaluations of the MAF, data strongly suggest that 
      the scale represents a unidimensional construct best represented by a single
      factor. Results indicate that the MAF is a useful measure of fatigue among
      pregnant and postpartum women.

TI  - Aspergillosis of a dog genital tract-Case report.
PG  - 164-71
LID - 10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.04.020 [doi]
AB  - The information about aspergillosis locations in the reproductive organ is
      scarce. This short paper deals with aspergillosis in the dog genital tract with
      hyphae present in semen. There are two therapy schemes used in visceral mycoses, 
      non-invasive treatment and surgical intervention. Considering the future
      reproductive career of the dog, we decided on antifungal drugs administration.
      Based on the microbiological results, we administered amoxycillin with
      clavulonate (Synulox 500mg, twice daily) orally. Itraconazole was used as an
      antimycological agent (Orungal, 100mg, twice daily) every other week. In 8th week
      of therapy no Aspergillus spp. growth was noted, yet slight Penicillium growth
      was observed. After 12 weeks of treatment, no fungus growth was present. Neither 
      spores or hyphae were seen in the microscopic examination. Three months after the
      termination of the therapy, the dog mated with two females. In one case, unifetal
      pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound examination on day 42 after mating. Due to 
      purulent discharge on day 45 after mating, the owner decided to terminate the
      pregnancy. In the other case, severe pyometra appeared 12 days after the second
      mating and the owner decided to put the female to sleep. The pathogen eradication
      from the ejaculates may be treated as a serious success, yet the lack of litters 
      after mating calls for an explanation and consequences of Aspergillus spp.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep
      positioning. STUDY DESIGN: We used data for 11340 mother-infant pairs from the
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State,
      1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant
      (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning. RESULTS: Factors
      associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth,
      maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity.
      Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive 
      only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of
      government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were
      predictive only of lateral sleep positioning. CONCLUSIONS: Factors predictive of 
      either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health 
      intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS.

TI  - [Reduction of patient discomfort, risks and costs, but not pregnancies, by a mild
      strategy for in-vitro fertilisation].
PG  - 809-16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare a so-called mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment
      strategy with the standard IVF treatment on the following aspects: the chance of 
      a pregnancy resulting in full-term live birth within 1 year, patient discomfort, 
      multiple pregnancies, and costs. DESIGN: Randomised, open-label, prospective
      trial (www.controlledtrials.com, number ISRCTN35766970). METHOD: 404 patients
      were assigned to undergo either a mild treatment, consisting of ovarian
      stimulation with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist combined
      with single embryo transfer, or the standard treatment consisting of prolonged
      stimulation with a GnRH agonist combined with the transfer of two embryos. The
      primary outcome measures were: (1) the percentage of cumulative pregnancies
      within one year after randomisation leading to full-term live birth; (2) total
      costs per couple and child up to 6 weeks after expected delivery; and (3) overall
      patient discomfort. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat
      principle and was intended to show that the mild treatment was not inferior to
      the standard treatment; the non-inferiority threshold was -12.5%. RESULTS: The
      proportion of cumulative pregnancies resulting in full-term live birth after 1
      year was 43.4% in the mild and 44.7% in the standard treatment group. The lower
      limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval was equal to -9.8%. The respective
      proportion of couples with multiple pregnancies was 0.5% versus 13.1% (p <
      0.0001), and the average total costs were Euro 8,333.- versus Euro 10,745.-
      (difference: Euro 2,412.-, 95% CI: 703-4,131). There were no statistically
      significant differences between the groups with regard to anxiety, depression,
      physical discomfort, and sleep quality. CONCLUSION: After 1 year of treatment,
      the cumulative percentage of pregnancies leading to full-term live birth and the 
      total patient discomfort were the same for the mild treatment (average 2.3
      IVF-cycles) and the standard treatment (average 1.7 IVF-cycles). The mild
      treatment significantly reduced the number of multiple pregnancies and the
      overall costs.

TI  - Melatonin and pregnancy in the human.
PG  - 291-303
LID - 10.1016/j.reprotox.2008.03.005 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this systematic review is to access the current state of knowledge
      concerning the role for melatonin in human pregnancy. Melatonin is a
      neuroendocrine hormone secreted nightly by pineal gland and regulates biological 
      rhythms. The nighttime serum concentration of melatonin shows an incremental
      change toward the end of pregnancy. This small lipophilic indoleamine crosses the
      placenta freely without being altered. Maternal melatonin enters the fetal
      circulation with ease providing photoperiodic information to the fetus. Melatonin
      works in a variety of ways as a circadian rhythm modulator, endocrine modulator, 
      immunomodulator, direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant and
      cytoprotective agent in human pregnancy, and it appears to be essential for
      successful pregnancy. It also seems to be involved in correcting the
      pathophysiology of complications during pregnancy including those due to
      abortion, pre-eclampsia and fetal brain damage. The scientific evidence
      supporting a role for melatonin in human pregnancy is summarized.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 497-518
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined by the presence of (i) an urge
      to move the legs with or without an actual paraesthesia; (ii) a worsening of
      symptoms with inactivity; (iii) improvement with activity; and (iv) a worsening
      of symptoms in the evening and at night. Patients may use a variety of semantic
      phrases to describe their symptoms but all must have an urge to move. Most people
      with RLS also have periodic limb movements during sleep, although this is not
      part of the clinical diagnostic criteria. RLS is very common. About 10% of all
      Caucasian populations have RLS, although it may be mild in the majority of cases.
      Women generally outnumber men by about 2:1. As a general rule, RLS severity
      worsens through the first seven to eight decades of life, but may actually lessen
      in old age. The aetiology of RLS is only partly understood. There is a strong
      genetic component, and several genetic linkages and three causative genes have
      been identified worldwide. Several medical conditions, including renal failure,
      systemic iron deficiency and pregnancy, and possibly neuropathy, essential tremor
      and some genetic ataxias, are also associated with high rates of RLS. In all
      cases to date, the actual CNS pathology of RLS demonstrates reduced iron stores, 
      in a pattern that suggests that the homeostatic control of iron is altered, not
      just that there is not enough iron entering the brain. The relationship between
      reduced CNS iron levels and the clinical phenotype or treatment response to
      dopaminergics is not known but generates promising speculation. Treatment of RLS 
      is usually rewarding. Most patients respond robustly to dopamine receptor
      agonists. Over time, response may lessen, or the patients may develop
      'augmentation', whereby they have a worsening of symptoms, usually in the form of
      an earlier onset. Other treatment options include gabapentin, or similar
      antiepileptic drugs, and opioids. High-dose intravenous iron is a promising but
      still experimental approach.

PG  - 217-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00655.x [doi]
AB  - For the first time, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep
      quality was explored prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (n = 273)
      completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Inventory at
      three 8-week intervals, starting from 15-23 weeks gestation. In addition to sleep
      quality and depression remaining relatively stable during pregnancy, findings
      revealed that sleep quality earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of
      depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy (after controlling for prior
      depression levels). In contrast, there was no evidence to suggest that depressive
      symptoms earlier in pregnancy impacted on sleep quality later on. Given that
      depressive symptomatology can lead to major depression and given the prevalence
      of pre- and postnatal depression, our findings suggest that screening for sleep
      problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance.

TI  - Risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome in a developing country.
PG  - 396-401
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether previously identified risk factors for sudden death
      syndrome have a significant impact in a developing country. METHODS:
      Retrospective longitudinal case-control study carried out in Porto Alegre,
      Southern Brazil. Cases (N=39) were infants born between 1996 and 2000 who died
      suddenly and unexpectedly at home during sleep and were diagnosed with sudden
      death syndrome. Controls (N=117) were infants matched by age and sex who died in 
      hospitals due to other conditions. Data were collected from postmortem
      examination records and questionnaires answers. A conditional logistic model was 
      used to identify factors associated with the outcome. RESULTS: Mean age at death 
      of cases was 3.2 months. The frequencies of infants regarding gestational age,
      breastfeeding and regular medical visits were similar in both groups. Sleeping
      position for most cases and controls was the lateral one. Supine sleeping
      position was found for few infants in both groups. Maternal variables, age below 
      20 years (OR=2, 95% CI: 1.1; 5.1) and smoking of more than 10 cigarettes per day 
      during pregnancy (OR=3, 95% CI: 1.3; 6.4), significantly increased the risk for
      the syndrome. Socioeconomic characteristics were similar in both groups and did
      not affect risk. CONCLUSIONS: Infant-maternal and socioeconomic profiles of cases
      in a developing country closely resembled the profile described in the
      literature, and risk factors were similar as well. However, individual
      characteristics were identified as risks in the population studied, such as
      smoking during pregnancy and maternal age below 20 years.

AB  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of
      pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients
      themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient
      pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients
      completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need--Mothers Version. There were
      significant differences in the total number of needs (p < 0.01) and total number 
      of unmet needs (p < 0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was
      moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life
      domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother--notably
      pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare
      domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities,
      sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women
      and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social
      care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the
      importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by
      staff.

TI  - Examination of a multi-factorial model of body-related experiences during
      pregnancy: the relationships among physical symptoms, sleep quality, depression, 
      self-esteem, and negative body attitudes.
PG  - 152-63
LID - 10.1016/j.bodyim.2007.12.005 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among
      women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep
      quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N=215) at 15-25 weeks gestation
      completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing
      self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of
      weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and
      completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective
      reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related
      to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more
      depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research,
      paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem;
      self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling
      fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

TI  - Developmental origins of childhood overweight: potential public health impact.
PG  - 1651-6
LID - 10.1038/oby.2008.260 [doi]
AB  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are
      known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in
      combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to
      levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain,
      breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child 
      pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome
      measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex >or=95th percentile) at age 3. 
      We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well
      as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household
      income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for
      each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of
      mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child
      pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the
      3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model,
      the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed
      to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all 
      four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much 
      lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to
      modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact
      on prevention of childhood overweight.

TI  - A long-term monitoring of fetal movement at home using a newly developed sensor: 
      an introduction of maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement during
      maternal sleep.
PG  - 595-603
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2008.03.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well
      known. Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as 
      there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement,
      psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal
      well-being have not been done. AIMS: To solve these methodological issues, we
      developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration 
      of fetal movement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiment I: We verified the reliability
      of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 
      weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a 
      button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously
      recorded maternal polysonograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens
      using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for
      agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective 
      maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven
      pregnant women's polysonograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night
      sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded 
      in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of 
      the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal
      markers and fetal movement. Our recording system using the new sensor can be used
      for home monitoring of fetal movement.

TI  - [Influence of circadian rhythm on fetal and maternal Doppler parameters--is a
      diurnal variation detectable?].
PG  - 47-52
LID - 10.1055/s-2008-1004638 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Doppler sonography is an established method in fetal medicine. Up
      to now a possible circadian rhythm of fetal and maternal Doppler parameters has
      only been insufficiently characterized and documented. This survey aimed at
      evaluating the significance of Doppler parameters with regard to diurnal
      variations. We have analyzed whether or not a circadian rhythm of fetal and
      maternal Doppler parameters is detectable. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-selected
      collective of 100 patients with a singleton pregnancy between the 20th and 39th
      week of gestation was examined with Doppler sonography at the Medical School of
      Hannover. Besides the Doppler sonography, which was performed at three fixed
      times a day, the maternal blood pressure was examined each time. Outcome
      parameters were resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and the maximum
      velocity (V (max)) of the A. umbilicalis, A. cerebri media and the Aa. uterinae
      as well as the maternal blood pressure. RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences for the RI, PI and V (max) of the Aa. uterinae for the whole
      collective, nor for the subgroups of maternal hypertonia, preeclampsia, notching 
      and fetal growth restriction (IUGR). There were also no significant diurnal
      variations of the Doppler parameters for the fetal vessels. In particular, there 
      were no differences in the measured Doppler parameters in comparison to the
      collective with unremarkable gravidity. In some subgroups statistical
      significance could be achieved, but due to the minor variations, no clinical
      importance has to be considered. CONCLUSION: A circadian rhythm of the Doppler
      parameters could not be confirmed in the examined collective. The time of the
      applied Doppler sonography on physiological conditions might represent a factor
      which does not affect the validity of the Doppler sonographic results. As a
      consequence a single Doppler examination at a freely chosen time seems to be
      sufficient to obtain a correct assessment of fetal and maternal blood perfusion. 
      Further studies on larger collectives are necessary to evaluate the clinical
      importance of a possible circadian rhythm, especially in fetuses with
      pathological Doppler values.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to wood fuel smoke and low birth weight.
PG  - 543-9
LID - 10.1289/ehp.10782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal exposure to wood fuel smoke may lead to impaired fetal
      growth due to hypoxia and or oxidative stress from smoke constituents such as
      carbon monoxide and particulate matter. OBJECTIVES: We studied the risk of low
      birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of
      wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG).
      METHODS: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth
      in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infant's birth weight 
      was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass
      index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used
      during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in
      2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using
      propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS: Unadjusted mean
      (+/- SD) birth weight was 2.78 +/- 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 +/- 0.43 kg (p
      < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than
      infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The
      rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG
      users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval,
      1.10-2.34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was
      estimated to be 24%. CONCLUSION: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a
      potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower
      mean birth weight compared with using NG.

TI  - Sleep fragmentation and evidence for sleep debt in alcohol-exposed infants.
PG  - 577-85
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2008.02.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor 
      neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. AIM: To
      examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and
      sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy. STUDY DESIGN:
      Low-income women (N=13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of
      alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period.
      Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and
      actigraphy at 6-8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol 
      use were used to divide infants into high vs. low maternal alcohol use groups.
      SUBJECTS: Mother-infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic. OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal
      assessments of infant alertness and irritability. RESULTS: Pre-pregnancy rates of
      alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of
      poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups 
      showed increased sleep fragmentation, e.g., frequency and duration of wakefulness
      following sleep onset and decreased active sleep. Bout analysis of the temporal
      structure of sleep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced
      bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use. CONCLUSION: These
      results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal sleep 
      organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during sleep, and increased
      sleep fragmentation promotes sleep deprivation. Results are consistent with the
      SIDS model of chronic sleep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related
      movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory
      functions during sleep in high-risk groups.

TI  - Onset of feeding at birth--perinatal development of the hypothalamic mechanisms
      that induce appetite and feeding in the newborn.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2007.12.043 [doi]
AB  - Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic peptides which, in the adult brain, are
      associated with arousal, increased vigilance, and the seeking and ingestion of
      food. Because the fetus is mostly asleep, and hunger is a physiological state
      unlikely to arise until birth, we hypothesized that orexigenic neurons in the
      lateral and dorso-medial hypothalamic areas (LHA, DMH) and their projections to
      the locus coeruleus (LC) would develop only near the time of birth. We therefore 
      determined orexin expression in fetal sheep, where birth occurs over a tightly
      regulated interval of 146-148 days gestation. Immunohistochemistry was used to
      determine the presence and distribution of orexin-A positive fibres and cells at 
      the level of the hypothalamus and LC in fetal (125-137 and 145+ days gestation
      age) and newborn sheep brains. Orexin was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma 
      samples taken from chronically catheterised fetal and newborn sheep, and in CSF
      taken from fetuses and lambs at postmortem. Orexin-A positive cells bodies were
      observed in the hypothalamus, and orexin-A fibres were found throughout all
      hypothalamic, thalamic, and brain stem regions of all the fetal and newborn
      brains examined. Orexin-A was present in plasma and CSF at similar concentrations
      in fetal and newborn sheep. The presence of orexin in hypothalamic neurons and
      CSF throughout late gestation suggests that orexinergic regulation of hunger,
      appetite and the sleep/wake cycle is inhibited, by mechanisms yet to be
      identified, until the time of parturition.

      during pregnancy and the postnatal period.

AB  - RATIONALE: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, 
      neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological
      well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy
      advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience
      and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive 
      and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in
      maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of
      maternity care on psychological health outcomes. METHODS: 165 antenatal women
      were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were
      assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional 
      Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and 
      Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14
      days and 6 months postnatal. RESULTS: No significant differences between groups
      were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and
      corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS
      socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality
      personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect
      for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and
      midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge
      regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater
      psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible,
      however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can
      affect psychological status.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and factors associated with co-sleeping 
      and nighttime waking among the children of the Pelotas 2004 cohort at 12 months
      of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil during 2004
      were enrolled on a longitudinal study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and
      once more at 12 months of age to obtain information on their sociodemographic and
      reproductive characteristics and on their children's sleep and the environment in
      which their children sleep. Co-sleeping was defined as habitually sharing the bed
      with another person. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson
      regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of co-sleeping at 12 months was 45.8% (95%CI 
      44.2-47.3). Co-sleeping was more common among mothers with low socioeconomic
      status, less education, younger mothers, mothers with more previous births and
      among children who wake at night. The prevalence of nighttime waking was 46.1%
      (95%CI 44.6-47.7). Nighttime waking was more common among boys and among the
      offspring of mothers who had had a greater number of previous pregnancies and of 
      mothers who had been employed while pregnant. CONCLUSION: Co-sleeping and
      nighttime waking are common among this study population, indicating a need to
      continue follow-up in order to observe how long these habits persist through
      childhood and to investigate their consequences for child development and
      behavior.

LID - 10.1089/met.2006.4.149 [doi]
AB  - Several conditions are associated with insulin resistance (IR), and the mechanism
      behind this state is multifactorial. Pathological states (such as visceral
      obesity, low energy expenditure, high carbohydrate consumption, and sleep
      deprivation) and more physiological states (such as puberty and pregnancy) will
      lead to increased IR. During puberty, the high levels of sex steroids as well as 
      the high levels of growth hormone (GH) are responsible for decreased insulin
      sensitivity. During pregnancy, the high levels of several diabetogenic hormones
      lead to a state of IR. A pronounced physiological decrease in peripheral insulin 
      sensitivity occurs as pregnancy proceeds. In contrast, gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) is a pathological state of carbohydrate intolerance beginning or
      first recognized during pregnancy, which leads to increased risk of adverse
      pregnancy outcome. Obese women, an increasing part of the fertile female
      population, develop a more pronounced IR during pregnancy, with a higher risk of 
      developing GDM.

TI  - Restless leg syndrome: is it a real problem?
PG  - 465-75
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that is frequently
      unrecognized, misdiagnosed and poorly managed. It is characterized by
      uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs developing at rest that compel the
      person to move; symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS 
      occurs in 7%-11% of the population in Western countries, and many such people
      experience troublesome symptoms. Primary RLS is familial in up to two thirds of
      patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron
      deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy.
      Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later
      life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or
      brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the
      subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound
      of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms
      earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a
      prolonged period with levodopa. Consequently, dopamine agonists have become first
      line treatment. Anti-convulsant medications and opioids are helpful in some
      patients. Correction of underlying problem wherever possible is important in the 
      management of secondary RLS.

TI  - Update on the prophylaxis of migraine.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Migraine prophylaxis is a stepwise procedure with lifestyle advice followed by
      consideration of medications. Patients should be advised to try to maintain a
      regular lifestyle, with regular sleep, meals, exercise, and management of stress,
      perhaps through relaxation techniques or other ways that are sensible for them.
      If this regimen does not adequately control their migraines, preventatives are
      indicated. Patients can choose between evidence-based nutraceuticals such as
      riboflavin, feverfew, butterbur, or coenzyme Q10, or more traditional
      pharmacotherapeutics. Medicine choices are somewhat limited by what is available 
      in each country, but from the full range, the medicines of first choice are
      beta-adrenoceptor blockers, flunarizine, topiramate, and valproic acid.
      Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are particularly useful in patients also suffering
      from hypertension or tachycardia. Following recent studies, topiramate has become
      a first choice for episodic as well as chronic migraine. It is the only
      prophylactic drug that may lead to weight loss, but it is sometimes associated
      with adverse cognitive effects. Valproic acid and flunarizine also have very good
      prophylactic properties. However, valproic acid is often associated with adverse 
      effects, and flunarizine is unavailable in many countries, including the United
      States. If sequential monotherapies are ineffective, combinations of first-line
      drugs should be tried before advancing to drugs of second choice, which are
      associated with more adverse effects or have less well-established prophylactic
      properties. Amitriptyline should be used carefully because of its anticholinergic
      effects, although it is useful in comorbid tension-type headache, depression, and
      sleep disorders. Methysergide is very effective, but it has been supplanted or
      even made unavailable in many countries because of its well-described association
      with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Pizotifen has a slightly better safety profile but
      is unavailable in the United States. Aspirin is particularly useful in patients
      needing platelet inhibitors for other medical conditions, but the risk of
      gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered. The prophylactic properties of
      magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10 are low at best, but their lack of severe
      adverse effects makes them good treatment options. Magnesium may be particularly 
      useful during pregnancy. Lisinopril and candesartan were shown to be effective in
      single trials and are preferable in patients with hypertension. Acupuncture may
      be another alternative; although controlled trials have failed to differentiate
      its effect from placebo, it is at least innocuous. Botulinum toxin A is not
      effective in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine.

AB  - The health of future generations, both physical and psychological, depends upon
      good parental and early environment, free particularly from malnutrition, toxins 
      and undue stress. Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially
      to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental 
      effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in
      Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a
      household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from
      smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near
      him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of
      beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth.
      Alcohol in early in the pregnancy--just when many mothers are unaware they are
      pregnant--an produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face.
      Prenatal exposure to alcohol has signilfcant effects on the intelligence and
      behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight
      amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a
      negative self-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic
      Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning
      Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the
      area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the
      Borderline Personality Disorder. Undue stress of any kind during the pregnancy
      leads to problems for the developing child.

PG  - 366-70
LID - 10.1002/ppul.20778 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate psychological aspects of
      childhood asthma and the connections between the illness and behavioral
      disturbances in asthmatic children. STUDY DESIGN: We selected a group of 47
      asthmatic children and a control group of 47 healthy children. The only criterion
      for inclusion was that the children be between 4 and 10 years of age; criteria
      for exclusion were neurological pathologies, cognitive retardation, and serious
      or chronic systemic disease. The collaboration of a psychologist and a
      comparative examination of questionnaires used in medical literature helped us
      prepare a calibrated questionnaire for our study. RESULTS: In our study, the
      asthmatic children show significantly more behavioral and psychological
      disturbances than the children in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      group of asthmatic children the boys and the children whose illness has lasted
      less than 4 years, are at greater risk of such disturbances; stressful situations
      connected to the birth or previous pregnancies can be seen more often in the
      group of asthmatic children than in the control group; before the onset of the
      illness the asthmatic children had significant sleep disturbances.

TI  - Access and barriers to measures targeted to prevent malaria in pregnancy in rural
      Kenya.
PG  - 208-17
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01992.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using
      insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with 
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria 
      strategy promoting these measures in Kenya. METHODS: All women aged 15-49 years
      were interviewed during a community survey in four districts between December
      2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about
      their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and
      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead
      assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC
      clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors 
      of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 
      Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC
      clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at
      least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the
      least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR 
      = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT
      were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more
      than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use
      ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR:
      1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP.
      CONCLUSION: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT
      fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in
      the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by
      community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux episodes in asthmatic patients and their temporal
      relation with sleep architecture.
PG  - 152-8
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in asthma patients and can contribute to 
      sleep disruption. The aim of the present study was to determine the time-related 
      distribution of GER events together with their impact on sleep in asthmatic
      subjects with GER disease symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years,
      controlled moderate to severe asthma and GER-compatible clinical evidence. The
      exclusion criteria were: chronic obstructive lung disease, smoking, infections of
      the upper airways, use of oral corticosteroids, other co-morbidities, pregnancy, 
      sleep-related disorders, night-time shift work, and the use of substances with
      impact on sleep. Asthmatic patients with nocturnal symptoms were excluded.
      All-night polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring were recorded
      simultaneously. Of the 147 subjects selected, 31 patients and 31 controls were
      included. Seventeen patients were classified as DeMeester positive and 14 as
      DeMeester negative. Both groups displayed similar outcomes when general variables
      were considered. Sleep stage modification one minute prior to GER was observed in
      the DeMeester-positive group. Awakening was the most frequent occurrence at GER
      onset and during the 1-min period preceding 38% of the nocturnal GER. Sleep stage
      2 was also prevalent and preceded 36% of GER events. In the DeMeester-negative
      group, awakening was the most frequent response before and during GER.
      Modifications in sleep stages, arousals or awakenings were associated with 75% of
      the total GER events analyzed during the period of one minute before and after
      the fall of esophageal pH below 4 in the DeMeester-positive group. These data
      provide evidence that sleep modifications precede the GER events in asthmatic
      patients.

TI  - The effect of circadian rhythm changes on fetal and placental development
      (experimental study).
PG  - 87-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of circadian rhythm changes on
      fetal-placental development in pregnant rats. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Pregnant rats 
      were randomly allocated to 4 groups with 10 rats in each group. Group 1: 12 hours
      light 12 hours dark period (n:10, Control Group); Group 2: 6 hours light 6 hours 
      dark period (n:10); Group 3: constant light group (n:10); Group 4: constant dark 
      group (n:10). Rats were made to deliver by cesarean birth at the end of their
      pregnancy and their placenta, number and weight of the offspring, and placental
      histopathological changes were examined. FINDING: Fetal number in the constant
      dark group was found significant in comparison to constant light group (p<0.01). 
      Fetal weight in all groups with altered circadian rhythm was significantly lower 
      than that in the control group (p<0.01). The decrease in fetal weight was more
      evident in the constant light group than in the constant dark group (p<0.01).
      Comparison of the histopathological findings of the placenta showed that
      placental edema, fibrin accumulation and leukocyte infiltration were
      significantly higher in constant light and constant dark groups than in other
      groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Circadian rhythm change in pregnancy adversely
      affects the fetal-placental development. More detailed studies are needed to
      clarify this mechanism.

TI  - Depression symptoms during pregnancy.
PG  - 43-8
LID - 10.1007/s00737-008-0216-1 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as
      energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is
      not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different
      from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of
      symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women
      with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall
      depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early
      insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity 
      of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected
      on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the
      severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in
      the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for
      psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression
      symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of
      depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological
      symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be
      dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.

TI  - A change in life as experienced by first-time fathers.
PG  - 64-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2007.00585.x [doi]
AB  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and
      child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused
      mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers'
      experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant 
      comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews
      were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category
      consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and
      home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with
      their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become
      responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they
      could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same 
      extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the
      mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and
      home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards
      breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made
      them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it 
      was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united
      relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in
      increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child
      implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers
      are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and
      development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about
      first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may
      bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.

TI  - Treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin.
PG  - 1712-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about
      treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. METHODS: The
      task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant
      literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper
      discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding
      treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of
      these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of
      evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice
      Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. RESULTS: The majority of
      recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium 
      oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large
      randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate
      are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no
      studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus
      traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated
      initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or 
      to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional
      stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate
      improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients
      with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate 
      that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with
      narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness
      of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our
      findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment
      of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or
      breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of
      information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment,
      patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance.
      CONCLUSION: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium
      oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies 
      were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with
      traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the
      pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full 
      and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward
      development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary
      prevention.

TI  - Adverse health effects related to tobacco smoke exposure in a cohort of
      three-year olds.
PG  - 354-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00619.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To analyse the importance of mothers' smoking during pregnancy and/or
      environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in early childhood for children's
      health and well-being at the age of 3 years. METHODS: Four groups from a
      population based cohort (n=8850) were compared: children with nonsmoking mother
      during pregnancy and nonsmoking parents at the age of 3 years (n=7091); children 
      with only foetal exposure (n=149); children exposed only postnatally (n=895) and 
      children exposed both pre- and postnatally (n=595). Odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Children exposed both pre- and
      postnatally had more wheezing (1.14; 1.07-1.21) and rhinitis (1.16; 1.06-1.26),
      used more cough-mixture (1.07; 1.01-1.14) and broncodilatating drugs (1.08;
      1.02-1.15) and suffered more from excessive crying (1.31; 1.13-1.51) and
      irritability (1.27; 1.09-1.48) compared to children with nonsmoking parents.
      Children exposed only postnatally had more rhinitis (1.24; 1.12-1.37), used more 
      cough-mixture (1.14; 1.05-1.29) and suffered more from poor sleep (1.26;
      1.07-1.47) than children of nonsmoking parents. Children with prenatal exposure
      only used more broncodilatating drugs (1.45; 1.03-2.04) and suffered more from
      poor sleep (2.06; 1.09-3.87). CONCLUSION: Health differences, small but
      significant, indicate that prenatal and/or postnatal ETS exposure alone, or in
      combination, seems to interfere with child health, supporting the importance of
      zero tolerance. However, as most smoking parents in Sweden try to protect their
      children from ETS exposure, the results also might indicate that protective
      measures are worthwhile.

PG  - 522-4
LID - 10.1097/01.AOG.0000280587.02443.75 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutaric aciduria type II is a rare disorder affecting the metabolism
      of fatty acid oxidation and several mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes.
      Narcolepsy and cataplexy is a disorder affecting sleep cycles and rapid eye
      movement activity. There is little information on outcome or management for
      either disorder in pregnancy. CASE: This is a case of a 16-year-old with glutaric
      aciduria type II and narcolepsy with cataplexy, treated with L-carnitine,
      riboflavin, fluoxetine, and modafinil during pregnancy. Intrapartum management
      included intravenous carnitine administration, and the patient underwent cesarean
      delivery at term without complication. CONCLUSION: This inborn error of
      metabolism and sleep disorder can be effectively treated during pregnancy with
      nutritional supplementation and stimulants. Because of the risk of cataplexy
      during labor, cesarean delivery is recommended to minimize the patient's risk.

TI  - Periconceptional folic acid use and the prevalence of positional plagiocephaly.
PG  - 37-9
LID - 10.1097/scs.0b013e31815c8a87 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of positional plagiocephaly (PP) has increased during the last 2
      decades in the Netherlands. Although this is generally solely attributed to the
      advice to put babies on the back during their sleep, other factors might be of
      influence. Because the advice to take folic acid (FA) was initiated in the same
      period as the sleeping advice, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect
      of FA on PP. It is known that a daily intake of 400 microg of FA around the time 
      of conception is advised in periconceptive women to prevent development of neural
      tube defects. The maximal daily dietary folate intake is considered to be 250 mg 
      with a bioavailability of 50% to 70%. However, periconceptional women may take a 
      multivitamin containing pteroylmonoglutamine in addition to a FA supplement
      (isolated pteroylmonoglutamine). Therefore, the daily intake of FA will exceed 1 
      mg daily, which is considered the upper limit of daily folate ingestion. Data
      from the "Maastricht Cohort and Intervention study about pregnancy related
      girdlepain" were used to study the amount of folate containing supplemental
      intake of all the 7526 women. In this study, women were prospectively questioned 
      about their FA intake. The entire cohort, considered the control group, was
      compared with a subgroup of women within this cohort with children with PP,
      treated by a plastic surgeon, considered the PP group. Double use, defined as
      isolated FA preparations in addition to folate containing supplements (vitamins),
      was seen more frequently in women giving birth to children with PP. In the PP
      group, double use was seen in 33.3% of the women compared to 13.2% in the control
      group. Although no statistical analysis could be made because the PP group was
      too small, the use of too high dosages of FA might have an adverse effect in
      causing more PP. This article does not want to discuss the beneficial effect of
      FA during pregnancy. However, we observed a potential empirical relation between 
      PP and FA double intake requiring attention in more extensive studies.

TI  - Association of maternal lifestyles including smoking during pregnancy with
      childhood obesity.
PG  - 3133-9
LID - 10.1038/oby.2007.373 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which maternal smoking during early pregnancy
      and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits are associated with obesity and
      overweight in 5-year-old Japanese children. RESEARCH METHOD AND PROCEDURES: We
      studied 1417 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Enzan--a prospective cohort
      study. The dependent variables, childhood overweight and obesity, were defined
      with an international cut-off value. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy and 
      other prepregnancy lifestyle habits were used as independent variables. RESULTS: 
      Maternal smoking habits were associated with overweight in the 5-year-old
      children [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to
      4.11]. Maternal sleep duration of >or=8 h/d negatively affected childhood
      overweight (adjusted OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.04). Children whose mothers
      skipped breakfast were likely to become overweight (adjusted OR: 1.78; 95% CI:
      1.14 to 2.77). The results of childhood obesity analysis were similar to those of
      childhood overweight analysis. DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest that
      there are effects of smoking during early pregnancy and other maternal lifestyle 
      habits on the onset of childhood obesity in Japan. Therefore, interventions in
      maternal lifestyle habits are required to prevent childhood obesity, and these
      interventions should be initiated before pregnancy.

TI  - Basic knowledge of epilepsy among medical students.
PG  - 2271-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The medical students' knowledge about basic medical neuroscience in
      the preclinical level may be fragmented and incomplete. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the
      knowledge of students prior to a lecture on epilepsy in clinical level. MATERIAL 
      AND METHOD: One hundred ten fourth-year medical students' knowledge was accessed 
      by a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The presented results revealed
      that 91.8% of respondents knew that epilepsy arose from a transient dysfunction
      in the brain. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs) were the most common type 
      (91.5%) they knew and absence seizures were the least common type (33.6%) they
      knew. All of them knew that eating pork and punishment of gods did not cause
      epilepsy. However 50% thought that genetics was a cause and 80.3% did not know
      that stroke and sleep deprivation (92.7%) cause epilepsy. About treatment and
      prognosis, only 28.2% of respondents thought epilepsy can be cured and patients
      should take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure free 2-5 years (48.2%), life
      long (33.6%). They knew that the patients should be prohibited from driving
      (80%), working on machinery (74.5%), and (27.3%) avoid drinking. However, they
      knew that the patients could marry (100%), get pregnant (98.2%), and lactate
      (91.9%). Regarding the first aid management, 50.9% of them recommended that
      placing a piece of wood between the teeth during a seizure and perform chest
      compressions (20.0%). Means knowledge scores is about 60%, the highest score is
      the definition of epilepsy (90.2%) and the lowest is type of seizure (43%).
      CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that lecturers should review aspects
      ofpathophysiology and emphasize on type of seizure, cause, consequences, and
      prognosis including first-aid management.

TI  - Measurement of pruritus in a Chinese woman with pemphigoid gestationis using a
      wrist movement detector.

AB  - Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare itching bullous disease of pregnancy and
      the postpartum period. We describe the use of a new methodology for measuring the
      nature and intensity of itching in a 21-year-old woman with pemphigoid
      gestationis. At 19 weeks gestation, she developed an itchy rash over the limbs,
      which spread to the trunk. Blisters then appeared on the hands which subsequently
      also involved the feet. Intense nocturnal wrist activities in this patient,
      measured with a wrist monitor and defined as average acceleration in the early
      hours of sleep, were even higher than that in patients with severe eczema, with
      an average value of 181.00 +/- 43.49 (mean +/- standard error) g/min for the
      first three hours, versus 84.47 +/- 8.53 g/min for the group of 24 eczema
      subjects. Most wrist activities were slower movements at 0 to 1 Hz. This is in
      striking contrast to the scratching activities at 0 to 3 Hz in eczema subjects.
      There have been no therapeutic trials for PG. Topical steroid and oral
      antihistamines are usually ineffective, but worked in our patient. We also
      discuss the potential application of the monitor in assessing the nature of
      various dermatological or systemic itching disorders.

TI  - Neurophysiologic measurement of continuity in the sleep of fetuses during the
      last week of pregnancy and in newborns.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - Our aim was to measure the correlation between fetal electrocardiographic (FECG) 
      recordings of low-risk pregnancies and polysomnographic (PSG) study parameters in
      low-risk infants born at term as a measurement of perinatal sleep-development
      continuity. We designed a short, prospective, observational follow-up of
      physiologic parameters between fetuses and newborns. We studied 10 fetuses from
      low-risk pregnant female out-patients and the same subjects as low-risk newborns 
      delivered at term. Fetal state (FS) was defined in FECG recordings reassembling
      the following: fetal state I (quiet sleep or QS); fetal state II (active sleep or
      AS); fetal state III (quiet waking), and fetal state IV (active waking).
      Percentages of AS, QS, and wakefulness in PSG studies of newborns were also
      determined. Comparisons of FS I with QS showed a significant reduction in QS,
      while comparison of FS II with AS showed significant reduction in AS. Negative
      correlations were found between FS I with QS, and FS II with AS. Number of cycles
      in FECG recordings and PSG sleep cycles also demonstrated significant
      correlation. In conclusion our data showed partial but significant sleep function
      continuity from fetal to neonatal period.

AB  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India
      more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary
      health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique
      concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, 
      from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are
      utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as
      Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the
      physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are
      encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including
      chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in
      this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, 
      diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These
      preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting
      larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares
      Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an
      integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed 
      light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the
      patient.

TI  - Epigenetic programming of the stress response in male and female rats by prenatal
      restraint stress.
PG  - 571-85
LID - 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.11.004 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed
      at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the
      stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive 
      responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the
      organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have
      strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to
      stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS),
      these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response
      associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion.
      Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA
      dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus
      suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to
      an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted
      corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an
      alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS 
      also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high
      anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some
      studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing,
      male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent
      tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood.
      The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal
      plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the
      permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS
      can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as
      environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments.
      Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown.
      However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during 
      pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male
      offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis
      and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also
      make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic
      mechanisms.

AB  - Course and outcome of 200 pregnancies, deliveries and post-partum periods of 127 
      women with the onset of epilepsy before or during pregnancy were compared to
      clinical form of the disease, frequency of seizures and antiepileptic therapy. In
      addition, 104 children born to 97 mothers with epilepsy, 85 children--from the
      moment of birth to 1 year old and others from 1 to 16 years old, were studied.
      The particular attention was focused on the early neonatal adaptation. It was
      shown that, along with the last weeks of pregnancy, the first 7 days period after
      the delivery was critical for epilepsy severity. The development of seizures at
      this period was related to sleep deprivation and marked hormonal changes. There
      were no significant changes between the body mass of newborns of mothers with
      epilepsy and those of healthy mothers. The period of neonatal adaptation in
      children of affected mothers was favorable in 46% of cases. Some peculiarities of
      a child's state (withdrawal syndrome, hepatitis A etc.) were mostly related to
      the treatment of a mother with high dosages of antiepileptic preparations, i.e.
      valproic acid. These disturbances vanished to the age of 1-3 years. In summary,
      the active supervision of women by an epileptologist during the pregnancy period 
      allows to optimize the prognosis of the child's health and better course of
      epilepsy in the mother.

TI  - Seizure control and pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs in pregnant women
      with epilepsy.
PG  - 160-5
AB  - The main concerns associated with epilepsy during pregnancy consist of maternal
      and fetal risks from uncontrolled seizures, and harmful effects of the treatment 
      on the development of the offspring. Although seizure control is maintained in
      the majority, worsening occurs in a fraction of childbearing women with epilepsy.
      As multiple factors associated with pregnancy may have a negative impact on
      epilepsy, a careful analysis of the situation should be performed in those who
      deteriorate. Emotional and behavioural influence, including insufficient sleep
      and treatment non-compliance, as well as physical factors, such as emesis and
      pelvic distortion, should receive attention. The serum concentrations of almost
      all antiepileptic drugs decrease during pregnancy, particularly those which are
      metabolised by glucuronidation. The inter-individual variability is pronounced.
      In highly protein-bound drugs, such as phenytoin and valproate, unbound drug is
      less affected than total concentrations. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam
      concentrations may decrease by more than 50% in the course of pregnancy;
      monohydroxyoxcarbazepine by up to 30-40%. Appropriate clinical follow-up tailored
      to individual needs and supported by therapeutic drug monitoring should be
      performed in pregnant women with epilepsy. Education concerning reproductive
      issues is an essential part of the epilepsy service to fertile women.

TI  - Laryngeal stimulation by an acid solution in the pre-term lamb.
PG  - 154-8
AB  - In a mature organism, the contact between various liquids and the laryngeal
      mucosa triggers lower airway protective responses (cough, swallowing, arousal).
      These laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are essential for preventing aspiration. In
      contrast, previous studies showed that LCR are responsible for apnea and
      bradycardia in the neonatal mammal. Consequently, LCR, especially when triggered 
      by acid gastrolaryngeal reflux, are deemed responsible for some apneas of
      prematurity and many life-threatening events of infancy and, probably, for some
      cases of sudden infant death syndrome. Recently, we have revisited LCR in
      full-term lambs during quiet sleep. Our results showed that the LCR triggered by 
      HCl (pH 2), mimicking the acid component of an acid gastro-oesophageal reflux,
      were consistently like the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without
      significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire 2005). These results prompted us 
      to question whether premature birth alters LCR. Results show that LCR triggered
      in pre-term lambs by both saline and HCl are much more marked and clinically
      relevant than the ones observed in full-term lambs. Indeed, life-threatening
      responses to HCl, including repetitive apneas for more than 90 seconds, severe
      desaturation and bradycardia, were observed in 2 lambs at postnatal day 7 (D7).
      In addition, LCR were significantly blunted at D14. In conclusion, HCl can
      trigger potentially dangerous LCR in pre-term lambs at D7, suggesting that LCR in
      response to acid gastrolaryngeal refluxes are likely involved in some
      apnea/bradycardia/desaturation in pre-term infants, before they reach a
      post-conceptional age equivalent to full gestation.

TI  - [Epidemiology of sleep disturbances].
PG  - 25-33
AB  - Epidemiological studies indicate that sleep disturbances in general population
      are highly frequent. It is estimated that approximately 40 million people in the 
      USA has some kind of problem with sleep. The most frequent sleep complaint is
      insomnia whose prevalence is around 50% some time in the life. Only a small part 
      of this population refer their sleep problems to the medical doctor with the
      consequence that only a minority is adequately diagnosed and treated. Sleep
      problems may appear at any age, and the epidemiological studies indicate the
      increase of specific prevalence with advancing age, with a special increase in
      the adults. It is estimated that the prevalence of sleep problems in childhood
      and adolescence is present in 25-40%. Some of the problems are more frequent in
      the female population, although not as a rule. The best example for this is the
      observed prevalence of sleep apnea which is present in 24% of male and only 9% of
      female population. Sleep problems are often associated with other diseases such
      as psychiatric or kidney diseases (patients on hemodialysis). However, their
      frequency may increase in physiologic conditions such as pregnancy. Overall
      characteristic of sleep diseases is that they may compromise daily functioning by
      causing deficits in memory, decrease in concentration, depressive mood,
      irritability, decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, having as a consequence
      decrease in the quality of life.

TI  - Polycystic ovary syndrome: a common reproductive and metabolic disorder
      necessitating early recognition and treatment.
PG  - 761-89, vi
AB  - Patients who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present with infertility,
      recurrent miscarriages, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and acne. Many also 
      have metabolic and hormonal abnormalities that can significantly increase risk
      for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and endometrial carcinoma.
      PCOS patients should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea. Early recognition
      may reverse physical signs of the disease, while correcting the metabolic
      abnormalities that can pose significant health risk if untreated. Although
      lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy are used to treat PCOS, there are few 
      long-term outcome data regarding benefits of metabolic interventional strategies.
      Insulin sensitizers can improve ovulatory function, lower insulin resistance,
      lower androgen levels, and increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Further 
      studies should yield other treatment options.

TI  - Chronic prenatal depression and neonatal outcome.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited at approximately 22 weeks
      gestation at prenatal clinics. Of these, 86 (20%) were diagnosed as depressed.
      The women were seen again at approximately 32 weeks gestation and after delivery.
      Chronicity of depression was evidenced by continuing high depression scores in
      those women diagnosed as depressed. Comorbid problems were chronically high
      anxiety, anger, sleep disturbance, and pain scores. Less optimal outcomes for the
      depressed women included lower gestational age and lower birthweight of their
      newborns.

TI  - Intra-household mosquito net use in Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, and 
      Zambia: are nets being used? Who in the household uses them?
PG  - 963-71
AB  - Mosquito net ownership is rising in sub-Saharan Africa but will substantially
      reduce malaria only if nets are used and the most vulnerable household members
      sleep under them. We used data from 9 large-scale household surveys conducted in 
      6 African countries from 2000 to 2004 that enumerated all household members and
      nets owned, analyzing only net-owning households. Across countries, women of
      reproductive age and children under 5 (without gender bias) were most likely to
      use the net; least likely were children of age 5-14 and adult males. Nets
      commonly covered 2-3 people. If a baby net was used, fewer people used the family
      net. Pregnant women were more likely to use a net in 2004 than in 2000. In
      several countries, a sizable minority of nets owned were not used. Understanding 
      intra-household net-use patterns helps malaria control programs more effectively 
      direct their efforts to increase their public health impact.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy and fetal outcome.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously investigate the polysomnography (PSG) and nonstress 
      test (NST) records of pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to
      observe NST changes during maternal desaturation and determine maternal and fetal
      outcomes. METHODS: A prospective observational study of pregnant women assessed
      by questionnaire for symptoms of OSA. Women with self-reported frequent snoring
      or apnea were offered PSG and NST. RESULT: OSA was diagnosed in 4 (11.4%) of the 
      35 pregnant women who underwent PSG. Three (75%) had fetal heart decelerations
      accompanying maternal desaturation. The neonates of women diagnosed with OSA had 
      lower mean Apgar scores and birth weights compared with neonates of women without
      OSA. Three neonates from the women diagnosed with OSA were admitted to the
      newborn healthcare unit. CONCLUSION: OSA in pregnancy has important maternal and 
      fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be assessed for symptoms of OSA and
      suspected cases should be offered PSG.

TI  - Association of fewer hours of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial
      weight retention at 1 year postpartum.
PG  - 178-87
AB  - Shorter sleep duration is linked to obesity, coronary artery disease, and
      diabetes. Whether sleep deprivation during the postpartum period affects maternal
      postpartum weight retention remains unknown. This study examined the association 
      of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial postpartum weight retention
      (SPPWR), defined as 5 kg or more above pregravid weight at 1 year postpartum. The
      authors selected 940 participants in Project Viva who enrolled during early
      pregnancy from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios of 
      SPPWR for sleep categories, controlling for sociodemographic, prenatal, and
      behavioral attributes. Of the 940 women, 124 (13%) developed SPPWR. Sleep
      distributions were as follows: 114 (12%) women slept < or =5 hours/day, 280 (30%)
      slept 6 hours/day, 321 (34%) slept 7 hours/day, and 225 (24%) slept > or =8
      hours/day. Adjusted odds ratios of SPPWR were 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI):
      1.42, 6.94) for < or =5 hours/day, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) for 6 hours/day, and
      0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) for > or =8 hours/day versus 7 hours/day (p = 0.012).
      The adjusted odds ratio for SPPWR of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.78) was twofold
      greater (p = 0.02) for a decrease in versus no change in sleep at 1 year
      postpartum. Sleeping < or =5 hours/day at 6 months postpartum was strongly
      associated with retaining > or =5 kg at 1 year postpartum. Interventions to
      prevent postpartum obesity should consider strategies to attain optimal maternal 
      sleep duration.

TI  - Evolving applications of light therapy.
PG  - 497-507
AB  - The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year
      research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies
      have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to
      placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A
      persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility
      for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting
      capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are
      at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light
      treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression,
      including drug- and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light
      therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to
      medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been
      noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in
      Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of
      light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been
      partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major
      chronotherapeutic inventions-light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and 
      sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap 
      hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain long-term improvement.

TI  - Circadian clocks during embryonic and fetal development.
PG  - 204-14
AB  - Circadian rhythmicity is a fundamental characteristic of organisms, which helps
      ensure that vital functions occur in an appropriate and precise temporal sequence
      and in accordance with cyclic environmental changes. Living beings are endowed
      with a system of biological clocks that measure time on a 24-hr basis, termed the
      circadian timing system. In mammals, the system is organized as a master clock
      located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, commanding
      peripheral clocks located in almost every tissue of the body. At the cell level, 
      interlocking transcription/translation feedback loops of the genes Bmal-1, Clock,
      Per1-2, and Cry1-2, named clock genes, and their protein products results in
      circadian oscillation of clock genes and of genes involved in almost every
      cellular function. During gestation, the conceptus follows a complex and dynamic 
      program by which it is simultaneously fit to develop and live in a circadian
      environment provided by its mother and to prepare for the very different
      environment that it will experience after birth. It has been known for a number
      of years that the mother tells the fetus the time of day and season of the year, 
      and that the fetus uses this information to set the phase of fetal and neonatal
      circadian rhythms. There is evidence that the maternal rhythm of melatonin is one
      of the time signals to the fetus. In the last few years, the study of the
      development of the circadian system has turned to the investigation of the
      oscillatory expression of clock genes and their possible role in development, and
      to answering questions on the organization of the fetal circadian system.
      Emerging evidence shows that clock genes are expressed in the oocyte and during
      early and late development in embryo/fetal organs in the rat and in a fetal
      primate. The data available raise the intriguing possibility that the fetal SCN
      and fetal tissues may be peripheral clocks commanded by separate maternal
      signals. The rapid methodological and conceptual advances on chronobiology may
      help to unravel how the developing embryo and fetus faces time in this plastic
      period of life.

TI  - Sleep disturbances increase interleukin-6 production during pregnancy:
      implications for pregnancy complications.
PG  - 560-7
AB  - Pregnant women experience disturbed sleep that varies throughout the gestational 
      period. In clinical studies of nonpregnant cohorts, data link disturbed sleep
      with increases in inflammatory markers. Emerging evidence has also found
      associations between increased inflammation and medical morbidity, including
      various pregnancy complications. The authors have previously shown a correlation 
      between sleep disturbances and serum cytokine levels. They extend this initial
      observation by evaluating the relationship between sleep during mid and late
      pregnancy and inflammatory cytokines in both serum and stimulated peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells. Subjective sleep during pregnancy, described by the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep diaries, and circulating and stimulated 
      measures of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were
      evaluated in 19 pregnant women. The authors found that greater sleep complaints
      in late pregnancy were associated with both increased circulating and stimulated 
      IL-6 levels. Short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency in both mid and late 
      pregnancy were associated with higher stimulated levels of IL-6. No relationships
      were observed for TNF-alpha. These preliminary findings indicate that women who
      experience sleep disturbances as early as mid gestation are likely to have an
      increase in inflammation.

TI  - [Restless legs syndrome].
PG  - 39-54
AB  - About 7% of the population are affected by the restless legs syndrome (RLS). The 
      most invalidating subjective complaints are dysesthesia / pain / an urge to move 
      the legs (46%), an alteration of sleep (38%), and difficulties in performing
      activities of daily life (7%). The onset of the disease is variable, ranging from
      childhood (often unrecognised) to old age. The clinical course is generally
      chronic with phases of spontaneous remission. The cause of RLS is probably mainly
      genetic with a dysfunction of iron and dopamine metabolism accentuated by
      peripheral factors (neuropathy, radiculopathy, and temperature). There are
      secondary forms of RLS, such as iron deficiency (under debate), side effects of
      drugs (that can be stopped), renal insufficiency, radiculopathy, and neuropathy. 
      RLS can come up during pregnancy, in particular in the last trimenon. Treatment
      of aggravating factors and sleep hygiene are general measures. Drug treatment of 
      the RLS comprises levodopa, dopaminergic drugs, opioids, and antiepileptic drugs;
      however, drug treatment is only necessary in about a third of the affected.

TI  - Time-variant analysis of nonlinear stability and bispectral measures to quantify 
      the development of fetal sleep states.
PG  - 1454-7
AB  - A combined time-variant analysis of nonlinear stability and parametric bispectral
      measures was applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep
      between 0.7 and 0.9 gestation to examine the maturation of sleep states and
      synchronization patterns of the ECoG. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the
      fetal ECoG occurred already at 0.7 gestation and suggests the presence of
      premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant
      biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature NREM
      sleep. Maturation of NREM sleep begun at 0.78 gestation and preceded that of REM 
      sleep that begun at 0.85 gestation. Our results suggest that maturation of brain 
      stem and thalamic function precedes that of cortical function.

TI  - Increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers and upper airway resistance
      during sleep in pre-eclampsia.
PG  - 667-74
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate pregnancy-associated sleep disorders, pregnancy outcomes 
      and inflammatory markers in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy (control).
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 15 consecutive pre-eclamptic women and 14
      controls. Pre-eclamptic women underwent overnight pulse oximetry and nasal
      pressure measurements at a university teaching hospital, and the sleep study for 
      the controls was performed at home. Mean gestation was 31 weeks. Nasal airflow
      was carefully analyzed visually, and the time with flow limitation was calculated
      as a percentage of total recording time. At the time of the sleep study, the
      subjects were clinically evaluated, they answered sleep questionnaires, and
      fasting blood samples were drawn for tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-alpha,
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) and sensitive C-reactive protein. Pregnancy outcomes were
      collected after delivery. RESULTS: Pre-eclampsia patients spent significantly
      more time with flow limitation (mean+/-SD: 21+/-18% vs. 4+/-9%), had higher
      plasma levels of TNF-alpha (6.2+/-2.3 ng/l vs. 4.1+/-ng/l) and IL-6 (4.4+/-ng/l
      vs. 1.2+/-0.4 ng/l), had more generalized edema, had increased fatigue and
      snoring, and had poorer pregnancy outcomes than did controls. Age, gestational
      age, mean SpO2 and body mass index did not differ between the groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia showed significantly more nasal
      flow limitation during the night, higher fasting IL-6 and TNF-alpha plasma
      levels, more edema and worse pregnancy outcomes than did healthy pregnant women.

TI  - Dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum women.
PG  - 1162-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated
      behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious 
      dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex
      behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). DESIGN: Three-group
      design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. 
      SETTING: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in
      hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null
      gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by
      telephone. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum:
      n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 +/- 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas);
      pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 +/- 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age
      = 28.5 +/- 6.34 years). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed questionnaires about
      pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in
      interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares,
      associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors.
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%).
      Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal
      prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and
      the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P <
      0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported
      dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null
      gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the
      behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%)
      as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing
      emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%)
      (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally 
      prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with
      nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety
      (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and
      multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of
      dream-associated behaviors. CONCLUSION: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and
      postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive
      emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep
      disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

      Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated
      in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey.
      PARTICIPANTS: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and
      2006, respectively. INTERVENTION: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Pregnant women
      exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as
      subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep
      duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had 
      the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and
      early morning awakening. The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance
      (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration,
      excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among
      nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate
      between that of active smokers and that of nonsmokers without environmental
      tobacco smoke. CONCLUSION: Passive smoking is independently associated with
      increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy.

TI  - Very low birth weight increases risk for sleep-disordered breathing in young
      adulthood: the Helsinki Study of Very Low Birth Weight Adults.
PG  - 778-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) is associated 
      with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood. METHODS: The
      study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very
      low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The
      principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic
      snoring. RESULTS: The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both
      groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control
      group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate
      logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education,
      height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the
      very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition,
      maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low
      birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal
      preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, 
      small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of 
      sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during 
      pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold.

TI  - Acupuncture for mild to moderate emotional complaints in pregnancy--a
      prospective, quasi-randomised, controlled study.
PG  - 65-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of acupuncture
      under real life conditions, in the treatment of emotional complaints during
      pregnancy. METHODS: A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with
      counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two
      groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study
      group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as
      anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms
      using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the
      symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships,
      social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was
      used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four 
      points were permitted as optional points. RESULTS: Three women from the
      acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over 
      the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by 
      at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of 
      those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of 
      the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when
      compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Emotional complaints are
      very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study,
      acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving
      the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large
      randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.

TI  - Neurosteroids in the fetus and neonate: potential protective role in compromised 
      pregnancies.
PG  - 602-10
AB  - Complications during pregnancy and birth asphyxia lead to brain injury, with
      devastating consequences for the neonate. In this paper we present evidence that 
      the steroid environment during pregnancy and at birth aids in protecting the
      fetus and neonate from asphyxia-induced injury. Earlier studies show that the
      placental progesterone production has a role in the synthesis and release of
      neuroactive steroids or their precursors into the fetal circulation. Placental
      precursor support leads to remarkably high concentrations of allopregnanolone in 
      the fetal brain and to a dramatic decline with the loss of the placenta at birth.
      These elevated concentrations influence the distinct behavioral states displayed 
      by the late gestation fetus and exert a suppressive effect that maintains
      sleep-like behavioral states that are present for much of fetal life. This
      suppression reduces CNS excitability and suppresses excitotoxicity. With the
      availability of adequate precursors, mechanisms within the fetal brain ultimately
      control neurosteroid levels. These mechanisms respond to episodes of acute
      hypoxia by increasing expression of 5alpha-reductase and P450scc enzymes and
      allopregnanolone synthesis in the brain. This allopregnanolone response, and
      potentially that of other neurosteroids including
      5alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (TH-DOC), reduces hippocampal cell death
      following acute asphyxia and suggests that stimulation of neurosteroid production
      may protect the fetal brain. Importantly, inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis in
      the fetal brain increases the basal cell death suggesting a role in controlling
      developmental processes late in gestation. Synthesis of neurosteroid precursors
      in the fetal adrenal such as deoxycorticosterone (DOC), and their conversion to
      active neurosteroids in the fetal brain may also have a role in neuroprotection. 
      This suggests that the adrenal glands provide precursor DOC for neurosteroid
      synthesis after birth and this may lead to a switch from allopregnanolone alone
      to neuroprotection mediated by allopregnanolone and TH-DOC.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome: demographics, presentation, and differential diagnosis.
PG  - 26-9
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a
      distressing urge to move the legs and sometimes other parts of the body.
      Diagnosis is based on clinical features that may be easily remembered with the
      mnemonic URGE: Urge to move, Rest induced, Gets better with activity, and Evening
      and night accentuation. RLS is common, its prevalence increases with age, and
      women are more frequently affected. The course is chronic with often severe sleep
      disruption, including periodic leg movements. Differential diagnosis includes
      disorders of restlessness and leg discomfort. Primary RLS is familial and likely 
      to be genetic. Important causes of secondary RLS are end-stage renal disease,
      pregnancy, and iron deficiency. Every patient should be checked for iron status
      with a serum ferritin measurement.

TI  - Self-reported snoring, maternal obesity and neck circumference as risk factors
      for pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy alter breathing
      patterns of pregnant women. It is possible that occult disordered breathing
      during sleep may be a risk factor for the development of pregnancy-induced
      hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the
      incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant women, and to investigate the
      relationship of snoring, obesity and neck circumference to PIH and preeclampsia. 
      METHODS: 469 pregnant women and 208 age-matched nonpregnant women were included
      in the study. Both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire. Maternal
      complications were retrieved from the medical records. RESULTS: Habitual snoring 
      was reported from 1.9% of nonpregnant women, 2.5% of pregnant women prior to
      pregnancy and 11.9% of those same women during the third trimester of pregnancy
      (p < 0.001). Age, smoking during pregnancy, and weight before delivery were
      independent risk factors for habitual snoring in pregnancy. PIH and preeclampsia 
      developed in 20 and 10.9% of pregnant women with habitual snoring, as compared to
      11 and 5.8% of non-snoring pregnant women (p = 0.045, p = 0.125, p = 0.415),
      respectively. In women who developed preeclampsia, weight before pregnancy,
      weight before delivery and neck circumference were significantly higher in
      univariate analysis. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for PIH
      and preeclampsia according to logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The
      incidence of snoring is significantly higher in pregnant women than in
      nonpregnant women. Snoring may indicate a risk of PIH. Neck circumference was an 
      independent risk factor for both PIH and preeclampsia.

TI  - The influence of maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy on infant lung 
      function.
PG  - 945-51
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We studied whether maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy
      adversely influence lung growth and development of the offspring, resulting in
      poor early life lung function. METHODS: Infants were participants of the Wheezing
      Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER). Lung function measurements (single
      occlusion technique) were performed during natural sleep. Questionnaire data were
      used to obtain information on maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy.
      Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between maternal
      respiratory infections during pregnancy and resistance and compliance of the
      respiratory system, adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Lower
      values of compliance (Crs) were found in infants of mothers with respiratory
      infections during pregnancy; Crs fell by 5.5% (P = 0.031). The difference in Crs 
      between infants of mothers with and without respiratory infections during
      pregnancy remained unchanged and statistically significant after adjusting for
      potential confounding variables. The more respiratory infections the mother
      experienced during pregnancy, the lower the value of Crs was in her offspring (P 
      for trend = 0.016). Using Crs corrected for body weight the relationship with
      maternal infections was non-significant, however still showing a trend.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may indicate that mothers who experience
      respiratory infections during pregnancy have newborns with lower compliance of
      the respiratory system.

TI  - [Three pregnancies on nasal CPAP: a case report].
PG  - 191-3
AB  - We report on a sleepy woman, suffering from morbid obesity, with a diagnosis of
      severe sleep apnea syndrome made at the age of 30 year, treated with nocturnal
      ventilatory support (nasal CPAP). The patient had an history of preeclampsia
      during a first pregnancy. In the following years, this patient remained very
      compliant with nasal CPAP, was no longer sleepy and was three times pregnant,
      without any complication.

TI  - The physiological costs of reproduction in small mammals.
PG  - 375-98
AB  - Life-history trade-offs between components of fitness arise because reproduction 
      entails both gains and costs. Costs of reproduction can be divided into
      ecological and physiological costs. The latter have been rarely studied yet are
      probably a dominant component of the effect. A deeper understanding of
      life-history evolution will only come about once these physiological costs are
      better understood. Physiological costs may be direct or indirect. Direct costs
      include the energy and nutrient demands of the reproductive event, and the
      morphological changes that are necessary to facilitate achieving these demands.
      Indirect costs may be optional 'compensatory costs' whereby the animal chooses to
      reduce investment in some other aspect of its physiology to maximize the input of
      resource to reproduction. Such costs may be distinguished from consequential
      costs that are an inescapable consequence of the reproductive event. In small
      mammals, the direct costs of reproduction involve increased energy, protein and
      calcium demands during pregnancy, but most particularly during lactation. Organ
      remodelling is necessary to achieve the high demands of lactation and involves
      growth of the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver and
      pancreas. Compensatory indirect costs include reductions in thermogenesis, immune
      function and physical activity. Obligatory consequential costs include
      hyperthermia, bone loss, disruption of sleep patterns and oxidative stress. This 
      is unlikely to be a complete list. Our knowledge of these physiological costs is 
      currently at best described as rudimentary. For some, we do not even know whether
      they are compensatory or obligatory. For almost all of them, we have no idea of
      exact mechanisms or how these costs translate into fitness trade-offs.

TI  - Pre-eclampsia and nasal CPAP: part 2. Hypertension during pregnancy, chronic
      snoring, and early nasal CPAP intervention.
PG  - 15-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential benefit of nasal continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) administration in pregnant women recognized to have hypertension 
      early in pregnancy. METHODS: This is a randomized study comparing the addition of
      nasal CPAP treatment to standard prenatal care to standard prenatal care alone in
      hypertensive women treated with alpha-methyl dopa during early pregnancy.
      Pregnant women with hypertension were recruited by their obstetricians and
      completed baseline sleep questionnaires and visual analogue scales on snoring and
      sleepiness. Subjects were then randomized to receive either CPAP with standard
      prenatal care (treatment group) or standard prenatal care alone (control group)
      with routine obstetric follow-up. Nocturnal polysomnography was performed in all 
      patients randomized to the treatment group for initial CPAP titration. Periodic
      assessment of blood pressure control and CPAP compliance was performed by the
      same specialist at each scheduled follow-up visit. RESULTS: In the control group 
      (n=9), a progressive rise in blood pressure with a corresponding increase in
      alpha-methyl dopa doses was observed, beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy. 
      There was also an increase in the number of non-scheduled post-natal visits
      during the first postpartum month. Pre-eclampsia occurred in one subject; the
      remaining eight patients had normal pregnancies and infant deliveries. In the
      treatment group (n=7), blood pressure was noted to decrease significantly as
      compared to the control group with associated decreases in doses of
      antihypertensive medications at six months of gestation. All treated patients
      experienced uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered infants with higher APGAR
      scores at one minute post-delivery compared to those of controls. CONCLUSION: In 
      pregnant women with hypertension and chronic snoring, nasal CPAP use during the
      first eight weeks of pregnancy combined with standard prenatal care is associated
      with better blood pressure control and improved pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Pre-eclampsia and nasal CPAP: part 1. Early intervention with nasal CPAP in
      pregnant women with risk-factors for pre-eclampsia: preliminary findings.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal-fetal morbidity and
      mortality. Significant overlap exists between the risk factors for pre-eclampsia 
      and sleep-disordered breathing. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
      has been proposed as therapy for pre-eclampsia. This prospective, longitudinal
      study was designed to characterize sleep-related breathing patterns in pregnant
      women with pre-eclampsia risk factors, and to describe the effects of early nasal
      CPAP therapy in these patients. METHODS: Twelve pregnant women with pre-eclampsia
      risk factors underwent polysomnography to characterize sleep-related breathing
      abnormalities and baseline blood pressure determination. Patients with
      airflow-limitation underwent nasal CPAP titration and were treated with optimal
      pressures. Periodic assessments of CPAP compliance and tolerance, sleep quality, 
      and blood pressure control were performed until delivery or pre-eclampsia onset. 
      CPAP retitration was performed between weeks 20 and 22 of pregnancy. RESULTS:
      Mean respiratory disturbance index was 8.5+/-2.6 events/h of sleep, and initial
      nasal CPAP pressures were 5-6 cm H(2)O with an increase to 6-9 cm H2O after
      recalibration. All subjects with chronic hypertension maintained blood pressures 
      below 140/90 with a mean diurnal blood pressure of 122+/-2.5 mmHg over 83+/-1.5
      mmHg. Patient characteristics of obesity and prior pre-eclampsia were associated 
      with pregnancies complicated by spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, or
      pre-eclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: Early application of nasal CPAP in pregnant women
      alleviated sleep-related breathing disturbances but was not sufficient to prevent
      negative pregnancy outcomes. Obesity and prior pre-eclampsia appeared to be
      important factors and were associated with the worst complications. However,
      nasal positive pressure may still be beneficial to decrease severity of outcomes,
      particularly if individualized to patient risk factors, more particularly
      hypertension at pregnancy onset.

TI  - Obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is responsible for increased serum
      hs-CRP levels in patients with sleep-disordered breathing in Delhi.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between April 2005 and March
      2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography
      (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for
      hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria:
      patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
      acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or
      smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone
      replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and
      patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as
      apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)>5], obese non-apneic [body mass index
      (BMI)>25, AHI<5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI<25, AHI<5). C-reactive protein
      levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay
      (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and
      partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and 
      confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables
      that were independently associated with hs-CRP. RESULTS: The mean serum levels of
      hs-CRP were found to be 0.25+/-0.23, 0.58+/-0.55, and 0.51+/-0.37 mg/dl in
      non-obese non-apneics (n=23), obese non-apneics (n=45) and apneics (obese and
      non-obese, n=29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with 
      BMI was found to be 0.25 (p=0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p=0.12). Partial
      correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI 
      after adjustment for AHI and age (r=0.22, p=0.03), while correlation with disease
      severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant 
      (r=0.10, p=0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found
      to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (beta=0.02, p=0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian
      subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated
      with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found
      between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study.

TI  - Acupuncture for insomnia.
PG  - CD005472
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such 
      as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it remains unclear whether
      the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with insomnia. SEARCH 
      STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International,
      CINAHL, AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), TCMLARS
      (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), National 
      Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of
      Health Clinical Trials Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the
      Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to
      2006, and the sleep bibliography, which is available at
      www.websciences.org/bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of retrieved
      articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on
      ongoing/completed trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials
      evaluating any form of acupuncture involving participants of any age with any
      type of insomnia were included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo
      or sham or no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the
      same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or compared 
      acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were excluded, since they did
      not yield the net effect of acupuncture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review
      authors independently extracted data and assessed quality according to a set of
      criteria for risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and
      detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with
      95% confidence intervals were used for binary and continuous outcomes
      respectively. Data were combined in meta-analyses (on an intention-to-treat
      basis), where more than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity
      presented the same outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials met the inclusion
      criteria. The studies included 590 participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped
      out. Participant age ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia
      varied from 6 months to 19 years. Co-existing medical conditions contributing to 
      insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart from
      conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture such as
      acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and transcutaneous electrical
      acupoint stimulation (TEAS) were evaluated. Meta-analysis was limited because of 
      considerable heterogeneity between comparison groups and between outcome
      measures. Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that
      acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores when
      compared to placebo (SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31, p=0.006) or no
      treatment (SMD -0.55, 95% CI = -0.89 to -0.21, p=0.002). TEAS also resulted in
      better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD = -0.74, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.26,
      p=0.003). However, the efficacy of acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent
      between studies for many sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total
      sleep duration and wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies
      reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or its variants
      was not more significantly effective than control (RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to
      -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study
      reported an adverse event, with one out of 16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from
      acupuncture because of pain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The small number of randomised
      controlled trials, together with the poor methodological quality and significant 
      clinical heterogeneity, means that the current evidence is not sufficiently
      extensive or rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the
      treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate 
      randomisation concealment and blinding with longer follow-up are needed to
      further investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of
      insomnia.

TI  - Role of acupuncture in the treatment of insomnia: a comprehensive review.
PG  - 184-93
AB  - Insomnia is a common sleep disorder with devastating socioeconomic consequences. 
      Even though there are pharmacological and behavioral treatments for insomnia,
      most of the patients are treated with medications. However, the long-term use of 
      medications to treat insomnia is questioned and has potential side effects. More 
      and more Americans are seeking complementary/alternative treatments for many
      conditions including insomnia and there are anecdotal reports/case series of use 
      of acupuncture in treating insomnia. To examine critically the role of
      acupuncture in treatment of insomnia, we performed a systematic review of
      published literature. Among the selected studies for review many were clinical
      case series and few open or randomized clinical trails. Even though several of
      these studies did not clarify the nature of insomnia (primary vs. secondary), it 
      seemed that many of the subjects enrolled in these studies had co-morbid other
      psychiatric (depression or anxiety disorders) and/or medical conditions
      (Hemodialysis, Stroke, Pregnancy). Except for few, several of these studies had
      methodological limitations. Despite the limitations of the reviewed studies, all 
      of them consistently indicate significant improvement in insomnia with
      acupuncture. Further methodologically strong, randomized controlled studies with 
      large sample size are needed to assess the usefulness of acupuncture in treatment
      of insomnia and explore the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of
      acupuncture on sleep and sleep disorders.

TI  - Activity levels in pregnant New Zealand women: relationship with socioeconomic
      factors, well-being, anthropometric measures, and birth outcome.
PG  - 733-42
AB  - Activity during pregnancy has health implications for mother and child. The aim
      of this prospective cohort study was to examine changes in activity levels during
      pregnancy; the influence of socioeconomic factors and well-being on activity, and
      the influence of activity on maternal anthropometric measures and birth outcome. 
      Twenty-four hour activity diaries were collected for 3 d in months 4 and 7 of
      pregnancy in 197 volunteers. Anthropometric measures and questionnaires to
      determine personal details were collected at these times and 2 months
      post-partum. Health records were used to supply infant measures. The time spent
      on each activity category was calculated, and used to calculate overall daily
      metabolic equivalents (METs). Low socioeconomic (SES) group 24 h activity levels 
      were significantly higher than for high SES or welfare groups (p = 0.013).
      Activity declined throughout pregnancy in all groups (p = 0.002). Women with
      children had higher 24 h activity, spending 41% more time walking and (or) on
      housework than nulliparous women (p = 0.013). Reduced well-being was associated
      with lower levels of activity. Sleep and lying down time influenced 2 month
      post-partum body mass (upper quartile gained 2.54 kg, lower quartile lost 0.24
      kg, p < 0.001). Mean infant gestational age increased with increasing 24 h
      activity (p = 0.047). No infants were born prematurely to mothers who spent more 
      than 190 min/d walking or doing housework activities in month 4. Probability of
      infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) declined with time
      spent walking or doing housework in month 4 (p = 0.007). Mean (SE) birth weight
      was 3883 (+/-165) g in the 10% of women spending less than 530 min sleeping or
      lying down per day, compared with 3413 (+/-104) g in the 10% of women spending
      725 min or more sleeping or lying down. Socioeconomic factors were therefore
      important influences on activity levels during pregnancy. Inactivity, especially 
      in early pregnancy, was associated with more maternal weight retention at 2
      months post-partum and a greater probability of admission to NICU and premature
      delivery.

TI  - Snoring, witnessed sleep apnoeas and pregnancy-induced hypertension.
PG  - 788-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snoring is common in pregnancy, but there are only a few studies that
      have investigated the relationship of snoring and pregnancy complications. We
      aimed to investigate the relationship of snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas with
      pregnancy-induced hypertension. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered on the 
      day of delivery to 456 women at the Department of Obstetrics, Hospital Donacion
      F. Santojanni, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pregnancy complications and blood
      pressure measurements were recorded from each woman's medical chart. RESULTS:
      Some 156 (35%) of 447 women with singleton pregnancies who answered the
      questionnaire, snored at some time during their pregnancy. Snoring was related to
      pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia combined, with an adjusted odds 
      ratio of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.16-2.84; p <0.01), independent of body mass index before
      pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy, neck circumference, smoking, alcohol and
      age. Witnessed sleep apnoeas were also related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive 
      disease, with an adjusted odds ratio of 8.00 (95% CI: 2.71-23.55; p <0.001).
      Daytime sleepiness was more prevalent in snoring women. CONCLUSIONS: Snoring and 
      witnessed sleep apnoeas are independently related to pregnancy-induced
      hypertensive disease.

TI  - The loss of entropy circadian rhythm in sinusal R-R intervals of type 1 diabetic 
      pregnant women suggests an indeterministic chaos in cardiac pacing (minimum
      delirium cordis syndrome). A newly identifiable type of silent cardiac
      dysautonomia?
PG  - 257-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The scope of this study is to detect whether or not the entropy (E)
      circadian rhythm (CR) is maintained preserved in sinusal R-R intervals (SRRI),
      its loss being the expression of a transition to an indeterministic chaos in
      heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: The E of SRRI was estimated in 14 type I
      diabetic pregnant women (DPW) in the first trimester of an apparently
      uncomplicated gestation (7 patients - mean age = 30.3 +/- 4.1 y - without
      clinical and laboratory evidence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and 7 patients 
      - mean age = 30.7 +/- 3.6 y - with positive tests for a cardiac dysautonomia).
      The E CR was studied via the single cosinor method, and summarized via the
      population-mean cosinor method. RESULTS: The E CR was found not to be preserved
      in both the investigated type I DPW, despite the occurrence of the SRRI CR.
      CONCLUSIONS: The loss of the E CR confirms that in type I DPW there is a
      transition to an indeterministic disorder in HRV due to the lack of an
      autocorrelated periodic chaos in cardiac pacing. Such an unphysiological
      neurovegetative regulation suggests a new silent cardiac dysautonomic syndrome,
      that we intend to call "minimum delirium cordis syndrome" (MDCS). Can the MDCS be
      regarded as a condition of cardiovascular risk? To answer this question, it seems
      justified to suggest that the study of the E CR should be added to the routine
      tests that are presently applied to clinical analysis of the Holter ECG, being
      the classic tests of linear analysis not methodologically suitable for detecting 
      the indeterministic chaos of the MDCS.

TI  - Analysis of frontal sharp transients in 32 neonatal polysomnography in healthy
      fullterm newborns.
PG  - 222-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify frontal sharp transients found in neonatal
      polysomnography of healthy full term newborns in each stage of the sleep-wake
      cycle within the first 48 hours of life. METHOD: The EEG from healthy term 32
      newborns, legal age of two days and with adequate monitoring during pregnancy.
      Frontal sharp transients (FST) were quantified, according to synchronous or
      asynchronous, in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle. The results were compared by
      Kruskal-Wallis-test. RESULTS: FST were counted individually in each sleep phase, 
      being present during quiet sleep (QS) in all tracings. FST bilateral and
      synchronous and lateralized FST were more frequent during QS (p<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Lateralized FST were found mostly during quiet sleep. FST
      asynchronous in healthy full term newborns were normal and depended of FST
      density. FST unilateral appearance should not necessarily be considered abnormal 
      as well.

TI  - Comprehensive clinical management of polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG  - 175-89
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-7% of reproductive-aged women.
      Although the diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been debated, it is frequently
      characterized by hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss),
      oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The reproductive and
      metabolic complications associated with the syndrome can be serious, so a
      comprehensive approach to the evaluation and treatment of affected women is
      important. Menstrual cycle control is necessary to prevent endometrial
      hyperplasia, and this can be accomplished with hormonal contraception,
      progesterone therapy, and weight loss (if overweight). In women desiring
      pregnancy, commonly used ovulation induction therapies include weight loss,
      clomiphene citrate, and/or metformin. Cosmetic issues such as hirsutism, acne and
      male-pattern hair loss can be challenging to cope with. Treatment options include
      estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptive agents, antiandrogens, and topical
      agents. More permanent hair reduction can be achieved with electrolysis and laser
      therapy. Evaluation of metabolic complications includes risk assessment for
      diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Women
      with PCOS should also be screened for sleep apnea, as this has been reported to
      occur more commonly in women with PCOS. Finally, mental health issues such as
      depression and eating disorders may be present. Many of the complications
      associated with PCOS can be managed with therapeutic lifestyle change, including 
      a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss (if overweight), and psychological support.
      Pharmacological therapies are also available to effectively regulate menstrual
      cycles and manage cosmetic complications. This article will review the current
      diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in PCOS.

TI  - Maternal positioning and fetal positioning in utero.
PG  - 279-82
AB  - AIM: Approximately two-thirds of term vertex fetuses are in the left occiput
      position in utero. However, little is understood about the physiology of
      maternal-fetal positioning during pregnancy. It was hypothesized that fetal left 
      occiput positioning is affected by maternal positioning. The present study was
      designed to investigate the relationship between maternal positioning in late
      pregnancy and fetal positioning in utero. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was
      conducted at Ueda Hospital, Kobe, Japan. Eligible women were limited to low-risk 
      pregnancies ending in spontaneous vaginal delivery with singleton vertex fetuses.
      Information obtained from the mother included the preference of positioning
      during sleep in the second half of pregnancy. Fetal information recorded after
      delivery included fetal positioning. RESULTS: Eighty-one (50.6%) of 160 evaluated
      women preferred left lateral positioning while 70 (43.8%) women preferred right
      lateral positioning in the second half of pregnancy. Seventy-seven (51.7%) of 149
      evaluated fetuses were in the left occiput position while 72 (48.3%) fetuses were
      in the right occiput position in utero. Maternal left lateral positioning with
      fetal left occiput position in utero was the predominant positioning (41 of 149, 
      27.5%). However, there was no statistical relationship between maternal
      positioning and fetal occiput positioning in utero. CONCLUSION: More women prefer
      the left lateral position during the second half of pregnancy. More fetuses are
      in the left occiput in utero during the late stage of pregnancy. However, no
      statistical relationship was observed between maternal and fetal positioning.

TI  - [Management of women with bipolar disorders from conception through the
      postpartum period].
PG  - 1913-8
AB  - Any plans for pregnancy must be discussed in detail with women with bipolar
      disorders. They must be informed about the risks related to it and the need for
      some precautions. Because of the risk of relapse during pregnancy, the
      risk/benefit ratio of maintaining or starting prophylactic treatment should be
      assessed, taking into account family history and frequency of recurrences.
      Lithium may be used during pregnancy under close monitoring. Most anticonvulsants
      are contraindicated because of their teratogenicity. During the post-partum
      period, prophylaxis is required in most cases because of the high risk of
      relapse. If no prophylaxis was given during pregnancy, it must be started quickly
      after delivery to be effective when the risk is at its highest, i.e., during the 
      first two weeks after delivery. Women with bipolar disorders should be advised
      against breast-feeding to avoid exposure of the infant to psychotropic
      medication. Because breast-feeding can be stressful and causes sleep deprivation,
      it may increase the risk of relapse. Second-generation antipsychotic agents
      should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding because inadequate
      information is currently available about their safety.

TI  - The feasibility of adding fetal heart rate to the nocturnal polysomnogram.
PG  - 277-80
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that fetal heart rate measured by ultrasound can
      be successfully captured and monitored throughout the nocturnal polysomnogram.
      METHODS: Fetal heart rate by ultrasound using an abdominal belt (Hewlett Packard 
      Fetal Monitor 8040A) was measured during 1 overnight polysomnogram in volunteers 
      in late pregnancy and added to a digitized polysomnography system (Alice 4,
      Respironics). RESULTS: In 6 women with a single fetus in their third trimester,
      the fetal heart rate monitor band only infrequently needed to be readjusted.
      Fetal kicks and movements resulted in signal loss, usually with subsequent
      recapture without having to awaken the mother. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal heart rate, 1
      of the classic signals of fetal distress, can be added to the nocturnal
      polysomnogram with minimal disruption of maternal sleep and with signal capture
      throughout the night.

TI  - Curt Richter and the female rat.
PG  - 376-87
AB  - Richter fully appreciated the fundamental biological importance of sex
      differences, in particular the challenges of female reproductive function to the 
      two classes of behavior that most engaged him, endogenous rhythms and
      "self-regulatory" behaviors. Indeed, his contributions in these areas justify
      honoring him as one of the founders of behavioral neuroendocrinology. During the 
      1920s Richter, together with Wang, Kinder and other students, performed elegant
      phenomenological and mechanistic studies of sex differences in rats' spontaneous 
      locomotor activity, nest building, and food intake. All of these behaviors
      display rhythms entrained to the ovarian cycle in female rats, and Richter's
      analyses of them formed the bases of many current areas of behavioral
      neuroscience. Slightly later, Richter made fundamentally important discoveries
      related to nutrient self-selection in pregnant and lactating rats, including
      changes in micronutrient and macronutrient selection. These data played a major
      role in the development of his concept of behavioral regulation of homeostasis.
      Unfortunately, some of these discoveries are rarely recalled. This is both
      historically regrettable and potentially an impediment to contemporary research
      progress.

TI  - [Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)].
PG  - 423-46
AB  - Polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female hormonal
      disorders. Its multiple components--reproductive, metabolic, neoplasic and
      cardiovascular--have a major impact on the public health. Androgen excess and
      resistance to insulin, probably from genetic origin, are responsible for most of 
      the clinical symptomatology. Resistance to insulin seems to be accompanied by a
      greater risk of glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, lipidic anomalies and can
      involve the development of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, sleep apnea
      syndrome is more progressively described in PCOS. Infertility, menses disorders
      and hirsutism often push these patients to consult their physician. A better
      understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms led to the emergence of new
      therapeutic options increasing the sensitivity to insulin. Besides the pregnancy 
      wishes, cares aim to attenuate the marks of the hyper-androgenism (hormonal
      treatment and cosmetic) and to correct cardiovascular, respiratory and
      gynaecological risk factors. In case of infertility by anovulation, cares must be
      performed by trained experts to minimize the risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation
      syndrome and multiple pregnancies. A gradation from loose weight to clomiphene
      citrate ovulation induction, ovarian drilling, low dose gonadotropin, in vitro
      fertilisation, or in vitro maturation of oocytes should bring back good
      reproduction potential.

TI  - The disruption of circadian clockwork in differentiating cells from rat
      reproductive tissues as identified by in vitro real-time monitoring system.
PG  - 413-20
AB  - The circadian clock, regulating hormonal secretion and metabolisms in accordance 
      with the environmental light-dark cycle, resides in almost all peripheral tissues
      as well as in the superchiasmatic nucleus. Clock gene expression has been found
      to be noncyclic during spermatogenesis and the differentiation of thymocytes.
      However, currently little is known about how cell differentiation could affect
      circadian clockwork. We performed this study using the in vitro real-time
      oscillation monitoring system to examine the clockwork in several types of
      differentiating cells originated from reproductive tissues of transgenic rats
      (constructed with Period gene 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase reporter 
      gene). After treatment with dexamethasone (DXM), persistent oscillation of Per2
      expression was observed in both gonadotropin-induced and pregnant ovarian luteal 
      cells, proliferative uterine stromal cells (USCs), and nondifferentiating
      testicular interstitial cells, with a cyclic period of ~24 h. In contrast to
      these cell types, only one cycle of oscillation was sustained in granulosa cells 
      undergoing differentiation. Additionally, Per2 oscillation was irregular in USCs 
      undergoing decidualization induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate plus N6,
      2-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Furthermore, no oscillation
      of Per2 expression was evoked by DXM in Leydig cells and thymocytes. In
      conclusion, the present study characterized the oscillation of Per2 gene
      expression in several types of ovarian, uterine, and testicular cells, and it is 
      strongly suggested that circadian clockwork is affected during cellular
      differentiation.

TI  - Consensus on drug treatment, definition and diagnosis for insomnia.
PG  - 351-85
AB  - Thirty-four experts and a literature supervisor got together in order to reach a 
      'consensus' regarding the definition, diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of 
      insomnia. Insomnia is a subjective perception of dissatisfaction with the amount 
      and/or quality of sleep. It includes difficulty in initiating or maintaining
      sleep or early awakening with inability to fall asleep again. It is associated
      with complaints of non-restorative sleep and dysfunction of diurnal alertness,
      energy, cognitive function, behaviour or emotional state, with a decrease in
      quality of life. The diagnosis is based on clinical and sleep history, physical
      examination and additional tests, although polysomnography is not routinely
      indicated. Therapy should include treatment of the underlying causes, cognitive
      and behavioural measures and drug treatment. Hypnotic therapy can be prescribed
      from the onset of insomnia and non-benzodiazepine selective agonists of the
      GABA-A receptor complex are the drugs of first choice. It is recommended that
      hypnotic treatment be maintained in cases where withdrawal impairs the patient's 
      quality of life and when all other therapeutic measures have failed. Experience
      suggests that intermittent treatment is better than continuous therapy. The
      available data do not confirm safety of hypnotics in pregnancy, lactation and
      childhood insomnia. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in decompensated chronic
      pulmonary disease but no significant adverse effects on respiratory function have
      been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone in stable mild to moderate chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and in treated obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
      Data for zaleplon are inconclusive. If the patient recovers subjective control
      over the sleep process, gradual discontinuation of hypnotic treatment can be
      considered.

TI  - Clinical trials in restless legs syndrome--recommendations of the European RLS
      Study Group (EURLSSG).
PG  - S495-504
AB  - The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association
      of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of
      the Study Group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for
      diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and
      evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all
      members have since contributed to many pivotal and nonpivotal drug trials for the
      treatment of RLS. The recommendations on clinical investigations of
      pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and
      knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address
      how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients
      with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical
      and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary
      endpoints for an evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of
      validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special
      populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations
      include the assessment of augmentation. Finally, general issues including the
      evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and
      cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim
      of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical
      companies in the design of optimized study protocols.

TI  - Prevalence of smoking and associated factors among pregnant women in Japan.
PG  - 15-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among
      pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their
      smoking behavior. METHOD: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were 
      randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was
      conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a
      survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on
      pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to
      examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. RESULTS: Data were
      obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during 
      pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of
      smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for
      smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young
      age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep
      duration and in women who drank. CONCLUSION: Smoking among pregnant women remains
      an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote
      antismoking measures based on the results of this study.

TI  - [Effects of ethanol on the development of circadian time keeping system].
PG  - 67-75
AB  - Ethanol exposure during gestation can have devastating consequences on the
      developing organism. Children who have a history of prenatally exposure to
      ethanol may show morphological and functional alterations, referred to as fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is
      characterized by pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, specific cranial/facial
      features, and dysfunction of central nervous system, is the most severe end of
      FASD. FAS or FASD children are known to suffer from disturbance of sleep and/or
      food intake behaviors. These neuropsychiatric symptoms may be due to impairment
      of the system regulating circadian rhythms. Recently, animal studies revealed
      that ethanol exposure during brain development can cause alterations in the
      circadian rhythm and its regulating system. We examined the effects of pre- or
      postnatal exposure to ethanol on the circadian rhythm in adulthood by measuring
      deep body temperature and wheel running activity in rats. After a phase delay in 
      the light/dark cycle, ethanol-exposed rats took longer than control rats to
      resynchronize to the new light/dark cycle. These results suggest that both pre-
      and postnatal ethanol exposure impair the development of the circadian clock
      response to light cue. Because abnormal development of the circadian clock system
      might contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in FASD, it is believed
      that normalizing the disturbed rhythm improves the symptoms. However, the
      mechanisms of dysfunction and potential interventions for disturbance of
      circadian clock system still remain to be elucidated. Further investigations are 
      required to fully understand long-term effects of ethanol on the development of
      circadian rhythms.

TI  - Patterns of sleep disruption and depressive symptoms in new mothers.
PG  - 123-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive
      symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the
      postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also
      examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between
      self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with
      depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive
      symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. METHODS: This 
      longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last
      month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and
      depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month
      postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month
      postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms
      were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 
      4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were
      associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling 
      asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question 
      in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

TI  - Negotiating sleep: a qualitative study of new mothers.
PG  - 114-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers
      about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of
      becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial
      on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. METHODS:
      Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to
      describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early
      postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established
      sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their 
      stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep
      became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the
      mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they
      experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps,
      development of a "sleep consciousness," and bed-sharing. Mercer's stages of
      becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes
      into their lives.

TI  - Sleep disturbance in late pregnancy and early labor.
PG  - 103-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy,
      particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not
      measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor
      sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days 
      preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and
      both pain and fatigue during early labor. METHODS: Thirty-five nulliparous women 
      were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist
      actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants
      completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to
      hospital admission. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Most women experienced spontaneous
      labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the
      last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital
      admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). CONCLUSION: There
      was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before
      hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset.
      Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about
      expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

TI  - Establishment and clinical application of enzyme immunoassays for determination
      of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone and metastin.
PG  - 422-9
AB  - Metastin, a 54-residue peptide, was identified as the cognate ligand of human
      G-protein-coupled receptor GPR54. Since metastin is a gene product of the human
      metastasis suppressor gene 'KiSS-1', early studies on metastin were focused on
      its activity as a tumor metastasis suppressor. Recently, there have been some
      reports that metastin is found in human plasma and is particularly abundant in
      the plasma of pregnant women. Dysfunction of the GPR54 receptor causes diseases
      that are characterized by an insufficient release of gonadotropin and lack or
      delay of pubertal maturation. This information strongly suggests that metastin is
      involved in the regulation of reproductive endocrine functions. In order to
      determine the plasma levels of metastin and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone
      (LHRH) in an isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) patient, who received
      intermittent administrations of LHRH, we tried to establish a sensitive and
      specific enzyme immunoassay. The plasma LHRH levels of the patient were very
      high, while plasma metastin levels were at almost the same levels as circadian
      rhythms of healthy male humans. In the central nervous system, metastin
      stimulates the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. However, the effects of
      peripheral metastin are not known. Our result suggested that peripheral metastin 
      had a genesis and activity different from central metastin.

TI  - [Twin pregnancy and severe obstructive sleep apnea].
PG  - 93-7
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy, associated with arterial hypertension, 
      pre-eclampsia and adverse outcome of the newborn, has been described. Usually it 
      can successfully be treated with non-invasive ventilation. A 36-year-old,
      twin-pregnant woman at 28 + 6 weeks of gestation presented with the complaints of
      snoring and nocturnal oxygen desaturations. Polysomnography confirmed the
      diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea (respiratory disturbance index [RDI] 
      104/h, minimal oxygen saturation in pulse oximetry [SpO2/min] 75%). First
      therapeutic approaches including oxygen supplementation, non-invasive ventilation
      with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway
      pressure--spontaneous (BiPAP-S) remained without success. Only after ventilation 
      with bilevel positive airway pressure in spontaneous/timed modus (BiPAP-ST)
      combined with additional oxygen supplementation a satisfactory treatment result
      could be achieved (RDI 32/h, SpO2/min 85%). Because of progressive pre-eclampsia 
      despite therapy at 31 + 0 weeks of gestation cesarean section was performed and 2
      healthy children were delivered. After surgery non-invasive ventilation had to be
      continued for another six weeks before the condition improved. In contrast to the
      documented benefits of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in pregnant
      women the literature, in our case even with sufficient therapy of sleep apnea
      progressive pre-eclampsia and premature delivery could not be prevented. Possible
      explanations include the short treatment duration and existence of twin
      pregnancy.

TI  - The adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs in children.
PG  - 251-65
AB  - Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are often equivalent, hence selection of
      an AED is often determined by the adverse effects (AEs). The development of
      neurocognitive AEs is almost inevitable with use of AEDs, especially in high-risk
      groups. Teratogenesis with major or minor malformations is of great concern
      during the first trimester of pregnancy, but an increasing body of information
      suggests that potential neurocognitive developmental delay may also occur with
      use of AEDs in the latter part of pregnancy. Decreased bone mineral density has
      been found in adults and children receiving both enzyme-inducing AEDs and
      valproate, an enzyme-inhibiting drug. AEDs may influence the lipid profile, body 
      weight, reproductive, hormonal and other endocrine functions, and sleep
      architecture. There are age-specific AEs related to pharmacokinetic differences
      that have been highlighted in this review with emphasis on the pediatric
      population. A classification of AEs using different parameters is also included.

TI  - Interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.
PG  - CD001139
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience back pain and
      almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The pain increases with advancing
      pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating back and pelvic
      pain in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and
      Childbirth Review Group's Trials Register (February 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised controlled trials of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence 
      or severity of back or pelvic pain in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
      Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN
      RESULTS: We found no studies dealing specifically with prevention of back or
      pelvic pain. We included eight studies (1305 participants) that examined the
      effects of adding various pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy,
      acupuncture and pillows to usual prenatal care. For women with low-back pain,
      participating in strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises
      (standardised mean difference (SMD) -5.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.40 to 
      -4.27), and water gymnastics reduced pain intensity and back pain-related sick
      leave (relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92) better than usual prenatal
      care alone. The specially-designed Ozzlo pillow was more effective than a regular
      one in relieving back pain (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55), but is no longer
      commercially available. Both acupuncture and stabilising exercises relieved
      pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Acupuncture gave more relief from
      evening pain than exercises. For women with both pelvic and back pain, in one
      study, acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy in reducing the
      intensity of their pain; stretching exercises resulted in more total pain relief 
      (60%) than usual care (11%); and 60% of those who received acupuncture reported
      less intense pain, compared to 14% of those receiving usual prenatal care. Women 
      who received usual prenatal care reported more use of analgesics, physical
      modalities and sacroiliac belts. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All but one study had
      moderate to high potential for bias, so results must be viewed cautiously. Adding
      pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy or acupuncture to usual prenatal care
      appears to relieve back or pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care alone,
      although the effects are small. We do not know if they actually prevent pain from
      starting in the first place. Water gymnastics appear to help women stay at work. 
      Acupuncture shows better results compared to physiotherapy.

TI  - Nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly: factors impacting onset, treatment, and
      outcomes.
PG  - 1866-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly remains a diagnosis of concern 
      in infancy. This study evaluates factors affecting the onset, treatment, and
      outcomes of nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly. METHODS: A retrospective chart
      review and telephone survey were performed. A posterior occipital deformation
      severity score was used. Factors such as demographics, behavioral and helmet
      therapy, feeding patterns, torticollis, multiple gestation pregnancies,
      prematurity, and congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly were evaluated.
      RESULTS: One hundred five infants were identified. Of these, 95 percent were
      Caucasian, 93 percent were from two-parent households, and 70 percent were from
      households earning more than $50,000. Repositioning was attempted in 95 percent, 
      and 45 percent progressed to helmet therapy. When comparing change in posterior
      occipital deformation severity score with helmet therapy to repositioning, a
      difference was found (p < 0.05). Forty-nine percent of patients were breast-fed, 
      and when compared with the general population, a difference was found (p < 0.05).
      Twenty percent of infants had torticollis, and when compared with population
      norms, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twelve percent of patients were twins, 
      and when compared with population norms, more twinning occurred (p < 0.05).
      Congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly was found in 10 percent of
      patients and did not result in an increased risk of progression to helmet
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates trends that may predict additional 
      risks for developing nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly, including
      torticollis, plural births, and increased socioeconomic affluence. In addition,
      the nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly cohort was breast-fed less than the
      general population, demonstrating that breast-feeding may be preventative, as
      breast-fed infants are repositioned more frequently and sleep for shorter
      periods. As in other studies, cranial molding helmet therapy was more effective
      in correcting nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly than repositioning alone.

TI  - Maternal dietary omega fatty acid intake and auditory brainstem-evoked potentials
      in Mexican infants born at term: cluster analysis.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the
      neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by
      brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted 
      a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third 
      trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP
      tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic
      sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by
      food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were 
      identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal
      PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic
      and biological factors. RESULTS: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a
      maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR=3.63, 95% CI 1.23-10.67) after
      adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was
      not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake
      during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination.

TI  - Altered cardiovascular control in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - Vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control in hazardous situations is important.
      Our hypothesis is that the prerequisite for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
      is impaired vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control. Prematurity is a risk
      factor for SIDS, and postnatal intermittent hypoxia may contribute to this risk. 
      We studied heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses in 10 infants with
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who were born at 27 +/- 2.4 (23-30) wk of
      gestation. Twenty healthy term infants served as controls. Cardiovascular tests
      were performed under polysomnographic control during slow-wave sleep (SWS) at a
      corrected age of 12 +/- 3.5 (7-19) wk. Control infants showed biphasic HR and BP 
      responses to side motion with an immediate increase followed by a modest decrease
      and return to baseline. Compared with the controls, half of the BPD infants had
      altered BP responses (p < 0.005) without an early increase, followed by a more
      prominent decrease in BP. BPD infants also presented with a greater variability
      in BP responses to head-up tilts than did the controls (p < 0.001). In
      conclusion, these findings suggest that some BPD infants have impaired vestibular
      sympathoreflex-mediated cardiovascular control. This dysfunction may become
      critical in life-threatening situations.

      measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory
      distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate.
      Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations
      were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of
      the PSG and observed tests were predefined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in 
      respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure
      of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. RESULTS: 20 infants
      (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at 
      study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car
      seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and
      arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively).
      Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of
      study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The
      nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more
      accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. CONCLUSIONS: Immature infants
      exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not
      accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

TI  - Birth and hatching: key events in the onset of awareness in the lamb and chick.
PG  - 51-60
AB  - The neuroanatomical and neurophysiological development of the embryo and fetus
      and unique features of the physiological environment of the fetal brain, features
      which are lost at birth, support recent conclusions that under normal
      circumstances awareness (or consciousness) is probably not exhibited by the ovine
      embryo-fetus before birth and that it appears for the first time only after
      birth. However, there has apparently been no evaluation of whether or not similar
      mechanisms modulate awareness-related functions in domestic chicks before and
      after hatching. This comparative review, in seeking to rectify this, arrived at
      the following conclusions. First, the neural apparatus of both lambs and chicks
      appears to be too immature to support any states resembling awareness during at
      least the first half of pregnancy or incubation. Second, electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) activity, which evolves subsequently, shows that states of sleep-like
      unconsciousness are likely to be continuously present in lambs until after birth,
      and that such states at least predominate in chicks until after hatching. Third, 
      as in fetal lambs, epochs of so-called 'wakefulness' previously reported in chick
      embryos do not seem likely to represent short periods of awareness in ovo.
      Fourth, several neurosuppressive mechanisms, with some unique features, also
      operate or have the potential to operate in chicks before hatching, but a dearth 
      of published information currently hinders a full comparison with those
      demonstrated to operate in fetal lambs. Fifth, contradicting the intuitive
      perception that vocalisation pre-hatching by the chick indicates the presence of 
      awareness, published evidence suggests that vocalisation before and during
      hatching occurs mostly during EEG states indicating sleep-like unconsciousness.
      Sixth, as seems to be the case for newborn lambs after birth, it is possible that
      demonstrable awareness may appear for the first time only after hatching in
      chicks, presumably through waning neurosuppression and burgeoning
      neuroactivation, but such awareness seems to take longer to manifest itself.
      However, additional research in chicks is recommended to further assess this
      suggestion. Particular attention should be given to the status of vocal
      interactions between hen and chick which begin several days before hatching, and 
      to the operation of neurosuppressive and neuroactivating mechanisms throughout
      the last 40% of incubation and during and after hatching.

TI  - A new paradigm for depression in new mothers: the central role of inflammation
      and how breastfeeding and anti-inflammatory treatments protect maternal mental
      health.
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in the field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has revealed
      that depression is associated with inflammation manifested by increased levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines. DISCUSSION: The old paradigm described inflammation as
      simply one of many risk factors for depression. The new paradigm is based on more
      recent research that has indicated that physical and psychological stressors
      increase inflammation. These recent studies constitute an important shift in the 
      depression paradigm: inflammation is not simply a risk factor; it is the risk
      factor that underlies all the others. Moreover, inflammation explains why
      psychosocial, behavioral and physical risk factors increase the risk of
      depression. This is true for depression in general and for postpartum depression 
      in particular. Puerperal women are especially vulnerable to these effects because
      their levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly increase during the last 
      trimester of pregnancy--a time when they are also at high risk for depression.
      Moreover, common experiences of new motherhood, such as sleep disturbance,
      postpartum pain, and past or current psychological trauma, act as stressors that 
      cause proinflammatory cytokine levels to rise. Breastfeeding has a protective
      effect on maternal mental health because it attenuates stress and modulates the
      inflammatory response. However, breastfeeding difficulties, such as nipple pain, 
      can increase the risk of depression and must be addressed promptly. CONCLUSION:
      PNI research suggests two goals for the prevention and treatment of postpartum
      depression: reducing maternal stress and reducing inflammation. Breastfeeding and
      exercise reduce maternal stress and are protective of maternal mood. In addition,
      most current treatments for depression are anti-inflammatory. These include
      long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, cognitive therapy, St. John's wort, and
      conventional antidepressants.

TI  - Effect of perinatal low protein diets on the ontogeny of select hepatic
      cytochrome p450 enzymes and cytochrome p450 reductase in the rat.
PG  - 1057-63
AB  - In the present study, we administered two low protein diets (LPDs) to rats during
      pregnancy and lactation and determined their effect on the ontogeny of select
      hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in their offspring. The L93 and LM76 LPDs
      were derived from the American Society of Nutrition recommended AIN93G and a
      modified version of the AIN76A purified control diets, respectively. The LPDs
      contained 8% crude protein in the form of casein, whereas the purified control
      diets contained 19% casein. A regular cereal-based diet (NP) was also included,
      and, therefore, a total of five groups were tested. Pups in all five groups were 
      weaned onto a regular NP diet on postnatal day 28. Perinatal LPD altered the
      activities of a number of P450 isoforms in 28-day-old male and female offspring. 
      However, nutritional rehabilitation abolished most of these changes as evidenced 
      by lack of differences between the five groups in the activities of P450 isoforms
      in either 65- or 150-day-old offspring. Interestingly, 58-day-old female
      offspring in the LM76 group but not those in the L93 group exhibited shorter
      hexobarbital sleep time than the purified control group. However, hexobarbital
      hydroxylase activity and the amount of CYP2C12 protein, an important P450 isoform
      involved in hexobarbital metabolism in females, were unchanged. This suggests
      that the decrease in hexobarbital sleep time in this group is not due to an
      increase in the activity of hexobarbital-metabolizing enzymes. In summary,
      perinatal LPDs produced transient alterations in activities of select hepatic
      P450s and resulted in a gender- and diet-dependent long-term alteration in
      hexobarbital pharmacodynamics.
