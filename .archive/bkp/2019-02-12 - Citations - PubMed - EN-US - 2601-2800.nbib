TI  - Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in pre-eclamptic pregnancy: evidence
      for a relative hypermesorACEemia.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - The circadian rhythm of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was
      investigated in pregnant women with normal and pre-eclamptic gestation. The
      chronobiological approach was able to document the occurrence of a circadian
      rhythm for serum ACE activity in normal pregnancy. Such a rhythm is characterized
      by a decreased mesor and amplitude and a shifted crest. The circadian rhythm for 
      serum ACE activity was not detectable in pre-eclamptic pregnancy. Such an
      abrogation is accompanied by a negligible decrease of mesor suggesting the
      occurrence of a relative hyperACEemia. This disorder could play a role in
      pregnancy-induced hypertension.

TI  - The development of sleep-wakefulness cycle and its correlation to other behavior 
      in the human fetus.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - Fetal rapid eye movements (REM), breathing movements (BM), and trunk movements
      (TM) were observed through the use of 3 ultrasonic real-time scanners. Each
      movement was recorded with the event marker and quantitatively analyzed in
      relation to the development of the sleep-wakefulness cycle by a computer-assisted
      system. The results were as follows: The number of REM increased with gestational
      age. The appearance rate of REM reached a certain level after 32 weeks of
      gestation. REM-non-REM rhythm was distinguished after 32 weeks. The relationship 
      between REM and BM increased with gestational age. The occurrence of each TM has 
      no correlation to that of REM when it was analyzed in short-term units, but the
      incidence of TM was high in REM periods. These results demonstrate the course of 
      the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in human fetuses.

TI  - Effects of low-frequency vibration on human term fetuses.
PG  - 1479-85
AB  - Thirteen healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were
      studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz,
      square wave) on fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, and gross fetal body movement 
      patterns. All fetuses were stimulated during an episode of low fetal heart rate
      variability (mean minute range less than or equal to 32 milliseconds for greater 
      than or equal to 5 minutes) lasting at least 5 minutes. There was an immediate
      and sustained increase in long-term FHR variability, number of FHR accelerations,
      and gross fetal body movements after stimulation. Fetuses made breathing
      movements more irregularly after vibratory stimulus. We hypothesize that external
      low-frequency vibratory stimulus, applied during episodes of low fetal heart rate
      variability, causes a change from a state of quiet sleep to a state of
      rapid-eye-movement sleep in healthy term fetuses.

TI  - Human fetal behavioral states after vibratory stimulation.
PG  - 1470-6
AB  - A total of 14 healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age
      were studied to determine the effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus
      (100 Hz, square wave) on human fetal behavioral states. Fetal behavioral state
      observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross
      fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. During 
      the first episode of behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep state) greater than or
      equal to 10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus
      was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus
      received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half
      day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory
      stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were
      then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A
      transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 
      2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged less than or equal to 3 minutes after
      stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes 
      in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. 
      There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate 
      variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body
      movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal
      fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after
      application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the
      profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously
      described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial
      larynx.

TI  - Cerebral oxidative metabolism in lambs during perinatal period: relationship to
      electrocortical state.
PG  - R1251-7
AB  - Cerebral oxidative metabolism and regional blood flow were studied, with changes 
      in behavioral state over the immediate perinatal period, to determine the change 
      in cerebral metabolism at birth and the relationship to behavioral activity. Nine
      unanesthetized fetal sheep (139-142 days gestation) were each studied during a
      period of high-voltage and low-voltage electrocorticogram (ECOG) activity and
      then again after cesarean delivery at 2 h of age while awake and at 24 h of age
      while awake and during a period of high-voltage ECOG sleep. Preductal arterial
      and sagittal vein blood samples were analyzed for O2 content, blood gases, and
      pH. Blood flow was measured with a radioactive microsphere technique. Cerebral
      oxidative metabolism showed no significant perinatal change, although a coupling 
      to behavioral state was evident with significant increases during both the
      perinatal low-voltage ECOG state and the awake state at 24 h. Blood flow to the
      brain showed a significant perinatal decrease after birth and state-related
      increases during both the prenatal low-voltage ECOG state and the awake state at 
      24 h consistent with the tight coupling of flow and/or O2 delivery to metabolic
      needs reported for normal brain tissue. The cerebral metabolic rate of the
      prenatal low-voltage ECOG state suggested a level of functional excitation
      comparable with that of the awake state after birth, supporting the importance of
      the rapid-eye-movement (REM) state mechanism as a source of endogenous
      stimulation during the perinatal period of brain growth and development.

TI  - Ethanol teratogenesis in selectivity bred long-sleep and short-sleep mice: a
      comparison to inbred C57BL/6J mice.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of ethanol teratogenesis. To
      examine this hypothesis, the teratogenic effects of ethanol were compared in
      Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in
      ethanol-induced narcosis. Inbred C57BL/6J (B6) mice were included to confirm
      previously reported teratogenic effects using our own treatment regimen and
      standard assessment technique. Intragastric administration of ethanol (5.8 g/kg) 
      on Days 9 and 10 of pregnancy resulted in growth retardation and an increase in
      prenatal mortality in LS litters but not in SS litters. Therefore, alcohol
      sensitivity plays a role in the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. B6 mice
      showed more ethanol teratogenicity than either LS or SS mice, even though
      maternal blood ethanol levels were similar across genotypes. This result suggests
      genetic variations other than alcohol sensitivity also influence ethanol
      teratogenesis.

PG  - 297-313
AB  - The behaviour of 3-year-old children born preterm was compared with that of
      full-term children of the same age. The preterm group were born between 32 and 37
      weeks gestation, and weighed between 1500 g and 2500 g at birth, and thus (in
      comparison to even earlier, lower birthweight babies) comprised a 'low risk'
      group. The children and their mothers were interviewed at home and information
      obtained about the following: behaviour, the number of accidents requiring
      medical attention, language development, maternal mental health and demographic
      data. The preterm group did not show an excess of behaviour problems overall but 
      they did show significantly more problems when certain individual behaviours were
      considered, namely sleep related problems, tempers and dependence. The preterm
      group had also had significantly more accidents. The nature of the behavioural
      differences suggested they represented styles of parental management rather than 
      neurological impairment in the preterm group. There was no evidence of language
      delay in either group and no significant association between child behaviour and 
      maternal mental health. This study showed that consideration of socioeconomic
      factors is important. Children from manual socioeconomic groups showed
      significantly more behaviour problems than children from non-manual groups, and
      mothers from manual groups had significantly poorer mental health.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-implications in maternal-fetal medicine. A
      hypothesis.
PG  - 51-4
AB  - During the past fifteen years the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has
      become widely recognized as a quite common disorder with a wide range of serious 
      clinical complications (1, 2, 3). This syndrome arises as a result of sleep
      related changes in upper airway muscle function and progressive narrowing of the 
      oropharyngeal lumen. The resulting hypoxia (or asphyxia) leads to an arousal
      response that terminates the initial obstructive event. The exact incidence and
      prevalence of OSAS is currently unknown. Lavie (4) concluded its prevalence to be
      1.26 percent. Others (5, 6) found that the prevalence of heavy regular snoring
      (taken as an index of at least a partially obstructed airway) increased with age 
      including 40 percent of women and 50 percent of men over 60 years of age.
      Polygraphically documented OSAS showed incidence of 0.99 percent in an unselected
      population. Postmenopausal women have frequent episodes. of OSA in contrast with 
      their premenopausal counterparts, who very rarely have any apnea. Since we could 
      not find in the literature any documented OSAS studies in pregnancy, we would
      like to base our hypothesis on our previously published clinical observations and
      our recent findings. In the present paper we would like to suggest that
      pathophysiologic changes of OSAS prolonged throughout many weeks of pregnancy may
      have an adverse effect upon the feto-placental unit.

PG  - 453-5
AB  - A case of severe obstructive sleep apnea developing during pregnancy is reported.
      A 27-year-old primigravida was well until the sixth month of pregnancy, when she 
      developed loud snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography was
      performed at 36 weeks' gestation and revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea. The
      patient was treated successfully during pregnancy with nasal continuous positive 
      airway pressure, but continued to suffer from moderate obstructive sleep apnea
      after delivery. This case suggests that sleep apnea may be either precipitated or
      exacerbated during pregnancy.

TI  - [A study of sleep-waking rhythms based on pattern-recognition of continuous fetal
      heart rate monitoring].
PG  - 1455-62
AB  - Two different rhythms exist in the fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern of a full-term 
      fetus. These rhythms seem to be related to the rhythms associated with sleep and 
      wakefulness, but the results are not yet conclusive. In this study, at first, the
      states of sleep and wakefulness in newborn infants (measured simultaneously by
      EEG, EOG, respiration and body movement) were compared with their heart rate
      patterns in rest, active, awake and unclassified phases. The results suggest that
      in newborn infants it is possible to distinguish quiet sleep from other states of
      sleep and wakefulness by means of the heart rate pattern alone. In the second
      part of the study, NST for three consecutive hours with 24 to 41 week pregnant
      women was performed and examined to determine the relationship between maturity
      and heart rate pattern (measured minute by minute in rest, active and
      unclassified phases) in their fetus. The findings suggest that the rest phase in 
      a heart rate pattern of a fetus indicates the fetus to be in a state of quiet
      sleep. Further, the proportional increase and significant increase in the
      duration of the rest phase after 34 gestational week indicate the maturity of the
      central nervous system of the fetus.

AB  - Mothers in the last trimester of the second pregnancy admit to being less active,
      more tired and moody than previously. Many were more anxious than usual. Their
      first child frequently showed behavioural changes. Those surveyed were between 1 
      1/2 and 4 years of age and showed more clinging, sleep disturbance and
      misbehaviour with tantrums than expected. It is presumed that the mother's
      pregnancy induces anxiety in her child with consequent behavioural changes.

TI  - Circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in four types of
      hypertensive disorder during pregnancy.
PG  - 922-7
AB  - Circadian variations in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide were studied, to
      clarify the characteristic pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension
      (PIH). The mean 24-h values (range) of atrial natriuretic peptide in mild and
      severe PIH, pregnancy-aggravated hypertension, chronic hypertension and normal
      pregnancy were 130.1 (97.3-207.0), 225.4 (202.8-281.8), 213.1 (183.2-249.5), 81.3
      (61.8-116.1) and 77.1 (56.0-123.5) pg/ml, respectively. The values in PIH and
      pregnancy-aggravated hypertension were significantly higher, although those in
      chronic hypertension were no different from normal pregnancy. Plasma atrial
      natriuretic peptide showed a clear circadian rhythm with acrophase in the middle 
      of the night, in mild and severe PIH. In the other hypertensive disorders, a
      circadian rhythm could not be confirmed. The results indicate that the elevated
      values of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in hypertensive disorders during
      pregnancy relate to generalized vasoconstriction, and that the diurnal rhythm is 
      a specific characteristic of PIH.

TI  - Behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to lidocaine in the rat: effects of
      dosage and of gestational age at administration.
PG  - 395-403
AB  - Pregnant Long-Evans hooded rats were dosed via injections into the gum with 3, 6,
      or 9 mg/kg lidocaine, or vehicle, or were uninjected, on gestational day 4 (GD4),
      GD11, or GD18. Offspring (8-11 litters/group) were tested on a variety of tests
      of behavioral development and adult behavior. No effects of any dose at any time 
      of administration were found upon maternal weight gain in gestation, litter size,
      or initial birth weight or weight gain of the pups. Administration at GD4
      produced few effects; only footshock sensitivity showed a significant effect of
      dosing, although there were trends toward dosing effects on spontaneous
      alternation. For administration on GD11, lidocaine was associated with slight but
      significant alterations in sex ratios, and a trend toward drug effects on
      development of spontaneous alternation. Vehicle administration at this age
      reduced barbiturate sleep time in offspring and slightly altered footshock
      sensitivity. Lidocaine dosing on GD18 was associated with a number of significant
      alterations of behavior, including visual discrimination, shuttlebox avoidance,
      tail flick, and water maze errors; there were also both vehicle and lidocaine
      effects on water maze latencies. These data reinforce our previous report that
      lidocaine may be a behavioral teratogen, and suggest that administration in later
      gestation in the rat may alter a broader range of behaviors than earlier in
      gestation.

PG  - 510-5
AB  - Experiences with using the biophysical profile according to Manning et al. in
      diagnosing the danger to the fetus in at risk pregnancy are presented.
      Examinations were carried out in 143 pregnant women. In 33 of them the following 
      parameters were evaluated with respect to the values of the biophysical profile: 
      placental maturity, urinary estriol, term and mode of termination of pregnancy,
      body weight, body length, and Apgar score of newborns. The authors recommend to
      extend this diagnostic method so that in interpreting the results it yields not
      only the overall clinical state of the pregnant woman should be considered but
      also biological rhythms of physiologic functions of the fetus as well the
      administration of drugs to the woman in pregnancy.

TI  - Diurnal variations in unconjugated plasma and total urinary estriol levels in
      late normal pregnancy.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - Diurnal variations in plasma unconjugated estriol and urinary estriol were
      assessed in 12 pregnant women during the 3rd trimester of uncomplicated
      pregnancies. Commercially available 125I-labelled radioimmunoassay kits were
      used. The preliminary data presented here support the hypothesis that there is no
      circadian rhythm of unconjugated plasma estriol in normal late pregnancy. Total
      urinary estriol reaches a nadir during the sleep hours (24.00-6.00). A biological
      carrier 'stick' for estriol measurements might serve as test of choice in the
      monitoring of high-risk pregnancy as well as for identifying pregnancies
      complicated by chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down's syndrome).

AB  - Behavioral state distribution in 19 preterm infants at term with good
      developmental prognosis was studied by 24-h video recordings. The preterm infants
      of shortest gestation had longer time awake and this was concentrated in the
      daytime. On classifying behavioral states by Prechtl's criteria, the preterm
      infants had a smaller amount of state 1 than healthy term infants; but a similar 
      amount of state 5 in awake time. Preterm infants were thought to have accelerated
      development in terms of diurnal sleep-awake rhythm, and decelerated development
      in terms of the content of sleep manifested by the amount of state 1.

TI  - Ontogeny of the circadian rhythm of cortisol in sheep.
PG  - 1137-43
AB  - In this work we investigated the ontogeny of the rhythm of plasma cortisol in
      sheep. Plasma cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay in blood samples obtained
      every 1 or 2 h, for periods of 24 or 48 h, in 13 fetal sheep (124-140 days of
      gestation; 130.6 +/- 1.5, mean +/- SE) and in 23 newborn (5-39 days of age). To
      this end, indwelling polyvinyl catheters were implanted into the femoral artery
      and vein in all animals. The presence of rhythm was determined by Cosinor
      Analysis. Newborns were separated into four groups. Group 1, newborns younger
      than 15 days of age (7.9 +/- 0.7 days), and Group 2, newborns older than 15 days

      3, newborns younger than 15 days of age (11.4 +/- 0.9 days), and Group 4,
      newborns older than 15 days of age (22.0 +/- 1.2 days), were raised under
      constant light conditions. A 24-h rhythm of plasma cortisol (F) was observed in
      newborns over 15 days of age under both nyctohemeral: F (ng/ml) = 16.1 + 7.6 cos 
      [15 (t-12.9)], (p = 0.01, n = 8) and constant light conditions: F (ng/ml) = 17.1 
      + 3.9 cos [15 (t-7.9)], (p = 0.02, n = 5). No rhythm was observed in fetal sheep 
      or in newborn sheep younger than 15 days of age under nyctohemeral or constant
      light conditions.

TI  - [Psychosocial problems posed by families having an infant infected with the HIV
      virus or with AIDS].
PG  - 409-12
AB  - Since the first cases of infantile AIDS, the "status" of the severely ill child
      and his or her family has changed. When faced with this "shameful" disease,
      transmitted by the mother to her child during pregnancy, parents feel compelled
      to hide their children's disease and to bear the tragic burden of emotional and
      social isolation. This fatal and untreatable disease, occurring as the result of 
      an unconventional lifestyle, is responsible for progressive neurologic
      deterioration that makes the child unrecognizable. Sleep and feeding disorders
      make life unbearable. Emotional suffering and feelings of guilt result in highly 
      specific behaviors that must be identified and understood in order to provide
      parents with appropriate support. Pediatricians lack the psychologic and
      sociologic training needed for managing some of these problems and should work
      with specialists in other fields, including social workers and psychologists, in 
      order to evaluate the family's needs and take the appropriate therapeutic or
      preventive steps.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of vasopressin levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the fetus:
      effect of continuous light.
PG  - 3095-101
AB  - We have measured the concentrations of vasopressin in sequential samples of
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from fetal lambs between 108 and 130 days
      gestation. There was a clear and significant (F = 4.46; P less than 0.005) rhythm
      in vasopressin concentrations in the CSF of nine fetuses, characterized by a mean
      trough value of 19.4 +/- 6.4 pg/ml (mean +/- SD) at 0200 h and a peak value of
      41.1 +/- 28.0 pg/ml at 1400 h. The mean cycle length was 23.2 +/- 1.7 h, with the
      majority (greater than 80%) of peak concentrations found during daylight hours.
      There were no concurrent fluctuations in concentrations of vasopressin in plasma 
      or Na, K, Cl, or osmolality in CSF. To examine the relationship between
      environmental cycles of light and darkness and rhythm of vasopressin
      concentrations in CSF, pregnant animals were maintained in a constant light
      environment. In the five fetuses of ewes maintained under these conditions, the
      rhythm of vasopressin in CSF was markedly damped or not apparent (F = 1.50; P
      greater than 0.15). These results demonstrate that prominent circadian rhythm of 
      vasopressin in the CSF of the fetus in utero. Despite the fact that the fetus is 
      sequestered from direct influences of the environment, exposure of the pregnant
      ewe to constant light disrupts the fetal pacemaker that generates the circadian
      rhythm of vasopressin in CSF. Studies of this rhythm in the fetal lamb,
      therefore, provide a means to examine the mechanisms of entrainment and assess
      prenatal influences on circadian organization of the fetus.

TI  - Direct in utero perception of light by the mammalian fetus.
PG  - 151-5
AB  - The primary neural pathway for entrainment of circadian rhythms in rodents is the
      retinohypothalamic tract, which conveys lighting information from the retina to a
      biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In a
      precocious rodent species, the spiny mouse, the retinohypothalamic tract is
      present and functioning within the SCN on the day of birth, as assessed by HRP
      histochemistry and 14C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, respectively.
      Furthermore, direct perception of environmental lighting was observed in fetal
      spiny mice late in gestation. Direct, retina-mediated fetal light perception
      appears to be a less potent entraining agent than maternal cues communicating
      time-of-day information to the fetal spiny mouse. Nevertheless, direct fetal
      light perception may reinforce maternal entraining signals during the prenatal
      period and therefore be of physiological significance for entrainment of
      circadian rhythmicity in the fetus.

PG  - 253-6
AB  - Pregnant albino rats were treated during the eighth day of gestation (GD 8), with
      two IP injections, spaced by 4 hours, of either ethanol (2.9 g/kg in 24% v/v
      saline solution) or saline. Maternal blood alcohol levels reached a peak of 457
      mg/dl 60 min after the second dose. At the age of 45 days, an equal number of
      male and female offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol and sleep time and 
      blood ethanol levels were determined upon awakening. Ethanol metabolic rate was
      studied in other individuals injected with the same dose of ethanol and the slope
      of the linear descending portion of the curves was calculated. Animals that
      received ethanol in utero exhibited shorter sleep time and higher blood ethanol
      levels at the moment of awakening than controls. The rate of ethanol metabolism
      was similar in both groups. These results show that an acute intoxication with
      ethanol during GD 8 induced long-term changes in the CNS of offspring which
      caused reduced sensitivity to ethanol hypnotic effects.

      clock.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - Destruction of the maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) early in gestation
      disrupts maternal communication of time-of-day information to the rat fetus. In
      the present study, we demonstrated that periodic feeding (food cue) to
      SCN-lesioned pregnant rats entrains the fetal biological clock. The phase of the 
      drinking behavior rhythm was examined in pups reared in constant darkness,
      beginning at weaning. In several control (uncued) litters, pup phases at weaning 
      were scattered. In other control litters where within-litter coordination of
      phase was observed, the average litter phase was unpredictable. In contrast,
      drinking rhythms of pups whose dams had received food cue during gestation were
      synchronized within- and between-litters, suggesting that prenatal food cue
      entrained the fetuses. The effect of food cue occurs prenatally, as similar
      results were obtained when offspring of SCN-lesioned, cued dams were fostered to 
      lesioned, uncued dams on the day of birth. The present results, along with data
      from this and other laboratories, suggest that redundant mechanisms communicate
      time-of-day information to the fetus.

TI  - Vibratory acoustic stimulation and the flow velocity waveform in the fetal
      internal carotid artery.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - Eleven healthy fetuses between 36 and 39 weeks of gestation were studied during
      the active sleep state to examine effects of a 5-s vibratory acoustic stimulus on
      the baseline fetal heart rate and flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal
      carotid artery. There was an immediate marked rise in baseline fetal heart rate
      with concomitant drop in pulsatility index in the flow velocity waveform of the
      fetal internal carotid artery, which persisted for at least 15 min after the
      stimulus. However, when the pulsatility index was standardized for a fetal heart 
      rate of 140 beats/min this index remained virtually unaltered. These data suggest
      that in the healthy term fetus during active sleep state, a vibratory acoustic
      stimulus has no measurable effect on cerebral vascular resistance. Since
      virtually all reported studies on vibratory acoustic stimulation of the fetus
      were carried-out during the quiet sleep state, the data from the present study do
      not provide any information on the safety of this device when employed as a means
      of assessing of fetal well-being.

TI  - [The auditory brainstem response].
PG  - 121-7
AB  - In 1967, Sohmer and Feinmesser recorded four negative peaks from extracochlear
      surface electrodes and they stated that the later components may be due to
      repetitive firing of auditory nerve fibers or may be due to the discharge of
      neurons in brain stem auditory nuclei. In 1970, Jewett, Romano and Williston
      presented the first full description of the scalp responses, postulated to be
      generated by brainstem nuclei. Since then, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) 
      technique has attracted attention because it satisfied two previously
      unattainable needs; 1) a means of quantitative measurement of changes in auditory
      function in newborn babies or uncooperative patients, and 2) the detection of
      brainstem neurological abnormalities. Recording during wakefulness and in sleep
      or under drug intoxication has shown that ABRs are independent of the level of
      arousal or attention, and this feature is particularly useful for people unable
      to cooperate appropriately. Because of the close relationship to the anatomy of
      brainstem pathways, ABRs offer a neurophysiological index of neuronal function at
      the level of the brainstem. At present, these responses have become widely
      recognized as an important tool for the diagnosis of neurological diseases. One
      specific feature of the ABR is its dependence on maturation. The ABR appears at
      around 26 weeks of gestation and thereafter undergoes systematic changes in
      latency, amplitude and threshold. By using a supramaximal intensity of more than 
      60 dBHL, it is possible to evoke in all newborn babies with sufficient hearing
      ability, waves I, III and V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Human fetal ductal flow velocity waveforms relative to behavioral states in
      normal term pregnancy.
PG  - 371-4
AB  - In 16 normal pregnancies the relationship between the blood flow velocity
      waveform and fetal behavioral states at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation was studied.
      Whereas behavioral state independency was established for the acceleration time, 
      peak flow velocity demonstrated a statistically significant reduction during
      active sleep, compared with quiet sleep. These data reflect reduced ductal flow
      and suggest a redistribution in the left-ventricular and right-ventricular output
      in favor of the left side of the heart during active sleep. Peak flow velocities 
      in the fetal ductus arteriosus were independent of fetal heart rate.

TI  - Ontogeny of the circadian variation of plasma prolactin in sheep.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - The ontogeny of circadian rhythms is unknown. The newborn sheep has a circadian
      rhythm of temperature; to study the ontogeny of other rhythms, we examined the
      24-h variation of plasma prolactin concentration in fetal and newborn sheep. To
      this effect, we measured plasma prolactin concentration in chronically
      catheterized fetuses (n = 7) and in newborn lambs raised under short day
      nycthemeral (12 light:12 dark, n = 13) or constant light conditions (n = 5).
      Indwelling catheters were implanted into the jugular vein and carotid artery of
      late gestation fetuses (0.9 gestation) and newborns (5-29 days old). Experiments 
      were performed 4 or more days after surgery. Lambs were kept in a canvas sling
      and were fed cow's milk either by mouth or through a nasogastric catheter at
      established time intervals. Haematocrit, pH, and blood gases were measured before
      and after the experiments in all cases and remained within normal values. Lights 
      were on and room temperature was maintained constant during the whole experiment.
      Samples were obtained every 1-2 h for 24 h in fetuses and newborn lambs under
      nycthemeral conditions and every hour for 48 h in newborn lambs kept under
      constant light. Plasma prolactin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The presence
      of a 24 h rhythm was determined by Cosinor analysis. Fetuses, aged 129 +/- 6 days
      (SD) n = 7, showed a variation in plasma prolactin concentration with a period of
      24 h that fits the equation: plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 97.0 + 15.4 cos 15
      (t-23.0), P = 0.035.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Bilateral testicular tumours in congenital adrenal hyperplasia: a continuing
      diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - Bilateral testicular tumours are a rare but well described complication of
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It can be extremely difficult to
      distinguish histologically between Leydig cell tumours and adrenocortical rest
      hyperplasia which may lead in some cases to unnecessary orchidectomy in young
      men. A 26-year-old male in whom CAH had been diagnosed neonatally, was referred
      for further investigation of a craggy mass in the left testis. Six months
      earlier, right orchidectomy had been performed after presentation with bilateral 
      enlarged, hard testes and azoospermia. The tumour was interpreted to be a
      malignant interstitial cell tumour of the testis. Our investigations revealed
      that his CAH was inadequately controlled and that the hormonal secretion from the
      remaining left testicular mass was ACTH dependent. Percutaneous venous sampling
      revealed high concentrations of cortisol and other adrenocortical hormones coming
      from the gonadal vein. Dexamethasone suppressed these adrenal hormones and
      reduced the size and softened the consistency of the testicular mass. Total
      disappearance of the mass was achieved by using dexamethasone, given in a reverse
      circadian rhythm regimen. Spermatogenesis returned and the patient's wife became 
      pregnant after 6 months; she gave birth to a normal male infant. To our
      knowledge, this is the first time in this clinical setting that fertility has
      been achieved. This case highlights the need for both a functional and
      histological assessment of such 'tumours' in CAH prior to orchidectomy.

TI  - What happens to babies exposed to phencyclidine (PCP) in utero?
PG  - 31-9
AB  - Fifty-seven infants exposed to phencyclidine (PCP) in utero were followed for the
      first year of life. Thirty-six (65%) of the 55 for whom birth records were
      available manifested symptoms of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome, including
      16 (52%) of those whose mothers denied opiate abuse during pregnancy. Temperament
      problems were noted in 47% of the babies and sleep problems in 14%. The majority 
      of infants grew normally, but a larger than expected number started out small and
      remained small. Testing using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age one 
      year revealed a mental development index (mean +/- SD) of 94 +/- 10 and a
      psychomotor development index of 98 +/- 10. Attachment behavior was abnormal in
      17%. Most infants were cared for by their natural mother. Further studies are
      needed to determine later effects of in utero PCP exposure, as well as effects on
      the infants being raised by women who have used PCP. Phencyclidine toxicity needs
      to be considered when evaluating babies with signs of neonatal narcotic
      withdrawal syndrome.

TI  - Significance of exercise and bed rest in pregnancy--pregnancy and walking (1).
PG  - 13-9
AB  - Prior to evaluating the significance of bed rest in managing obstetric diseases, 
      characteristics of physiology of pregnant women were examined on the basis of 24 
      hours heart rate changes in eight pregnant women at the third trimester and also 
      distances covered in walking by a total of 53 multiparas and of 87 primiparas
      during free-living daily activities were measured by means of a pedometer. A
      significantly higher mean heart rate was observed in those pregnant women even
      during sleep than in non-pregnant control. The primiparas showed significant
      decreases in the pedometer readings in all stages except for 15-27 weeks of
      gestation, while the multiparas of less than 28 weeks exhibited no decrease as
      compared with non-pregnant control. The decrease in the pedometer readings were
      marked in both primiparas and multiparas, the value being much lower than that of
      any other week of gestation. However, the equation of weight x distance covered
      in walking remains rather constant throughout gestation.

TI  - Alterations in offspring behavior induced by chronic prenatal cocaine dosing.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - Sperm-positive female Long-Evans hooded rats were dosed subcutaneously with 10
      mg/kg/day cocaine or an equal volume of vehicle (0.9% sterile saline) from
      gestation day 4 (GD4) through GD18. Offspring were assessed for development of
      negative geotaxis, righting reflex, spontaneous alternation, and open field
      activity, and for adult behaviors including DRL-20 acquisition, water maze,
      visual discrimination, barbiturate sleep time, shuttlebox avoidance, footshock
      sensitivity, and tail flick latency. Cocaine dosing produced no significant
      effects on dam weight gain, any measure of litter size and weight, or early
      postnatal behavioral tests, but there were significant drug effects on
      development of spontaneous alternation, development of open field activity,
      DRL-20 acquisition, water maze performance, tail flick, and footshock
      sensitivity. These data suggest that chronic administration of a modest dose of
      cocaine during gestation in the rat alters a number of behaviors in the
      offspring.

TI  - Serum ferritin levels after multivitamin iron ingestion during teenage pregnancy.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - The postabsorptive serum ferritin levels following normal dosages of prenatal
      multivitamin/multimineral supplements were studied in 17 pregnant teenagers,
      whose fetuses were between 16 and 20 weeks gestational age. The purpose of the
      study was to determine the effect of a single oral dose of differing prenatal
      multivitamin/multimineral tablets containing 60 or 65 mg of elemental iron on the
      postabsorptive serum ferritin levels. Each woman was randomly tested following
      the ingestion of one of three different tablets, both in a fed and a fasting
      state. Blood samples were obtained for ferritin measurement immediately prior to 
      ingestion of the prenatal tablet, with or without a standard meal, and at 1, 3,
      6, and 8 hours postabsorption. The group mean serum ferritin levels increased
      dramatically during the fasting state following ingestion of the Stuart Prenatal 
      tablet and decreased when the Stuartnatal 1 + 1 or Materna 1.60 was ingested. The
      opposite results were observed when the tablets were ingested postprandially. The
      results of the study indicate that Stuart Prenatal was most suitable for
      consumption while fasting (ie, at the hour of sleep), and both Stuartnatal 1 + 1 
      and Materna 1.60 with a meal.

TI  - Genetic influences on brain growth restriction induced by development exposure to
      alcohol.
PG  - 321-34
AB  - Genetic factors have been implicated as contributing to the considerable
      variation in the severity of alcohol-related birth defects in offspring of women 
      who drink heavily during pregnancy. Two animal models of alcohol-related
      developmental effects incorporated different behavior genetic approaches to
      examine genetic influences on brain and body growth following alcohol exposure
      during development. The first, extensively developed in Sprague-Dawley rats,
      examined the effects of three doses of alcohol administered to two inbred rat
      strains (MR and M520) via artificial-rearing procedures during the early
      postnatal brain growth spurt. In both strains, alcohol produced a dose-dependent 
      restriction of brain weight (but not body weight) on postnatal day 10, compared
      to artificially reared controls. The MR strain was more susceptible to cerebellar
      growth restriction than the M520 strain, an effect not attributable to strain
      differences in blood alcohol concentrations. In the second model, pregnant female
      Long-sleep and Short-sleep mice, selectively bred for differences in initial
      sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of acute alcohol administration, were
      intubated with ethanol from gestational days 7-18. Controls included either
      sucrose or maltose/dextrin intubation controls and non-intubated controls. The LS
      offspring showed growth deficits and brain weight reductions in adulthood, while 
      the SS offspring were resistant to these detrimental effects of the prenatal
      alcohol exposure. Thus, differences in either maternal or fetal genotype may
      contribute to individual differences in the severity of the effects of alcohol
      exposure during development.

      opposite-sex twin pair.
PG  - 49-56
AB  - A pair of preterm, opposite-sex twins were examined during the lying-in period
      for behavioral and morphological effects of maternal alcohol and pentazocine
      abuse during pregnancy. A few morphological features typical of fetal alcohol
      syndrome were observed in each infant, and the male infant only was above the
      standardized mean in minor physical anomalies. The male's behavioral scores were 
      more likely to be deviant from the standardized mean than the female's.
      Specifically, the male was more irritable, both spontaneously and in response to 
      specific stimuli; highly active while awake and handled for the presentation of
      stimuli; more active than average during sleep; and low on ratings that reflect
      the attitude of the examiner toward the infant. These findings imply individual
      and gender differences in behavioral susceptibility to teratogens.

PG  - 259-67
AB  - Time of delivery was studied in normal (N) or enucleated (E) rats. Isolated
      (1/cage) at mating (day 1 of gestation), they were all anaesthetized on day 8 and
      some of them were then blinded. After anaesthesia, they were kept either alone (N
      and E) or in homogeneous (NN and EE) and heterogeneous (NE) pairs either under a 
      12L-12D or a 2L-22D light-dark (LD) cycle. Activity, monitored throughout the
      rest of pregnancy in 2 homogeneous (NN and EE) and heterogeneous (NE) pairs of
      rats, kept a marked circadian rhythm under each light regimen. Birth
      distributions differed according to LD cycle in normal (N or NN) but not in
      enucleated (E and EE) rats. Under the 12L-12D regimen, parturitions of N and E
      rats were divided into 2 parts, the majority occurred on the afternoon of day 22 
      before 21:00 h, the remainder were observed after 6:00 h on day 23. Under the
      2L-22D regimen, N rats gave birth over one period, mainly on day 23, whereas E
      rats had the same birth distribution as those subjected to the 12L-12D LD cycle. 
      In heterogeneous pairs of rats (NE), birth times were affected by photoperiod;
      under the 2L-22D regimen it was intermediate between those of homogeneous pairs
      (NN and EE). These results indicate that the eyes were the first link of the
      nervous chain by which photoperiod influenced birth time. Social conditions may
      also modulate the photodependent mechanism in ways which remain to be determined.

TI  - Physiologic role of endogenous human atrial natriuretic peptide in preeclamptic
      pregnancies.
PG  - 155-9
AB  - To assess the effect of endogenous human atrial natriuretic peptide on the
      vascular system in preeclampsia, the circadian variations of plasma human atrial 
      natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate, cyclic adenosine
      3'5'-monophosphate, and blood pressure were measured. In severe preeclamptic
      women, the mean 24-hour values of human atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic
      guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate rose significantly compared with those in normal
      nonpregnant and pregnant women. Also, in severe preeclamptic women, circadian
      variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine
      3'5'-monophosphate, and blood pressure confirmed the same circadian rhythm with
      acrophase during the middle of the night. Plasma cyclic adenosine
      3'5'-monophosphate values did not differ significantly among the three groups and
      did not confirm a circadian rhythm. These results suggest that plasma human
      atrial natriuretic peptide may not strongly influence blood pressure, although it
      may induce the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles via the cyclic guanosine
      3'5'-monophosphate system in preeclampsia.

TI  - Ethanol teratogenesis in mice selected for differences in alcohol sensitivity.
PG  - 513-9
AB  - Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in
      ethanol-induced narcosis, were administered ethanol (2.9, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0 g/kg) 
      twice per day during the period of organogenesis. On gestation day 18, the dams
      were sacrificed and the uterine horns were examined for live, dead, and resorbed 
      fetuses. Live fetuses were weighed and assessed for either skeletal or soft
      tissue anomalies. The 5.8 g/kg/day dose had no effect on prenatal mortality,
      litter size, body weight, or number of physical anomalies in either line.
      However, the alcohol-sensitive LS mice exposed to ethanol doses of 8.0 g/kg/day
      or more evidenced decreased body weights while weights for the
      alcohol-insensitive SS mice differed from controls at only the highest dose
      tested. The incidence of skeletal variants was increased in the LS mice exposed
      to the 10 g/kg/day ethanol dose. These results indicate genetically-mediated
      alcohol sensitivity increases susceptibility to some of the fetotoxic effects of 
      in utero alcohol exposure.

TI  - Alterations in maternal plasma corticosterone levels following treatment with
      phenytoin.
PG  - 24-32
AB  - The mechanisms of the embryotoxic effects of the anticonvulsant drug, phenytoin
      (PHT), are unknown. Glucocorticoids and PHT demonstrate similar embryopathic
      effects and strain sensitivity in that A/J mice are very sensitive to the
      embryopathic effects of synthetic glucocorticoids and PHT while C57BL/6 (B6) mice
      are comparatively resistant to both. It is possible that teratogenic consequences
      of PHT are not a result of drug interaction at the target site but are mediated
      indirectly by glucocorticoids. In this study, PHT was administered by
      intraperitoneal injection at 25 (a nonteratogenic dose) or 75 mg/kg body weight
      (a teratogenic dose) to pregnant A/J mice on Day 10 of gestation. Mice of the B6 
      strain received the drug at 75 mg/kg on Day 10. Control mice received vehicle (pH
      11.0 distilled water). Dams were killed at various times after the injection;
      plasma samples were obtained, and corticosterone levels were determined by
      radioimmunoassay. In control animals, maternal plasma corticosterone levels were 
      elevated soon after dosing but gradually declined, except for an apparent
      circadian rhythm effect seen in samples obtained in the afternoon. Administration
      of a nonteratogenic dose of PHT to A/J mice caused a temporary increase in plasma
      corticosterone levels which decreased to the control level between 6 and 24 hr
      following dosing. Treatment with a teratogenic dose in A/J mice led to plasma
      levels that remained elevated for the entire 48-hr period examined in this study.
      In B6 mice, treatment with 75 mg/kg increased plasma corticosterone levels for 24
      hr, after which they declined to the control value by 30 hr. The adrenal
      corticosteroid response of A/J mice to PHT appeared to be much more sensitive
      than that of B6 mice, and there appeared to be a relationship between plasma
      levels of PHT and corticosterone. The lengthy increase in plasma corticosterone
      during organogenesis may be a factor in the increased incidence of cleft lip and 
      palate seen after administration of PHT to A/J mice.

TI  - Cholinergic influences on sleep-wake patterns and breathing movements in the
      fetus.
PG  - 372-8
AB  - Fetal lambs were prepared for chronic intrauterine recording of behavioral states
      and breathing movements during the third trimester of pregnancy. Pilocarpine
      administered directly to the fetus produced an immediate change from quiet sleep 
      to arousal. Neither the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep nor the
      latency to REM sleep was affected. Associated with this change in sleep-wake
      patterns, pilocarpine produced a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of
      fetal breathing movements. These effects of pilocarpine on behavioral states and 
      breathing movements were blocked by atropine sulfate but not by methylatropine.
      We conclude that the increased incidence of breathing movements produced by
      pilocarpine are due, in part, to increased arousal at the expense of quiet sleep.
      As a result, the fetus alternates between arousal and REM sleep, and this
      behavioral pattern results in sustained breathing movements. In addition,
      pilocarpine increases the incidence of breathing movements in all three
      behavioral states. These effects of pilocarpine are mediated primarily via
      central muscarinic sites of action.

TI  - Entrainment of hamster pup circadian rhythms by prenatal melatonin injections to 
      the mother.
PG  - R439-48
AB  - A circadian pacemaker, thought to be within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of 
      the hypothalamus, begins to function before birth in rodents. Prenatal
      entrainment of the pacemaker appears to be mediated by signals regulated by the
      maternal SCN; ablation of the mother's SCN during gestation disrupts the normal
      phase of the pups' rhythms. The present paper presents an experimental approach
      for identifying candidate entraining signals and for testing when they are
      effective during development. The candidate signal examined in these experiments 
      was the pineal gland hormone, melatonin. Female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus
      auratus) received SCN lesions on day 7 of gestation. During the last week of
      gestation, they were given two daily subcutaneous injections of oil 12 h apart.
      One of the injections each day contained melatonin (10, 50, or 100 micrograms).
      The phases of the pups' activity rhythms were measured at weaning and were found 
      to be related to the timing of the daily injection that contained melatonin,
      demonstrating that the melatonin directly or indirectly set the phase of the
      pups' rhythms. Injections given over 4 days of gestation were found to be as
      effective as injections given over 7 days. Although a physiological role for
      melatonin as an entraining signal has not been demonstrated, the results show
      that exogenous, prenatal treatment can predictably set the phase of the
      offsprings' circadian rhythms.

TI  - The effects of prenatal alcohol and marijuana exposure: disturbances in neonatal 
      sleep cycling and arousal.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Neonatal EEG and sleep findings are presented from a longitudinal study of the
      effects of maternal alcohol and marijuana use during pregnancy. Infant outcome
      has been examined relative to the trimester(s) of pregnancy during which use
      occurred. Disturbances in sleep cycling, motility, and arousals were noted that
      were both substance and trimester specific. Alcohol consumed during the first
      trimester of pregnancy was associated with disruptions in sleep and arousal,
      whereas marijuana use affected sleep and motility regardless of the trimester in 
      which it was used. Although these findings are preliminary and based on a small
      sample of women exhibiting only moderate substance use during pregnancy, they do 
      suggest that specific neurophysiological systems may be differentially affected
      by prenatal alcohol or marijuana exposure even in the absence of morphological
      abnormalities.

TI  - Development of sleep states in normal premature and full-term newborns.
PG  - 431-44
AB  - THE AIMS OF OUR STUDY WERE: 1) to answer the question "Do sleep states exist in
      normal premature infants;" 2) to analyze the development of sleep cycle and sleep
      state characteristics in premature and full-term newborns. Polygraph recordings
      were done on 38 normal, appropriate for gestational age newborns, born at 30 to
      41 weeks (w) of gestation. All infants fell asleep in active sleep (AS).
      Postwaking AS was significantly shorter than the next AS. Mean sleep cycle
      duration increased from approximately 46 min at 31-34 w of conceptional age (CA) 
      to 70 min. at 35-36 w CA. In all infants we observed stable, greater than 5 min
      AS and quiet sleep (QS) periods, as defined by EEG and REM criteria.
      Indeterminate sleep was about 30% of the total sleep cycle at 31-34 w; it
      decreased to 12% at 35-36 w. Both duration and percentage of AS and QS
      significantly increased at 35-36 w and remained stable up to 39-41 w CA. Values
      of QS were significantly reduced when defined by additional criteria (respiratory
      rate, tonic chin EMG or motility). Concordance of QS criteria was not
      significantly better in older versus younger groups of infants. At all ages, AS
      values were insensitive to changes in the criteria chosen to define them. The
      contrast, starting from 31-34 w CA, between AS and QS as defined by EEG and REM
      criteria could account for state differences in the control of many physiological
      variables in prematures.

TI  - Development of a fetal circadian rhythm after disruption of the maternal
      circadian system.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - The role of maternal circadian rhythms in the development of the fetal circadian 
      system was investigated in the rat. Pregnant females were subjected to procedures
      known to disrupt circadian function, ablation of the maternal suprachiasmatic
      nuclei (SCN) or housing in constant illumination, on gestational day 10.
      Circadian function was assessed in fetuses at gestational day 22 by analysis of
      glucose utilization in hypothalamic slices in vitro using the 2-deoxyglucose
      method. Fetuses from control females exhibit a robust rhythm in glucose
      utilization in the SCN. In contrast, the SCN of fetuses from females with SCN
      lesions, or housed in constant illumination, show no significant day-night
      difference in glucose utilization. Analysis of individual brains indicates,
      however, that this apparent disruption in the development of circadian
      rhythmicity in metabolism in the fetal SCN is due to a desynchronization of
      individual fetuses resulting from the loss of maternal entraining influences.
      Thus, the fetal SCN is capable of developing a circadian rhythm in glucose
      utilization independent of the maternal circadian system.

TI  - Sleep in craniopagus twins.
PG  - 301-6
AB  - Two craniopagus twins sharing some common cerebral circulation but no common
      brain structures were recorded polygraphically and continuously observed for
      behavioral sleep states and wakefulness. The observations lasted 9.5 h when the
      twins were 12 weeks postgestation and for 24 h at 16 weeks post gestation, or
      approximately 4 weeks postterm. Sleep onsets were synchronous 67% of the time
      (+/- 5 min), but arousals were synchronous only 38% of the time (+/- 5 min) at 16
      weeks postgestation. The recordings reported here are the longest ever made of
      craniopagus twins. This report is consistent with some interdependence of the
      sleep of each twin on the other. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

PG  - 541-8
AB  - The development of fetal behaviour is reviewed. Fetal cutaneous and muscle
      sensory receptors are developed by the time movements are first seen. Human
      infants certainly respond to painful stimuli at 28 weeks. There is no clear
      evidence that prenatal "stress," e.g., maternal exposure to random noise and
      bright lights, impairs fetal development in the rat, on the contrary. Fetal
      diurnal rhythms appear in man and sheep before the development of sleep states;
      they are dependent on maternal corticosteroids, but the fetal mechanism is
      uncertain. With the development of sleep states (in late gestation in man and
      sheep, postnatally in the rat), the complex central control of behaviour is
      gradually established, but wakefulness is still of low incidence. The location of
      the sleep cycle generator is uncertain; the results of experimental lesions of
      the brainstem in fetal lambs appear incompatible with studies in adult rats and
      cats.

TI  - Prenatal morphine exposure and sleep-wake disturbances in the fetus.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - We have previously shown that acute exposure to low-dose morphine stimulates
      arousal and breathing movements in the fetal lamb. We now report on the effects
      of subacute low-dose morphine exposure on the regulation of fetal sleep-wake
      behavior and breathing patterns. Morphine was infused to 11 fetal lambs (121-129 
      days gestation) at a constant rate of 400 micrograms/h for 7 days via a mini
      osmotic pump implanted subcutaneously in the maternal flank and connected
      directly to an indwelling catheter in the fetal vena cava. On day 1, morphine
      resulted in a state of arousal in all fetuses, with loss of quiet sleep and rapid
      eye movement (REM) sleep. This response was greatly reduced by day 2 and was
      insignificant by day 3, despite continuous drug exposure. There was no decrease
      in plasma morphine levels. Two fetuses died during morphine exposure. Upon
      removal of the pump, all fetuses exhibited disturbances in their sleep cycles
      within 1-3 h, with an increase in arousal time and loss of REM sleep. The
      duration of the arousal and quiet sleep episodes was also greatly reduced. Such
      disturbances were noted for 3-4 days after termination of morphine infusion. Four
      fetuses were delivered prematurely (131-136 days) during this period. These
      results demonstrate the rapid onset of tolerance to low-dose morphine exposure in
      the fetus and the development of physical dependence, as manifested by a mild
      abstinence syndrome characterized by sleep-wake disturbances.

TI  - Development of hamster circadian rhythms: role of the maternal suprachiasmatic
      nucleus.
PG  - 601-10
AB  - During development, the circadian rhythms of rodents become entrained to
      rhythmicity of the mother. Rhythms in behavior and in neuroendocrine function are
      regulated by a circadian pacemaker thought to be located within the
      suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Evidence indicates that this
      pacemaker begins to function and to be entrained by maternal rhythms before
      birth. Although the maternal rhythms which mediate prenatal entrainment of the
      fetal circadian pacemaker have not been identified, it is likely that they are
      regulated by the maternal SCN. The role of the maternal SCN in entrainment of the
      offspring was examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) by measuring the
      activity/rest rhythms of pups. Using the synchrony among the rhythms of pups
      within a litter as an indication that the pups had been entrained, the effect on 
      entrainment of ablating the maternal SCN was determined. Lesions of the maternal 
      SCN which were performed early in gestation (day 7) and which destroyed at least 
      75% of the SCN were found to disrupt the normal within litter synchrony among
      pups, indicating interference with the normal mechanism of entrainment. The
      effect of lesions on day 7 of gestation could mean that the maternal SCN is
      important for entrainment of the pups before birth, after birth, or during both
      of these times. To determine if the maternal SCN is specifically important for
      prenatal entrainment, lesions were performed two days before birth on day 14 of
      gestation. Lesions of the maternal SCN on day 14 were not as disruptive as were
      lesions on day 7. This suggests that the maternal SCN is important between days 7
      and 14 of gestation and that the synchrony normally observed at weaning is
      already established, in part, on or before day 14 of gestation. This further
      suggests that an entrainable circadian pacemaker is present in the fetus only two
      weeks after fertilization.

PG  - 217-25
AB  - On 25-30-day rabbit foetuses, in chronic experiments using constant synchronous
      recording of the motor activity and heart rate, studies have been made of
      temporal organization of the activity-rest cycle. Already in 25-day foetus, three
      functional conditions may be distinguished: active, intermediate and resting
      ones, the duration of the latter increasing to the end of gestation up to 8-10
      min, whereas the duration of the intermediate phase decreases, reaching its
      minimum to the 30th day if not being completely reduced. Cyclic pattern of active
      and resting phases is observed in 28-day foetuses; to the 29th-30th day, these
      phases from a unique activity-rest cycle, its duration reaching 20-30 min to the 
      end of intrauterine period. It is suggested that the resting phase in foetal
      rabbits serves as a basis for the development of polyphasic sleep in adult
      animals.

AB  - A case of sleep apnoea syndrome in a pregnant patient is reported here. For
      obstetric reasons, and because of the possibility that a metabolic and
      respiratory acidosis associated with the apnoea syndrome might have developed, we
      decided to do a caesarian section. Orotracheal intubation was particularly
      difficult because of the patient's abnormal mandibular, palatal and
      retropharyngeal shape, which was probably the underlying cause of the apnoeic
      syndrome.

PG  - 240-3
AB  - Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) was analysed in 25 pregnant women with
      trisomy 21 foetuses whose chromosomal aberration was recognized by cytogenetic
      study after amniocentesis. Enzyme investigation was performed at 20-22 weeks of
      gestation using cytochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-nine women at the
      same stage of normal pregnancies were selected as controls. In parallel, each
      mother was karyotyped. Ten subjects from each series underwent biochemical and
      immunological investigation: measurement of enzyme levels, thermostability study 
      and immunological tests with alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme antibodies. NAP from 
      pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses was characterized by: (1) a lower rate of
      enzyme activity, (2) a large amount of heat-stable enzyme (T = 56 degrees C for
      biochemical assays, T = 85 degrees C for cytochemical tests), and (3) a marked
      loss of liver antigenicity. These findings suggest the presence in trisomy 21
      pregnancies of a non-specific alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme which appears as an 
      "enzyme marker" in maternal circulating neutrophils.

TI  - Overnight and basal metabolic rates in men and women.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - The FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for energy requirements assume that the energy
      cost of sleep is equal to the basal metabolic rate (BMR). We have tested the
      validity of this assumption by analysing overnight and BMR measurements made by
      whole-body indirect calorimetry. Data from 80 healthy subjects measured on a
      total of 246 occasions have been used. In a subgroup of 40 normal lean subjects
      the mean ratio of overnight metabolic rate (Overnight MR): BMR was 0.95 (range
      0.85 - 1.02, s.d. 0.04). The mean ratio of lowest sleeping metabolic rate (Lowest
      SMR): BMR was 0.88 (range 0.83 - 0.96, s.d. 0.04). Ratios of Overnight MR: BMR
      were not significantly affected by different levels of exercise on the preceding 
      day. This ratio was significantly higher for subjects who were obese, late
      pregnant or attached to ECG electrodes. With the exception of the late pregnant
      subjects these groups had the same Lowest SMR:BMR ratios as the normal lean
      subjects, indicating that the higher Overnight MR was caused by disturbed sleep. 
      The data suggest that the use of BMR to estimate overnight energy expenditure
      would introduce an average overestimate of approximately 5 per cent during the
      actual hours of sleep, but that when applied over 24 h the error becomes
      negligible.

TI  - Fetal acoustic stimulation testing. III. Predictive value of a reactive test.
PG  - 217-8
AB  - The nonstress test (NST) is a helpful adjunct to the management of high-risk
      pregnancies. However, fetal sleep states may lead to falsely nonreactive tests.
      We assessed the usefulness of transabdominal acoustic stimulation of the fetus
      and demonstrated an approximately 50% reduction in the number of nonreactive
      tests and a shorter testing time. No change in the predictive reliability of a
      reactive test was observed. With regard to the intrapartum and neonatal outcome
      in women delivering within seven days of a reactive test, no difference between
      the incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, depressed one- or five-minute
      Apgar scores or operative intervention for fetal distress could be identified. A 
      reactive test evoked by acoustic stimulation is as reliable as the NST. It offers
      the additional benefits of reduced testing time and a lower incidence of
      nonreactive tests.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and blood
      pressure during the third trimester in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies.
PG  - 393-9
AB  - The influence of pregnancy on circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic
      peptide and aldosterone was studied. In those women with normal pregnancies, the 
      mean 24-hour values of atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone increased,
      compared with the levels in normal nonpregnant subjects. In cases of severe
      preeclampsia, levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher than
      in the other subjects, but aldosterone levels decreased to nearly those seen in
      the nonpregnant subjects. Atrial natriuretic peptide did not establish a rhythm
      in normal nonpregnant and pregnant subjects, but in the studies of aldosterone
      levels, a clear circadian rhythm was evident. In severe cases of preeclampsia,
      atrial natriuretic peptide established a circadian rhythm similar to that of
      blood pressure, and the circadian rhythm of aldosterone disappeared. The main
      characteristic of the rhythm in atrial natriuretic peptide and blood pressure in 
      women showing preeclamptic signs is that the acrophase occurred at midnight. This
      evidence suggests that in women with symptoms of preeclampsia the load to the
      atria increases at midnight.

TI  - Diurnal variations in unconjugated oestriol levels during early pregnancy and
      their relation to maternal cortisol levels.
PG  - 169-77
AB  - We studied maternal plasma levels of oestriol (measured by radioimmunoassay) and 
      total cortisol (measured by a protein binding method) in 11 women from 8 to 22
      weeks gestation. Blood specimens (5 ml) were drawn over a 24-h period at 60 and
      30 min intervals. The diurnal rhythm of cortisol with higher values in the
      morning than in the afternoon and evening was present at all gestational ages
      studied. Unconjugated plasma oestriol showed a similar circadian rhythm to
      maternal cortisol (r = 0.576, P less than 0.01) in the 8th week. From the 9th to 
      the 11th week oestriol values rose and there was no evidence of a circadian
      rhythm. In the 12th week plasma oestriol again showed a circadian rhythm, with
      higher values at night (117.3 +/- 9.5 pg/ml) than during day-time (104 +/- 7.5
      pg/ml, P less than 0.001). This pattern remained until the 22nd week, when plasma
      oestriol levels at night (3.78 +/- 0.49 ng/ml) were markedly higher than in the
      day-time (3.16 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, P less than 0.001). An inverse relation between
      oestriol and cortisol levels as shown in late human pregnancy could not be
      demonstrated for the early stages we studied. The interval between rising
      cortisol and falling oestriol levels decreased from 6 h in the 12th week to 3.5 h
      in the 22nd week of gestation. This suggests an increasing sensitivity of the
      fetal hypothalamus to the feedback effect of maternal cortisol.

TI  - Sexual abuse: somatic and emotional reactions.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted
      to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer
      from symptoms similar to the "rape trauma syndrome," which has been reported in
      adults. Symptoms similar to the rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72
      abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p less than .01. Common
      somatic complaints in the sexual abuse patients included dysuria, vaginal
      discharge and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral
      problems noted during the follow-up period among the sexual abuse patients
      included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts. The duration of 
      abuse and age of the victim at the time of abuse significantly affected the
      frequency of reported somatic symptoms, but the type of abuse and type of
      assailant did not significantly affect the frequency of reported somatic and
      emotional reactions. There was no difference in the occurrence of school problems
      and early pregnancy between sexually abused patients and controls. Since 67% of
      all sexually abused patients suffered from emotional and somatic reactions, close
      follow-up of these patients is indicated.

TI  - Endocrine changes, with special emphasis on oestradiol-17 beta, prolactin and
      oxytocin, before and during labour and delivery in goats.
PG  - 299-308
AB  - Jugular plasma concentrations of oestradiol-17 beta, prolactin, progesterone and 
      13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGFM) were measured at 2-h
      intervals during the last 4 days of pregnancy in 6 goats. During advanced labour 
      and delivery, samples were obtained more frequently and assayed for oxytocin. The
      animals were housed in a barn with continuous dim lighting. A distinct pattern of
      oscillation in prolactin concentrations, with peaks during the late afternoon,
      was apparent during the last 3 days. Geometric means of peak concentrations
      doubled each day and became of longer duration; night-time nadir values remained 
      low except during the last night before parturition. A progressive increase in
      oestradiol-17 beta, with mean levels doubling every 36 h, was apparent during the
      last 3 days. There was no sharp pre-partum increase in oestradiol-17 beta.
      Correlated (r = 0.83) with the increase in oestradiol-17 beta was a gradual
      increase in PGFM and when the latter reached approximately 1000 pg/ml, the
      non-reversible decline in progesterone reflecting pre-partum luteolysis occurred.
      Subsequent changes in PGFM related closely to an approximately 20-fold increase
      in the ratio of oestradiol-17 beta to progesterone until maximal PGFM levels of
      26.5 +/- 4.2 ng/ml were reached at delivery. Basal concentrations of oxytocin
      (8-15 microU/ml) were measured before the last 60 min and markedly higher, though
      erratic, concentrations were detected at various times before appearance of the
      allantochorion. Maximal oxytocin values (range 180-1570 microU/ml) occurred
      within minutes before or after delivery of the first fetus. The results suggest
      that increased pre-partum production of oestradiol-17 beta, in addition to
      provoking sufficient release of prostaglandins to cause luteolysis, may modulate 
      either the sensitivity or set-points for an endogenous rhythm in prolactin
      secretion at the end of pregnancy. The nature of the oxytocin changes suggest
      that, after labour has evolved sufficiently, delivery is precipitated by an
      abrupt increase in oxytocin secretion.

TI  - Computerized analysis of behavioural states in asymmetrical growth retarded
      fetuses.
PG  - 357-63
AB  - The fetal behaviour of 15 asymmetrical intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR)
      fetuses was compared to that of a control group of healthy fetuses. Fetuses
      underwent simultaneous cardiotocographic and ultrasonographic examinations for 2 
      consecutive hours at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Behavioural states analysis was
      carried out by means of a computerized system (Digital PDP 11) that allowed the
      recording of several fetal variables including heart rate (FHR), gross body
      movements (FM), eye movements (FEM) and breathing movements (FBM). FHR was
      classified in four different patterns (FHRP) according to Nijhuis et al.; fetal
      movements were automatically synchronized with FHR and grouped for each FHRP.
      Several quantitative parameters (i.e. incidence, mean duration, lag time, % time 
      spent moving) were then computed for each movement. There were no statistical
      differences in the distribution of FHRP between healthy and IUGR fetuses. On the 
      other hand quantitative differences were found when the movements investigated
      were related to FHRP. In IUGR fetuses FEM were mainly represented by low
      frequency movements (IEM) during both low (FHRP A) and high variability (FHRP B) 
      FHRP, whereas healthy fetuses exhibited mostly rapid eye movements (REM) during
      FHRP B and absent type of FEM during FHRP A. Moreover IUGR fetuses showed a
      reduction of state 1F (quiet sleep) and an increase of periods of no coincidence 
      between behavioural state variable when compared to the control group fetuses.
      These findings, therefore suggest the existence of quantitative differences in
      fetal behaviour in asymmetrical IUGR fetuses when compared to healthy fetuses.

TI  - [Fetal respiratory movements].
PG  - 207-12
AB  - In the human species, foetal breathing movements are detectable from the
      fifteenth week of gestation and their incidence increases until the start of the 
      third trimester. Over the last 10 weeks, breathing movements are present for 30% 
      of the time. These are contemporaneous with body and ocular movements, suggesting
      an association between breathing movements and paradoxical sleep, as has been
      seen in the foetal lamb. These phases of activity alternate with phases of foetal
      immobility during which breathing movements are often absent. The incidence of
      foetal movements rises in the late post-prandial period, under the effect of
      maternal hyperglycaemia. After the establishment of regular uterine contractions,
      foetal breathing movements disappear, perhaps under the effect of prostaglandins 
      E2 and/or a reduction in placental blood flow. Maternal hypercapnia leads to a
      rise in foetal breathing movements, which corresponds in the animal to the
      paradoxical sleep state. In the foetal lamb, hypoxaemia is accompanied by a
      cessation of breathing movements coinciding with a passage to quiet sleep. It is 
      probable that the human foetus produces a similar reaction to hypoxaemia. During 
      quiet sleep an inhibition of the respiratory centres would exist, disappearing
      during paradoxical sleep. Alcohol and certain anaesthetic agents lead to an
      inhibition of foetal breathing movements. The effect of tobacco remains
      controversial. The role of foetal breathing movements in pulmonary maturation is 
      discussed in the human species.

TI  - Seasonality of reproduction in sheep and its control by photoperiod.
PG  - 69-85
AB  - Seasonality of the reproductive cycle in sheep is a general phenomenon for
      mid-latitude breeds. The proximal part (breeding season) and also partially
      distal part (end of gestation and beginning of lactation) of this cycle is
      controlled by photoperiod, whatever the form of light regimens. Data are
      presented which indicate that male and female do not necessarily have the same
      photoperiodic sensitivity. Gonadal stimulation in the ram starts 1.5-2 months
      earlier than in the ewe under annual variations. Photoperiod controls the
      reproductive cycle by the intermediary of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. There
      are both a steroid-independent and a steroid-dependent effect of light, depending
      on both decreasing and increasing daylength in mid-latitudes. Data are also
      presented which support Bunning's hypothesis on photoperiodic time measurement in
      mammals. Sheep measure photoperiodic time by using a circadian rhythm of
      photosensitivity. Daylength is not measured by the total duration of exposure to 
      light but by the illumination of two special set points during the day, one of
      them entraining the circadian rhythm of photosensitivity and the other inducing
      or not inducing a physiological response if it is coincident, or not coincident, 
      with photoinducible phase of that rhythm. A photoinducible phase has been found
      for prolactin secretion, and perhaps also for LH secretion. Melatonin secretion
      is used by sheep for measuring daylength. However, that secretion disappears
      during two set points during the day, thus raising the possibility of using
      alternatively melatonin and light pulse for controlling the reproductive cycle in
      sheep.

TI  - The Doppler flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal carotid artery with
      respect to fetal behavioural states. A longitudinal study.
PG  - 274-8
AB  - Doppler flow velocity waveforms in the fetal internal carotid artery were
      recorded in 21 normal pregnancies during fetal behavioural state IF (quiet sleep)
      and 2F (active sleep) according to Nijhuis and co-workers, from the 36th week of 
      gestation onwards. The present study confirms the earlier finding of a
      significant reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) in state 2F as compared to
      state 1F at 37-38 weeks of gestation and demonstrates that this difference in PI 
      exists throughout the entire period, in which fetal behavioural states have been 
      described. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that there is a significant reduction 
      in PI of this vessel during the last 4 weeks of gestation, suggesting a
      haemodynamic redistribution, favouring blood supply to the brain during the
      latter weeks of gestation.

TI  - [Ontogeny of circadian rhythms and the maternal role in rats: entrainment of the 
      circadian pacemaker during the perinatal period].
PG  - 873-89
AB  - Post-natal manifestation of circadian rhythms was examined in individual rats in 
      order to clarify the manner in which pups' circadian oscillation entrained to the
      maternal circadian system. Ablation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus
      (SCN), a putative circadian pacemaker, completely eliminated the circadian
      rhythms of spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in
      pregnant rats. However, all pups born to mothers whose SCN were lesioned at day
      10 of gestation showed free-running circadian rhythms of plasma corticosterone
      level with similar phase angles after the 4th week of postnatal life. Strong
      positive correlations between the phases of circadian locomotor rhythm at the day
      of weaning and each free-running period (tau) were observed in blinded pups
      nursed under identical lighting schedule (LD). The fact suggests that the
      individual circadian oscillation was in phase on a certain day before the
      weaning. Mother-pups exchange under reversed lighting schedule (LD and DL) and
      nursing under 4-hourly restricted daily feeding (RF) indicated that nursing
      mother rat could essentially phase-set the circadian locomotor rhythm of blinded 
      pups when the conditions during nursing were artificially modified. The weight of
      neonatal rats was measured every 4 hours from day 1 to day 3 and day 9 to day 10 
      after birth, and 4-hourly weight gains showed apparent circadian periodicity from
      day 2 of age. Under ad-lib feeding of mother rats, pups' weight mainly increased 
      during daytime but the phase of weight rhythm shifted under RF corresponding to
      the feeding time of the mother. These findings suggest that the circadian
      oscillation underlying the spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma
      corticosterone level in rats has entrained to the maternal circadian system
      during fetal life, and nursing mother is capable of phase-setting the circadian
      oscillation of blinded pups probably through the rhythmicity of the lactation.

      use: a feasibility study in general practice.
PG  - 437-40
AB  - A hypnosis programme for antenatal and intrapartum use has been developed and
      successfully introduced into a practice as an alternative to conventional
      relaxation training. Of 96 women from the practice who delivered during the
      10-month period of the study 51 opted for the psychoprophylaxis and 45 for the
      hypnosis. Details of the pregnancy, labour and postnatal period were collected
      for both groups, together with a subjective assessment of their satisfaction with
      labour.Disparity between the ages and parity of the two groups made comparisons
      difficult. The duration of the first stage of labour was markedly reduced in the 
      hypnosis group by 98 minutes for primiparas and 40 minutes for multiparas. A
      small (five minutes) increase in the length of the second stage may have been a
      result of the hypnotic relaxation. The verbalization has been amended
      accordingly. The hypnosis group were more satisfied with labour than the
      psychoprophylaxis group (mean satisfaction score 7.4 versus 5.6) and they
      reported other benefits of hypnosis, for example, reduction in anxiety and help
      with getting to sleep.Further studies are planned.

TI  - [Historical development of obstetrical anesthesia].
PG  - 537-40
AB  - Pain is a primary component of normal childbirth as evidenced by the behavior of 
      parturients in primitive societies. Methods of pain relief such as the use of
      herbs and plant extracts were described in ancient writings. Modern obstetric
      analgesia employing ether began in 1847, three months after the first successful 
      surgical anesthetic. Administration of chloroform and nitrous oxide followed.
      Twilight sleep, a combination of morphine and scopolamine, became popular in the 
      beginning of the twentieth century as did regional analgesia, first single
      injection and later continuous blockade via catheter. Simultaneously, psychologic
      methods were propagated, but were not uniformly successful. Continuous lumbar
      extradural analgesia has evolved as the optimal method of bsotetric pain relief, 
      both subjectively and objectively, and its combination with childbirth education 
      is considered to be complementary. The increasing utilization of obstetric
      analgesia and the recognition of marked physiologic and pharmacologic differences
      between pregnant and nonpregnant patients has led to the development of the
      subspecialty of obstetric anesthesia as well as to the foundation of obstetric
      anesthesia societies.

TI  - Fetal alcohol effects in long- and short-sleep mice: activity, passive avoidance,
      and in utero ethanol levels.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - Genetic differences in susceptibility to fetal alcohol effects (FAE) have been
      suggested by both human and animal studies. The Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep
      (SS) mouse lines, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis,
      provide a model for studying differential alcohol sensitivity in the etiology of 
      FAE. LS and SS mice were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg (20% w/v) ethanol (E) or 
      an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day (6 hr apart) on Days 7 through 
      15 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line.
      Offspring were fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. LS offspring
      prenatally exposed to ethanol exhibited increased open-field activity relative to
      LS controls, but this effect was due to the overactivity of one litter. Activity 
      for SS mice prenatally exposed to ethanol did not differ from control levels.
      Ethanol content in blood (280 mg/dl), amniotic fluid (258 mg/dl), and fetal
      tissue (230 mg/dl) did not differ in similarly treated LS and SS dams. In a
      second experiment, females were treated from Days 7 through 18 of gestation, and 
      their offspring were tested for either open-field activity or passive avoidance
      learning. There were no group differences in open-field activity, but LS mice
      prenatally exposed to alcohol took more trials to reach a passive avoidance
      criterion than their controls, whereas similarly treated SS mice did not differ
      from controls. These results suggest that genetically-mediated sensitivity to
      ethanol influences susceptibility to FAE and that this may be task specific.

AB  - The relation between the blood flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal
      carotid artery (n = 12) and umbilical artery (n = 15) and fetal behavioural
      states at 37-38 weeks of gestation was studied. In the fetal internal carotid
      artery, under standardized fetal heart rate conditions, the pulsatility index
      (PI), as a measure of peripheral vascular resistance, was significantly lower
      during behavioural state 2F (active sleep) compared with state 1F (quiet sleep)
      according to the classification by Nijhuis et al. (1982), suggesting increased
      fetal cerebral blood flow during state 2F. In the umbilical artery, no
      significant difference in PI between the two behavioural states could be
      established. This suggests a fetal origin of the state dependency observed in
      fetal blood flow velocity waveforms.

TI  - Human cyclic motility: fetal-newborn continuities and newborn state differences.
PG  - 425-42
AB  - The spontaneous movement of 41 healthy human newborns was analyzed for cyclic
      patterns during different behavioral states and also compared to similar data
      obtained during their last few months of gestation. Spectral analysis was used to
      identify and quantify the motility cycles, except in quiet sleep, for which the
      instantaneous frequency of the isolated movements was analyzed. Cyclic motility
      (CM) was common in all states, and measures of its cyclic organization were
      similar in the non-sleep states in spite of very large differences in the total
      amount of movement. During active sleep, CM was weaker and less regular than
      during the non-sleep states, but similar to fetal CM during the last month of
      gestation. Thus cyclic variation in spontaneous motor activity, a basic feature
      of fetal behavior, is also a nearly constant feature of newborn spontaneous
      movement. Fetal CM persists relatively unchanged in the newborn during active
      sleep, and the cyclic organization of newborn movement is independent of the
      level of motor output.

TI  - Maternal perception of fetal movements: the optimal duration of a recording
      period.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - A regular count of perceived fetal movements by the mother has been proposed as a
      screening method for the early recognition of fetal distress. Absence or a
      strongly decreased number of fetal movements during a particular period is
      considered as a sign of fetal distress. In the study presented, the optimal
      duration of a recording period for the maternal perception of fetal movements was
      examined. 186 pregnant patients at gestational ages of 32 and 38 weeks were asked
      to mark each perceived fetal movement on a time axis for two continuous hours.
      From these patients an 'optimal' group of 143 pregnancies was selected to
      constitute the study group. A window technique was applied to the 2 h recordings,
      searching for periods in which 0, 1 or 2 fetal movements were noted. 23% of the
      recordings at 32 weeks and 14% at 38 weeks showed absence of fetal movements for 
      at least 30 min. At both 32 weeks and 38 weeks there was absence of fetal
      movements for more than 1 h in only 1.5% of the recordings. The findings are in
      agreement with the fetal behavioural state concept. A recording time of 1 h
      exceeds the normal duration of a fetal quiet-sleep state and minimizes the risk
      of unjustified suspicion of fetal distress.

TI  - Melatonin rhythms in fetal and maternal circulation during pregnancy in sheep.
PG  - E799-802
AB  - In many seasonally breeding species, the nocturnal melatonin rhythm is part of an
      endogenous biological clock mediating information about day length to time the
      onset of puberty and the annual adult reproductive cycle. To determine whether
      timekeeping persists during pregnancy, we studied the pattern of melatonin in
      circulation in sheep during the last trimester of gestation. We measured plasma
      melatonin concentrations in the chronically catheterized ewe and fetus (n = 6)
      over a 48-h period (every 1-4 h) at approximately 120 days gestation. A typical
      rhythm was present in the pregnant ewes; plasma melatonin was low during the day 
      and remained increased throughout the night. In the fetus, a modest 24-h pattern 
      was detected, which lagged 0.5-1.5 h behind that of the maternal circulation. In 
      combination with findings later in gestation (126 and 135 days) or even during
      parturition, it is clear that melatonin rhythms were sustained in all pregnant
      ewes and a 24-h pattern was present in the fetus. In those sheep that went to
      full term, births occurred during the night at 0130 +/- 2.6 h (mean +/- SE, n =
      3). These findings suggest that measurement of day length is maintained in female
      sheep during the last trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, information about day
      length and/or time of day may be transferred across the placenta, because the
      pattern of melatonin in fetal circulation follows the maternal circadian
      melatonin rhythm.

TI  - Electroencephalographic study of 137 patients with thalidomide embryopathy.
PG  - 197-205
AB  - EEG examinations were carried out on 137 patients with thalidomide embryopathy
      aged between 7 and 22 with a mean age of 17.0. Waking and sleep EEGs were normal 
      in 82 (59.9%), and abnormal in 55 (40.1%). The incidence of abnormal EEG was
      significantly high in the patients associated with mental retardation, and it
      increased in proportion to the severity of mental retardation. The most frequent 
      abnormal EEG finding was slowing of the basic activity (35/137; 24.8%). The
      incidence of slowing was significantly higher in the patients with a
      sensorineural hearing impairment (26/74; 35.1%) than in those with dysmelia
      (9/62; 14.5%). Slowing appeared frequently in the patients with various cranial
      nerve symptoms (30/84; 35.7%). The incidence of slowing was found significantly
      high in the patients with borderline or subnormal intelligence (8/16; 50.0%), and
      it correlated with the severity of mental retardation. Many patients (48/84;
      57.1%) showed unilateral or asymmetrical neurological symptoms. However,
      asymmetry or focal abnormality in EEG was shown in only 8 patients. Positive
      spikes appeared frequently in the patients with gonadal dysplasia. Other somatic 
      symptoms, past medical history and family history were not related to the
      incidence of abnormal EEGs. Eight patients had had epileptic seizures prior to
      this examination. Another 2 patients had nocturnal enuresis and showed epileptic 
      EEG abnormalities in this examination. The incidence of epilepsy was
      significantly higher in the patients we examined than among the general
      population. It is concluded that ingestion of thalidomide during pregnancy
      affected not only the morphological development of the limbs of the fetus, but
      the functions of its central nervous system, causing hearing impairment, other
      cranial nerve symptoms, mental retardation or epilepsy.

TI  - Low-back pain in pregnancy.
PG  - 368-71
AB  - Two hundred women were interviewed within 24-36 hours after giving birth. The
      patients were not examined. It was found that 56% of the patients suffered from
      low-back pain during pregnancy. The percentage of Caucasians was statistically
      higher in the back pain group. The percentage of Hispanics was statistically
      higher in the no pain group. Among the variables that were compared in both
      groups were the age, the weight gained by the mothers during pregnancy, the
      baby's weight, the number of previous pregnancies, number of prior children. None
      of the variables reached a statistically significant level. The pain group
      complained of pain the low-back area, which radiated in 45.5% of cases to the
      lower extremities. In about one-third of the patients the pain increased as the
      day wore on, whereas in another one-third the pain increased during the night and
      disturbed sleep. Standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting, and walking tended 
      to increase the pain. Most of the patients started suffering from back pain
      between the fifth and seventh months of pregnancy. Several theories to explain
      the occurrence of backache during pregnancy are discussed.

TI  - Restoration of lung liquid volume following its acute alteration in fetal sheep.
PG  - 531-43
AB  - 1. The experiments were aimed at determining the means by which lung liquid
      volume is controlled in fetal sheep. Six unanaesthetized chronically catheterized
      fetuses between 121 and 144 days of gestation were used in experiments in which
      lung liquid volume was acutely reduced or increased. 2. The effects on lung
      liquid volume, secretion and flow in the trachea were continuously monitored
      until the original volume was restored. Tracheal pressure, breathing activity,
      electrocortical activity and laryngeal adductor muscle activity were also
      monitored. 3. Following a mean reduction in lung liquid volume of 54.1% (40.0 +/-
      4.3 ml) there was a reduction in tracheal pressure of 1.91 +/- 0.26 mmHg. There
      was no change in the rate of lung liquid secretion and there was a near cessation
      in its rate of efflux from the trachea. Influx of liquid from the upper airway
      was rarely seen. 4. 5 h after its reduction, lung liquid volume had returned to
      control values. Tracheal pressure and the rate of liquid flow in the trachea
      returned to control values over 7-8 h. 5. In the hour following the reduction in 
      lung liquid volume the incidence and amplitude of fetal inspiratory muscle
      electromyogram (e.m.g.) activity were reduced by 19% and 28% respectively. There 
      was no change in laryngeal adductor muscle activity or in the duration of fetal
      sleep states. 6. When lung liquid volume was increased by 25.4 +/- 3.1 ml
      tracheal pressure increased by 2.01 +/- 0.17 mmHg. Although there was no change
      in the rate of liquid secretion there was a rapid efflux of liquid from the
      trachea principally during epochs of fetal breathing activity thus returning lung
      liquid volume to its control value. 7. Following the increase in lung liquid
      volume there were no changes in the incidence or amplitude of fetal inspiratory
      muscle activity, the activity of laryngeal adductor muscles or in the duration of
      sleep states. 8. It is concluded that following its alteration in fetal sheep
      lung liquid volume is restored by passive means. There was no evidence of
      volume-receptive neural reflexes being activated in defence of lung liquid
      volume.

TI  - Pregnancy-related affective episodes among women with recurrent depression.
PG  - 288-93
AB  - The authors examined 52 women with recurrent depression to determine the
      differences between women with and without histories of pregnancy-related
      affective episodes. The women with histories of such episodes (N = 24) had been
      significantly younger at illness onset, were more severely depressed at baseline,
      and tended to show less emotional stability. The EEG-recorded sleep of the women 
      with pregnancy-related affective episodes was distinguished by longer REM sleep
      time and more REM activity, differences accounted for almost entirely by the
      women with histories of only postpartum episodes.

TI  - Effect of naloxone on fetal behavior near term.
PG  - 474-8
AB  - Fetal behavior was studied after intravenous administration of either 0.4 mg of
      naloxone or an equal volume of saline solution in 54 healthy pregnant women near 
      term. The number, duration, and amplitude of fetal heart rate accelerations
      increased after naloxone injection. The incidence of both gross fetal body
      movements and fetal breathing movements increased, especially in the first hour
      after naloxone administration. The distribution of fetal behavioral states was
      modified with a prevalence of active sleep and active awake states compared to
      the quiet sleep state. These data suggest that endorphins could be involved in
      the modulation of fetal behavior.

TI  - External vibratory acoustic stimulation near term: fetal heart rate and heart
      rate variability responses.
PG  - 323-7
AB  - Twenty-five pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestational age were studied 
      to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory acoustic stimulus on the
      fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability. There was an immediate
      significant increase in the basal heart rate, which persisted for 1 hour after
      the stimulus, compared to that of the control subjects. There was also a
      significant increase in the total time during which accelerations occurred for
      the first 20 minutes after the stimulus. There were no changes in
      computer-derived indices of fetal heart rate variability. Maternal blood pressure
      and heart rate were not altered following vibratory acoustic stimulus. We
      hypothesize that external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a
      state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near term healthy fetuses.

TI  - Restricted daily feeding during nursing period resets circadian locomotor rhythm 
      of infant rats.
PG  - R262-8
AB  - Phase setting of the circadian rhythm by restricted daily feeding (RF) was
      examined in rat pups. Feeding of virgin, pregnant, and nursing rats together with
      pups was restricted to 4 h at a fixed time of the day. Phases of the circadian
      rhythm developed in neonatally blinded pups were measured on the day of weaning
      to evaluate the effect of RF on phase setting. The activity onset and offset of
      the locomotor rhythm were used for the phase reference. In blinded pups born and 
      raised under ad libitum feeding, the phase at weaning was a function of the
      free-running period measured after weaning and located in a narrow range (control
      zone). When RF was imposed from 2 wk prior to the conception (C) until weaning
      (3w), the pups phases were located outside the control zone and related to the
      feeding time. To identify the period in which the phase setting is effective, RF 
      was imposed during 5 different periods (C-0w, C-1w, C-2w, 2-6w, and 3-6w). The
      circadian rhythm of all pups in the C-2w group and some in the C-1w was phase
      set, but those in other groups were not affected. It is concluded that RF imposed
      during the early nursing period is capable of phase setting the circadian system 
      of blinded infant rats.

TI  - Vasectomy reversal.
PG  - 155-66
AB  - A vasovasostomy may be performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthesia,
      but also may be performed on an outpatient basis with epidural or general
      anesthesia. Local anesthesia is preferred by most of my patients, the majority of
      whom choose this technique. With proper preoperative and intraoperative sedation,
      patients sleep lightly through most of the procedure. Because of the length of
      time often required for bilateral microsurgical vasoepididymostomy, epidural or
      general anesthesia and overnight hospitalization are usually necessary. Factors
      influencing the preoperative choice for vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy in
      patients undergoing vasectomy reversal are considered. The preoperative planned
      choice of vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy for patients having vasectomy
      reversal described herein does not have the support of all urologists who
      regularly perform these procedures. My present approach has evolved as the data
      reported in Tables 1 and 2 have become available, but it may change as new
      information is evaluated. However, it offers a logical method for planning
      choices of anesthesia and inpatient or outpatient status for patients undergoing 
      vasectomy reversal procedures.

OAB - The basis for choosing either vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy for reversal of
      vasectomy or vas obstruction by microsurgical outpatient procedures, and
      management of these patients, are summarized, with diagrams and photographs
      included. Prior to surgery, it is impossible to determine whether a person needs 
      one procedure or the other. When operative procedures have begun, those with
      sperm or clear vas fluid are candidates for vasovasostomy. Those without sperm,
      or with cloudy fluid, will require vasoepididymostomy under general or epidural
      anesthesia, which takes 4-6 hr. No extensive data on outcome of pregnancy after
      microsurgical vasoepididymostomy are available. The author's patients with
      outpatient 2-layer microsurgical vasovasostomy have had 62% pregnancy rate so
      far; 14% more men show normal mobile sperm counts. Most of the operations are
      done under local anesthesia using lidocaine and bupivacaine, perhaps with
      sedation, through a 2-3 cm incision. Only general instructions for the 2
      procedures are included here. The author prefers "end-to-side" microsurgical
      vasoepididymostomy, combined with 1 or more microdissections to find the most
      caudal area of the epididymis where mobile sperm are present. For those who must 
      contain costs, as these operations are not usually covered by health insurance,
      the postoperative recovery, if needed, is obtained by hospitalizing the patient
      overnight after the procedure. Costs of vasovasostomy, not including surgeon's
      fee, ranged from $1144 for local, outpatient, to $2066 for general anesthesia and
      inpatient care.

TI  - Perinatal malnutrition, suprachiasmatic nuclear lesioning, and
      circadian-ultradian aspects of spontaneous behavior of albino rats.
PG  - 473-89
AB  - The effect of reducing the dietary protein content at different stages of
      development was investigated. A group of control rats was fed a diet with 25%
      protein throughout the entire study. Four other groups were fed only 6% protein
      in a diet isocaloric with the control diet. In an "intrauterine"-deprivation
      (prenatal) group, the feeding of the low protein diet was limited to the span
      from mating to delivery. In a "postnatal"-deprivation (lactation) group, the
      reduced protein diet was limited to the 25 days allowed for lactation. In a
      "perinatal"-deprivation group, the low-protein diet was fed during both the
      pregnancy and the 25 days after birth. Protein deprivation in a "preperinatal"
      group started 1 month before mating and continued throughout gestation and
      lactation to day 25 after birth. Except for the perinatal group, consisting of
      two animals, other groups consisted each of three or four rats. Behavioral
      variables--activity, rest, eating, drinking, exploring, grooming, curling up, and
      lying down--were studied in rats from each group at 90 days of age for 3 days at 
      consecutive near-12-min intervals for observation spans of 1 min. Two animals
      subjected to bilateral suprachiasmatic lesions, subsequently validated
      histologically, and two sham-operated controls were also investigated. Both the
      population-mean and the single cosinor methods were used for data analysis in
      conjunction with linear least-squares spectra. Cosinor methods allow the
      rejection of the zero-amplitude assumption on a group basis for the intact
      controls (P = 0.007), the intrauterine malnutrition group (P = 0.034), the
      lactation group (P = 0.059), the preperinatal group (P = 0.055), and on an
      individualized basis for the two animals constituting the perinatal group (P =
      0.007 and 0.002). These results by population-mean cosinor are complemented by
      the single cosinor demonstration of rhythms for most animals and variables
      investigated. The results demonstrate, on an individualized basis, the
      persistence of circadian rhythms under differently timed conditions of protein
      malnutrition. The data on the behavior of rats with bilateral lesions of the
      suprachiasmatic nuclei show a circadian to ultradian variance transposition. In
      most behaviors, there are prominent ultradian rhythms, which, however, require
      study over longer spans with dense observations on additional animals.

      alcohol consumption in the AA and ANA rat lines.
PG  - 231-40
AB  - To study the role of genetic factors in the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure 
      on behaviour, dams of two rat lines developed to differ in voluntary alcohol
      intake, alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rats were given a
      5-10% alcohol solution mixed with a 1% sucrose solution as a sole drinking liquid
      throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the offspring was studied at the
      ages of 7, 14 and 20 days, using a movement-sensitive mattress. In ANA rats,
      sleep recordings showed that prenatal alcohol exposure increased the percentage
      of waking but decreased the percentage of active sleep. Sleep-wake behaviour of
      the AA rats was not affected by alcohol exposure in utero. Prenatal alcohol
      exposure did not change open field behaviour in 1 month old rats, except that the
      alcohol-exposed AA rats' defaecation was decreased. When rats were 3 months old, 
      voluntary intake of 10% (v/v) alcohol increased for alcohol-exposed ANA rats and 
      decreased for alcohol-exposed AA rats as compared to the controls. The results
      indicate that AA rats may compensate for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
      on behaviour, whereas offspring of the alcohol-exposed ANA dams suffer from
      severe behavioural disturbances. These findings further suggest that genetic
      factors are responsible for the differences in the susceptibility of rat foetuses
      to alcohol-induced long-term effects on behaviour.

TI  - Women's self-reported responses to abortion.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - The legalization of abortion in many states has allowed an alternative for women 
      with unplanned or unwanted pregnancies who do not wish to deliver and raise their
      children or to place them for adoption. Of 158 women asked to recall their
      responses to the experience, 21% reported psychosocial satisfaction at the time
      of abortion, and 45% reported satisfaction several months later; over half
      reported an improved outlook on life, and nearly half found abortion preferable
      to other alternatives for future unplanned pregnancies. It may prove important to
      make counseling or therapy available to about 10% of women who report negative
      responses (guilt and confusion) to the abortion.

OAB - Women members of a pre-paid health plan who had had therapeutic abortions during 
      3 years answered a questionnaire by mail on their reactions to the abortion
      experience. The procedure took 20 minutes, under general anesthesia, with a
      36-hour hospital stay. 178 subjects submitted usable questionnaires. These
      included a wide range of ages, marital status, religious backgrounds, education
      and socioeconomic status. Most had abortions over 1.5 years before. Over 50% felt
      relieved after their abortions. Only 21% recalled feeling satisfaction at the
      time, but 45% were satisfied at the time of the survey. Nervousness, guilt or
      confusion were cited by 6, 14 and 11%. Over 50% reported an improved outlook on
      life after the abortion. Negative responses were reported by 9-12% for several
      items such as tension, anxiety, energy level and sleep problems and 17% for
      depression. 49% said that they would have another abortion in the event of a
      future unplanned pregnancy, compared to 25% who would keep the baby, 0% who would
      place it for adoption and 23% who did not know. The observation that some women
      recounted distress at the time of abortion suggests that counseling or
      psychotherapy should be provided to those in need.

AB  - Alterations in circadian rhythms have previously been associated with estrous and
      seasonal changes in reproductive state. In the present study we explored the
      effects of the reproductive events of pregnancy and parturition on free-running
      circadian activity rhythms in the rat. Free-running rhythms were monitored before
      mating, during pregnancy, and following parturition and removal of pups.
      Systematic and long-lasting alterations of the period of the free-running
      activity rhythm were seen following parturition. The effects of estrous,
      seasonal, and gestational reproductive states on circadian rhythms may be
      mediated by the endocrine events which accompany these states.

PG  - 226-9
AB  - Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded over a 24-hour interval in a
      totally adrenalectomized pregnant woman at term. Cortisol, ACTH, unconjugated
      estriol and 17 beta-estradiol were contemporaneously measured every 2 h in the
      maternal peripheral plasma. Owing to the substitution therapy the patient showed 
      a loss of circadian variations of all the hormones investigated. Moreover, the
      circadian rhythms of fetal heart rate and fetal movements, usually present at
      term, were no longer evident. We can thus suggest that the circadian variations
      of plasma maternal cortisol could affect the alternations of fetal behaviour.

TI  - Influence of drugs on brain neurotransmitters and behavioral states during
      development.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - Neurotransmitters are present at very early stages of brain development. They may
      have trophic effects on maturation of target neurons and mediate the behavioral
      repertoire of the immature brain. Many centrally acting drugs which are used
      during pregnancy and early childhood for the treatment of e.g. hypertension,
      depression, epilepsy, sleep disorders, or hyperkinetism influence brain
      neurotransmitters and behavioral states. Disturbances observed later in life in
      animal and man, due to perinatal interference of such drugs with brain
      neurotransmitters and behavioral states, are not gross physical malformations but
      rather subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity,
      emotional lability, perceptual motor disturbances, attentional distractibility
      and sleep disturbances.

      fetal body movements near term.
PG  - 1227-30
AB  - Twenty-five pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestational age were studied 
      to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory acoustic stimulus on fetal
      breathing and gross fetal body movement patterns. When the study period was
      compared with the control period, there was an immediate significant decrease in 
      the incidence of fetal breathing movements that persisted for 1 hour after the
      stimulus. Moreover the fetal breathing pattern was more irregular for the hour
      after the stimulus. There was also a significant but delayed increase in the
      incidence of gross fetal body movements that persisted for 1 hour after the
      stimulus. We hypothesize that an external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a
      change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near-term healthy
      fetuses.

TI  - Circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol in diabetic pregnant
      women.
PG  - 1176-81
AB  - The effect of type I and II diabetes in pregnancy on the circadian rhythm and
      diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol was studied in the second and third
      trimesters and post partum. Cosignor analysis demonstrated persistence during
      gestation of the significant circadian rhythm of the nonpregnant state. As
      previously reported in control pregnancies, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean,
      nadir, peak, and nadir-peak excursion) increased during gestation while the
      relative excursion of cortisol (expressed as the percent deviation from the
      24-hour mean) was blunted. No significant difference was found between diabetic
      groups or when diabetic groups were compared with control subjects. Nocturnal
      hypoglycemia was common among diabetic women during pregnancy and post partum.
      Although these episodes were usually asymptomatic, the mean concomitant cortisol 
      levels were increased over the corresponding cortisol levels of nonhypoglycemic
      diabetic and control subjects. We conclude that differences between control and
      type I and II diabetic subjects in carbohydrate tolerance or glycemic excursion
      are not explained by differences in cortisol levels or rhythm. The
      pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of cortisol is consistent with an 
      autonomous source of adrenocorticotropin. Asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia is 
      common in insulin-requiring diabetic women and is associated with increased
      cortisol secretion.

TI  - Modifications of ultradian and circadian rhythms of fetal heart rate after
      fetal-maternal adrenal gland suppression: a double blind study.
PG  - 409-17
AB  - In order to verify whether fetal and maternal adrenal gland suppression induces
      effects on fetal behaviour, triamcinolone was administered to five healthy
      pregnant women at 35 weeks of gestation. Five patients of the same gestational
      age were used as control. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal movements were
      recorded continuously over 2-h interval by means of cardiotocography. After 3
      weeks (38 weeks of gestation) the recordings were repeated without drug
      administration. Cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone, 17 beta-estradiol and
      unconjugated estriol were measured at the same time every 2 h in maternal
      peripheral plasma. At 35 weeks we found a loss of circadian rhythms of the
      hormones investigated and modifications of ultradian and circadian patterns of
      FHR in the treated group with respect to the control. No differences in hormonal 
      and biophysical parameters were found between the two groups after the end of
      treatment (38 weeks). These data suggest that the inhibition of fetal and
      maternal adrenal glands could cause modifications of FHR patterns.

TI  - Fetal cardiorespiratory changes during spontaneous prelabor uterine contractions 
      in sheep.
PG  - 893-7
AB  - Fetal cardiorespiratory changes during spontaneous prelabor uterine contractions 
      (called contractures) were studied in 12 chronically catheterized fetal sheep at 
      120 to 143 days' gestation. During contractures the carcass blood flow increased 
      significantly from 27 +/- 2 (SEM) to 32 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm. There were no
      significant changes in combined ventricular output or in blood flow to the
      umbilical circulation, brain, heart, adrenal glands, gut, kidney, and lung. Fetal
      arterial blood pressure increased from 57 +/- 2 to 62 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than
      0.001) during contractions. There were no significant changes in fetal heart
      rate. In the fetal femoral artery during contractures the oxygen content
      decreased from 6.1 +/- 0.2 to 5.4 +/- 0.2 ml/dl of blood (p less than 0.001), and
      carbon dioxide tension increased significantly from 44 +/- 0.4 to 45 +/- 0.4 mm
      Hg (p less than 0.001). The pH did not change. The increase in carcass blood flow
      during contractures suggests that there was an increase in fetal skeletal
      muscular activity or tone. An increase in fetal skeletal muscle activity,
      together with a decrease in uterine blood flow could explain the small decrease
      in fetal oxygen content that occurs with each contracture. Fetal compression
      and/or changes from rapid eye movement to synchronized sleep or arousal observed 
      during contractures are possible stimuli causing increased fetal skeletal muscle 
      tone or activity. Since contractures periodically result in neuromuscular
      activity in the fetus in its protected fluid-filled environment, they may play a 
      key role in fetal neuromuscular development by stimulating "exercising" in the
      fetus in utero.

TI  - Maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei are necessary for maternal coordination of the
      developing circadian system.
PG  - 2724-9
AB  - During late fetal and early neonatal life, the maternal circadian system
      coordinates the timing of a circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic
      nuclei (SCN) to the prevailing light-dark cycle. The role of the maternal SCN in 
      the process of maternal coordination was investigated in rats. Complete lesions
      of the maternal SCN on day 7 of gestation disrupted rhythms of SCN glucose
      utilization in fetuses and pineal N-acetyltransferase activity in 10-d-old pups. 
      This disruption was probably due to the desynchronization of individually
      oscillating fetal SCN, because individual pups born to and reared by SCN-lesioned
      dams under constant conditions exhibited normal circadian rhythms in drinking
      behavior. Cross-foster studies showed that the maternal circadian system can
      coordinate developing circadian rhythmicity during either the pre- or postnatal
      period. The results indicate that the maternal SCN are a necessary component of
      the mechanism of maternal coordination during both the pre- and postnatal
      periods.

TI  - Effect of repeated and prolonged stress stimuli on the plasma prolactin
      concentration in sheep.
PG  - 265-76
AB  - The effect of repeated and prolonged stress-stimuli applied during 3 days on the 
      plasma prolactin concentration in sheep, in anoestrous, prooestrous and pregnant 
      animals were studied. The following results were obtained: Repeated and prolonged
      weak electric stimuli applied in the form of footshocks in sheep during 3 days
      elicited a rise of mesor plasma concentration. The magnitude and the onset of
      this rise was not associated and dependent on the physiological state of animals.
      The mesor values of plasma prolactin concentration in all groups of animals
      except prooestrous ewes on the day following stimulation returned to their
      prestressing levels. Repeated and prolonged stimuli disturbed circadian rhythm of
      prolactin secretion existing only in prooestrous ewes, i.e. they caused its
      disappearance on the days during stimulation and its reappearance on the day
      following stimulation but at an accelerated and inverse time of the day to that
      found before stimulation. The induced rise of plasma prolactin concentration in
      anoestrous and pregnant ewes on the days during electric stimulation showed,
      according to Cosinor analysis, all features characteristic for acrophase of the
      circadian rhythm. This phenomenon may be considered as induced acrophase in
      stress condition.

TI  - Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neonatal sleep-wake behaviour and adult
      alcohol consumption in rats.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - Our previous experiments showed that suppression of early postnatal active (REM) 
      sleep increases alcohol intake in adult rats. To study the effects of prenatal
      alcohol exposure on neonatal sleep-wake behaviour and adult alcohol consumption
      pregnant rat dams were given 7% to 12% alcohol, 1% sucrose solution, or tap water
      as a sole liquid throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the pups was
      studied at 6, 8, 12 and 15 days of age by using a movement sensitive mattress.
      The offspring who were exposed to alcohol in utero had significantly less active 
      sleep and more wakefulness from total recording time than the controls. Their
      quiet state was also interrupted more often by waking episodes. At the age of 2
      months voluntary alcohol intake of the rats exposed prenatally to alcohol was
      elevated compared to the controls. These findings suggest that early postnatal
      active sleep and the neurotransmitter systems regulating it may be the means by
      which in utero alcohol exposure affects adult alcohol drinking.

TI  - Temperament of preterm versus full-term infants.
PG  - 159-62
AB  - The temperament of a group of preterm infants (n = 126) was studied as part of a 
      large, longitudinal study of infant temperament and behavior in a representative 
      sample of Australian infants (n = 2443). Utilizing the Infant Temperament
      Questionnaire of Carey and McDevitt, previously revised and validated for an
      Australian population, ratings were made at 4 to 8 months corrected age, and data
      for the preterm group (less than 37 weeks gestation) were compared to those
      infants born at term (37 to 41 weeks). There were no significant differences
      between the two groups on any of the sociodemographic variables, on the mother's 
      global rating of temperament, or on the reported incidence of colic, sleep
      problems, and excessive crying. There were also no differences between premature 
      and full-term infants on any of the individual dimensions or clinical categories 
      of temperament. We conclude that prematurity per se does not affect observed
      temperament at 4 to 8 months. However, we cannot extend these conclusions to
      high-risk infants who experience medical complications of prematurity, and who
      require intensive care for prolonged periods of time. These may represent an
      entirely different category of risk for subsequent difficult temperament and
      behavior problems.

TI  - Role of endogenous opiates in hypoxic ventilatory response in the newborn
      primate.
PG  - 2015-9
AB  - The effects of opiate receptor antagonism by naltrexone hydrochloride on the
      biphasic hypoxic ventilatory response in the infant Macaca nemestrina have been
      investigated. Minute ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory frequency were
      measured in six animals from timed gestations before and during inhalation of a
      hypoxic gas mixture. All studies were completed in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. 
      Arterial blood gases were obtained during each stimulus period. All animals
      demonstrated the typical biphasic ventilatory response to acute moderate-severe
      hypoxemia. After the administration of naltrexone hydrochloride to block opiate
      receptors, the animals still manifested a biphasic hypoxic response that was no
      different than that noted prior to drug administration. Naltrexone hydrochloride 
      had no effect on room air resting ventilation in any of the animals. Our data
      suggest that endogenous opiates play no physiological role in the acute
      ventilatory response to moderate-severe hypoxia in the newborn subhuman primate.

TI  - Stimulation of fetal breathing activity by beta-adrenergic mechanisms.
PG  - 1938-45
AB  - Experiments were done on chronically prepared fetal lambs, 125-135 days
      gestation, to test the effects of various catecholamines on fetal breathing (FB) 
      as well as the influence of isoproterenol on the fetal respiratory response to
      hypoxemia. Bolus injections of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol
      (5-20 micrograms) were administered via the lingual artery or femoral or jugular 
      vein during periods of FB activity or apnea. The effects of epinephrine and
      norepinephrine on FB were variable and not statistically significant.
      Isoproterenol produced a significant increase in FB, frequency of breathing, and 
      mean inspiratory effort, when infused during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep but
      it failed to induce FB during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. The positive
      response during REM sleep was absent following pretreatment with 3-5 mg
      propranolol and after bilateral section of the sinus nerves. The effect of
      hypoxia on FB was tested before and during constant infusion of isoproterenol (1 
      microgram/min iv). A reduction of the fetal arterial PO2 by 3-10 Torr produced
      the characteristic depression of FB in either situation. These results indicate
      that the fetal carotid body chemoreceptors can reflexly stimulate FB under
      certain circumstances but that their effectiveness is limited by more powerful
      inhibitory mechanisms such as those operative during NREM sleep and hypoxemia.

TI  - [Health advice before travel to tropical countries].
PG  - 682-6
AB  - Some 8% of Swiss citizens travel in the developing countries annually. Advising
      these travellers is an important task for the physician, though the most frequent
      infections are the less serious travellers' diarrhea and common colds. To some
      extent the more serious tropical diseases can be avoided by appropriate measures,
      e.g. vaccination (against yellow fever, tetanus, polio etc). and by
      chemoprophylaxis (malaria). Individual fitness for travel should be checked prior
      to any journey abroad, and special advice must be given to travellers with
      special risks (e.g. pregnant women, infants, persons with chronic diseases,
      diabetics etc.). Most important during a stay in the tropics is a sensible way of
      life with enough sleep, general hygiene, especially with regard to food, and
      avoidance of untreated water. Further safety measures are recommended for
      bathing, strong sun exposure, mountaineering above 10,000 ft and in general for
      exposure to special health risks. Recognition of risks and their avoidance is
      often the best prophylaxis.

AB  - Possible negative effects of maternal antiepileptic medication on fetal motility 
      and heart rate patterns were examined at 32 and 38 wk of gestation. Fetal eye and
      body movements were recorded using 2 real-time ultrasound units. Comparison
      between pregnancies with antiepileptic medication and control pregnancies did not
      show marked differences in patterns of motility and heart rate. Duration of sleep
      states, occurrence and duration of body movements in state 2F and statistical
      parameters of heart rate level and heart rate variability were very similar for
      both groups. This preliminary study, limited to mostly combined treatment with
      antiepileptic drugs, could not demonstrate any obvious effect on fetal
      neuromuscular development from maternal antiepileptic medication.

TI  - Sugar absorption in healthy preterm and full-term infants.
PG  - 214-9
AB  - We have studied carbohydrate absorption in 40 healthy term infants and 10 preterm
      neonates (31-35 weeks gestation) by respiratory H2, fecal pH, and chromatographic
      analysis of stools. Sequential studies of H2 excretion (24-h collection) in
      response to breast feeding were carried out in premature infants during the first
      8 weeks of life. Five expired H2 during the first 2 weeks, and two continued to
      do so in the 3rd to 4th weeks. Breath H2 excretion fell below 10 ppm by 8 weeks
      and was not related to feeding or sleep. In term neonates, the frequency of
      incomplete carbohydrate absorption (4-h test) at the end of the first week was
      36% for 14 breast-fed, 42% for 12 formula-fed, and 64% for 14 mixed-fed neonates 
      (not significant differences). There were no significant differences between the 
      absorbing and malabsorbing subjects in fecal pH. Chromatographic analysis showed 
      only small quantities of sugars. In summary, incomplete carbohydrate absorption
      occurred in a high percentage of the newborns studied; the 24-h test evaluated
      better than the 4-h test; and negative breath H2 excretion indicated development 
      of the capacity of the small intestine to hydrolyze carbohydrates. In the
      majority of the preterm malabsorbing babies, completely functional lactase occurs
      within the first month of life. The growth modulators in human milk may increase 
      the rate of maturing of the small intestine.

TI  - Benign encephalopathy of pregnancy. Preliminary clinical observations.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - A survey of 67 pregnancies in 51 professional women (physicians, psychologists,
      nurses, administrators, etc.) revealed the occurrence of symptoms of cognitive
      dysfunction such as forgetfulness, disorientation, confusion and reading
      difficulties in 28 pregnancies occurring in 21 women. These were unrelated to
      such factors as age of delivery, percentage weight gain, the baby's sex or birth 
      weight, alcohol consumption, smoking, a history of migraine or allergy or other
      symptoms occurring during pregnancy such as sleepiness and lack of concentration,
      irritability, loss of interest in job or nightmares. Nor was there any
      correlation with hypertension, proteinuria, glycosuria, ketonuria, anemia, or
      morning sickness. Furthermore, these cognitive disturbances were not related to
      depression or sleep deprivation. Despite these symptoms, none of the women
      suffering from them were forced to interrupt their professional activities during
      pregnancy. The syndrome of benign encephalopathy of pregnancy should be
      recognized so that simple precautions can be taken to prevent any interference
      with professional or other activities. The etiology of the syndrome is unknown.

TI  - Breathing during sleep in normal pregnant women.
PG  - 38-41
AB  - Physiologic changes during the last trimester of pregnancy include reduced
      functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial
      difference for oxygen, and in the supine position reduced cardiac output. In
      conjunction with sleep-related apnea or hypoventilation, these could lead to
      maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because we could not find detailed
      respiratory sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete
      polysomnography on 6 pregnant women at 36 wk gestation and again postpartum.
      Contrary to what we expected, oxygenation was well maintained, with neither mean 
      nor minimal arterial oxygen saturation significantly different during pregnancy. 
      Frequency of apnea and hypopnea and total apnea and hypopnea time were
      significantly reduced during pregnancy. This finding may be due to increased
      levels of progesterone during pregnancy and may contribute to preservation of
      maternal oxygenation during late pregnancy.

TI  - Effect of alpha-methyldopa administration during pregnancy on the development of 
      a child's sleep.
PG  - 416-23
AB  - A male infant was born to a mother who had been suffering from primary
      hyperaldosteronism with the administration of alpha-methyldopa (MD) during
      pregnancy. His behavioral development, especially that of sleep, was studied by
      means of sleep-awake rhythm and polysomnography recordings (PSG) from 2 months to
      2 years and 5 months of age. His daily sleep-awake rhythm showed some abnormal
      pattern. As to the PSG, the proportion of each sleep stage was normal and the two
      types of body movements (BM) showed various patterns. A paradoxical increase was 
      seen in the twitch movement of some muscles. MD affects the catecholamine system 
      in the CNS and human sleep. Since the sleep-awake rhythm and BM are thought to be
      related to the monoaminergic system in the CNS, we assume that his behavior and
      sleep disorders are the effects of the maternal MD administration during
      pregnancy.

OAB - A facsimile of the 1-page labor chart provided by the Ministry of Health and used
      at all maternity clinics in Malawi is described. Malawi has 350 maternity units
      which take care of 45% of deliveries. Personnel range from nonprofessional to
      registered nurse-midwives to physicians. The most notable feature of the chart is
      a partogram marked with "alert" and "action" lines, for comparing cervical
      dilation per hour. The alert line is a diagonal line starting at 3 cm dilated and
      fully effaced, drawn at an angle representing the slowest 10% of normal African
      primigravidas. Normally vaginal delivery would be expected at the time of the end
      of the action line. The action line is drawn arbitrarily 4 hours to the right,
      allowing time for normal delivery or transfer of the patient. Fetal descent is
      also charted in fifths of head palpable above the pelvic brim. There is room to
      the left of the page to chart progress in latent phase. One side of the chart
      contains demographic and admission data and the progress graph. The reverse side 
      has space for pelvic assessment, results of 2nd and 3rd stage of labor and
      charting of up to 6 days' postpartum stay for mother and infant. There are blanks
      to record whether the woman has had sleep, food or homemade medicine, and room
      for making referrals. In practice fetal descent is followed by abdominal
      palpation hourly, fetal heart rate every 30 minutes, and charted as type 1, 2, or
      3. Vaginal examinations are done every 4 hours for primigravidas and every 3 in
      multiparas. Fetal head molding is charted as -or 1+, 2+ or 3+.

AB  - Pregnant rats were deprived of paradoxical sleep for 3 days starting on the 18th 
      gestational day. The condition of PS-D was imposed by confinement on a small
      platform surrounded by water or by daily injections of clomipramine. Four hours
      before the killing rats received a s.c. injection of [3H]-thymidine. The amount
      of radioactive DNA determined by autoradiography in several regions of fetal
      brain was found to be markedly increased under both experimental conditions in
      comparison with the control fetal brain. Considerably more limited effects were
      observed in kidney. Comparable changes of lower magnitude were obtained by
      comparing the specific radioactivity of DNA samples purified by chlorophorm
      extraction and digestion with RNase and proteinase K. The results fully confirm
      our previous data obtained under similar experimental conditions but based on the
      analysis of an acid-washed DNA fraction.

      development.
PG  - 382-9
AB  - Transmission of information in the brain is of a chemical nature.
      Neurotransmitters are present at very early stages of brain development, having
      trophic effects on maturation of target neurons as well as mediating the
      behavioral repertoire of the immature brain. Many centrally acting psychoactive
      drugs which are commonly used (also during pregnancy) for treatment of
      depression, asthma, hypertension, epilepsy, parkinsonism, hyperkinetism and other
      neurological and psychiatric disorders act directly on brain neurotransmitters
      (in particular monoamines) and behavioral states. Disturbances observed later in 
      life in animals and man, as a result of early interference with brain
      neurotransmitters, using these drugs, are not gross physical malformations but
      are in fact subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity,
      emotional lability, attentional distractability and sleep disturbances, similar
      to symptoms observed in the minimal brain dysfunction syndrome.

TI  - Maternal phase control of fetal circadian oscillation during pregnancy.
PG  - 237-51
AB  - Mother-pups interaction is essential for the normal development of individuals
      during ontogeny. In this review, the emphasis was on a special function in a
      special stage of development, i.e., fetal entrainment to pregnant mother of the
      circadian rhythm which is one of the fundamental autonomic functions in the
      organism. To this end, the basic assumptions and problems were introduced and the
      validity of the assumption was defended. Based on this, the various factors of
      postnatal life which might affect the phase angle of overt hormone rhythm were
      experimentally evaluated. Finally, by introducing experimental designs which were
      to exclude disturbing effects of the nursing mother, we found that the fetal
      oscillation was possibly entrainable by pregnant mother as early as in the middle
      of gestation. Possible mechanism of the entrainment and adaptive implications of 
      the findings were discussed.

TI  - Changes in circadian rhythm and suppression of the plasma cortisol level after
      prolonged stress in the sheep.
PG  - 540-5
AB  - Diurnal variations in the plasma cortisol level were studied in anoestrous,
      pro-oestrous and pregnant ewes subjected to weak electric stimulation of the
      fore-limbs 9 h daily for 3 consecutive days. In non-pregnant ewes the cortisol
      level rose on each of the 3 days when the stimulation was applied and then
      decreased on the day following the stimulation. A similar decrease in plasma
      cortisol concentrations in pregnant ewes appeared on the second day of
      footshocking. The acrophase of the circadian rhythm on electrostimulation days
      was synchronous with the time of application of footshocks; therefore, in
      stimulated ewes it was significantly accelerated compared to the prestimulatory
      day. A decrease in the plasma cortisol level in pro-oestrous and pregnant ewes
      was accompanied by disappearance of its normal rhythmicity. Since a normal plasma
      cortisol response to exogenous corticotrophin was noted after 3 days of
      footshocking it seems unlikely that the decrease in the cortisol level after
      prolonged stress was caused by exhaustion of the adrenal cortex. Some central
      mechanisms which could account for the biphasic changes in the plasma cortisol
      level and for disturbances of the hormone diurnal rhythmicity under conditions of
      prolonged stress are discussed.

TI  - Effect of phototherapy on plasma levels of GH, LH and FSH in the newborn.
PG  - 561-5
AB  - Plasma levels of GH, LH and FSH were measured in 74 three-day-old newborn infants
      with hyperbilirubinemia before and after exposure to continuous phototherapy
      (PhT) for 48 h. The results obtained were compared with data observed over the
      same period of time in 46 newborn infants belonging to the control group having
      homogeneous characteristics as far as form of delivery (spontaneous), gestation
      age, chronological age, sex, birth weight and basal blood glucose were concerned,
      except hyperbilirubinemia and necessity of PhT. Hyperbilirubinemic female newborn
      showed higher plasma GH concentrations in comparison with hyperbilirubinemic
      males and with controls. Forty-eight of continuous PhT significantly reduced GH
      levels which, however, appeared not to be substantially different from those of
      normal controls of the same age. Moreover, PhT determined a slight trend to
      increase in FSH of females, and did not modify the physiological decline of LH in
      both sexes during the first five days of life. The reduction of GH following PhT 
      from abnormal to physiological concentrations may be due to the direct effect of 
      light and/or to continuous light-related disorders of sleep. In conclusion, 48 h 
      of continuous exposure to light (PhT) do not impair the newborn's pituitary
      functions here studied.

TI  - Prenatal development of sleep-wake patterns in sheep.
PG  - 347-55
AB  - Chronic intrauterine monitoring of electrocortical activity, eye movements, and
      electromyographic activity of the nuchal muscles has permitted the use of
      established polygraphic criteria to study the ontogenetic development of
      organized sleep-wake patterns in the fetal lamb in utero. Sixty-five polygraphic 
      recordings obtained from 21 fetal lambs ranging from 112 to 144 days of gestation
      (term = 145 days) were analyzed. The results show that the transition from
      disorganized to organized behavioral state patterns occurs at approximately
      115-120 days (0.8 term). The physiologic characteristics of the arousal, quiet
      sleep (QS), and REM sleep (REMS) states are qualitatively similar to those in the
      adult. There is initially a high proportion of REMS (greater than 50%), with only
      11% time spent in arousal. The direct transition from arousal to REMS without a
      QS period is frequently seen in the fetus at all ages. Quantitative changes in
      the distribution of behavioral states continue throughout gestation. There is a
      significant decrease in the incidence of REMS, with a small increase in arousal
      and QS. The duration of QS and REMS episodes increases with age until a steady
      level is achieved by 130 days. There is also an increase in the frequency of
      occurrence of arousal periods, with no change in episode duration.

TI  - Neurochemical and electrophysiological disturbances mediate developmental
      behavioral alterations produced by medicines.
PG  - 677-83
AB  - Many centrally acting drugs which are prescribed for hypertension, depression,
      epilepsy, insomnia and asthma may also affect fetal brain neurotransmission and
      behavioral states. Nearly all these drugs enter the fetal circulation following
      maternal administration. The immaturity of the blood-brain barrier and greater
      accumulation in the developing brain make the fetal brain a major target of its
      mother's medication. Adverse effects that are seen in the fetus are not
      necessarily evident in its mother. We have shown that drugs like clonidine (an
      antihypertensive) and clomipramine (an antidepressant), which act on
      noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission in the brain, suppress rapid eye
      movement sleep in the developing rat. In adulthood, the neonatally treated rats
      showed hyperactivity, hyperanxiety, reduced sexual behavior, disturbed sleep
      patterns and reduced cerebral cortical size. Furthermore, such treatment induced 
      an increase in voluntary alcohol consumption and a decreased adaptability of
      responses to changes in water deprivation in a Y-maze. Little is known about
      long-lasting consequences of centrally acting drugs used during late gestation in
      humans. Minor neurological disturbances, such as delayed visual motor
      performance, smaller head circumference, increased anxiety and disturbed
      sleep-wake patterns, have been reported in children born to hypertensive mothers 
      treated with clonidine or alpha-methyl-dopa.

      the fetal and neonatal guinea pig with subsequent power spectral analysis.
      Thirty-four unanesthesized, unrestrained pregnant Hartley guinea pigs were
      studied 1 to 14 days following surgical procedures. Twelve neonatal animals
      instrumented during the first week of life were studied at 3 to 30 days.
      Spontaneous, undifferentiated electrocortical activity was recorded from the
      youngest fetuses studied, with high-voltage slow activity appearing at 50 days'
      gestation. Cycling electrocortical activity and sleep spindles could be observed 
      in the late-term fetal and neonatal animals, with rapid eye movements and
      behavioral state defined in the latter. Power spectral analysis demonstrated more
      predominant delta activity, faster beta frequencies, and better-developed sleep
      spindles in the neonatal animal as compared to the fetus.

AB  - Behavioral states in the near-term human fetus have been described during
      pregnancy. The aim of this study was to observe whether these same states are
      present during labor. Nine patients with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies
      participated. Fetal heart rate and uterine contractions were recorded. Fetal eye,
      mouth, rotation, and retroflexion of the head were observed by real-time
      ultrasound. Fetal movements were recorded with coded event-markers. Behavioral
      states were identified by the movement pattern. A total of 13 ultrasound
      observations, varying from 25 to 66 minutes, were obtained. Optimal viewing was
      present at least 60% and on the average 80% of the time. State 1F (quiet sleep), 
      state 2F (active sleep), and state 3F (quite awake), as well as a total of 10
      state changes, were identified during labor in spite of increasing contractions
      and/or ruptured membranes. These observations demonstrate existence of
      alternating behavioral states in the healthy term fetus during labor.

PG  - 893-7
AB  - To examine the modulation of fetal systolic time intervals of the ovine fetus in 
      relation to fetal maturation, heart rate, respiratory activity, and circadian
      rhythm, studies were carried out on 13 fetal-maternal sheep preparations. The
      data obtained showed that there was a significant correlation between the
      ejection time (ET) and the RR intervals of the electrocardiogram. The
      pre-ejection period (PEP) and PEP/ET increased in relation to the fetal
      maturation (38 ms and 0.25 at 120 days to 52 ms and 0.33 at 145 days of
      gestation, respectively). When the circadian rhythmicity was analyzed, a relative
      tachycardia was in evidence during the 21- to 03-h period but systolic time
      intervals remained unchanged. Except for some tachycardia and cardiac rhythm
      variability, respiratory activity also had no influence on the systolic time
      intervals.

TI  - Development of sucking rhythm in preterm infants.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - We studied the ontogeny and temporal organization of non-nutritive sucking during
      active sleep in 6 healthy preterm infants (mean birthweight 1.1 kg (range 0.8-1.3
      kg) gestational age 28.6 weeks (range 26-30 w] from 30 to 35 weeks of
      post-menstrual (PM) age. Recognizable rhythmical sucking bursts were recorded at 
      28 weeks in one infant and by 31-33 weeks in the others. Results were analyzed
      for the periods 30-31, 32-33 and 34-35 PM weeks. The number of bursts/min
      increased with age, while the duration of each burst was stable (mean 4.1 s). The
      pause between bursts decreased. Sucking pace within bursts increased with age
      which resulted in an increase in the overall rate of sucking. The coefficient of 
      variation (CV) for intersuck time within bursts and for interburst time was
      computed to examine the stability of the sucking rhythm. For intersuck time the
      CV was relatively low and constant across ages. However, for interburst time CV
      was relatively large across ages. Thus, there appears to be a stability of the
      intraburst sucking rhythm from 30 weeks of gestation, whereas the interburst
      rhythm is less regular. This documentation of temporal organization in sucking
      from 30 weeks is one of the earliest indications of an intrinsic rhythm in human 
      behavior.

PG  - 717-20
AB  - Idiopathic apnea in preterm infants, more than 30 weeks of gestation, after the
      first week of life is uncommon and poorly understood. To study ventilatory
      control in these infants we measured minute ventilation, respiratory frequency,
      tidal volume, end-tidal oxygen pressure and carbon dioxide pressure, and
      transcutaneous oxygen pressure before and during the fifth minute of breathing 4%
      carbon dioxide in air. Nine healthy preterm infants and eight infants with three 
      or more episodes of apnea (greater than or equal to 20 s) in 24 hours were
      studied during active sleep. We found that infants with apnea had a significantly
      increased alveolar carbon dioxide pressure while respiratory frequency, minute
      ventilation, and slope were significantly decreased. Alveolar-transcutaneous
      oxygen gradients were essentially unchanged. These preterm infants with apnea
      have a decreased carbon dioxide sensitivity. They have a decreased minute
      ventilation primarily as a result of decreased respiratory frequency and their
      alveolar-transcutaneous oxygen gradient is normal. Our findings suggest that the 
      major deficit in these infants is a central disturbance in the regulation of
      breathing.

PG  - 140-3
AB  - In a prospective study estriol, estradiol, progesterone, human placental lactogen
      (HPL) prolactin and SP1 (a placental glycoprotein specific for pregnancy), were
      performed in the second half of uncomplicated pregnancies in order to answer the 
      question if there exist a circadian rhythm of these hormones in serum. All serum 
      concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay at 8.00, 10.00, 16.00, 20.00,
      24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. 58 pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies show no 
      circadian rhythm of serum levels from estriol, progesterone, HPL and SP1, while
      serum levels of estradiol and prolactin have a significant circadian rhythm. The 
      estradiol serum levels are significant higher at 8.00 and 12.00 o'clock,
      significant less at 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. The prolactin serum levels are
      significant less at 16.00 and 20.00, at 4.00 and 8.00 significant higher. In 20
      pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and 12 pregnancies complicated by
      intrauterine growth retardation serum levels of all hormones were measured at
      8.00, 10.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. The serum concentrations in
      complicated pregnancies show no difference to the serum levels in uncomplicated
      pregnancies.

OAB - This discussion identifies some of the health problems experienced by rural women
      in Africa. The first of these health problems is malaria, which is not
      exclusively reserved for rural women. Yet, it is they who are most exposed to
      bites by the mosquitoes which abound more particularly in that country. So
      involved are they in their daily tasks, they often do not even feel these bites, 
      and negligence and/or lack of information prevents them from taking antimalarial 
      drugs. Only when fever or tenacious headaches occur do they decide to take a few 
      nivaquine pills. Often they simply drink medicinal herb teas said to be
      "diuretic." Next on the list is malnutrition, with anemia as its corollary. It is
      caused by ignorance, or lack of information on what food should be eaten; dietary
      customs and taboos deeply anchored in some families and which deprive women of
      the nutrients required by their bodies, especially after childbirth; lack of
      time; and financial difficulties. The problems of malaria and malnutrition affect
      men and children as well as women, but others are specific to women. Closely
      spaced pregnancies, which used to be rare in villages, are now increasingly
      frequent in rural areas. Since planned parenthood is "unknown" in rural areas,
      most women bear a great many children -- 8-10 or more. Placenta previa is a
      frequent condition in such women, and often results in the mother's death, sinc
      the delivery was done in a poorly equipped center and the diagnosis was only made
      at the beginning of labor. Since women are constantly concerned with doing the
      most for their family and satisfying all of their needs, they never rest during
      the day, are excessively tired, and only sleep 5-6 hours a night. In addition to 
      their own specific health problems, mothers often are obliged to spend their
      nights watching, alone, over 1 or more sick children. In sum, these are some of
      the everyday problems encountered in rural areas: the lack of information on
      health matters; the distance from health centers; limited financial resources in 
      the rural population; and the precariousness of means of transportation, and the 
      absence of an emergency transferral system.

PG  - 49-57
AB  - The authors suggest an indirect evaluation of the electrocortical activity of the
      fetus by looking at evidence of cyclical variations in fetal cardiac rhythm.
      These are shown up by periodic changes in the variability of the rhythm. The
      narrow association that has been established between small changes in episodes of
      cardiac rhythm and deep sleep--which is itself evidence of satisfactory cortical 
      development--make this type of tracing, under certain conditions, an excellent
      sign of fetal wellbeing. This means that the value of small variabilities in
      fetal heart rhythm takes on greater importance as a prognostic feature.

AB  - Two hundred and twenty-three cases notes of patients with toxaemia of pregnancy
      were analysed in order to try to establish the ability to predict through
      clinical and biological assessments of the mother the prognosis for the fetus.
      Statistical analysis methods were chosen to work out the classification of the
      parameters and to lead to an index of severity that could be established by a
      multifactorial discriminating analysis. This study confirms that there is an
      inversion in the circadian rhythm of arterial blood pressure, with an increase in
      the evening and at night. It shows how bad prognostically blood pressure
      instability is. On the other hand oedema of the legs is of no significance.
      Contrary to the view that has been held for a long time, an increase in weight is
      directly proportional to fetal parameters. As far as parameters are concerned as 
      a whole (both clinical and biological) a rise in blood urea is more
      discriminating at every stage of the illness and precedes an increase in the
      platelet count, the changes in creatinine clearance and night blood pressure.
      Maternal changes are better correlated with fetal variability before the 35th
      week of the pregnancy whereas after that date the prognostic value of these
      readings is of little importance.

      diethyl ether (diEGdiEE), ethylenethiourea (ETU), sodium selenite (SS), dimethyl 
      phthalate (DMP), naphthalene (NAP), or p-nitrophenol (PNP) were administered by
      gavage for eight consecutive days to female CD-1 mice. Weight loss was
      insensitive as an index of sublethal adult toxicity and was inadequate for
      determining a maximum tolerated dose. LD50 values indicate that SS, NAP, and PNP 
      were more toxic (8.4, 353.6, and 625.7 mg/kg, respectively) than the polyglycol
      ethers, ETU, and DMP (LD50 values ranged from 2525.8 to 6281.9 mg/kg). Each of
      the compounds was administered on d 7 through 14 to pregnant animals at a single 
      dose estimated to be at or just below the threshold of adult lethality. In such a
      reproductive study, each of the compounds could be categorized on the basis of
      the pattern of maternal lethality and fetotoxicity which it produced. The number 
      of dams with complete resorptions was significantly increased after
      administration of ETU, and no mice in the EGdiME-, diEGdiME-, or
      triEGdiME-treated groups delivered any viable offspring. Maternal lethality was
      significant in the EGdiME, triEGdiME, PNP, and NAP groups. There was a slight
      reduction in the average number of live pups per litter in the diEGdiEE- and
      PNP-treated groups and a significant reduction in the NAP group. The number dead 
      per litter was increased with diEGdiEE. SS and DMP had no effect on maternal or
      fetal survival at the doses administered. Individual pup weight at d 1 postpartum
      was only significantly reduced by diEGdiEE, and no gross congenital abnormalities
      were detected in neonates from any treatment group. These results provide
      guidelines for the subsequent toxicity testing of these chemicals.

TI  - Circadian hormonal interactions among the mother, fetus, and amniotic fluid.
PG  - 745-53
AB  - Circadian rhythms and hormonal interactions among the maternal, fetal, and
      amniotic fluid compartments were studied in long-term catheterized rhesus macaque
      monkeys between days 127 and 138 of gestation (term = 167 days). Blood samples
      were collected at 3-hour intervals for 48 hours and analyzed by radioimmunoassay 
      for estrone, estradiol, cortisol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate,
      and prolactin. Distinct circadian rhythms were present for cortisol and
      progesterone in the maternal circulation and for progesterone and
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the fetal circulation (p less than 0.05).
      Although maternal and fetal estrogen levels were higher in AM samples than in PM 
      samples, a statistically significant circadian rhythm was not present (p greater 
      than 0.10). Fetal levels of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and
      maternal levels of progesterone were highest between 9:00 PM and 3:00 AM and
      lowest between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Maternal levels of cortisol were highest
      between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM and lowest between 6:00 PM and 12 midnight. The
      circadian patterns of maternal cortisol and progesterone were inversely related
      to each other (r = -0.68; p less than 0.01). Amniotic fluid cortisol levels were 
      highest between 9:00 AM and 12 noon and lowest between 6:00 PM and 3:00 AM (p
      less than 0.10). With the possible exception of cortisol, amniotic fluid steroid 
      hormones did not demonstrate distinct diurnal fluctuations, nor did they
      correlate with steroid changes in maternal or fetal blood. Because the rhesus
      placenta is permeable to glucocorticoids it is likely that transplacental passage
      of maternal cortisol influences the activity of the fetal pituitary and adrenal
      so that the circadian rhythm in the fetal axis is 180 degrees out of phase with
      that of the maternal axis. The circadian rhythms in fetal dehydroepiandrosterone 
      sulfate and progesterone in late gestation parallel the biorhythm in uterine
      contraction frequency and amplitude, with peaks during periods of darkness
      between 9:00 PM and 3:00 AM.

TI  - [Observations on fetal behavioral states at term in normal pregnancy].
PG  - 738-43
AB  - The authors report on results of examinations of 18 women between the 38th and
      42nd weeks of pregnancy in respect of the observation of foetal sleep/waking
      cycles. The following parameters were noted simultaneously, i.e. with time
      synchronicity: foetal heart rate, foetal eye movements, foetal thorax movements, 
      and movements of the body and extremities. On the basis of the criteria published
      by Prechtl (1974) and by Nijhuis et al. (1982) it is possible to define with
      relative accuracy foetal sleep/waking cycles just before the term of birth; 4
      independent researchers achieved agreement in the allocation of the various
      cycles in 86% of the cases investigated by them. In view of the fact that
      monitoring is complicated and exacting, recording cannot be continuous all the
      time and certain dropout periods must be taken into account. This applies, for
      example, to the foetal heart rate, foetal eye movements and movements of the
      thorax. The average dropout time during recording of foetal heart rate is 16%,
      during recording of foetal eye movements 22%, and of foetal thorax movements 3%. 
      11% of the recordings could not be evaluated because of poor recording quality
      and faulty monitoring. In the study under reference the shortest period of a
      cycle was three minutes, whereas the longest phase recorded so far was 39
      minutes. In 55% of all monitored pregnancies between the 38th and 42nd weeks of
      pregnancy the foetus was awake, whereas in 45% the foetus was found to be asleep.

TI  - Continuous twenty-four hour recording of the fetal cardiac rhythm during normal
      pregnancies.
PG  - 385-8
AB  - Recording the fetal cardiac rhythm (FCR) is currently the technique most widely
      used to assess the well being of the fetus. In view of the importance of the
      decisions taken on the modifications of the FCR, the authors have recorded and
      analysed over 24 consecutive hours 10 resting women manifesting a strictly normal
      pregnancy. They observed no modification in the basal cardiac frequency, very few
      declarations and above all, never any signs of a flat or sinusoidal rhythm.
      Flattening of the FCR is invariably pathological. It must not be interpreted as
      "fetal sleep" period, but it should intensify the surveillance.

TI  - ECoG and breathing activity in fetal lambs after undercut of cerebral cortex.
PG  - 1195-201
AB  - Reduction of cortical inhibition has been suggested as a possible mechanism for
      the transition from episodic fetal to continuous postnatal breathing. Twelve
      fetal lambs were chronically decorticated at 112-115 days gestation. Lateral
      rectus, neck, and diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG), electrocorticogram (ECoG), 
      and tracheal and arterial blood pressure were monitored after allowing 3 days for
      recovery. The fetal lambs were studied for 4-28 days in 2- to 4-h sessions/day.
      There were no episodes of low-voltage high-frequency ECoG activity. The mean
      duration (+/- SD) of rapid eye movements (REM) measured by lateral rectus EMG [11
      +/- 7.9 min and periods of tonic activity or silence [non-REM (NREM)], 14 +/- 7.4
      min] in decorticated fetuses were not statistically different from REM (12 +/-
      5.1 min) and NREM (15 +/- 6.8 min) sleep periods in intact fetuses. After
      decortication, the percentage of time (+/- SD) occupied by different states were 
      phasic diaphragmatic EMG activity 36 +/- 7.8%, tonic diaphragmatic EMG 21 +/-
      8.6%, and diaphragmatic silence 43 +/- 14.2%. Phasic diaphragmatic EMG activity
      occurred together with REM, the latter being present 45 +/- 3.7% of the time.
      Despite decortication, between 115 and 125 days gestation ECoG changed from a
      trace alternans to a high-voltage low-frequency pattern. We conclude that the
      cerebral cortex is not responsible for apnea during fetal life. In addition,
      these data suggest that the cerebral cortex may normally be the source of ECoG
      synchrony.

OAB - Dr. Frederick Zuspan, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology at the 
      Ohio State University College of Medicine, participated in an informal medical
      exchange to Zaire. He was located at the Tchi Kagi Hospital, a regional bush
      hospital near the capital of Kananga. While the hospital is considered one of
      Zaire's most modern, it would compare with an understaffed and poorly-equipped US
      hospital of 80 or 90 years ago. Despite the chronic understaffing and primitive
      medical equipment, results of medical intervention are good. The incidence of
      postoperative infection is surprisingly low, and Dr. Zuspan emphasized the
      excellence of the missionary doctors, as well as the general hardiness of the
      population. He noted a high incidence of tetanus, especially among babies. In the
      cities, pregnant women are given 2 doses of tetanus toxoid as prophylaxis, and
      the midwives are encouraged to cut the umbilical cord long and to refrain from
      the custom of packing the cord with manure or dirt. The latter practice greatly
      increases the risk of neonatal tetanus. Cervical cancer is common, as are
      gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease. The high incidence of infertility seen
      is thought to be associated with gonorrhea and PID. Cancers of the breast, colon,
      and endometrium are rare. Toxemia of pregnancy is also rare, a surprising
      finding, since the maternal diet is often protein deficient. It is speculated
      that the custom of long naps in midday may increase uterine blood flow,
      preventing toxemia.

TI  - Pineal N-acetyltransferase activity in 10-day-old rats: a paradigm for studying
      the developing circadian system.
PG  - 918-25
AB  - Pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in 10-day-old rat pups was used to
      examine several aspects of the developing circadian timing system. When born and 
      reared under constant darkness, 10-day-old animals manifested a clear daily
      rhythm of NAT activity whose phase was in time with the estimated circadian time 
      of the mother (set by the lighting cycle during pregnancy). When pups were reared
      in constant darkness from birth by a foster mother whose circadian time was 180
      degrees (12 h) out of phase with that of the natural mother, the resulting
      population profiles of NAT activity were arrhythmic. Analysis of the individual
      litter profiles from this experiment showed a variable postnatal influence of the
      maternal circadian system on the timing of the developing circadian system.
      Neither cross-fostering per se nor social interactions among litter mates
      contributed significantly to the apparent maternal influence. The magnitude of
      the postnatal maternal influence was not the same throughout development, but was
      most apparent during the first 5 days of life. Neonatal blinding (within 24 h of 
      birth) did not appreciably alter the maternal influence. Extraretinal
      photoreception does not contribute to entrainment of the circadian clock during
      postnatal development, and retina-mediated photic entrainment is present by 10
      days of age. The results indicate that pineal NAT activity monitored in
      10-day-old rats provides a useful paradigm for studying the developing circadian 
      system.

      electroencephalogram.
PG  - 330-5
AB  - Newborn infants of mothers who drink heavily (greater than 2 oz alcohol per day) 
      during pregnancy have been shown to have hypersynchrony of the EEG. The
      possibility that hypersynchrony is related to acute alcohol withdrawal was
      tested. Eleven preterm infants of mothers who drank heavily ("alcoholic") were
      studied at a postnatal age of 4 to 6 weeks using power spectral analysis of EEG
      signals. This group was compared with a control group with similar racial and
      socioeconomic status. In addition, a group of ten "healthy" preterm infants was
      compared with a carefully matched control group. Total power of the EEG during
      quiet, indeterminate and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was 162%, 183%, and 188%,
      respectively, in the infants whose mothers were alcoholic when compared with
      their control infants or with the healthy preterm infants and their control
      infants. It is concluded that ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy may result in
      potentially serious prolonged effects on brain function of the offspring, even in
      the absence of dysmorphology.

TI  - Estimation of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide in newborn infants using
      skin surface blood gas electrodes.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - Using only skin surface blood gas measurements, we calculated the ventilatory
      response to inhaled carbon dioxide from changes in skin surface PCO2 (PSCO2).
      This new method is based on the fact that if CO2 elimination is nearly constant, 
      the change in alveolar ventilation from one steady state level to another is
      inversely proportional to the change in PSCO2. From this we derived a ventilatory
      ratio (VR) for 0%, 2%, and 4% CO2 breathing. A ventilatory response slope is then
      calculated from the three VR values, and is similar to a standard CO2 response
      slope. We serially studied 20 infants (28 to 40 weeks gestation) 2 to 9 weeks of 
      age. Ten infants had serious apnea, ten did not. The infants breathed each test
      gas for 8 to 10 minutes during quiet sleep with skin surface electrodes attached.
      Infants with apnea were studied before and after apneic spells resolved. We found
      that apneic infants had a significantly reduced VR slope compared with that in
      the nonapneic infants, regardless of age. When apnea disappeared, the ventilatory
      ratio slope always increased into the range measured in nonapneic infants. In
      nonapneic infants the ventilatory ratio slope significantly increased with
      postnatal age. We conclude that infants with serious apnea have a reduced
      ventilatory response to CO2 and that the resolution of apnea is associated with
      the development of a normal CO2 response.

TI  - Prenatal effects of alcohol.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Suspicion of alcohol's teratogenic potential stretches back many centuries, but
      it is only recently that solid support for this possibility has been produced.
      There is now little doubt that alcohol can produce developmental defects, but
      there are many questions that still remain to be answered concerning the impact
      of alcohol on the conceptus. One major question that remains to be resolved is
      why only a small percentage of alcoholic women give birth to children with Fetal 
      Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), whereas other alcoholic women who drink the same amount
      do not. Another important issue concerns the way in which alcohol produces its
      effects. Although one of the most likely ways in which alcohol's teratogenic
      actions are mediated appears to be via hypoxia, other mechanisms such as direct
      toxicity of alcohol or acetaldehyde may be involved. FAS refers to a pattern of
      defects in children born to alcoholic women. For a diagnosis of FAS to be made,
      the patient must have three main characteristics: (1) pre- and postnatal growth
      retardation (greater than or equal to 2 S.D. for length and weight), (2) facial
      anomalies, and (3) central nervous system dysfunction Pre- and postnatal growth
      retardation are the most reliable consequences of fetal alcohol exposure. In many
      cases, patients with the syndrome weigh less than 2500 g at birth and most do not
      exhibit postnatal 'catch-up growth' Among the distinctive facial anomalies seen
      in conjunction with the syndrome are absent-to-indistinct philtrum, epicanthic
      folds, thin upper lip and short upturned nose. Joint, limb and cardiac anomalies 
      are also often present. Central nervous system dysfunction includes mental
      retardation, the most serious consequence of in utero alcohol exposure,
      hyperactivity, sleep disorders and miscellaneous behavioral difficulties. If only
      one or two of these broad characteristics are present and the mother is suspected
      of drinking during pregnancy, then a diagnosis of 'possible fetal alcohol
      syndrome,' or 'partial fetal alcohol syndrome,' or 'fetal alcohol effects,' or
      'alcohol-related birth defects' may be made. However, without evidence of
      maternal drinking during pregnancy, this diagnosis is very tentative, since many 
      of these effects are also observed in conjunction with many other congenital
      disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Acceleration of puberty in female mice by a chemosignal from pregnant and
      lactating females: circadian rhythm effects.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - Two experiments were designed to test whether the urinary chemosignal excreted by
      pregnant and lactating female mice that accelerates puberty in young females is
      affected by circadian rhythms. The experiments also measured the possible
      influence of circadian rhythms on the response of the young recipient females.
      For urine from both pregnant and lactating females there was no difference in the
      effectiveness for accelerating puberty in urine collected during all 24 h.
      However, pregnancy urine used for treatment at 1800 and 0000 h, and lactation
      urine used for treatment at 1800, 0000 and 0600 h, all resulted in significantly 
      earlier mean ages for puberty than pregnancy urine treatment at 0600 or 1200 h,
      or lactation urine treatment at 1200 h. There was also a significant interaction 
      between the time of urine collection and the time of urine treatment for each
      urine source; urine was generally more effective in accelerating sexual
      development when used for treating young females at the same hour at which it had
      been collected, or at the time interval(s) just before or after the time at which
      it had been collected.

      derivative (450191-S) (V). General pharmacological activities].
PG  - 175-212
AB  - General pharmacological activities of 450191-S were studied in various species of
      animals and compared with those of reference benzodiazepines (BDZ). 450191-S at
      doses of 10 mg/kg slightly decreased (-5 degrees C) the rectal temperature of
      rabbits. 450191-S decreased respiratory and heart rates in anesthetized cats, but
      the effects were less than those of diazepam or triazolam. 450191-S increased
      respiratory and heart rates in conscious dogs, but had no effect on the blood
      pressure, electrocardiogram and autonomic nervous system in cats and dogs. The
      drug displayed a slight spasmolytic activity in the small intestine of guinea
      pigs and a slight inhibitory effect on isolated non-pregnant and pregnant uteri
      of rats. These effects were less than those of diazepam or nitrazepam. Below
      doses of 25 mg/kg, 450191-S did not affect urinary volume and electrolyte
      excretions in rats. It also decreased brain norepinephrine (NE) turnover rates in
      rats, but decreased NE and dopamine turnover rates in mice. These effects of
      450191-S were less than those of nitrazepam. 450191-S was found to be minimally
      irritating to the ocular mucosa in rabbits and did not irritate the stomach and
      small intestine in rats. These effects were also compared with those of active
      metabolites of 450191-S, M-1, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4, and the superiority of the
      mother compound over its metabolites was clarified.

TI  - EEG and seizure threshold in normal and lissencephalic ferrets.
PG  - 29-38
AB  - Changes in EEG and susceptibility to electrically induced seizures were examined 
      in the ferret with lissencephaly produced by exposure to a single injection of
      methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM Ac) given to the pregnant jill on gestation day 
      32. Ten lissencephalic and 11 normal ferrets were chronically implanted with 14
      cortical stainless steel electrodes. EEG records were sampled from various stages
      of the sleep/awake cycle. Six of each group were subjected to electrical
      stimulation for seizure threshold. Although the number of stimulations and the
      current intensity required to produce epileptiform afterdischarges (AD) and
      seizures were not different between the two groups, the lissencephalic ferrets
      had significantly longer AD and seizures, and a greater number of generalized
      seizures, indicating an enhanced seizure susceptibility. The EEG of the
      lissencephalic ferrets was characterized by increased slow wave activity within
      the low theta band range, extreme spindle activity, focal or multifocal slow and 
      sharp waves, spikes, or spike and slow wave complexes. The differences in the EEG
      were more pronounced during drowsiness and sleep stages. The brains of all of the
      treated animals were lissencephalic and hydrocephalic, and weighed significantly 
      less than those of the normals. The cerebral cortex was thin and flattened, with 
      the parieto-occipital region most severely affected. Heterotopic foci were found 
      in the cerebellum as well as in the cerebral cortex. Abnormalities in the
      configuration of the cerebellar folia were also seen. Comparison between the
      electrophysiological and neuropathological data suggests that the extent of the
      extreme spindle activity, and longer AD and seizure duration depended on the
      degree of cerebellar dysplasia, whereas the EEG focal abnormalities were related 
      to lesions in the cerebral hemispheres.

      weighing 2,500 grams or less and an equal number of mothers of 3,000-up to-4,000 
      gram babies matched by place and month of birth. A correlation was found between 
      low-birth-weight babies and maternal age, stature, menstrual history and past
      history. The mother's occupation, educational career, smoking habits, amount of
      sleep each day, date of issue of the Mother's Handbook and the number of the
      periodical health examinations received can be listed as socio-medical factors.
      Bleeding and lower abdominal pain during pregnancy, anemia and toxemia of
      pregnancy are found as prenatal factors. Low-birth-weight babies are found to be 
      correlated with multiple pregnancy, breech presentation, placenta previa and
      premature separation of the placenta, also.

TI  - The suprachiasmatic nuclei of the fetal rat: characterization of a functional
      circadian clock using 14C-labeled deoxyglucose.
PG  - 1677-82
AB  - The circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) was characterized
      in the fetal rat by using 14C-labeled deoxyglucose to monitor glucose utilization
      (metabolic activity) of the nuclei. A clear day-night oscillation of metabolic
      activity was detectable in the fetal SCN from the 19th through the 21st days of
      gestation; the nuclei were metabolically active during the subjective day and
      metabolically inactive during the subjective night. During the subjective day on 
      gestational day 21, the fetal SCN were found to manifest high metabolic activity 
      for most of the subjective day. We were able to acutely dissociate SCN metabolic 
      activity in the mother rat from that in the fetus by exposing the pregnant
      animals to light during the normal dark period of diurnal lighting on gestational
      day 20. The results show the utility of the deoxyglucose method for directly
      investigating prenatally the function of the biological clock located in the SCN.

TI  - Presence of delta-sleep-inducing peptide-like material in human milk.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP)-like material was detected in human breast
      milk of two women by RIA with a recovery of about 90%. The high concentration of 
      DSIP-like immunoreactivity (DSIP-LI) in colostrum (30 ng/ml) decreased to about
      10 ng/ml in milk. The concentration continued to decrease over the next 2 months 
      in one women. In the same woman, a significant circadian rhythm of the amount of 
      breast milk DSIP was found with the peak in the afternoon and the trough in the
      morning. A significant effect of the sampling procedure was detected in the other
      woman examined; lower amounts of DSIP-LI were found when the milk was collected
      before and higher concentrations after nursing. Gel chromatography revealed that 
      most of the immunoreactive DSIP-LI in milk and colostrum occurred in a form
      larger than the nonapeptide. The presence of DSIP itself, however, was
      demonstrated by high pressure liquid chromatography, which also showed additional
      peptides reacting with the antibody. Digestion of the large immunoreactive
      DSIP-LI by trypsin produced a peak on Sephadex G-10 that coeluted with DSIP. This
      peak contained three immunoreactive fractions with retention times on high
      pressure liquid chromatography similar to DSIP, phosphorylated DSIP, and
      N-tyrosine-DSIP. Plasma samples taken during pregnancy were assayed for DSIP but 
      no difference from normal values was found. Slightly higher amounts were found in
      placenta than in blood, which might be due to interfering substances. No
      Tyr-MIF-1 or corticotropin-releasing hormone was detected by RIA in human breast 
      milk. Peptides and proteins of milk can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal
      tract of babies, but it is not known if the DSIP-LI in human milk is involved in 
      the induction of a sleep-wake cycle in neonates.

      Swallowing bouts were associated with a low-voltage electrocorticogram, eye

      movement; n.r.e.m.) sleep when swallowing and also suggest that they are not in
      r.e.m. sleep as conventionally defined; we consider that fetuses may be in a
      state of heightened activity resembling wakefulness. Swallowing bouts were always
      accompanied by fetal breathing movements. When a swallow coincided with an
      inspiratory effort the diaphragm was briefly inhibited. Evidence was obtained
      that bouts of fetal ingestive activity were not dependent upon outpourings of
      fluid from the lungs and were not significantly influenced by volume information 
      from the gastric compartments.

PG  - 63-73
AB  - Advances have recently been made in understanding the pharmacokinetics of
      theophylline. To correlate the new knowledge of theophylline pharmacokinetics
      with the drug's current status in therapy, we have critically reviewed the
      relevant investigations of the last 5 years. We consider data on its presumed
      mechanisms of action, factors affecting its clearance, its use in pregnancy,
      treatment of overdoses, and important drug interactions. Theophylline clearance
      is decreased by concomitant use of erythromycin, cimetidine, high-dose
      allopurinol, oral contraceptives, and caffeine. Clearance is increased by
      concomitant use of phenobarbital and phenytoin. Newly discovered actions of
      theophylline include dose-dependent improvement of diaphragmatic contractility,
      augmentation of ventilatory response to hypoxia, and sleep disturbances
      (especially with high-dose treatments). Points clinically relevant to the daily
      use of theophylline derivatives and the importance of sustained-release
      preparations are discussed. Theophylline continues to play a major role in
      therapy for reactive airways disease.

AB  - Prospective data on 86 pregnant women were analysed to investigate the
      relationship between the pregnancy symptoms of nausea and vomiting and various
      demographic, social and psychological factors. In contrast to previous research
      findings no significant differences were discovered along demographic or social
      dimensions between women reporting no nausea, mild nausea and severe nausea
      during the first trimester of pregnancy. Not surprisingly, those women
      experiencing severe nausea reported significantly more sleep disturbances,
      fatigue and irritability. Women having both nausea and vomiting during the first 
      trimester, reported significantly more unplanned, undesired pregnancies and
      negative relationships with their own mothers, than first trimester groups
      experiencing nausea only or no symptoms. Finally, those with continuing nausea
      and vomiting in the third trimester, when compared with those having no symptoms,
      tended to have reported significantly more psychological/psychiatric problems in 
      the first trimester and were significantly more negative in their assessment of
      their own maternal relationship.

TI  - RU 486: a steroid with antiglucocorticosteroid activity that only disinhibits the
      human pituitary-adrenal system at a specific time of day.
PG  - 3879-82
AB  - RU 486 is a synthetic steroid hormone antagonist which acts at the receptor
      level. It has both intrinsic anti-progesterone and antiglucocorticosteroid
      properties in animals. We investigated the antiglucocorticosteroid activity in
      humans by evaluating the pituitary-adrenal response to RU 486 in men and in
      pregnant and nonpregnant women. In non-pregnant women, RU 486 (approximately
      equal to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day) produced an interruption of the luteal
      phase without affecting the pituitary-adrenal axis, thereby indicating a more
      potent anti-progesterone than antiglucorticosteroid effect. In the course of
      pregnancy interruption by RU 486 (approximately equal to 4 mg/kg per day), there 
      was a significant increase in plasma corticotropin, beta-lipotropin, and cortisol
      concentrations. In normal men, RU 486 administration led to a dose-dependent
      stimulation of plasma corticotropin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol. This
      disinhibition of the pituitary-adrenal axis was only observed during the morning 
      hours of the circadian rhythm. When administered concomitantly with 1 mg of
      dexamethasone at midnight, 6 mg of RU 486 per kg completely suppressed the
      dexamethasone inhibitory effect on the pituitary-adrenal axis. These results
      indicate that RU 486 is an antiglucocorticosteroid that disrupts the negative
      pituitary feedback of both the morning cortisol rise and administered
      dexamethasone. Furthermore, they demonstrate the possibility of optimizing the
      anti-progestational effect of the compound and its potential use for human
      fertility control by modifying the dose and the time of administration of the
      drug and thereby minimizing the antiglucocorticosteroid effect.

TI  - Maternal phase setting of fetal circadian oscillation underlying the plasma
      corticosterone rhythm in rats.
PG  - 1791-6
AB  - We examined the entraining effect of the maternal circadian system on the fetal
      circadian oscillation during pregnancy. The circadian rhythm of locomotor
      activity and plasma corticosterone of pregnant rats was abolished by bilateral
      ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei at day 10 of gestation. At term, pups were
      removed by Cesarean section and were blinded immediately. To avoid possible
      rhythmic influences of a nursing mother on the pups' circadian rhythms,
      alternating nursing was imposed on blinded infants. Thus, pups were exchanged
      every 12 h between two foster mothers, one entrained to a light-dark cycle and
      the other to dark-light, so that one group of pups were always nursed in the
      light period and the other in the dark. Both groups of pups showed free-running
      circadian hormone rhythms with similar phase angles. However, the circadian
      rhythm of these pups was always phase delayed by about 8 h to that of blinded
      control pups which were born to unoperated mothers. Furthermore, blinded pups
      born to and nursed by a suprachiasmatic nuclei lesioned mother developed a
      circadian hormone rhythm which was phase delayed by 4 h to that of the control.
      It is concluded that the circadian oscillation underlying the rhythm of
      corticosterone release in rats has entrained to the maternal circadian system
      during fetal life. It is further suggested that the entrainment starts before day
      10 of gestation.

PG  - 141-5
AB  - No mention is made of any aspect of BP bioperiodicity, among current clinical
      criteria for diagnosing pregnancy-related hypertension. The abnormal BP, based on
      a single unqualified measurement, is accepted and utilized as a clinical feature 
      to identify pregnancy at risk. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood
      pressure were measured every 15 min for 24 h in 5 women (2 non pregnant
      clinically healthy subjects, 1 clinically healthy subject in her third trimester 
      of pregnancy, 1 presenting mild and 1 severe toxiemia, also in their third
      trimester of pregnancy) by an automated BP recording apparatus (Dynamap). All
      variables, analyzed by the single cosinor method, exhibited statistically
      significant circadian rhythms. A high amplitude could nullify the
      time-unqualified usual range. The change in circadian amplitude precedes an overt
      mesor hypertension and constitutes a tool for earlier detection of fetal
      distress.

TI  - CO2 and naloxone modify sleep/wake state and activate breathing in the acute
      fetal lamb preparation.
PG  - 325-40
AB  - We studied locally anesthetized lamb fetuses (140-144 days' gestation) in utero
      on the day of surgical preparation (the acute preparation) to correlate
      sleep/wake (S/W) states with fetal breathing movements (FBM) activated by CO2
      with and without endorphin displacement by naloxone. We placed electrodes for
      definition of S/W states, a carotid arterial catheter for injections and
      measurements of pressure, pHa, PaCO2 and PaO2, and intratracheal and
      intraesophageal catheters for measurement of FBM and esophageal motility. We
      recorded the onset, pattern and cessation of breathing and estimated fetal
      respiratory responsivity to CO2 rebreathing by the ewe using our fetal CO2 test
      (Moss, I.R. and Scarpelli , E.M., 1979, J. Appl. Physiol. 47: 527-531).
      Activation of breathing by CO2 either accompanied or followed wakefulness (W).
      FBM and W were sustained throughout CO2 stimulation. Cessation of breathing after
      the CO2 test was temporally associated with the resumption of sleep. When the
      test was started in active sleep (AS) and W, breathing threshold to CO2 was lower
      than when it was started in quiet sleep (QS). Naloxone treatment (1) resulted in 
      activation of FBM in association with W, (2) lowered CO2 threshold as compared to
      that of CO2 tests entered in QS without naloxone, and (3) caused greater FBM
      responses to CO2 than without naloxone. These results extend previous reports
      from our laboratory in that they demonstrate the importance of W to normal
      respiratory responsivity to CO2 in the acute fetal preparation and the possible
      role of endorphins in respiratory control.

TI  - Respiratory pauses in very low risk prematurely born infants reaching normal
      term. A comparison to full-term newborns.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - We studied the occurrence of greater than or equal to 2 sec. respiratory pauses
      (RP) in very low risk, normal prematurely born infants (less than or equal to 36 
      wks. of gestation), recorded when they reached 37-40 wks. conceptional age and
      compared the results with those of full-term (37-41 wks. of gestation) newborns. 
      The influence of gestational age at birth (GA), postnatal age, sleep states, twin
      birth and gross body movements was tested. We recorded 2434 central RP and only
      one 4 sec. duration obstructive RP. We never observed RP greater than 15 sec.
      10-15 sec. RP were rare, noted only in 37-38 wks. GA newborns. We found some
      differences between prematures reaching normal term on one hand and full-term
      newborns on the other: a) RP frequency and periodic breathing were higher in
      prematurely born infants; b) Between-sleep state differences leveled out in
      prematures reaching normal term (they had more numerous RP in all sleep states), 
      while the prevalence of RP in active sleep compared to quiet sleep was constant
      in full-term newborns. There were no significant differences between prematurely 
      born twins and singletons. When they reached normal term, infants born before 35 
      wks. of gestation had more RP, compared to infants born at 35-36 wks. of
      gestation. About 12% of RP occurred after gross body movements.

TI  - The influence of acute hypoxia and sleep states on the electrical activity of the
      cerebellum in the sheep fetus.
PG  - 166-73
AB  - The experiments were designed to examine (1) the effects of acute hypoxia and (2)
      the influence of sleep states on the electrical activity of the cerebellum in the
      fetus. Five fetal sheep were instrumented between 106 and 133 days of gestation
      and survived in utero until term (140-146 days). Insulated stainless steel
      electrodes (75 microns diam.) were introduced into the cerebellar cortex and
      cemented in place. Electrodes were also implanted into 4 fetuses to monitor the
      electrocorticogram, rapid eye movements and the EMG of the dorsal neck (nuchal)
      muscles. Recordings of cerebellar activity were made for 252 h in 4 fetuses. The 
      recordings were derived from many units (probably Purkinje cells) with a high
      level of basal discharge. The mean firing frequency was related to fetal sleep
      state. The highest frequencies coincided with episodes of rapid eye movements
      with low-voltage electrocortical activity and the lowest occurred during
      high-voltage electrocortical activity when rapid eye movements are absent. Acute 
      hypoxaemia (fetal pa O2 6-10 mm Hg for up to 30 min) abolished rapid eye
      movements and caused a marked reduction in cerebellar activity. High-voltage
      electrocortical activity and nuchal EMG activity were maintained indicating that 
      the effects of hypoxia on the cerebellum were not due simply to a general CNS
      depression. Cerebellar neural activity returned to normal at the termination of
      the hypoxic stimuli demonstrating that fetal Purkinje cells can withstand short
      episodes of severe hypoxia.

TI  - The effects of myometrial activity on fetal thoracic dimensions and uterine blood
      flow during late gestation in the sheep.
PG  - 244-51
AB  - We wished to investigate mechanisms by which non-labour contractions of the
      uterus influence fetal sleep states and respiratory activity during late
      pregnancy. The relationship between the dimensions of the fetal chest and uterine
      contractions was examined in 5 pregnant sheep. The dorso-ventral dimension at the
      level of the xiphisternum (3 fetuses) decreased, on average by 4.4-9.4% while
      increases of 16.6-18.7% were seen in the transverse dimension (4 fetuses). Blood 
      flow in a middle uterine artery was monitored using a Doppler technique in 5
      pregnant sheep. Non-labour uterine contractions were accompanied by mean
      reductions of 6.5-12.7% in blood flow. Postural adjustments by the ewe also
      influenced uterine blood flow. A mean increase in blood flow of 5.9-12.0%
      followed a change from standing to lying; standing caused a mean reduction of
      5.9-11.8%. We conclude that the influence of uterine contractions on the fetus is
      likely to be complex, involving distortion of the body and alterations in
      utero-placental haemodynamics.

TI  - Effects of elimination of maternal circadian rhythms during pregnancy on the
      postnatal development of circadian corticosterone rhythm in blinded infantile
      rats.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - The influence of maternal circadian rhythms on fetal circadian oscillations
      during pregnancy was examined. Circadian rhythms of spontaneous locomotor
      activity and plasma corticosterone level in pregnant rats were eliminated by
      bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) at different stages of
      gestation and the postnatal manifestation of the circadian corticosterone rhythm 
      was examined in individual pups. Effective lesions of SCN at day 3 of gestation
      resulted in an abortion in all rats examined. Rats whose SCN were lesioned at day
      10 or 17 of gestation maintained their pregnancies. At term, pups were removed by
      Cesarean operation and immediately blinded by bilateral ocular enucleation; they 
      were reared by unoperated foster mother afterwards. All pups from SCN lesioned
      mothers showed a clear free running circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone
      levels after the 4th week of postnatal life. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm
      that developed in pups from SCN-lesioned mother at day 10 of gestation (G10 pups)
      was always phase-delayed about 4 h as compared with that in pups from mothers
      whose SCN were lesioned at day 17 of gestation (G17 pups) and in pups from
      sham-operated mothers (S pups). It is concluded that the circadian hormone
      rhythmicity develops in normal fashion postnatally when the maternal SCN are
      effectively lesioned after day 10 of gestation. The phase-angle difference in the
      circadian rhythm between G10 pups and G17 or S pups suggests that fetal circadian
      oscillation is entrainable at least after day 10 of gestation.

PG  - 539-41
AB  - Intra-uterine fetal movements indicate the wellbeing of the fetus and can be used
      in the detection of chronic fetal asphyxia. The daily variations in fetal
      activity follow an irregular pattern, though showing a peak of activity in the
      evening. The pattern of nocturnal activity is not known. In this study, fetal
      movements were monitored by maternal subjective recordings in 116 women with a
      normal pregnancy. In gestational weeks 31-40, fetal movements were recorded
      intermittently for at least 3 hours, both in the daytime and at night. In the
      daytime, fetal activity was moderate. A maximum occurred in the evening between 9
      and 10 p.m. At night there was a period of minimum activity between 1 and 5 a.m. 
      A minor peak in fetal activity was seen between 7 and 8 a.m. The frequency of
      fetal movements followed a pattern of a circadian rhythm, which was influenced by
      exogenous factors.

TI  - Serum cortisol concentrations in gilts and sows housed in tether stalls,
      gestation stalls and individual pens.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - Three experiments were conducted to determine whether housing in tether stalls,
      gestation stalls or individual pens imposes a stress upon gilts and sows. Changes
      in serum cortisol concentrations were used as the indicator for stress. In the
      first experiment, gilts were placed in tether stalls and individual pens to
      determine cortisol concentrations after tethering and to see if this response was
      different from gilts that were previously tethered for two weeks. In the second
      experiment, gilts were tethered in order to determine if penning in tether stalls
      altered the circadian rhythm of cortisol. In the third experiment, breeding sows 
      were placed in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens to determine if
      a ten-hour profile of cortisol concentrations were altered and if such housing
      affected a sow's response to transfer to farrowing crates. The results indicate
      that the initial response to tethering varied among gilts and sows and this
      variation appeared to be due to previous penning and human handling experiences. 
      When tethering was stressful, acclimation required up to four days. However, once
      acclimated, tethering resulted in higher morning concentrations which may be
      associated with the greater activity that occurs at this time. Housing in tether 
      stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens was not a stress for breeding sows
      and did not alter sows' responses to transfer into the farrowing crate.

TI  - The central control of fetal breathing and skeletal muscle movements.
PG  - 1-18
AB  - Breathing movements in the sheep fetus have been observed from a gestational age 
      of about 40 days. From 95 to 115 days fetal breathing movements are almost
      continuous, interrupted by apnoea rarely exceeding 2 min. From 115 days until
      term (about 147 days) breathing and movements of the trunk and limbs are
      episodic. Breathing normally occurs only during rapid-eye-movement sleep as
      identified by low-voltage cortical electrical activity. Active movements of the
      neck muscles occur predominantly in high-voltage electrocortical activity.
      Hypercapnia or acid cerebrospinal fluid perfusion cause an increase in the
      regularity and depth of breathing when present, and recruit intercostal and
      laryngeal abductor activity. Isocapnic hypoxia, however, in contrast to the
      hyperventilation seen postnatally, causes arrest of fetal breathing movements.
      This effect is due to a central inhibition. Section of the brain stem, from the
      caudal hypothalamus rostrally, causes dissociation of fetal breathing movements
      and electrocortical activity into independent rhythms. Section of the brain stem 
      caudally, in the upper pons or at the inferior colliculus, also causes a
      dissociation of electrocortical activity from breathing movements, which become
      almost continuous. Isocapnic hypoxia causes an increase in the rate and depth of 
      breathing movements. It is concluded that the arrest of breathing in intact fetal
      lambs is not due to a direct effect on the respiratory centre in the medulla. The
      lumbar polysynaptic flexor reflex response becomes episodic after 115 days
      gestation but, in contrast to fetal breathing movements, is enhanced during
      high-voltage electrocortical activity. Isocapnic hypoxia arrests movements of the
      fetal limbs and trunk and inhibits the lumbar flexor reflex. This inhibition of
      the reflex is prevented by section of the spinal cord at T12, but persists after 
      section of the brain stem in the upper pons. It is attributed to an action on the
      medulla, independent of the systemic arterial chemoreceptors. Small doses of
      pentobarbitone (5 mg/kg) cause arrest of fetal breathing movements by a
      suprapontine mechanism, abolished by brain stem transection, and inhibition of
      the lumbar flexor reflex by an action on the spinal cord, persisting after
      transection at T12. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase (indomethacin,
      meclofenamate or aspirin) induce continuous fetal breathing movements, while
      prostaglandin E2 arrests fetal breathing. The site of action is on the medulla,
      as shown by section of the brain stem and of afferents from the systemic arterial
      chemoreceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Variation of serum myoglobin levels in normal individuals. With reference to the 
      use of myoglobin measurements for the detection of women carrying genes for the
      X-linked muscular dystrophies.
PG  - 41-58
AB  - The extent of variation in the serum myoglobin (Mb) levels of normal healthy
      females were investigated so that the value of Mb measurements for carrier
      detection could be properly assessed. Factors considered were sex, age, menstrual
      status, pregnancy, diurnal variation and daily activity. In each instance, Mb
      levels were compared with those for serum creatine kinase (CK). A significant
      difference (P less than 0.001) was found between the Mb levels of men and women
      but no relationship could be found between several measurements of body build and
      the Mb or CK levels of either sex. An apparent correlation of Mb concentrations
      with age was found in control groups of both sexes up to 85 years of age, but
      this was not significant below 60 years of age. No differences in Mb levels were 
      found among premenarchal, menstruating, postmenopausal or hysterectomised women
      and neither smoking nor the use of oral contraceptives seemed to affect Mb
      levels. Serum CK levels were very much higher in premenarchal (P less than 0.001)
      and postmenarchal (P less than 0.05) teenagers than in adult controls. No
      difference was found between the mean Mb levels of non-pregnant and pregnant
      (6-40 weeks) women. The mean value for CK activity was significantly lower than
      normal in the pregnant women (P less than 0.001). A marked circadian rhythm of
      serum MB levels was found with samples taken at 5 p.m. being approximately 20%
      lower than those taken at 9 a.m. This unexpected decrease during the day
      persisted with 48 hours of bedrest suggesting that this rhythm is inherent and
      unrelated to muscular activity.

      utilizing 2-[14C]deoxyglucose, of brain structures in a healthy, non-breathing
      chronic fetal sheep preparation in late gestation. This preliminary result
      suggests that during quiet sleep (non-breathing state) the fetal sheep may be
      processing a variety of sensory input from the auditory, vestibular, and
      olfactory systems at a thalamic, limbic system level.

TI  - Physiological factors affecting drug toxicity.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - Physiological factors that affect the fate of drugs in the body and thereby have 
      effects on their pharmacology and toxicology involve the systems that control
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The main factors are
      disease, genetics, and age. Nutritional status, sex, hormonal status (e.g., the
      effects of pregnancy), and circadian rhythm have important influences. Maternal
      toxicity will affect the fetus. The absorption and excretion of drugs are
      frequently reduced by diseases. Excretion is reduced by impaired renal function, 
      often found in the elderly, which may increase the toxic response. Distribution
      is affected by body weight and build, for example, the proportion of fat. The
      disposition of many drugs has been shown to be significantly influenced by
      circadian rhythms such that therapeutic doses may exhibit toxicity if
      administered at an inappropriate time of day. Metabolism is modified by
      environmental influences including previous food and drug experience, and various
      factors such as age, sex, and disease. Intersubject variations in drug
      disposition can be very great with possibly severe consequences for the
      individual; in this regard, knowledge of genetic polymorphism in drug
      metabolizing enzymes is rapidly increasing. The toxicology of a drug may be
      profoundly affected by a particular disease state, for example, the
      administration of a drug that might be a tumor promoter when a cancerous or
      precancerous condition exists. These effects are illustrated with examples from
      the literature and recent studies undertaken in the Bureau of Drug Research.

TI  - GABA-mediated inhibition of breathing in the late gestation sheep fetus.
PG  - 353-60
AB  - The effects of the GABA antagonist picrotoxin, and the GABA agonist muscimol,
      have been studied in chronically instrumented unanaesthetized fetal sheep of
      115-132 days gestation. Picrotoxin (300-400 micrograms/kg intravenous bolus
      injection) induced a period of stimulated breathing (40-112 min) which was
      associated with high voltage electrocortical activity, but inhibited by hypoxia. 
      Muscimol (4 mg infused) had the opposite effect and caused a prolonged period of 
      apnoea (85-418 mins) which was followed by a rebound period of increased
      breathing. These observations suggest that the GABA-ergic system may be involved 
      in the apnoea of high voltage sleep states in the late gestation fetal sheep, but
      not in the apnoea associated with hypoxaemia in the fetus.

OAB - 239 women, who constituted 61% of the 389 undergoing sterilization operations in 
      a Geneva maternity hospital in 1977, were interviewed by telephone 18 months-2
      years later to assess the occurrence of psychosexual side effects. 20% reported
      gaining more than 3 kg; 10% experienced psychological trouble manifested in
      irritability, depression, or sleep disorders; 15% reported a persistent desire
      for a child or pregnancy; 1/3 reported an improved sexual adjustment; 10%
      reported a deterioration; and 7% reported experiencing pain during intercourse.
      20% were under 30 years old at the time of the operation but they did not
      experience a higher rate of side effects than the older women. Women without any 
      children, women from lower socioeconomic levels, and immigrant women expressed
      higher degrees of regret. Women exposed to religious opposition to sterilization,
      all of whom were practicing Catholics, were more likely to experience
      psychosexual side effects. Negative repercussions were also more common when the 
      decision was made on medical grounds rather than as a personal choice by the
      woman, and when the procedure immediately followed abortion or childbirth. 16%
      felt that they had received insufficient medical information prior to the
      procedure. The experience of regret at not having another child and desire for
      another pregnancy were less when women who had themselves undergone the operation
      were involved in counseling.

TI  - [Pharmacotherapy of epilepsy--current problems and controversies].
PG  - 363-86
AB  - Current trends and controversies in the antiepileptic drug therapy are reviewed
      from a clinical view. The usefulness of prophylactic therapy of febrile seizures 
      and posttraumatic seizures or posttraumatic epilepsy is compromised by
      difficulties in the management of the patients especially by noncompliance.
      Previously untreated epilepsies can be treated successfully in 70--80% of the
      patients. Phenytoin or carbamazepine are equally effective for generalized
      tonic-clonic seizures of focal seizures, while absence seizures are controlled by
      ethosuximide or valproic acid. Only when the epilepsy is uncontrolled despite
      high plasma concentrations which cannot be raised because of side effects, a
      second drug should be given. A second drug is successful in about one out of six 
      patients with focal epilepsy. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and
      primidone seem to be equally effective for these drug-resistant cases. Status
      epilepticus can be treated with intravenous diazepam or phenytoin and, if
      necessary, with an infusion of phenytoin. Rectal diazepam is useful for acute
      pediatric therapy. Drugs of second choice are clonazepam, phenobarbital,
      lidocaine, and clomethiazole. In the pregnant epileptic patient a drop in the
      plasma concentration of antiepileptic drugs mainly through non-compliance and
      seizure provocation through sleep deprivation are major sources for the
      deterioration of epilepsies during pregnancy. The "fetal antiepileptic drug
      syndrome", malformations and an increased risk for epilepsy in the child are
      discussed as an interaction of parental epilepsy and drug-exposure during
      pregnancy. Finally, the interpretation of abnormal clinical chemistry data is
      reviewed. Disorders of the liver, bone, thyroid gland and blood are rarely seen
      in treated epileptic patients usually when specific risk factors are present. The
      over-interpretation of laboratory abnormalities e.g. an isolated increase of
      gamma-GT may lead to iatrogenic deterioration of epilepsy when the effective dose
      of the drug is reduced for unfounded fear of hepatic toxicity.

PG  - 495-506
AB  - The effects of cooling have been studied in chronically instrumented
      unanaesthetized fetal lambs of 106-132 days gestation. Cold stimulation of
      cutaneous thermoreceptors by means of a coil placed around the fetus in the
      amniotic cavity induced continuous breathing which was associated with
      high-voltage electrocortical activity throughout the cooling period. Direct
      internal cooling by means of an intragastric cooling coil did not alter fetal
      breathing or sleep-state patterns. Shivering occurred in response to both
      external and internal cooling, and this response was present as early as 106 days
      gestation, well before the appearance of high-voltage sleep. In older fetuses
      there was evidence of a reduction in thermoregulatory responses during
      low-voltage electrocortical activity, but not of the complete suspension of
      thermoregulation characteristic of low-voltage (r.e.m.) sleep seen in mature
      animals. It is concluded that deep regular breathing associated with high-voltage
      electrocortical activity can be induced by cold stimulation of cutaneous
      thermoreceptors, but not by a reduction in core temperature alone. Furthermore,
      fetal responses to cooling are present as early as 106 days gestation.

TI  - Eye movements in the human fetus and newborn.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - The human oculomotor system becomes active long before birth. At about 16 weeks
      (post-menstrual age) the first slow changes of eye position can be observed with 
      the aid of real time ultrasonography. At 18-20 weeks more rapid eye movements are
      detectable. There is a gradual decline in the percentage of time spent in rapid
      and slow eye movements from 32-40 weeks. These eye movements are organized in
      episodes of activity, divided by episodes of quiescence which are at first
      unrelated to cyclical changes in other variables (such as breathing movements,
      body movements and fetal heart rate patterns). At about 36 weeks gestation, REM
      and non-REM episodes become linked with other changes and then represent
      behavioural states identical to those seen in the newborn infant. This
      organization of behavioral states in the fetus is identical with that found in
      preterm infants of comparable age. Opening of eyelids is difficult to see before 
      birth but the existence of episodes of wakefulness seems most probable. Hence
      fetal eye movements will be in part related to wakefulness. In the newborn at
      term, the interval distributions of REMs during sleep and of scanning eye
      movements during wakefulness are statistically different.

      received 15 min rocking/heartbeat when inactive for 90 sec, but only for 1
      stimulation period per hour. Assessments included measures of neurological
      functioning, sleep-wake activity, mother-infant interaction, and mental and motor
      development at 8 and 24 months. All experimental infants, compared to controls,
      showed decreased rates of activity while in the hospital, fewer abnormal
      reflexes, and better orienting responses. At 24 months, experimental infants
      scored significantly higher on the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales.
      Few differences were found in parent-infant interaction patterns. The results
      indicate that both temporal patterning and contingent responsiveness in the
      preterm infant's early environment contribute positively to some aspects of the
      development of such infants.

TI  - Prevention of continuous light-induced anovulation in rats by early exposure to
      continuous light.
PG  - 355-61
AB  - Continuous illumination (LL) beginning at 22 days of age caused precocious
      puberty followed by persistent estrus with anovulation in female offspring
      originating from mother rats exposed to a 14L:10D light-dark cycle prior to and
      during pregnancy. However, LL had no deleterious effect on reproductive cycles of
      offspring reared in LL and originating from mothers exposed to LL prior to and
      during pregnancy. These rats had a normal onset of puberty in LL, a normal 4-day 
      estrous cycle, a periodic rise of plasma estrogen prior to the periodic
      appearance of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and spontaneous
      ovulation in LL continued until at least 300 days of age. Also, the female
      offspring of these rats showed a similar resistance to the deleterious effects of
      LL on cyclic ovulation. These results support the following interpretation: 1)
      offspring from mother rats exposed to LL prior to and during pregnancy become
      insensitive to the deleterious effects of LL on cyclic ovulation, 2) neural
      elements controlling cyclic release of LH are not totally photoperiod
      (14L:10D)-dependent, and 3) in the absence of daily 14L:10D signals, an
      endogenous clock, possibly timed by daily laboratory signals (temperature, noise,
      taking of vaginal smears), may provide time cues for cyclic LH release.

TI  - Change of seizure frequency in pregnant epileptic women.
PG  - 751-5
AB  - The effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency was monitored prospectively in 136
      pregnancies of 122 epileptic women. Pregnancy did not influence the seizure
      frequency in 68 pregnancies (50%). In 50 pregnancies (37%) the number of seizures
      increased during pregnancy or puerperium. The seizure frequency decreased in 18
      pregnancies (13%). In 34 out of 50 pregnancies (68%) the increase was associated 
      with non-compliance with the drug regimen or sleep deprivation. In seven out of
      18 pregnancies (39%) improvement was related to correction of non-compliance or
      sleep deprivation during the pregestational nine months. Insufficiently low
      plasma concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were found in 47% of the women with 
      uncontrolled epilepsy during pregnancy. The course of epilepsy during pregnancy
      is primarily influenced by non-compliance, sleep deprivation during pregnancy,
      and inadequate therapy before and during pregnancy. With good medical attention
      pregnancy itself seems to have only a minimal influence on the course of
      epilepsy.

TI  - Ontogeny of an oscillation underlying the circadian rhythm of plasma
      corticosterone in rats.
PG  - 739-42
AB  - In previous reports (J. Physiol. 325, 493, 507, 521, 1982) we have suggested a
      prenatal onset of the circadian oscillation in rats. This was based mainly on the
      findings obtained in pups which were reared by an alternating nursing. In the
      present study we have applied this technique to experiments which were designed
      to determine the stage of gestation in the original mother that decided the phase
      angle of pup's hormone rhythm which was to develop later in the postnatal life.
      In this experiment we observed, though preliminarily, that reversal of the
      light-dark cycle of the pregnant mother at day 10 of pregnancy resulted in an
      effective reversal of pup's hormone rhythm, whereas the reversal at day 17 of
      pregnancy failed to affect it. From these results it is surmised that the
      original mother primarily determined the phase angle of the circadian oscillation
      in the fetus prior to the 17th day of gestation.

PG  - 271-2
AB  - A 30-year-old, 36-week pregnant, female was admitted to the hospital with
      progressive "asthma" and wheezing. She was markedly dyspneic and unable to lie
      down or to sleep for periods over an hour. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an
      endobronchial tumor just above the carina. Following ventilating tracheal
      bronchoscopy with dilatation of the trachea and establishment of an airway
      through the tumor, a cesarean section was performed with resultant delivery of a 
      healthy, female, infant. A partial abruptio placentae was noted. Under the same
      anesthetic, a right posterior lateral thoracotomy with resection of the tracheal 
      tumor was performed. Preoperative and operative considerations are described.

TI  - Placental transfer and maternal midazolam kinetics.
PG  - 786-91
AB  - Midazolam was given in a single 15-mg oral dose as a sedative the evening before 
      elective cesarean section. Twelve hours later, levels of this new benzodiazepine 
      were measureable in the fetomaternal entity in only one of 13 cases. After 15 mg 
      midazolam orally or 0.05 mg/kg midazolam intramuscularly 15 to 60 min before
      elective cesarean section, there was evident transfer of drug into the placenta, 
      but transfer took place more slowly than with diazepam. On the basis of kinetics 
      derived from maternal serum concentrations after oral, intramuscular, or
      intravenous dosing, midazolam appears to have a rapid onset and short duration of
      action, which was also evident from subjective assessments by the patients. There
      was wide interindividual variation in the gastrointestinal absorption of
      midazolam in full-term pregnant women. Clinically, midazolam nevertheless seemed 
      to be very useful for nocturnal sedation before elective cesarean section; it
      ensures a mean duration of sleep of about 6 hr and there are virtually no
      detectable levels of drug in the fetomaternal entity the next morning.

TI  - Effects of maternal alcohol intake and smoking on neonatal electroencephalogram
      and anthropometric measurements.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - Anthropometric data and computerized electroencaphalogram analysis during quiet, 
      indeterminate, and active sleep were obtained from infants of mothers of four
      groups: (1) heavy drinking mothers (greater than 2 ounces of alcohol per day);
      (2) nondrinking mothers; (3) smoking, nondrinking mothers; (4) nonsmoking,
      nondrinking mothers. Infants in groups 1 and 2 were matched as closely as
      possible for postconceptional age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Infants
      in groups 3 and 4 were matched similarly. Infants of alcoholic mothers had a
      significantly lower birth weight, length, and head circumference than those from 
      the matched control group. Infants of smoking mothers had lower birth weights and
      lengths than infants of nonsmoking mothers, but head circumference was identical.
      Hypersynchrony of the electroencephalogram was seen only in "alcoholic" infants, 
      and power spectral density analysis revealed that the average integrated power
      was significantly increased in quiet, active, and indeterminate sleep. The
      greatest increase in electroencephalogram power (212%) was seen in active sleep, 
      and this analysis clearly separated 15 of 17 alcohol-exposed infants from the
      control infants. These data suggest that alcohol has a specific toxic effect on
      the fetal brain that is not linked with smoking habits. The neonatal
      electroencephalogram is affected even in the absence of dysmorphology and thus
      may be the most sensitive indicator of fetal alcohol toxicity.

TI  - Fluctuations in the plasma levels of the follicle-stimulating hormone during
      estrous cycle, anestrus, gestation and lactation in the ewe: evidence for an
      endogenous rhythm of FSH release.
PG  - 565-82
AB  - Two experiments were carried out to analyse FSH secretion in the ewe. The first
      was a long-term study during which four ewes under controlled photoperiods were
      checked for plasma concentrations of FSH twice daily for a period of 16 months.
      They were successively anestrous, cycling, gestating and lactating. The results
      suggested that an endogenous secretion rhythm of FSH persisted throughout each of
      the physiological states of the ewes. The periodic cycles of FSH production
      lasted about 5 days during anestrus and gestation but extended to about 6 days
      during estrus. One of the three waves of secretion we noted during one cycle was 
      represented by the two periovulatory surges, the first coincident with the LH
      peak, the second occurring 30-40 h later. Plasma levels of FSH were similar
      during estrous cycles and anestrus, whereas the FSH secretion decreased gradually
      throughout gestation. During lactation, large differences were observed among
      animals before the recovery of cyclic ovarian activity. The second experiment
      consisted of frequent blood sampling (every ten minutes) of eight ewes for 6
      hours during anestrus. FSH was secreted differently compared to LH. No pulsatile 
      production of FSH was demonstrated and no increase in FSH levels was seen at the 
      time of the episodic LH surge.

PG  - 180-92
AB  - According to recent investigations more than half of all growth disorders are due
      to growth hormone (GH) deficiency. I. The cause of the classic
      hypothalamo-pituitary dwarfism is: 1. perinatally acquired lesions of the
      hypothalamus; 2. suprasellar tumours; 3. brain malformations; 4. hereditary
      disturbances of GH-synthesis. - II. Constitutional delay of growth and adolescent
      development is clinically characterised by harmonious delay of growth, skeletal
      development and sexual maturation. The typical aspect of the pituitary dwarf is
      missing. Whereas provocation tests for GH do not show reliable deviations,
      assessment of the spontaneous GH secretion during sleep usually demonstrates a
      significant GH-deficit. - III. Impairments of GH synthesis with production of a
      hormone which reacts in the RIA but exhibits reduced biological effectivity
      causes the same clinical picture as constitutional delay. The disorders I--III
      can successfully be treated by GH. - IV. Familial short stature is based on the
      summation of hereditary anlages of the parents. In principle, it is no endocrine 
      disorder. However, the combination with disorders II and III occurs frequently
      ("Small/Delay" acc. to Tanner). - V. Intrauterine growth retardation is caused by
      maternal, placental or fetal factors. With most of the "small for dates" growth
      prognosis is good. However, if teratogenic agents, particularly alcohol is
      involved, and if the damage occurs in the first months of gestation, the
      prognosis is unfavorable. - VI. A great number of genetic disorders is connected 
      with pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, combined with typical
      malformations. Apart from few exceptions these syndromes are rare. Endocrine
      deviations are missing. - The therapeutic possibilities of GH and anabolics are
      thoroughly discussed.

TI  - Tryptophan feeding adversely influences pregnancy.
PG  - 1193-6
AB  - Additional tryptophan during pregnancy reduces embryo and neonate survival in the
      golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Relatively small doses of exogenous
      serotonin have been reported to cause abortions in several vertebrate species (1,
      2, 3, 4, 5). Smaller doses reduce litter sizes, increase still births and neonate
      abnormalities, and otherwise influence pregnancy adversely. These effects are
      produced by serotonin throughout pregnancy, beginning at implantation (6). The
      availability of tryptophan is probably the most important rate limiting factor in
      serotonin synthesis (7). Inasmuch as tryptophan is an essential amino acid and is
      not synthesized by the body, the diet is the sole source; studies have shown that
      increases (8) or decreases (9) in dietary tryptophan lead to concomitant changes 
      in serotonin content. Because tryptophan is employed in humans to promote sleep
      (10, 11, 12) and to decrease appetite (13) we felt it might be important to test 
      whether increased amounts of diet tryptophan can adversely influence pregnancy.

TI  - Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the circadian rhythm of cortisol in
      pregnancy.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - The effect of pregnancy on the circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma
      cortisol and urinary free corticoids was examined in a sequential study during
      the second and third trimester and 6 to 12 weeks post partum. Hourly blood
      samples from six subjects and 8-hour urine collections from eight subjects were
      obtained around the clock. While the circadian rhythm was maintained during
      gestation, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean, nadir, peak, and nadir-peak
      excursion) increased. The relative excursion of plasma cortisol (expressed as the
      percentage of deviation from the 24-hour mean) exhibited remarkable blunting
      compared with postpartum values. This pregnancy-associated blunting of plasma
      cortisol excursion was indicated by a significant reduction in the: (1) mean peak
      and nadir excursion, (2) integrated area between the percent deviation curve and 
      the 24-hour mean, and (3) mean slope of the major incremental and decremental
      segments of the percent deviation curve. The circadian rhythm and diurnal
      excursion of plasma cortisol were reflected in urinary free corticoid values.
      Mean 24-hour urinary free corticoid concentrations increased 180% during
      gestation over nonpregnant levels. Nadir concentrations of urinary free
      corticoids in pregnancy exceeded peak nonpregnant levels. The gestational rise of
      metabolically active free cortisol and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and the
      pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of plasma cortisol may be
      explained by an autonomous source of ACTH during gestation.

TI  - Carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnancy.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - One thousand consecutive postpartum patients were interviewed by questionnaire to
      establish the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnancy. Hand symptoms had
      been noted by 34%: 25% had had symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, 2% symptoms of
      ulnar nerve compression and 7% ill defined hand symptoms. Maternal and fetal age,
      parity and weight change did not correlate with the presence of symptoms. The
      rate of ring removal because of swelling was twice as great for the symptomatic
      women (73%) as for the asymptomatic women (36%), and the rates of pre-eclampsia, 
      hypertension and edema were higher for the women with symptoms. Three quarters of
      the women had bilateral symptoms, and half of the multigravidas had had similar
      symptoms in previous pregnancies. Hand function and sleep were disturbed in 75%
      of the symptomatic women, yet only 46% of all those with symptoms mentioned their
      symptoms to their doctors; treatment was given to only 16% (35% of those who
      complained), and relief was obtained by only half of these.

PG  - 325-9
AB  - An animal model was used to examine the effect of maternal alcohol administration
      on behaviors in the offspring which might predispose to alcoholism. Pregnant C3H 
      mice were administered a liquid diet containing 28% ethanol-derived calories
      (EDC) from Gestation-Day 8 until parturition. Control animals were either
      pair-fed an isocaloric 0% EDC diet or received standard lab chow and water
      throughout pregnancy. Offspring were tested for sleep time following a challenge 
      dose of 3.5 or 4.5 g/kg ethanol at 25 or 110 days of age or for consumption of
      10% w/v ethanol in a two-bottle choice situation. The results demonstrated that
      prenatal exposure to alcohol did not affect alcohol-induced sleep time at either 
      testing age or dose and that waking blood alcohol levels were similar across
      groups. Voluntary alcohol consumption, however, was higher in mice exposed to
      alcohol in utero during the initial week of testing but intake decreased to near 
      control levels by the third week. Whether other alcohol-related behaviors are
      altered by prenatal alcohol exposure remains to be examined.

OAB - RU 486 is a synthetic 19 norsteroid with a great affinity for progesterone and
      glucocorticosteroid receptors. The antiprogesterone activity of RU 486 permits
      interruption of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and of early pregnancy,
      while the antiglucocorticosteroid activity interrupts the feedback mechanisms of 
      cortisol at the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 11 women aged 18-34 years who were
      6-8 weeks pregnant were given daily doses of 200 mg of sensation of lipothymia.
      Blood pressure and laboratory test results remained normal. The daily increase of
      beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and progesterone was stopped by the
      antiprogesterone. It has been demonstrated in vitro that RU 486 inhibits
      secretion of beta HCG by cells of trophoblastic origin. 2 weeks after expulsion
      of the products of conception, the blood levels of beta HCG, progesterone, and
      estradiol had returned to nonpregnant values and ovarian activity was normal in
      women not using oral contraceptives. The reason for failure of expulsion in 2
      cases was not known. RU 486 was also used to interrupt the luteal phase of normal
      menstrual cycles in 3 young women. 50 mg/day of RU 486 starting on the 22nd day
      was sufficient to induce bleeding within 48 hours. Studies using RU 486 50 mg/day
      beginning on the 10th cycle day indicate that progesterone plays a central and
      follicular role during the preovulatory period. The antiglucocorticosteroid
      activity of RU 486 was observed in pregnant women who received the abortifacient 
      dose of 200 mg/day. The 8 a.m. plasma level of ACTH and beta-LPH cortisol
      remained elevated for thee 4 days of treatment. Nonpregnant women receiving 50 mg
      of RU 486 for 4 days beginning on the 22nd cycle day had no change in the level
      of hypophyseal-adrenal hormones.dd Tests in young male volunteers showed that RU 
      486 amplified circadian rhythms of the hypophysealadrenal axis, affecting
      specifically the morning hormonal levels without influencing afternoon levels. A 
      test in which RU 486 was used to antagonize the inhibition producedd by
      dexamethasone during a test of suppression of the hypophyseal-adrenal axis
      confirmed that the antiglucocorticosteroid effect of RU 486 is produced at the
      level of the glucocorticosteroid receptors. The antiglucocorticosteroid effect is
      independent of the antiprogesterone effect. RU 486 may be utilizable in fertility
      control, to control undesirable effects of steroids in cases of hypercorticism,
      and perhaps eventually to test the hypophyseal-adrenal axis.

AB  - The effects of methadone and morphine on fetal behavior were studied following
      their administration to either the mother (5micrograms/kg/min) or fetus
      (0.5micrograms/kg maternal wt./min) using the chronically-instrumented pregnant
      ewe model. Fourteen unanesthetized, unrestrained pregnant ewes between 130-141
      days gestation (term 145 days) were studied 9-28 days following the surgical
      implantation of cannulae and electrodes to monitor fetal heart rate, blood
      pressure, breathing movements, eye movements, muscular and electrocortical
      activity. The three behavioral states of quiet sleep, rapid eye movement sleep
      and arousal could be distinguished using these parameters. Both drugs, by both
      routes, resulted in fetal arousal, largely at the expense of quiet sleep. While
      morphine and methadone were equipotent in suppressing quiet sleep following
      infusion to the fetus, methadone was three times more potent than morphine after 
      maternal infusion. This potency difference is consistent with the results of
      prior pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating that fetal exposure to maternally
      administered methadone is approximately three times greater than that to
      maternally administered morphine.

TI  - Fetal response to external mechanical stimuli.
PG  - 232-42
AB  - Several authors have recommended [1, 3, 8, 12] that the fetus be mechanically
      stimulated if the abdominal pregnancy CTG shows no accelerations. One expects the
      fetus to show a motor response to mechanical stimulation. Fetal movements
      expressed as accelerations in the abdominal CTG are considered to reflect
      "arousal" of the previously asleep fetus and are thought to be normal. An absence
      of such a response in considered by some as a sign of pathological fetal changes 
      [3, 8, 12]. Others, however, have found that the normal non-stressed fetus need
      not change its sleep-arousal state after mechanical stimulation [5, 14]. An
      attempt was made to clarify this in the present work. We studied the CTG
      recordings and the ultrasound pictures in 63 pregnancies in a total of 83 cases
      for an average of 56 minutes. Fetal movements were marked by pressing a lever on 
      the labor pressure chart. The fetus was mechanically stimulated by shaking its
      head manually for 5 seconds. Control recordings were also made, when the fetus
      was not so stimulated. The following results were obtained: With a normal CTG
      (reactive nonstress test, FISCHER score 8-10 points) Mechanical stimulation led
      to no changes in 87% of NREM sleep and in 93.9% of REM sleep. A change to a more 
      active state (REM sleep + arousal) due to stimulation was found in 13% of NREM
      sleep, which is significantly more frequent than the 2.9% found when no
      stimulation occurred. A change from REM sleep to arousal was found in 6.1%, not
      significantly different from 1.8% found without stimulation. Short-lasting
      reactions to mechanical stimulation included movements, acceleration of fetal
      heart rate and dip 0. These reactions were equally frequent in REM and NREM
      sleep, i.e. 75% and 68.5% respectively. These reactions occurred by chance less
      frequently, in 14.5% of cases in REM and in 3% of cases in NREM sleep (Tab. II). 
      The occurrence is significantly higher in REM than in NREM sleep. In a
      pathological CTG (Fischer score 7 points or less) our technique does not permit
      us to distinguish the different sleep-arousal states. Only the short-lasting
      response to mechanical stimulation of the fetus was hence evaluated. Mechanical
      stimulation resulted in a fetal response in 19% with decelerations of variable
      expression (Figs. 1a, 1b, 2, 3) similar to the variable decelerations observed
      during labor. These decelerations occurred only together with other signs of
      fetal distress in the CTG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Mid-trimester therapeutic abortion is performed routinely in several clinics by
      using a combination of intra-amniotic instillation of prostaglandin F2 alpha,
      followed by intravenous infusion of oxytocin in 5% glucose. In doses as low as 10
      mU/min, oxytocin has an antidiuretic action. Two cases of grand mal-like seizure

OAB - The cases of 2 women undergoing induced abortions in the 16th week of gestation
      who developed hyponatremia and grand mal-like seizures during administration of
      oxytocin are described. The women, aged 22 and 16, received 50 mg synthetic
      prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), Amoglandin, intraamniotically, as well as
      intravenous infusions of 5% glucose with synthetic oxytocin, Syntocinon, 100
      I.U./1000 ml. 25 and 26 hours later the 2 patients had typical grand mal-like
      seizures followed by postictal sleep. The patients had received total doses of
      400 and 200 I.U. of oxytocin. The oxytocin infusions were stopped and .9% NaC1
      solution was administered intravenously. Both patients were discharged fully
      recovered after 4 days. Synthetic oxytocin is known to have a dose-dependent
      antidiuretic effect during intravenous infusion, even in doses as low as 10
      mU/minute. The routine use of oxytocin for midtrimester abortion was discontinued
      by the authors after the cases occurred.

TI  - Maternal and child nutritional status: its association with the risk of
      pregnancy.
PG  - 1529-40
AB  - Breastfeeding reduces the interval between births by its effect on prolonging the
      period of postpartum anovulation and in some cases, reducing the likelihood of
      conception once ovulation has occurred. Extended durations of postpartum
      amenorrhea (18 months and longer) are observed among many women in developing
      countries, while shorter durations (6 months or less) are common among women in
      developed countries. This differential effect has been suggested to be related to
      maternal nutritional status, but numerous other factors also differ. This paper
      reviews the literature in this area, and suggests that most studies indicate a
      small and demographically insignificant effect of maternal nutritional status on 
      the period of postpartum amenorrhea. Factors associated with suckling patterns
      appear to be more important in determining the length of postpartum infertility. 
      Suckling frequency and intensity which affects the hormonal stimulus preventing
      ovulation appear to be affected by the type of and how supplemental feeding is
      given to the child (use of bottles), whether suckling is on demand or scheduled, 
      the frequency of night-time feedings (influenced by whether or not the mother
      sleeps with the child), whether or not pacifiers are used, and the child's
      nutritional and health status.

TI  - Review of experimental studies on the functional development of the respiratory
      system in the foetal lamb.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - In the foetus, as in the adult, the behavioural state of the central nervous
      system plays a very significant role in the modulation of respiratory activity.
      Breathing at birth represents the continuation of a process that commences early 
      in life in utero and develops as gestation proceeds. The profile of classical
      afferent respiratory input to the foetus in utero is significantly different to
      that of the new born, with a reduction in total neural traffic and a smaller
      phasic variation. The foetus, however, phasically contracts its diaphragm which, 
      as gestation proceeds, is patterned into distinct 'on and off' periods. Breathing
      of the foetus occurs during rapid eye movement sleep, analogous to that in the
      adult, and continues following somatic stimulation. This behavioural state is
      reduced during foetal hypoxia and foetal respiration is simultaneously depressed.
      At birth there is an increase in both somatosensory neural input and phasic
      variation and the new born breathes in all behavioural states, the stability of
      which varies cyclically with a period similar to that seen before birth. Whereas 
      improved surgical and experimental techniques and non-invasive technology have
      enabled a more complete description of the development of the respiratory system 
      in utero, the transitional events of the processes which occur at birth happen
      very quickly and at present prevent a similar detailed description.

TI  - Individualized cosinor assessment of circadian hormonal variation in third
      trimester human pregnancy.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Two clinically healthy pregnant women were studied in a single 24-h span during
      the third trimester. Blood drawn every 20 min was assayed for cortisol (F),
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), estriol (E3), and prolactin (PRL). Blood
      drawn hourly was assayed for progesterone (P), human placental lactogen (HPL) and
      15alpha-hydroxyestriol (E4). Breast temperature (BT) was continuously monitored. 
      Single cosinor analysis demonstrated statistically significant circadian rhythms 
      for plasma concentrations of F, DHEA-S, and BT for both subjects, and of E3 for
      one subject. Statistically significant circadian rhythms in plasma concentrations
      of P, HPL, E4 or PRL could not be demonstrated in our third trimester subjects.
      However, analysis of data from subjects sampled at earlier gestational ages
      revealed highly significant PRL circadian rhythms. These results suggest that
      plasma concentrations of PRL show a progressive decrease in circadian amplitude
      despite a progressive increase in mesor with advancing gestational age. Frequent 
      sampling and cosinor data analysis permit identification of circadian rhythms in 
      BT. The use of BT as a potential marker for rhythms in plasma concentration of
      certain hormones awaits further scrutiny. The demonstration of several circadian 
      endocrine rhythms in individual subjects in the third trimester of human
      pregnancy facilitates the usefulness of such marker rhythms.

OAB - In 1981 a child's life was worth less than $100. The sum of $100, wisely spent on
      each of the poorest 500 million mothers and young children in the world, could
      have brought improved diets and easier pregnancies, elementary education and
      basic health care, safer sanitation, and more water. In practice $100 proved too 
      high a price for the world community to pay with the consequence that every 2
      seconds of 1981 a child paid that price with his or her life. For the children of
      1982 the facts of life on earth will not be significantly different. Of the 125
      million who will be born, another 17 million will be dead before their 5th
      birthday. This has been another year of quiet emergency: 40,000 children quietly 
      dying each day; 100 million children quietly going to sleep hungry at night; 10
      million children becoming disabled in mind or body; and 200 million children age 
      6-11 quietly watching other children go to school. The infant mortality rate of
      the 3rd world, a sensitive indicator of the well being of mothers and children,
      fell by a steady 4 or 5 points a year during the decade of the 1960s but for the 
      past 5 years it has barely moved. The developing world's infant mortality is
      still 10 times higher than that of the industrialized countries. Life expectancy 
      is still 15 years less, and 1/3 of its 6-11 year olds are still out of school.
      Children need priority in dark times, and this statement is an appeal to reason
      as well as emotion. 90% of the growth of the human brain and 50% of the growth of
      the human body occurs in the 1st 5 years of life. The corresponding
      susceptibility of those years should alone argue that priority be given to the
      needs of the young. If parents cannot protect and provide, then the
      responsibility falls to the community of which the child is part. In "loud"
      emergencies, such as starvation in Kampuchea, the world community does respond,
      but in "silent emergencies" the international response is more muted. The
      timeless concern is currently sharpened to a particular edge by specific changes 
      in the growth and structure of the world population. Acceptance of family
      planning and a decline in birthrates is closely connected with such changes as
      the improvement of health care, the decline in infant mortality, and the spread
      of education. A setback in progress towards these social goals is likely to also 
      be a setback in the trend towards lower population growth. To bring about a
      significant improvement in the lives of children by the end of the 20th century
      will require a marked increase in the resources available for the task and in the
      effectiveness with which they are deployed.

PG  - 1889-98
AB  - Plasma cyclic nucleotides in some physiological conditions were measured in
      normal women and the changes of cyclic AMP were studied after the loading of
      gonadotropins in normal and castrated women. We demonstrated a circadian rhythm
      of cyclic AMP and its variation during menstrual cycle in normal women and also
      demonstrated its significant increase in pregnant women. But there was no
      significant variation of plasma cyclic GMP levels in those physiological
      conditions. Plasma cyclic AMP was increased by the simultaneous administration of
      HMG and HCG in both normal and castrated women. However, individual
      administration of HMG or HCG demonstrated that it was HCG that caused that
      increase in plasma cyclic AMP even in castrated women. To examine the
      extragonadal effects of HCG, cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) in
      the plasma were measured after the loading of HCG. The plasma cortisol level was 
      influenced by HCG in neither normal nor castrated women. HCG did not cause any
      change of T3 or T4 in normal women; however it caused a marked increase in T3
      with a small decrease in T4 in castrated women.

TI  - [Intrauterine fetal movements and their significance for the condition of the
      fetus].
PG  - 219-29
AB  - A literature review reports the results of investigations about fetal
      intrauterine activity. Different methods of observation are demonstrated and
      discussed. The results indicate that real-time-ultrasound is an accurate method
      for observation of fetal movements. Different patterns are identified: 1. Fetal
      body and extremity movements Development of fetal activity in early pregnancy is 
      looked at as a process of maturation associated with fetal cerebral function.
      After 12 weeks of pregnancy typical patterns are established and seen also in the
      following weeks. Different results are reported about frequency of fetal
      movements related to duration of pregnancy. A circadian rhythm seems to be
      associated with a peak in activity between 2100 and 0100 hours, although fetal
      activity is altered by a variety of drugs and external stimuli. The proportion of
      pathological foetal movements in early pregnancy seems higher in patients who
      aborted. There are findings in later pregnancy, which report good fetal outcome, 
      if daily fetal movement recording is greater than 10 movements for 12 hours. 2.
      Fetal breathing movements are recognized as being normally present, but episodic,
      shallow and variable in rate and regularity. There is a great variability in the 
      percentage of time fetuses spend making breathing movements (mean 30-50% per
      hour; range 0-80%). Under physiological conditions there is a circadian rhythm
      concomitant with changes in fetal low-voltage electrocortical activity. The
      activation of fetal breathing occurs mainly during rapid-eye-movement-sleep, but 
      the physiologic control of the activation has not been identified. Apnea,
      frequency, variability and amplitude of breathing, continuous breathing or
      gasping are described, but positive identification of abnormal pattern is not
      achieved. Several factors affecting fetal breathing movements have been
      described, their physiologic significance and control and their clinical
      relevance remain to be clearly elucidated. 3. Total fetal activity Fetal
      biophysical variables such as tone, breathing, body and extremity movements and
      heart rate reactivity are initiated and regulated by the fetal central nervous
      system, and as such, the presence of a given variable is indirect evidence of a
      functioning and intact central nervous system. These variable could be depressed 
      by hypoxemia or other factors. Data in literature suggest that combined fetal
      biophysical testing is a more accurate method of antepartum fetal evaluation than
      any single method.

PG  - 98-104
AB  - Progesterone and cortisol were measured in the peripheral blood of pregnant women
      using radioimmunoassay. Ten women were between 18 and 25 weeks of pregnancy and
      10 were between 32 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Blood for the hormone
      determinations was drawn at hourly intervals. A significant circadian
      progesterone rhythm was found with the nadir at 8.00 h and the peak around
      midnight. The progesterone rhythm showed a significant inverse relation to the
      cortisol rhythm (tau = 0.310). No difference was detected between the two groups 
      for progesterone rhythm or its inverse relation to the cortisol rhythm.

TI  - Influence of maternal drug metabolism on the fetal toxicity induced by
      acetylsalicylic acid.
PG  - 177-84
AB  - Investigations were performed to explore changes in fetal toxicity induced by
      acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in pregnant animals treated by various means for
      maternal alterations. The fetotoxicity induced by ASA (500 mg/kg s.c.) was higher
      in rats than in mice. In mice with low enzyme activity, those displaying a longer
      sleeping time in pentobarbital-induced sleep, the ASA-fetotoxicity was higher
      than that of mice with shorter sleeping time. In rats pretreated with
      phenobarbital (0.05%), Zn (10 mg/l) and Cu (10 mg/l) in tap water and cysteine
      (200 mg/kg s.c.), fetal toxicity of ASA was reduced, whereas it was enhanced in
      rats pretreated with SKF-525A (200 mg/kg s.c.) and alpha-naphthyl acetic acid
      (200 mg/kg p.o.) and in nephrectomized rats. The UDPGT activity in hepatic 9000 x
      g supernate was higher in mice than in rats and the activity of mice was
      increased by phenobarbital and Cu. This study indicates that ASA-induced
      fetotoxicity can be positively modified by alterations in drug metabolizing
      activity.

PG  - 373-80
AB  - Doxylamine succinate, a drug used as a sleep-inducing agent, an antihistamine,
      and in a therapeutic formulation taken by pregnant women as an antinauseant, was 
      scheduled for toxicological evaluation as part of a structure activity
      relationship study, with rats and mice, because a deficiency of such data exists 
      with regard to many antihistamines. Analytical chemical procedures that ensure
      proper concentration, homogeneity, and stability of the drug in dosed feed, as
      well as the safety of personnel and the environment, were prerequisites for the
      toxicological tests. GC methods using a rubidium-sensitized nitrogen detector
      were developed for analysis of doxylamine succinate in animal feed, human urine, 
      and wastewater at levels as low as 1 ppm, 100 ppb, and 100 ppb, respectively.
      Sample extracts were cleaned up by liquid-liquid partitioning, followed by
      additional cleanup on a column of silica gel. Data are presented concerning the
      stability of the drug in animal feed, extraction efficiencies, and the use of the
      silica gel cleanup column to separate the caffeine interference from doxylamine
      in extracts of human urine. Partition values and ancillary data concerning
      analysis of the drug in feed, by HPLC at levels as low as 10 ppm, are also
      reported.

TI  - Methadone and heroin during pregnancy: a review of behavioral effects in human
      and animal offspring.
PG  - 429-34
AB  - Both clinical and animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to opiate
      produces effects that occur in two phases. An acute phase consists of a neonatal 
      abstinence syndrome characterized by increased CNS arousal. The major behavior
      symptoms seen in both humans and animals include hyperactivity, disturbed sleep
      and increased lability of state. This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting
      from 12 weeks hyperactivity, disturbed sleep and increased lability of state.
      This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting from 12 weeks to six months in
      humans and 20-25 days in rats. Although confirming pharmacokinetic studies are
      needed, it is possible that these persistent symptoms result from the slow
      clearance of the drug from neonatal tissues. The second phase of the syndrome is 
      less well-understood but the available clinical evidence suggests that exposure
      to heroin, particularly in a pattern of polydrug abuse, can result in impaired
      organizational and perceptual abilities, poor self-adjustment and in situations
      requiring motor inhibition, heightened activity. Studies of pre-school children
      exposed prenatally to methadone, show no effects on intellectual and cognitive
      functioning but do reveal heightened activity or energy level, impulsivity, and
      brief attention span and persistence. A finding of impaired motor inhibition
      while performing a task has been stressed by one worker as an area of particular 
      vulnerability among these children. A strikingly similar effect, characterized as
      an impaired ability to modulate task-oriented motor activity, has been described 
      for adult rats prenatally exposed to methadone.

TI  - The effect of sleep state on active thermoregulation in the premature infant.
PG  - 512-4
AB  - Alterations in thermoregulatory mechanisms related to sleep state may play an
      important role in the problems of homeostasis experienced by the premature
      infant. In the adult, homeothermic regulation of body temperature may be
      suspended during REM. We measured oxygen consumption (VO2) in six premature
      infants 33-35 wk gestation both at thermoneutrality and during a mild thermal
      stress to determine whether thermoregulatory responses were intact during REM
      sleep. All infants were studied under radiant warmers. Skin temperature was
      allowed to fall 7-8 times during a 6-8 h study period while VO2, VCO2, heart rate
      and TcPO2 were continuously recorded. Sleep state was scored using EEG, EOG, EMG 
      and behavioral criteria. A total of 1,162 one-min epochs were scored. In all
      states including REM, VO2 was significantly higher during the cool periods. The
      mean increases: 21.5%, 23.3%, 11.1% and 5.3% for Awake, Indeterminate, REM and
      NREM respectively. When REM and NREM were compared at thermoneutrality, there was
      no difference in the VO2 (8.80 +/- 0.11 and 8.93 +/- 0.15 cc/kg/min, mean +/-
      S.E., for REM and NREM, respectively). We conclude that in contrast to the adult,
      active thermoregulation occurs in the premature infant during REM sleep.

TI  - Respiratory sensitivity before and after birth.
PG  - 529-36
AB  - A description is first given of respiratory activity in the fetus and its
      control. Evidence suggests that when the fetus makes respiratory movements, it is
      in a state comparable to REM sleep in the newborn and adult and that in the
      alternating periods of apnoea, it is in quiet sleep. It does not appear that the 
      respiratory movements are normally regulated by chemical or reflex, e.g. Hering
      Breuer, inputs though they are enhanced by CO2 and depressed by hypoxia. In the
      apnoeic periods, breathing movements are virtually impossible to elicit by
      chemical or reflex means. Evidence from examination of peripheral inputs
      indicates that: the carotid body chemoreceptors are inhibited at receptor level, 
      stimulation of the aortic chemoreceptors affects the circulation only and
      although pulmonary stretch receptors are active and are excited by inflation of
      the fetal lung, such inflation does not affect discharge in medullary respiratory
      units or phrenic nerve. Since there is no real evidence of immaturity of the
      respiratory system in late gestation and since chemical and most reflex inputs
      appear to provide an adequate stimulus, it is most probable that the periods of
      apnoea are caused by an inhibitory process, possibly of supra-pontine origin
      which acts close to medullary respiratory units and effectively inhibits the
      operation of the automatic component. This inhibitory process may operate
      periodically; or continuously and be periodically overridden in REM sleep. After 
      birth, breathing is normally continuous and sensitive to lung inflation, CO2 and 
      after a variable delay, to hypoxia. This may be due to the lifting of the
      inhibitory process allowing activation of the automatic component. However, there
      is evidence that even in normal, full term infants, full maturation of the
      automatic component is not complete until about three months of age and in the
      meanwhile, breathing tends to be imperfectly regulated and subject to damped
      oscillations when disturbed.

TI  - Mouse mammary gland DNA synthesis during pregnancy.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - Mammary explants from virgin and pregnant Balb/c mice were incubated with
      3H-thymidine, and its incorporation into TCA-precipitable material was
      determined. In addition, the labeling index of alveolar and ductal epithelial
      cells was determined by autoradiography. Incorporation of precursor into mammary 
      tissue from pregnant animals was elevated above that of virgin animals on each
      day of pregnancy. During pregnancy, there were three periods of peak
      incorporation (on days 3, 7, and 11-15). The labeling index of epithelial cells
      also increased during this period. Ductal cells had a peak labeling index on day 
      3 (30%), which dropped thereafter to comparatively low levels (3-6%) for the rest
      of pregnancy. With the exception of days 1 and 3, the labeling index of ductal
      cells showed no difference between midnight and noon. Alveolar structures were
      first observed in histological preparations on day 5 of pregnancy. The labeling
      index of alveolar cells was higher than that of ductal cells during the rest of
      pregnancy, and on most days showed a diurnal fluctuation, being greater at
      midnight than at noon. The labeling index of alveolar cells had peak values at
      midnight on days 7 (23%) and 11-13 (20%). This daily fluctuation in DNA synthesis
      by alveolar cells is a circadian rhythm; pregnant animals continued to show this 
      rhythm after 13 days in constant darkness, and animals maintained on a reversed
      light schedule had a reversed rhythm. Mammary tissue shows a complex pattern of
      DNA synthesis during pregnancy, reflecting the different characteristics of
      ductal and alveolar epithelial cells.

OAB - Researchers conducted a survey study of 59,598 households in 3 major
      socioeconomic groups (urban slums, rural agricultural areas, and rural cattle and
      horse raising areas) in the Punjab province of Pakistan to estimate mortality
      from neonatal tetanus and to develop a strategy for its control. The
      investigators learned of 13,831 live births. 724 of these died in the 1st month
      of life with 432 (60%) dying from neonatal tetanus. Village untrained "dai" or
      trained midwives delivered all infants in all 3 areas. Often these deliverers
      placed cow dung on the stump of the severed umbilical cord and used a dirty cloth
      for cleaning the infant. In addition, the trained midwives would use unclean
      unsterilized tools to assist in delivery. In rural areas, animals sleep inside
      with the family and they are always with the family. Since Clostridium tetani is 
      found in intestines of animals, especially horses, the neonatal tetanus rates as 
      a percentage of all neonatal deaths for the rural agricultural and rural cattle
      and horse raising areas were higher (60% and 73%) than for the urban slums (45%).
      The village barber circumcises male infants on or before the 7th day of life.
      Since he stuffs the wound with ash or cow dung or rubs it with a dirty cloth, the
      chances of infecting the wound with C1. tetani increases. Therefore the total
      ratio of male deaths to female deaths was 1.61:1. Most males died during the last
      3 weeks of the 1st month which can be attributed to circumcision. Overall most
      deaths occurred between 4-19 days. None of the mothers interviewed had been
      vaccinated with a tetanus toxoid during pregnancy which greatly contributed to
      the neonatal tetanus mortality rate.
