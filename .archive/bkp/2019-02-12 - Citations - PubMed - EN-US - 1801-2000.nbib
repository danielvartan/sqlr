TI  - Smoking during pregnancy: postnatal effects on arousal and attentional brain
      systems.
PG  - 915-23
AB  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal,
      attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN),
      as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to
      modulate arousal, waking and REM sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreases 
      between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, with the greatest decrease
      occurring at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 150 ml of cigarette smoke 
      for 15 min, three times per day, from day E14 until parturition, and the pups
      allowed to mature. We analyzed (a) intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons
      in slices from pups aged 12-21 days, and (b) the sleep state-dependent P13
      auditory evoked potential, which is generated by PPN outputs, in animals allowed 
      to age to adolescence. We found significant changes in the intrinsic membrane
      properties of PPN cells in prenatally exposed animals compared to intact ones,
      rendering these cells more excitable. In addition, we found disturbances in the
      habituation to repetitive stimulation in adolescent, freely moving animals,
      suggestive of a deficit in the process of sensory gating. These findings could
      explain some of the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during
      pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity
      for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders.

TI  - Medical management of early pregnancy failure in a patient with coronary artery
      disease.
PG  - 212.e1-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of early pregnancy failure in a patient who was not
      an optimal candidate for suction aspiration because of her body habitus and
      history of a myocardial infarction that was treated medically with misoprostol.
      DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Academic tertiary-care hospital. PATIENT: A
      43-year-old woman with morbid obesity, coronary artery disease, previous
      myocardial infarction, obstructive sleep apnea, and other medical problems who
      presented with an early pregnancy failure. INTERVENTION: Medical management with 
      800 microg of vaginal misoprostol in an inpatient setting with cardiac
      monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ultrasonographic resolution of intrauterine 
      pregnancy, vaginal bleeding, and cardiac events. RESULT(S): No gestational sac
      was visualized by ultrasound on the second hospital day, the patient's hemoglobin
      value at discharge was 12.1 mg/dL, and no adverse cardiac events occurred.
      CONCLUSION(S): Medical management with misoprostol on an inpatient basis is a
      possible alternative to dilation and curettage in patients with complex medical
      problems and early pregnancy failure.

TI  - [Assessment of EEG in children with partial epilepsy].
PG  - 1181-90
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of the focal epilepsy is possible even based on the
      clinical history. More precise identification of bioelectrical focus, type of
      epileptic attack and type of epilepsy requires EEG or videoEEG analysis. AIM OF
      STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess clinical value of
      electro-encephalography and videoelectro-encephalography in diagnostics of
      partial epilepsy in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 
      140 children with partial epilepsy hospitalized between 1998 and 2004 in
      Department of Pediatric Neurology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow. The group
      included 70 girls and 70 boys, aged from 2 months to 17 years. 38 of the children
      were older than 5 years, with mean age 8 years and 4 months. The mean time of the
      epilepsy course was 2 years and 4 months. Children with symptomatic partial
      epilepsy were the biggest group and children with idiopathic partial epilepsy
      were in minority. More than 50% of children suffered from complex partial
      seizures. Statistical correlation of the EEG results and pregnancy and birth
      period factors, results of neurological and psychological examination was
      performed. All children underwent MRI and 15 HMRS neuroimaging as well. All
      children underwent EEG examinations and 55 children videoEEG, recording time 60
      minutes for each patient. Sleep recording in 40 children, awake EEG in 93
      children and both type recordings in 8 children were performed. Stroboscope,
      hyperventilation and sleep deprivation stimulation tests were used. All EEG
      recordings were assessed by 2 physicians with the EEG license and final result
      was a mean of their assessment. T-student test, Mann-Whitney and bilateral Fisher
      test were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: EEG pattern was abnormal in
      139/140 children, and videoEEG in all 55 children. In the vast majority of the
      patients with partial epilepsy focal EEG changes were recorded (in 111/140), with
      a significant prevalence of unilateral changes observed in 48/111 patients. 34
      children had focal EEG changes with one-site prevalence and 27/140 children had
      focal EEG changes in both hemispheres without any prevalence. Generalized EEG
      changes were revealed in 16/140 children. Hyperventilation revealed in 8 children
      paroxysmal bioelectric activity and in 43 enhanced abnormal EEG pattern. In all
      children with normal MRI imaging EEG/videoEEG methods revealed changes
      significant for localization of seizures onset and origin. CONCLUSIONS: (1) EEG
      patterns in children with partial epilepsy were dominated by localized and
      lateralized changes. EEG was crucial for localization of bioelectric foci
      especially in children with normal MRI. (2) Focal EEG changes were significantly 
      more often in children with hippocampal sclerosis. (3) In terms of localization
      HMRS were more compatible with EEG than with MRI findings. HMRS examination is
      strongly indicated especially in children with EEG localized discharges and with 
      normal brain MRI.

TI  - Neuroprotective peptides prevent some alcohol-induced alteration in
      gamma-aminobutyric acid A-beta3, which plays a role in cleft lip and palate and
      learning in fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 259.e1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States
      and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities.
      In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal
      death and learning deficits. The gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor
      subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate
      development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented
      alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. STUDY DESIGN: With a model for fetal
      alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 
      with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides 
      NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 microg). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24
      hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the
      Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 
      litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain
      reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
      dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance
      and Fisher protected least significant difference. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours and
      10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < or =
      .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher
      in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was
      not prevented by the peptides. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the neuropeptides
      NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3
      expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues
      through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft
      lip and palate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment might lessen both
      patients' discomfort and multiple births, with their associated risks. We aimed
      to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a
      pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard
      treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and
      costs. METHODS: We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404
      patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian
      stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist co-treatment
      combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a
      GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were
      proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year
      after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12.5%), total costs per
      couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for 
      patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an
      International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970.
      FINDINGS: The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term
      livebirth after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard
      treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of
      the one-sided 95% CI was -9.8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy
      outcomes was 0.5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13.1% (p<0.0001) with standard
      treatment, and mean total costs were 8333 euros and 10745 euros, respectively
      (difference 2412 euros, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences
      between the groups in the anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, or sleep
      quality of the mother. INTERPRETATION: Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates
      of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian
      stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two
      embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially
      reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs.

TI  - [Cost of obesity in France].
PG  - 832-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs associated with obesity in France. METHODS: We
      used data from the 2002 survey on health and social protection as well as health 
      care consumption data from the EPAS sample of the national health insurance
      funds. After excluding those younger than 18 years, pregnant women and people
      diagnosed with cancer, we classified subjects as underweight, normal weight, or
      obese and then studied two subpopulations: (P1) obese patients (body mass index
      (BMI) >or= 30 kg/m2) and (P2) patients who were obese or overweight (BMI >or= 27 
      kg/m2) and had additional cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction (present or history),
      transient ischemic attack, intermittent claudication or sleep apnea. The Heckman 
      approach was used to adjust for several factors. RESULTS: The study included 4651
      individuals, with a mean age was 47 years. The obesity prevalence rate was
      estimated at 10.7% for P1; the P2 prevalence was 16.0%. Average healthcare costs 
      for the entire study group were 1534 euro, 1105 euro for ambulatory care (72%)
      and 429 euro (28%) for inpatient care. Costs for obese subjects (P1 and P2)
      averaged 2500 euro, twice the costs for normal-weight people (1263 euro). After
      taking into account age, sex, socioeconomic status, alcohol consumption and
      smoking, the 100% reimbursement rate for chronic diseases (all else being equal),
      the extra cost of obesity, compared with normal weight, was estimated between 506
      euro (P1) and 648 euro (P2). CONCLUSION: The annual total cost of obesity was
      estimated to range from 2.1 to 6.2 billion euros in 2002 and account for 1.5 to
      4.6% of total health expenditures in France.

TI  - Back and pelvic pain in an underserved United States pregnant population: a
      preliminary descriptive survey.
PG  - 130-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of back
      pain and treatment satisfaction in a population of low-socioeconomic pregnant
      women. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design to determine the
      prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy for 599 women.
      Women completed an author-generated musculoskeletal survey in the second
      trimester of their pregnancy that addressed pain history, duration, location, and
      intensity, as well as activities of daily living, treatment frequency, and
      satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of the total population
      reported musculoskeletal pain, and nearly half presented with a multi-focal
      pattern of pain that involved 2 or more sites. Twenty-one percent reported severe
      pain intensity rated on a numerical rating scale. Eighty percent of women
      experiencing pain slept less than 4 hours per night and 75% of these women took
      pain medications. Importantly, 85% of the women surveyed perceived that they had 
      not been offered treatment for their musculoskeletal disorders. CONCLUSION:
      Multi-focal musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy was prevalent in this underserved
      patient population. The pain in this population negatively affected sleep and
      treatment appeared inadequate.

TI  - Sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant women and their newborns.
PG  - 127-33
AB  - Pregnant women (N=253) were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy 
      (M=22.3 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N=83) and non-depressed
      groups based on a SCID diagnosis of depression. They were then given self-report 
      measures on sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety and anger, and their urine was
      assayed for norepinephrine and cortisol. These measures were repeated during
      their third trimester (M=32.4 weeks). Their newborns were then observed during
      sleep. During both the second and third trimesters, the depressed women had more 
      sleep disturbances and higher depression, anxiety and anger scores. They also had
      higher norepinephrine and cortisol levels. The newborns of the depressed mothers 
      also had more sleep disturbances including less time in deep sleep and more time 
      in indeterminate (disorganized) sleep, and they were more active and cried/fussed
      more.

TI  - Predisposing factors of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy.
PG  - 627-31
AB  - The occurrence of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy is well known. However, the
      mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the
      factors that predispose women to have restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. A 
      total of 146 pregnant women were included in the study. Patients were asked
      questions regarding demographic characteristics, complications of pregnancy,
      medical therapy (vitamin and iron intake), sleep disorders, muscle cramps, and
      excessive daytime sleepiness. Electroneurography, routine blood biochemistry
      tests, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests were performed and
      vitamin B12, folic acid, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, iron
      saturation, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were measured. Of the
      participants, 38 were diagnosed as having restless legs syndrome. In women with
      restless legs syndrome, additional medical problems, night cramps, and excessive 
      daytime sleepiness were more frequent. In women without restless legs syndrome,
      serum hemoglobin levels were significantly higher and the use of supplemental
      iron or vitamins was greater. Among the women with restless legs syndrome,
      progesterone levels were slightly higher but this difference was not
      statistically significant. In summary, in this study, lower hemoglobin levels and
      supplementation deficits of iron and vitamins were found be the risk factors for 
      restless legs syndrome in pregnancy.

TI  - Management of obesity in pregnancy.
PG  - 419-33
AB  - Maternal pregravid obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes
      during pregnancy. In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous
      abortion and congenital anomalies. In later gestation maternal metabolic
      manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive
      disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased
      insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with
      pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid
      disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems
      previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic
      cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean
      delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection,
      and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of
      fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent
      components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric
      surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, 
      and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who
      have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we
      need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle
      changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute
      of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for
      physical activity.

TI  - Estrogens and autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 538-47
AB  - Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers
      at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and
      glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors . Several physiological,
      pathological, and therapeutic conditions may change the serum estrogen milieu
      and/or peripheral conversion rate, including the menstrual cycle, pregnancy,
      postpartum period, menopause, being elderly, chronic stress, altered circadian
      rhythms, inflammatory cytokines, and use of corticosteroids, oral contraceptives,
      and steroid hormonal replacements, inducing altered androgen/estrogen ratios and 
      related effects. In particular, cortisol and melatonin circadian rhythms are
      altered, at least in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and partially involve sex hormone
      circadian synthesis and levels as well. Abnormal regulation of aromatase activity
      (i.e., increased activity) by inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., TNF-alpha, 
      IL-1, and IL-6) may partially explain the abnormalities of peripheral estrogen
      synthesis in RA (i.e., increased availability of 17-beta estradiol and possible
      metabolites in synovial fluids) and in systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as
      the altered serum sex-hormone levels and ratio (i.e., decreased androgens and
      DHEAS). In the synovial fluids of RA patients, the increased estrogen
      concentration is observed in both sexes and is more specifically characterized by
      the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a
      mitogenic and cell proliferative endogenous hormone. Local effects of sex
      hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seems to consist mainly in modulation
      of cell proliferation and cytokine production (i.e., TNF-alpha, Il-1, IL-12). In 
      this respect, it is interesting that male patients with RA seem to profit more
      from anti-TNFalpha strategies than do female patients.

TI  - Linear and nonlinear analysis of heart rate patterns associated with fetal
      behavioral states in the antepartum period.
PG  - 585-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal behavioral states are important indicators of fetal physiology 
      and pathology associated to typical fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. AIM: To
      provide linear and nonlinear analysis of FHR patterns associated with fetal
      behavioral states regarding a better understanding of these states and patterns. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Fifty FHR tracings from normal term pregnancies with a
      median duration of 40.3 min were acquired with the SisPorto 2.01 system for
      computerized analysis of cardiotocograms. Each tracing was divided into
      consecutive 10-minute segments and each segment was classified by two experts as 
      pattern A, B, C or D. OUTCOME MEASURES: Linear and nonlinear indices were
      computed in each segment, namely mean FHR, long-term irregularity index (LTI),
      very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency spectral indices, approximate
      entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). Kappa statistic (kappa) and
      proportions of agreement (Pa) were used for assessment of inter-observer
      agreement. Bootstrap percentile confidence intervals and nonparametric
      statistical tests were calculated for statistical inference. RESULTS: Overall
      agreement between experts in pattern classification was good to excellent with
      values for kappa and Pa of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.94) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96),
      respectively. Most linear domain indices increased significantly with rising
      fetal activity whereas the opposite occurred with nonlinear indices, except for
      SampEn(2, 0.1). LF/(MF+HF) ratio also significantly increased with fetal
      activity, denoting an increased sympatho-vagal balance. CONCLUSIONS: Results
      support the hypothesis that entropy and linear variability indices measure
      different FHR features. FHR patterns associated with active sleep (B) and active 
      wakefulness (D) evidenced more signs of autonomous nervous system activity, with 
      sympatho-vagal imbalance, and less signs related to complexity or irregularity
      control systems than patterns associated with calm sleep (A) and calm wakefulness
      (C).

TI  - Sleep duration and quality in healthy nulliparous and multiparous women across
      pregnancy and post-partum.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies of sleep during normal pregnancy and post-partum
      are rare, and interpretation of the findings is often hampered by methodological 
      issues. Consequentially, there is still limited information on what constitutes
      normal sleep quality and quantity across pregnancy and early post-partum, for
      both nulliparous and multiparous women. AIMS: To quantify the change and
      variability in sleep duration and quality across pregnancy and post-partum for
      healthy nulliparous and multiparous women. METHODS: Nineteen women (eight
      nulliparous and 11 multiparous) wore an actigraph and completed a sleep diary to 
      objectively measure sleep for seven nights during the second trimester, one week 
      prior to delivery, and at one and six weeks post-partum. Mixed model analysis of 
      variance and logistic regression were used to investigate changes in sleep across
      this timeframe. RESULTS: The largest changes in sleep occurred in the first week 
      post-partum (1.5 h less sleep than during pregnancy, three times more sleep
      episodes in 24 h, 70% of women regularly napping during the day, and greatest
      day-to-day variability in sleep). Compared to multiparas, nulliparas generally
      had less efficient sleep, spent more time in bed and had greater wake after sleep
      onset in the second trimester, and spent less time in bed and had fewer sleep
      episodes a day at one week post-partum. CONCLUSIONS: These changes should be used
      to inform women about the extent of change in sleep, particularly early
      post-partum, and to help health-care providers identify women experiencing severe
      sleep loss and disruption and discuss possible coping strategies with them.

TI  - Melatonin reduces inflammation and cell death in white matter in the
      mid-gestation fetal sheep following umbilical cord occlusion.
PG  - 153-8
AB  - The premature infant is at increased risk of cerebral white matter injury.
      Melatonin is neuroprotective in adult models of focal cerebral ischemia and
      attenuates ibotenate-induced white matter cysts in neonatal mice. Clinically,
      melatonin has been used to treat sleep disorders in children without major side
      effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective and
      anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin in the immature brain following
      intrauterine asphyxia. Fetal sheep at 90 d of gestation were subjected to
      umbilical cord occlusion. Melatonin (20 mg/kg, n = 9) or vehicle (n = 10) was
      administered IV to the fetus, starting 10 min after the start of reperfusion and 
      continued for 6 h. Melatonin treatment resulted in a slower recovery of fetal
      blood pressure following umbilical cord occlusion, but without changes in fetal
      heart rate, acid base status or mortality. The production of 8-isoprostanes
      following umbilical cord occlusion was attenuated and there was a reduction in
      the number of activated microglia cells and TUNEL-positive cells in melatonin
      treated fetuses, suggesting a protective effect of melatonin. In conclusion, this
      study shows that melatonin attenuates cell death in the fetal brain in
      association with a reduced inflammatory response in the blood and the brain
      following intrauterine asphyxia in mid-gestation fetal sheep.

TI  - On the pathway of an animal model for restless legs syndrome...
PG  - S53-60
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sleep motor disorder that affects up to
      10% of the general population. Except for periodic leg movements (PLM), which can
      be found in the great majority of RLS patients, no objective hematochimic or
      neurophysiological markers are available to prove the diagnosis, which is based
      on clinical standard criteria. Nowadays, the aetiopathogenesis of the syndrome is
      unknown. In a consistent sample of patients affected by the idiopathic form, the 
      disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait related to an unidentified
      locus, while each symptomatic form is probably linked to a specific cause.
      Although of possible different origins, both the primary and secondary forms may 
      share the same pathogenetic mechanism, which, even if unclear, could be
      characterised by a neurological dysfunction of the dopaminergic system. Several
      issues, including strong efficacy of dopamine-agonist treatments, support this
      theory, which is currently considered the main pathogenetic hypothesis. Most of
      the past studies tried to clarify the RLS mechanism using the neurophysiological,
      biochemical and neuroimaging techniques applied to the field of human research.
      Now the time has come to accept the challenge in creating an animal model of RLS,
      which may emerge as a decisive step in understanding RLS pathogenesis, and to
      develop and test new therapies. Even though there have been a few significant
      efforts, a valid animal model of RLS still does not exist. In past pioneering
      studies, the authors attempted to induce restless motor behaviour in animals by
      different strategies: antidopaminergic pharmacological interventions, spinal or
      cerebral lesions of specific regions involved in the motor control and in
      dopamine regulation, and selective deletion of genes coding for dopamine
      receptors. Rodents (mice and rats) were always chosen by the authors as the
      animals for their experiments. The current tendency in achieving an RLS model is 
      generally represented by simulation of a symptomatic condition of RLS or by a
      direct interference of the dopaminergic system. In this regard, the
      pharmacological method had the intention to reproduce the neuroleptic-induced
      acathisia, the spinal lesional model was based on the hypothesis of myelopathic- 
      related PLM, and the hypothalamic lesion tested the motor consequence of A11
      dopaminergic neurons. Preliminary studies are underway to replicate the
      pregnancy-related form of RLS by using a hormonal intervention, and the
      iron-deficiency secondary form by using specific iron-free diets. Today, modern
      technologies are available to easily replicate in animals most of the symptomatic
      RLS conditions. In addition, more than a few well validated animal models of
      different diseases known to be related to RLS or PLM, for instance, Parkinson's
      disease, rheumatoid arthritis and renal failure, could also be exploited in
      addressing this topic. The real obstacle in achieving an RLS model is the absence
      of a certain diagnostic marker to recognise if the animal that underwent the
      different experimental procedures has developed the RLS condition or not.
      Concerning this issue, possible specific endpoints are represented by the
      increase in locomotor activity, which are ascertainable by different techniques, 
      such as openfield or run-wheel activity, or by sleep fragmentation, in which the 
      circadian shift can be verified by applying polysomnography on the animal. PLM
      are probably the only specific and reliable markers available to recognise and
      quantify experimentally induced RLS. Despite a few authors who reported the
      presence of limb-phasic, pseudoperiodic activity during sleep in old or in
      lesioned rats, the existence of spontaneous or provoked PLM in animals is still
      debated. Eventually, the PLM features in an animal could be markedly different
      compared to human ones. To recognise and characterise PLM in animals, three more 
      essential steps are required: a method to record directly, as in humans, the
      activity of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, a consistent amount of normative 
      control data on the TA activity in healthy animals, and reliable analysis to
      distinguish the generic phasic muscular activity to a possible unambiguous PLM
      pattern. This review includes a summary and a critical discussion of the previous
      tentative RLS models, proposals for other possible animal models, and firstly the
      preliminary normative data on TA activity during sleep in normal rodents.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome: diagnosis, epidemiology, classification and consequences.
PG  - S37-46
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by a
      complaint of an almost irresistible urge to move the legs. RLS is diagnosed
      clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International Restless 
      Legs Syndrome Study Group. In doubtful cases, neurophysiological examinations,
      such as polysomnography and/or a suggested immobilisation test, can be performed 
      to confirm a clinical suspicion of RLS. Several other conditions may present
      sensorimotor complaints with features similar to RLS; a careful sleep history is 
      required to avoid a misdiagnosis. Three different scales have been validated to
      assess the severity of RLS. In the general population, RLS prevalence ranges from
      0.1% to 11.5%, with a high number of patients affected by a primary form of the
      sleep disturbance (70%-80%). However, several clinical conditions have been
      associated with RLS, such as iron deficiency, uraemia, pregnancy and
      polyneuropathy. Furthermore, recent studies show that RLS may be associated also 
      to type 2 diabetes mellitus and to multiple sclerosis. RLS has a negative impact 
      on sleep, cognitive functions, quality of life and mental status. Higher
      awareness of RLS among physicians is required; it remains an underdiagnosed
      clinical condition.

TI  - Is changing the sleep environment enough? Current recommendations for SIDS.
PG  - 453-69
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS or cot death) was the major cause of
      post-neonatal infant death in many countries in the late 1970s and 1980s. There
      is now very strong evidence that public intervention campaigns targeting the
      prone sleeping position, which had been identified by epidemiological studies as 
      a major risk factor, were followed by substantial falls in the rate of SIDS. In
      the present review we discuss the evidence on which current recommendations for
      the prevention of SIDS are based. The prone sleeping position is now clearly
      causally associated with SIDS. Further reductions in SIDS may be produced by
      recommending the back sleeping position as opposed to the side position. Maternal
      smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing by infants of mothers who smoke are also
      strongly associated with SIDS, but have been harder to influence. Paternal
      smoking has also been implicated, although the magnitude of the reported risk is 
      small. Finally, breastfeeding, pacifier use and having the infant sharing the
      parents bedroom, but not the bed, may also reduce risk. Continued reductions in
      SIDS mortality will require innovative public health education to target these
      major risk factors, while building on the "back to sleep" approach.

TI  - [Origin and significance of leptin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in amniotic fluid
      between the 14th and 18th weeks of gestation].
PG  - 208-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) play important roles in the
      regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, hematopoesis and reproduction. The
      biological functions of leptin and NPY in fetal development, and their regulation
      during pregnancy by fetal and maternal factors remain poorly understood. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: From 55 women undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis between the 14th
      and 18th weeks of gestation samples of amniotic fluid were collected. In accord
      with the circadian rhythm of leptin secretion all amniocenteses were performed
      between 8.00 and 12.00 a. m. The concentrations of leptin and NPY in amniotic
      fluid were analysed using commercially available RIA's. RESULTS: The amniotic
      fluid samples of 32 male and 23 female fetuses were determined and demonstrated
      no gender-dependent differences in leptin and NPY levels. No correlation was
      found between leptin/NPY and the maternal body mass index. NPY concentrations are
      lower in advanced gestational age pregnancies. Leptin levels revealed no
      differences with respect to gestational age. CONCLUSION: Leptin and NPY levels
      were independent of fetal gender and maternal BMI. This provides clues for
      alternative regulatory mechanisms in leptin and NPY secretion. Compared to the
      data of adults, our findings show high leptin concentrations in the amniotic
      fluid in the presence of only minor amounts of white adipose tissues which might 
      include the placenta. Our data including the observation of lower levels of NPY
      in more advanced gestational age support the idea of specific factors regulating 
      leptin and NPY secretion into the amniotic fluid.

TI  - Evidence supporting the use of melatonin in short gestation infants.
PG  - 22-7
AB  - Pineal melatonin regulates circadian rhythms and influences sleep. Melatonin also
      has protective actions against tissue damage from free-radicals and other toxins.
      Evidence is presented that this indoleamine is involved in pre- and postnatal
      brain (and ocular) development and intrauterine growth. In the absence of
      maternal melatonin, short gestation infants have a prolonged period of melatonin 
      deficiency. Melatonin supplementation, which has a benign safety profile, may
      help reduce complications in the neonatal period that are associated with short
      gestation. We believe that this treatment might result in a wide range of health 
      benefits, improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs.

TI  - SIDS-protective infant care practices among Auckland, New Zealand mothers.
PG  - U2365
AB  - AIM: To survey the knowledge and implementation of sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS)-protective infant care practices in mothers of infants aged less than 4
      months. METHODS: A postal survey was carried out of knowledge of SIDS risk
      factors and infant care practices of 200 mothers with infants aged 6-8 weeks and 
      3-4 months. RESULTS: Mothers who could cite supine sleeping as protective
      comprised 84%, while 73% knew that smoking was a risk factor. Fewer knew that
      room sharing, keeping the face clear of bedding, and avoiding bed sharing and
      overheating are also protective. Fifty-four percent of the infants usually
      room-share with a parent, while 39% both room-share and sleep in their own bed.
      Sixteen percent usually co-slept for part or all of the night. Nearly one-third
      used pacifiers. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy comprised 8%, while 7% had
      smoked in the last 24 hours. Most infants (97%) had been breastfed at some time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Maternal education of the benefits of supine sleeping, not smoking, 
      and breastfeeding appear well understood by these mothers. However, more
      education is needed about other SIDS-protective behaviours such as keeping the
      face clear and sleeping the infant in their own bed in the parents' room.

TI  - Postnatal maturation of laryngeal chemoreflexes in the preterm lamb.
PG  - 1429-38
AB  - Laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are triggered by the contact of liquids with the
      laryngeal mucosa. In the mature organism, LCR trigger lower airway protective
      responses (coughing, effective swallowing, and arousal) to prevent aspiration.
      General belief holds that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the
      newborn mammal, including humans. Our laboratory has recently shown that LCR in
      full-term lambs are consistently analogous to the mature LCR reported in adult
      mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire M, Nsegbe E,
      Gagnon-Gervais K, Samson N, Moreau-Bussiere F, Fortier PH, and Praud J-P. J Appl 
      Physiol 98: 2197-2203, 2005). The aim of the present study was to assess LCR in
      nonsedated, newborn preterm lambs born at 132 days of gestation (term = 147
      days). The preterm lambs were instrumented for recording glottal adductor
      electromyogram, electroencephalogram, eye movements, heart rate, respiration, and
      oximetry. A chronic supraglottal catheter was used for injecting 0.5 ml of
      saline, distilled water, and HCl (pH 2) during quiet sleep, active sleep, and
      wakefulness on postnatal days 7 (D7) and 14 (D14). Laryngeal stimulation by water
      or HCl on D7 induced significant apneas, bradycardia, and desaturation, which, at
      times, appeared potentially life-threatening. No significant apneas,
      bradycardias, or desaturation were observed on D14. No consistent effects of
      sleep state could be shown in the present study. In conclusion, laryngeal
      stimulation by liquids triggers potentially dangerous LCR in preterm lambs on D7,
      but not on D14. It is proposed that maturation of the LCR between D7 and D14 is
      partly involved in the disappearance of apneas/bradycardias of prematurity with
      postnatal age.

TI  - Antenatal depression.
PG  - 26-30
AB  - About 20 per cent of pregnant women experience antenatal depression (AD), which
      not only has deleterious effects on the woman and her baby but also increases the
      risk of developing postpartum depression. Nurses who understand the prevalence,
      signs and symptoms, and risk factors associated with AD can help to identify it
      and prevent the sequelae. The signs and symptoms of depression in pregnancy do
      not differ from depression at at any other time. However, AD may go undiagnosed
      because of a focus on maternal and fetal well-being and the attribution of
      complaints to the physical and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Risk
      factors include history of depression, lack of partner, marital difficulties,
      lack of social support, poverty, family violence, increased life stress,
      substance abuse, history of previous abortions, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence 
      toward the pregnancy and anxiety about the fetus. Most of the standard treatments
      for depression can be used in pregnant women, with the exception of some
      antidepressant medications. Supportive therapies--exercise, adequate nutrition,
      adequate sleep, and support from family and friends--are also indicated.
      Screening of women with known risk factors is crucial, but the authors suggest
      that the high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy
      indicates a need for universal screening.

TI  - Seasonality of symptoms in women with postpartum depression.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - It is important to consider the potential contribution of seasonality to
      postpartum depression (PPD; Hiltunen et al, 2004). A possible link between
      seasonality and PPD may have implications for not only choice of treatment, but
      also in considering pregnancy planning. The objectives of this pilot study were
      to examine whether women with seasonal mood changes demonstrated greater
      incidence of PPD, and to determine if seasonality scores were predictive of PPD. 
      The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ; Rosenthal et al, 1987) was
      used to assess seasonality of mood. A logistic regression analysis was conducted 
      to determine the association between clinical factors, SAD diagnosis, SPAQ global
      seasonality score (GSS) and season of SPAQ administration and PPD. In our sample,
      twice as many women in the PPD group were found to have SAD compared to the
      control group. The PPD group also had a higher group GSS mean (10.44) than did
      the control group (8.84). However, logistic regression analysis showed that
      higher seasonality scores in women with PPD were not necessarily predictive of
      PPD. While more women in the PPD group reported increased seasonal weight
      fluctuation and less sleep in the spring and summer, these items alone did not
      predict depression after childbirth.

TI  - Stress in pregnancy activates neurosteroid production in the fetal brain.
PG  - 264-74
AB  - Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone are potent agonists at the GABA(A)
      receptor and suppress the fetal CNS activity. These steroids are synthesized in
      the fetal brain either from cholesterol or from circulating precursors derived
      from the placenta. The concentrations of allopregnanolone are remarkably high in 
      the fetal brain and rise further in response to acute hypoxic stress, induced by 
      constriction of the umbilical cord. This response may result from the increased
      5alpha-reductase and cytochrome P-450(SCC) expression in the brain. These
      observations suggest that the rise in neurosteroid concentrations in response to 
      acute hypoxia may represent an endogenous protective mechanism that reduces
      excitotoxicity following hypoxic stress in the developing brain. In contrast to
      acute stress, chronic hypoxemia induces neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression
      without an increase in neurosteroid concentrations and, therefore, may pose a
      greater risk to the fetus. At birth, the allopregnanolone concentrations in the
      brain fall markedly, probably due to the loss of placental precursors; however,
      stressors, including hypoxia and endotoxin-induced inflammation, raise
      allopregnanolone concentrations in the newborn brain. This may protect the
      newborn brain from hypoxia-induced damage. However, the rise in allopregnanolone 
      concentrations was also associated with increased sleep. This rise in sedative
      steroid levels may depress arousal and contribute to the risk of sudden infant
      death syndrome. Our recent findings indicate that acute hypoxic stress in
      pregnancy initiates a neurosteroid response that may protect the fetal brain from
      hypoxia-induced cell death, whereas the decline in allopregnanolone levels after 
      birth may result in greater vulnerability to brain injury in neonates.

TI  - Obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is responsible for metabolic
      abnormalities in a cohort with sleep-disordered breathing.
PG  - 12-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the profile of metabolic abnormalities in subjects with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a case-control study
      conducted in two years, from April 2003 to March 2005, data obtained from
      polysomnography study, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, serum insulin, insulin
      resistance, leptin and adiponectin levels, were compared between the various
      groups. Included in the study were OSA subjects from a sleep laboratory and
      matched controls from the community. Those with recent myocardial infarction,
      upper airway surgery, class III/IV heart failure, pregnancy, acromegaly, chronic 
      renal failure, or who were on treatment for hyperthyroidism, on systemic steroid 
      treatment, or on hormonal replacement therapy, were excluded from the study.
      RESULTS: Forty apneic obese subjects (AHI=32.19, range 13-52.75) were compared
      with 40 non-apneic obese controls (AHI=1.3, range 0-2.45) and 40 normal weight
      control subjects (AHI=0.7, range 0-1). No significant difference was noted in
      levels of fasting blood sugar, insulin resistance (obese apneics 61.9, obese
      controls 47.8, non-obese controls 19.1), leptin (obese apneics 10.65 microg/L,
      obese controls 8.52 microg/L, non-obese controls 2.83 microg/L) or adiponectin
      (obese apneics 4959.3 ng/ml, obese controls 5706 ng/ml, non-obese controls 7412
      ng/ml) in the OSA group compared to obese controls. CONCLUSIONS: OSA has no
      independent association with lipid abnormalities, insulin resistance, serum
      leptin and adiponectin levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity was the major
      determinant of metabolic abnormalities in this cohort.

TI  - The late preterm infant and the control of breathing, sleep, and brainstem
      development: a review.
PG  - 883-914; abstract x
AB  - The brainstem development of infants born between 33 and 38 weeks' gestation is
      less mature than that of a full-term infant. During late gestation, there are
      dramatic and nonlinear developmental changes in the brainstem. This translates
      into immaturity of upper airway and lung volume control, laryngeal reflexes,
      chemical control of breathing, and sleep mechanisms. Ten percent of late preterm 
      infants have significant apnea of prematurity and they frequently have delays in 
      establishing coordination of feeding and breathing. Unfortunately, there is a
      paucity of clinical, physiologic, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical data in this
      specific group of infants. Research focused on this group of infants will not
      only further our understanding of brainstem maturation during this high risk
      period, but will help develop focused plans for their management.

TI  - Sudden infant death syndrome: selenium administered above dietary needs
      stabilizes the electrocardiograms of subjects deprived of exercise stimuli to the
      brain.
PG  - 1265-7
AB  - The human foetus begins preparation for extrauterine life in the 26th week of
      gestation. Victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) were described as
      having less-intensive reactions to environmental stimuli than their siblings.
      They were described as less-active physically and more breathless and exhausted
      during feeding. These foetal-like qualities are similar to the microgravity
      deconditioning of the space traveller and the autonomic dysfunction of
      hypokinetic humans. During quiet sleep, a group of near-miss SIDS victims
      displayed a faster heart-rate and a decreased movement-time, compared to
      controls. Another group of SIDS victims linked delayed repolarisation and
      sympathetic overactivity of the nervous system. The excessive Q-T wave intervals,
      cardiac instability and autonomic dysfunction tended to coincide with the peak
      incidence of SIDS which is the normal period of autonomic transformation at 2-3
      months of age. Sympathetic hyperactivity transforms the subject into an
      energy-intensive species with an accelerated heartbeat, intensive
      vasoconstriction and general reactions to a hostile environment. Energy-intensive
      species (flight-oriented species) were sensitive to selenium (Se) deficiency.
      Altered mitochondrial structure and defective electron transport of heart
      mitochondria were features of this syndrome. Runaway excessive sympathetic
      autonomic activity transforms the subject into an energy-intensive species
      responsive to selenium. Groups of Se-deficient lambs confined for eight weeks
      developed abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs). Groups exercised daily on a
      treadmill or Se-supplemented groups retained virtually normal ECGs. Foetuses and 
      subjects unreactive to the environment are space travellers lacking
      parasympathetic stimuli to the brain. Decreased movement-time deprives the brain 
      receptors of the stimulus induced by gravity.

TI  - Bed-sharing, breastfeeding and maternal moods in Barbados.
PG  - 526-34
AB  - Bed-sharing among Barbadian mothers and infants was studied in relationship to
      maternal and infant characteristics. This prospective study followed 226 healthy,
      well-nourished mother-infant dyads at birth, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months
      postpartum. At each age, approximately half of the infants shared the same beds
      as their mothers. Bed-sharing was associated with demographic characteristics,
      especially fewer home conveniences, and also maternal characteristics, including 
      less information seeking by the mother and younger maternal age at first
      pregnancy. Bed-sharing was also associated with lower infant birth weights.
      Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers 
      who reported having more despair and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with 
      their infants. Bed-sharing was also significantly associated with increased
      breastfeeding at all infant ages, but this relationship was no longer significant
      once the effects of maternal moods were controlled. This study emphasizes the
      importance of assessing maternal moods in studies evaluating the risk and
      benefits of bed-sharing.

TI  - Stability of mood states and biochemistry across pregnancy.
PG  - 262-7
AB  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited during their second
      trimester of pregnancy (M=20 weeks). They were designated depressed (N=172) or
      nondepressed (N=258) on the Structured Clinical Interview of Depression (SCID)
      and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). They were
      given a second assessment when they were approximately 32 weeks gestational age. 
      At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State
      Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for 
      assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and
      serotonin. They were also given the VITAS scale for lower back pain and leg pain 
      and a sleep disturbance scale. The stability of mood states and biochemistry
      across pregnancy (20 and 32 weeks) were assessed inasmuch as mood states, and
      biochemistry have been noted to predict prematurity and low birthweight.
      Significant correlations were noted for all variables except serotonin.
      Relationships between mood states and biochemistry were also noted but only
      between cortisol and depression, cortisol and anxiety, and epinephrine and
      anxiety. Significant stability was noted between the 20-week measures and the
      32-week measures including depression, anxiety, anger, and cortisol. These were, 
      in turn, correlated with each other and with, low back pain, leg pain, and sleep 
      disturbance. These data suggest the stability of mood states and cortisol across 
      pregnancy.

PG  - 32-43
AB  - This study examined the association between maternal smoking and exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy and infant heart rate.
      Participants were 62 mother-infant dyads where mother smoked during pregnancy, 47
      dyads where mother did not smoke during pregnancy but was exposed to ETS and 47
      dyads where mother did not smoke and was not exposed to ETS. Average heart rate
      (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed at 2-4 weeks of age
      during sleep. Infants in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than
      nonexposed infants. Furthermore, boys in both exposure groups had higher HR and
      lower RSA than girls. These results highlight the importance of considering
      prenatal ETS exposure and infant gender when assessing infant outcomes.

TI  - [The CIS20R Questionnaire and its suitability for prolonged fatigue studies].
PG  - 335-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to validate the Checklist Individual
      Strength (CIS20R) questionnaire for the assessment of prolonged fatigue in
      workers and to define its psychometric properties and fatigue standards for the
      population of Poland. The questionnaire contains 20 statements, scored on a
      seven-point scale (1-7), reflecting four aspects of fatigue: subjective feeling
      of fatigue, reduction of concentration, reduction of motivation, and reduction of
      physical activity. The outcome yielded by the questionnaire is expressed by the
      sum of all points scored in responding to all statements and mean values of its
      components. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in a group (325 men
      and 363 women) of workers employed in industrial plants, hypermarkets and
      municipal services; workers of research institutes (81 men and 205 women) and
      pregnant women (20 persons). Based on the calculated coefficients of correlation 
      between responses to each statement and the total score, strong discriminative
      power of individual statements was observed. Crombach's alpha was used to assess 
      the consistence of the questionnaire. The coefficient value for the total score
      was 0.912 and for the fatigue components it ranged from 0.611 to 0.879, which
      indicates satisfactory reliability of the method. In addition, norms were
      elaborated using a sten scale. The total value of 40 indicates the borderline
      between low and moderate and the value of 84 between medium and high level of
      fatigue. RESULTS: The level of the risk for chronic fatigue was estimated on the 
      basis of investigations among industrial, trade and municipal services workers.
      In the group of men, the necessity of prolonged standing during work, high
      physical effort during work, lack of fitting to physical effort during work, and 
      stress connected with responsibility (component of occupational stress) were the 
      risk-increasing factors. In the group of women, they were: lack of fitting to
      physical effort during work, noise disturbing reasoning of speech and stress
      connected with psychic load and lack of social support (components of
      occupational stress). In both groups, sleep disturbances proved to be responsible
      for increasing risk of the incidence of chronic fatigue. In the group of men--the
      diet, and in the group of women - exercise during leisure time were found to be
      protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the CIS20R questionnaire
      is a good research tool to study chronic fatigue. It was also found that the
      level of fatigue in the population of Poland is much higher than that in the
      Netherlands, the country where the questionnaire has been developed. In the Dutch
      studies, the value of 76 was found to be a borderline between "normal fatigue"
      and fatigue occurring in people with impaired health. In our studies this value
      corresponds with six stens, which means that it is still within the range of
      moderate values.

TI  - Predictive factors for pregnancy hypertension in primiparous adolescents:
      analysis of prenatal care, ABPM and microalbuminuria.
PG  - 487-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify PH prevalence in primiparous adolescents; define
      predictive factors for the occurrence of PH and its impact on newborns. METHODS: 
      We followed 29 primiparous adolescents from the prenatal period through the 12th 
      week of the puerperium, with a mean of sixteen years of age, served at the
      Outpatient Facility for Adolescents of Maternidade Escola Assis Chateaubriand
      (MEAC) of Universidade Federal do Ceara (Fortaleza, Brazil). The pregnant
      adolescents were divided into two groups, that is, those who remained
      normotensive (Group I) and those who developed PH (Group II). The variables
      investigated in the assessment of the value of predictability for the development
      of PH were anthropometric measures, socioeconomic aspects, smoking habit,
      inheritance for SAH (father/mother), prenatal tests requested in the first
      prenatal care visit in addition to microalbuminuria and ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM) in the 28th week of gestation. The pregnant adolescents were
      followed up at delivery and late puerperium (12th week after the puerperium). The
      newborns to the mothers included in our study were assessed at birth according to
      the Apgar score and the Capurro method, for weight, height and perinatal hypoxia.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of PH was 51.7%. Inheritance for SAH presented the
      highest predictive value for PH with an odds ratio of 10.99. Diastolic arterial
      pressure equal to or above 70 mmHg at the gestational age of 35 weeks was
      statistically significant as a predictive value for PH. At ABPM we found a
      predictive value for PH: diastolic pressure load during alertness, diastolic and 
      systolic pressure load during night sleep, pressure variability and maximum
      diastolic pressure during sleep. Specifically a maximum diastolic arterial
      pressure (DAP) at ABPM during the period of night sleep (3)64 mmHg presented an
      odds ratio of 6 for PH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 60% for the
      development of PH. CONCLUSION: The research for PH predictive factors in
      primiparous adolescents showed to be easy to apply and useful to stratify
      high-risk pregnant women as regards the development of PH.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour CTG monitoring: comparison of normal pregnancies of 25-30 weeks 
      of gestation versus 36-42 weeks of gestation.
PG  - 451-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Routinely antepartal cardiotocogram (CTG) is recorded for 30 min in
      order to obtain normal resting phases (<30 min) or a decrease of irregulatory due
      to hypoxia (>30 min) or to differentiate these from each other. In case of early 
      onset of hypoxia first pathological findings might only be seen by chance in
      incidentally recorded CTG. The goal of this study was, if a continuous 24-h CTG
      allows an earlier detection of beginning hypoxia in case of normal pregnancies of
      36-42 weeks compared to pregnancies of 25-30 weeks of gestation, and if there are
      any differences between both groups concerning the qualitative and quantitative
      description or the detection of a circadian rhythm. METHODS: 21 patients in each 
      group had 24-h CTGs by means of telemetry (Hewlett-Packard type 78101A, 80110A). 
      In both study groups, fetal heart-rate tracing included a full qualitative and
      quantitative description. Comparison of the results of both groups was done to
      look for early signs of pathological findings concerning reduced fetal well-being
      and a potential day and night rhythm. RESULTS: In comparison to 36-42 weeks of
      pregnancies 25-30 weeks had significantly more physiological undulatory
      oscillation and less narrowed undulatory oscillation (P < 0.001), as well as less
      resting phases (P < 0.001). Baseline tachycardia and bradycardia showed
      significantly increasing quantity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Twenty-four-hour CTG
      is a good screening method to detect early onset of hypoxia in case of second and
      third trimester pregnancies and a big help to detect a fetus at risk earlier. In 
      future computerized CTG-systems should be proved in this connection and should be
      compared with our study.

TI  - Gender differences in body mass index in rural India are determined by
      socio-economic factors and lifestyle.
PG  - 3062-8
AB  - A survey of the nutritional status of women in 6 villages of the Pune district of
      Maharashtra, India, found young women to have a significantly lower BMI than
      their male peers. The purpose of this study was to identify social and economic
      factors associated with this difference in thinness and to explore the behavior
      in men and women that might underlie these associations. We compared men and
      women in 90 families in this part of Maharashtra by taking measurements of the
      height and weight of the married couple of child-bearing age in each family and
      assessing their social and economic details, fasting practices, and oil
      consumption. In this agricultural community, women were thinner in joint
      land-owning families, where the main occupation was farming, than those in
      nonfarming families. This was not true of men in this type of family. Men in
      "cash-rich" families had higher BMI than men in families without this
      characteristic. There was no corresponding difference in women's BMI. We then
      examined the lifestyles of men and women in a subset of 45 of these families.
      Women were more likely to work full time in farming than men, to carry the burden
      of all household chores, to have less sleep, and to eat less food away from home 
      than men. Women fasted more frequently and more strictly than men. Despite
      identifying significant differences in behavior between men and women in the same
      household, we did not find a direct link between behavior and BMI. We conclude
      that being married into a farming family is an important factor in determining
      the thinness of a woman in rural Maharashtra.

TI  - The challenges of obesity and obstetric anaesthesia.
PG  - 631-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the clinical challenges
      of obesity in obstetrics from the anaesthetist's viewpoint. RECENT FINDINGS: The 
      prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the
      labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During 
      pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension 
      and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational),
      respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease,
      caesarean section and infections (primarily urinary tract infections, wound
      infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia-related
      maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway
      complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality
      but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes.
      Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced
      anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counselling, antenatal
      screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged. SUMMARY: Effective 
      communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are
      essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional
      techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal
      mortality.

TI  - Correlates of first-time mothers' postpartum stress.
PG  - 500-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine first-time mothers' postpartum stress
      and its correlates following discharge from the hospital or clinic after vaginal 
      delivery. One hundred and eighty-three first-time mothers were enrolled from
      hospitals and clinics in Kaohsiung City. All first-time mothers reported normal
      pregnancies and vaginal deliveries, delivered healthy infants at term, and were
      surveyed during their postpartum periods after discharge from hospitals or
      clinics. The Hung Postpartum Stress Scale was used to examine first-time mothers'
      postpartum stress and stressors during their postpartum periods. The top ten
      postpartum stressors perceived by the women were: "the baby getting sick
      suddenly", "the flabby flesh of my belly", "the unpredictability of the baby's
      schedule", "interrupted sleep", "the shape of the baby's head due to the sleeping
      position", "not sleeping enough", "lack of information regarding infant's growth 
      and development", "the baby's crying", "my life is restricted", and "the baby
      choking during feeding". There were no significant differences between the
      first-time mothers' demographic characteristics and their postpartum stress and
      its three components (negative body changes, maternal role attainment, lack of
      social support), respectively. Insight into the study results of first-time
      mothers' postpartum stress and stressors provides a reference for health
      professionals that the development of programs and resources addressing
      primiparous women's unique needs are required.

TI  - Spontaneous coronary dissection associated with sleep deprivation presenting with
      acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - e78-9
AB  - Spontaneous coronary dissection is a rare cause of myocardial ischemia,
      myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Idiopathic spontaneous coronary
      artery dissection (SCAD) occurs in patient without risk factors for coronary
      artery disease and without underlying pregnancy. We describe a case of idiopathic
      spontaneous coronary dissection after sleep deprivation presenting with acute
      myocardial infarction. A 40 year old woman presented to an emergency department
      with squeezing substernal chest pain lasting 1 hour following 72 h sleep
      deprivation due to overtime work. On admission, ECG showed no significant ST
      change. But the level of CK-MB and Troponin T were increased up to 77.54 ng/ml
      and 1.62 ng/ml, respectively. Emergent coronary angiography demonstrated a
      longitudinal dissection of the middle portion in the diagonal artery with TIMI
      III flow to the distal part of the vessel. Because the dissected vessel was too
      small to pass the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and deploy the stent,
      angioplasty was not performed. Under medical treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel 
      and unfractionated heparin, conservative management was proposed; she remained
      free of symptom and discharged free of chest pain and in good condition.

TI  - Possible broad impacts of long work hours.
PG  - 531-6
AB  - The paper summarizes research linking long work hours to a wide range of risks to
      workers, families, employers, and the community. The risks are theorized to stem 
      from less time to recover from work, longer exposure to workplace hazards, and
      less time to attend to non-work responsibilities. Risks to workers include sleep 
      deprivation, poor recovery from work, decrements in neuro-cognitive and
      physiological functioning, illnesses, adverse reproductive outcomes, and
      injuries. Risks to families include delayed marriages and child bearing, and
      obesity in children. Risks to employers include reduced productivity and
      increases in workers errors. Mistakes by fatigued workers have broad reaching
      impacts to the community: medical errors, automobile crashes with other drivers
      on the road, and industrial disasters that damage the environment.

AB  - Women report their sleep to be disrupted during pregnancy. Sleep deprivation has 
      been linked to elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. No information
      currently addresses the sleep-immune relationship during pregnancy. This study
      explores the relationship between subjectively reported sleep variables and
      circulating serum cytokine levels. Pregnant women (n=35; mean age=31.0+/-3.7
      years) seen once a trimester completed sleep questionnaires, gave blood and
      recorded their sleep on a sleep diary at home for 2 weeks. Nonpregnant women
      (n=43; mean age=28.2+/-5.2 years) underwent the same protocol once. Subjective
      sleep variables were compared to serum cytokine levels for IL-4, -6, -10 and
      TNF-alpha as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) determined by ELISA. Nonparametric 
      analyses and linear regression were performed to explore relationships between
      the sleep and immune variables. Pregnant women subjectively reported their sleep 
      to be worse than in the nonpregnant group. Serum cytokine levels differed between
      the two groups and varied by trimester. As anticipated, IL-10 was significantly
      higher in all trimesters; however CRP, an indicator of systemic inflammation, was
      higher in all trimesters compared to the nonpregnant sample. Subjectively
      reported sleep disruption was associated with increases in TNF-alpha in the
      pregnant sample and CRP in the nonpregnant sample. These data confirm that
      disrupted sleep experienced during pregnancy, as well as during the nonpregnant
      state, is related to increases in inflammatory markers. Future exploration of
      these relationships should include functional assessments of immunity as well as 
      polysomnographically recorded sleep.

TI  - Sleep practices and sudden infant death syndrome: a new proposal for scoring risk
      factors.
PG  - 1288-94
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and
      socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale
      associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional, population-based study. SETTING: Passo Fundo, Brazil.
      PARTICIPANTS: 2,285 newborns. INTERVENTIONS: Perinatal information was collected 
      from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was 
      applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep
      practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was
      based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate
      analyses were employed. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Application of the score
      allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following
      variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer
      visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age < or = 20 years (p <
      .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of 
      life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p <
      .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome 
      cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk
      sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of
      this study lies in the future application of this information via public health
      measures targeted at high-risk populations.

PG  - 84-6
AB  - Investigation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) circadian
      chronological structure changes by means of blood pressure monitoring in healthy 
      pregnant women during development of gestational hypertension (GH) and
      pre-eclampsia (PE) was carried out. 72 hours blood pressure monitoring (TM-2421
      device, Tokyo, Japan) was carried out in 34 healthy pregnant women. Parametric
      and non-parametric indices of circadian rhythms were determined, which allowed us
      to include in group A 17 women who had normal BP until delivery. Group B
      consisted of 17 women with hypertension in II and III trimesters. Increase of
      hyperbaric index (HBI) of SBP was revealed in the I trimester in women in whom
      hypertension was developed later in pregnancy. HBI was used as a prognostic
      criterion of developing MESOR-hypertension long before its clinical
      manifestation. In the II and III trimesters HBI, per cent time of elevation
      (PTE%) and MESORs of SBP and DBP circadian rhythms progressively augmented.
      Pregnant women with hypertension belonged to type non-dipper according to D/N%
      changes (less then 10%). This may be the result of insufficient decrease of night
      values of SBP in group B pregnant women, which is characteristic of GH and PE.

TI  - [Circadian rhythms of human fetus and their coordination with its functioning].
PG  - 59-62
AB  - Diurnal rhythms of cardiac activity and motion activity of expectant mother fetus
      with physiological course of pregnancy have been studied at pregnancy terms of
      16-28 weeks. A new, original method of analysis of fetus has been proposed. It
      has been established, that healthy fetus exhibits sharply defined day-and-night
      variations of physiological functions. Biological rhythms of human fetus are in
      coordination with the condition of maternal body, but it is in counter phase with
      it. Dynamic curve of the changing of functioning level of its physiological
      systems carries biphasic character. "Active" (from 9 am till 2 pm and from 7 pm
      till 4 am) and "calm" (from 4 am till 9 am and from 2 pm till 7 pm) periods of
      human fetus have been chosen. The absence of sharply defined biorhythms in terms 
      of 20-24 weeks gestation, shows its developmental retardation and needs timely
      correction. The results of investigations lay fundamentals of chronobiology and
      chronotheraphy of human fetus.

TI  - Gender differences in sleep disorders.
PG  - 383-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate recent evidence regarding gender differences in
      sleep. RECENT FINDINGS: Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with
      longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency.
      Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of
      slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, 
      including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with
      alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie
      the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support 
      a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and
      women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive
      sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and
      central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female
      predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin
      syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become
      apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause
      can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such
      as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include
      differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response
      to therapy.

TI  - Monitoring progress toward achieving Maternal and Infant Healthy People 2010
      objectives--19 states, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS),
      2000-2003.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Certain modifiable maternal behaviors and experiences before, 
      during, and after pregnancy are associated with adverse health outcomes for the
      mother and her infant (e.g., physical abuse, insufficient folic acid consumption,
      smoking during pregnancy, and improper infant sleep position). Information about 
      these behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends in maternal and
      infant health, enhance understanding of the relation between maternal behaviors
      and infant health outcomes, plan and evaluate maternal and infant health
      programs, direct policy decisions, and monitor progress toward achieving the
      national Healthy People 2010 [HP 2010] objectives (US Department of Health and
      Human Services. Healthy people 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving
      health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington, DC: US
      Department of Health and Human Services; 2000). REPORTING PERIOD COVERED:
      2000-2003. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
      (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed
      to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during,
      and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a
      mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are
      mailed to a sample of mothers; nonresponders are followed up with telephone
      interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate
      data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create
      annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates
      of perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live
      infants. This report summarizes data for 2000-2003 from 19 states (Alabama,
      Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine,
      Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
      Utah, Washington, and West Virginia) that measured progress toward achieving HP
      2010 objectives for eight perinatal indicators: 1) pregnancy intention, 2)
      multivitamin use, 3) physical abuse, 4) cigarette smoking during pregnancy, 5)
      cigarette smoking cessation, 6) drinking alcohol during pregnancy, 7)
      breastfeeding initiation, and 8) infant sleep position. RESULTS: In 2003,
      prevalence of intended pregnancy among women having a live birth ranged from
      48.1% in Louisiana to 66.5% in Maine; during 2000-2003, no state experienced a
      statistically significant (p< or =0.05) increase in prevalence of intended
      pregnancy, and one state experienced a significant decrease. In 2003, prevalence 
      of multivitamin use at least four times per week during the month before
      pregnancy ranged from 23.0% in Arkansas to 45.2% in Maine; during 2000-2003,
      multivitamin use increased significantly in three states (Illinois, North
      Carolina, and Utah). In 2003, prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or
      partner during the 12 months before pregnancy ranged from 2.2% in Maine to 7.6%
      in New Mexico; during 2000-2003, significant decreases were recorded in three
      states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska). In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from
      cigarette smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 72.5% in West
      Virginia to 96.1% in Utah; during 2000-2003, a significant increase was recorded 
      in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of smoking cessation during pregnancy ranged from
      30.2% in West Virginia to 65.8% in Utah; during 2000-2003, a significant increase
      was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from alcohol during the
      last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 91.3% in Colorado to 98.0% in Utah; during
      2000-2003, abstinence increased significantly in Louisiana and Utah but decreased
      significantly in Florida and Nebraska. In 2003, prevalence of mothers who
      breastfed their babies in the early postpartum period ranged from 51.2% in
      Louisiana to 90.3% in Alaska; during 2000-2003, significant increases were
      recorded in six states (Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, 
      and South Carolina). In 2003, prevalence of healthy full-term infants who were
      placed to sleep on their backs ranged from 50.0% in Arkansas to 78.7% in
      Washington; during 2000-2003, significant increases were recorded in eight states
      (Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, and West
      Virginia). In 2003, all 19 states achieved or exceeded the HP 2010 objective for 
      smoking cessation during pregnancy, and 16 states achieved the HP 2010 objective 
      for abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy. In addition,
      nearly half of the states achieved the objectives for breastfeeding in the early 
      postpartum period and infant back sleep position. However, no state achieved the 
      HP 2010 objectives for intended pregnancy, multivitamin use before pregnancy,
      absence of physical abuse before pregnancy, or abstinence from smoking during
      pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: PRAMS data indicate variability among states regarding
      progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives in the area of maternal and child
      health. More progress has been made in achieving objectives focused on the period
      during and after pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation and proper infant sleep
      position); less progress has been made in achieving objectives related to
      behaviors and experiences in the preconception period (e.g., pregnancy intention 
      and multivitamin use). PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: State maternal and child health
      programs can use these state- and population-based data to monitor progress
      toward achieving HP 2010 objectives, identify indicators to target for
      intervention, and plan and evaluate programs that promote positive maternal and
      infant health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes. These data also can be used
      to guide policy decisions that could affect the health of mothers and infants.

TI  - Prenatal mood disturbance predicts sleep problems in infancy and toddlerhood.
PG  - 451-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental animal data link prenatal stress with sleep disturbance 
      in offspring, but the link in humans is unclear. AIMS: To investigate the link
      between prenatal maternal anxiety and depression and infant sleep disturbance
      from 6 to 30 months of age. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective study of a
      large birth cohort from pregnancy to 30 months. Questionnaire measures of anxiety
      and depression were completed by mothers at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and at 8
      weeks and 8 months postpartum. SUBJECTS: The ALSPAC cohort, a prospective
      community study of women in the UK who have been followed since pregnancy.
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of total sleep time, number of awakenings, and broadly
      defined sleep problems were available on children at ages 6, 18, and 30 months.
      RESULTS: Reliable measures of total sleep time, nighttime awakenings, and sleep
      problems were identified at 6, 18, and 30 months. Higher levels of prenatal
      maternal anxiety and depression predicted more sleep problems at 18 and 30
      months, after controlling for postnatal mood and obstetric and psychosocial
      covariates; the association was not restricted to clinical extremes. No link with
      total sleep time was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Mood disturbance in pregnancy has
      persisting effects on sleep problems in the child, a finding that is consistent
      with experimental animal research. The findings add to a growing literature
      showing that maternal prenatal stress, anxiety, and depression may have lasting
      effects on child development.

TI  - Today's epidemics in children: possible relations to environmental pollution and 
      suggested preventive measures.
PG  - 18-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Facts and hypotheses on the relationship between some children's
      diseases or disorders and external stressors during the developmental stage of a 
      child, both prenatally and postnatally are described in literature. In this paper
      the following changes in patterns and causes of the main childhood illnesses are 
      summarized and recommendations for actions are made. Prematurity. Intra-uterine
      growth restriction. Testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Type I and Type II diabetes. 
      Asthma, atopy and hay fever. Autism. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). Learning disabilities. Cancer. Obesity. Hearing problems. RESULTS:
      Literature provides a growing amount of information on changing patterns in
      childhood diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The following recommendations for action are
      formulated: Immediate research on endocrine disrupters in relation to
      prematurity. Diabetes: avoid Maillard Compounds in liquid baby food and in food
      in general: promote breastfeeding. Asthma: avoid exposure to smoking, the use of 
      chemical household products, dioxin and dioxin-like chemicals, and avoid air
      pollution with high levels of particulate matter, especially around conception,
      during pregnancy and in the first years of life. Autism: more research on
      incidence and causes. ADHD and learning disabilities: more research on prevalence
      and causes. Preventions: 1) preconception counselling to avoid potentially
      harmful substances; 2) controlling and further lowering levels of polychlorinated
      biphenyls, lead and methyl mercury. Cancer: promote breastfeeding, carry out
      research into effects of foetal exposure to internal fission-product
      radionuclides. Obesity: stop smoking in pregnancy, avoid parental obesity, longer
      night sleep. Hearing problems: lower noise levels in discotheques, promote the
      day-evening-night level to avoid noise (longer night sleep).

TI  - EFNS guidelines on management of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb
      movement disorder in sleep.
PG  - 1049-65
AB  - In 2003, the EFNS Task Force was set up for putting forth guidelines for the
      management of the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and the Periodic Limb Movement
      Disorder (PLMD). After determining the objectives for management and the search
      strategy for primary and secondary RLS and for PLMD, a review of the scientific
      literature up to 2004 was performed for the drug classes and interventions
      employed in treatment (drugs acting on the adrenoreceptor, antiepileptic drugs,
      benzodiazepines/hypnotics, dopaminergic agents, opioids, other treatments).
      Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class
      of evidence, and recommendations formed according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for
      rating. Dopaminergic agents came out as having the best evidence for efficacy in 
      primary RLS. Reported adverse events were usually mild and reversible;
      augmentation was a feature with dopaminergic agents. No controlled trials were
      available for RLS in children and for RLS during pregnancy. The following level A
      recommendations can be offered: for primary RLS, cabergoline, gabapentin,
      pergolide, ropinirole, levodopa and rotigotine by transdermal delivery (the
      latter two for short-term use) are effective in relieving the symptoms.
      Transdermal oestradiol is ineffective for PLMD.

TI  - An urn model of the development of L/M cone ratios in human and macaque retinas.
PG  - 387-94
AB  - A model of the development of L/M cone ratios in the Old World primate retina is 
      presented. It is supposed that during gestation, the cone cycles randomly between
      states in which it transcribes either L or M opsin. The current state determines 
      and increases the probability that it will transcribe the same opsin in future
      cycles. These assumptions are sufficient to formalize the process as a Markov
      chain that can be modeled as an urn containing two types of balls, L and M.
      Drawing one ball results in the increase of its species and the decrease of the
      other. Over the long run, the urn will become populated with a single type of
      ball. This state corresponds to the photoreceptor adopting a fixed identity for
      its lifetime. We investigate the effect of the number of states and the rule that
      regulates the advantage of transition toward one cone type or another on the
      relation between fetal and adult L/M cone ratios. In the range of 100 to 1000
      states, small variations of the initial L/M ratio or the transition advantage can
      each generate large changes in the final L/M ratio, in qualitative accord with
      the variation seen in human adult retinas. The time course to attain stable L/M
      ratios also varies with these parameters. If it is believed that the cycling
      follows a circadian rhythm, then final L/M cone ratios would be expected to
      stabilize shortly after birth in the human being and the macaque.

TI  - RLS patients: who are they?
PG  - 2-7
AB  - Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been
      identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins 
      or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved
      by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day.
      All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a
      family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a
      positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features
      to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS 
      is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, 
      or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar 
      to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify
      these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of
      RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients' quality of life.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 1599-612
AB  - PURPOSE: The signs and symptoms, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology,
      diagnosis, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, and options and
      guidelines for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are reviewed.
      SUMMARY: RLS was first described in the 17th century and further characterized in
      1945. RLS is a common disorder, occurring in about 10% of the population.
      Patients with RLS often describe the urge to move, uncomfortable sensations, and 
      pain, which begin or worsen during rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting.
      Symptoms of RLS make sleeping difficult for many patients, and significant
      daytime difficulties result from the condition. RLS can either be primary or
      arise from secondary causes that lead to iron deficiency. There is a familial
      component in primary RLS, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Of
      individuals with conditions associated with iron-deficiency states, including
      pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia, 25-30% may develop RLS. The goals of RLS
      treatment include improving its symptoms and the patient's quality of life. There
      are limited data on the treatment of RLS. Pharmacologic therapies include iron
      replacement, dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa), dopamine agonists,
      anticonvulsants, opioids, and benzodiazepines. There have been no systematic
      trials of nonpharmacologic therapies for RLS, but good sleep hygiene and
      avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may improve symptoms. CONCLUSION:
      RLS is a common disorder thought to involve abnormal iron metabolism and
      dopaminergic systems. Nonpharmacologic therapy should be suggested for all
      patients with RLS, but pharmacologic therapy may be required, and evidence is
      strongest for levodopa and dopamine agonists.

TI  - Sleep dysfunction in women and its management.
PG  - 376-86
AB  - Women generally have more complaints about sleep, compared with men of the same
      age. At various stages of reproduction, the reasons for these complaints become
      rather obvious--menstrual cramps and discomfort, pregnancy and postpartum
      factors, and menopausal hot flashes can fragment sleep. In addition, there are
      lifestyle factors, such as going to bed late and getting up early in order to
      attend to various family responsibilities, restricting the time allowed for
      sleep. Factors outside a woman's control, such as caregiving for sick family
      members during the night, can also result in disrupted sleep patterns, with
      little opportunity to make up for the lost sleep on weekends or days off. This
      article discusses the types of insomnia commonly experienced by women during key 
      reproductive stages of life and proposes gender-specific assessment and
      management strategies. Pharmacologic management of sleep problems is useful for
      brief episodes of insomnia, but not usually desirable during pregnancy and
      lactation, or for management of chronic insomnia. For most women, regardless of
      reproductive stage, nonpharmacologic strategies that involve behavioral
      therapies, or short-term focused use of hypnotics at key time points, are more
      effective for quality of life than is long-term use of pharmacologic
      interventions.

TI  - Estrogen-triggered delays in mammary gland gene expression during the estrous
      cycle: evidence for a novel timing system.
PG  - 225-39
AB  - During the estrous cycle and beginning in estrus, the mammary gland undergoes
      pregnancy-like development that depends on transcriptional regulation by the
      estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR) and Pax-2 as well as the action of
      the growth factors Wnt-4 and RANKL. In this report, we first describe the decay
      and delayed expression of ERalpha, PR, and Pax-2 proteins as well as depression
      of Wnt-4 and RANKL mRNA coincident with the strong estrogen surge in proestrus.
      In time-course studies using ovari-ectomized mice, a single estrogen injection
      replicated these delays and caused an 18 h delay in Wnt-4 expression. Molecular
      time-delay systems are at the core of cellular cycles, most notably the circadian
      clock, and depend on proteasome degradation of transcriptional regulators that
      exhibit dedicated timing functions. The cytoplasmic dynamics of these regulators 
      govern delay duration through negative transcription/translation feedback loops. 
      A proteasome inhibitor, PS-341, blocked estrogen-stimulated ERalpha, PR, and
      Pax-2 decay and proteasome chymotryptic activity, assayed using a fluorogenic
      substrate, was elevated in proestrus correlating with the depletion of the
      transcription factors. The 18-h delay in Wnt-4 induction corresponded to the
      turnover time of Pax-2 protein in the cytoplasm and was eliminated in Pax-2
      knockout mammary tissue, demonstrating that Pax-2 has a unique timing function.
      The patterns of estrogen-triggered ERalpha, PR, and Pax-2 turnover were
      consistent with a negative transcriptional feedback. Retarding the expression of 
      ERalpha, PR, and Pax-2 may optimize preparations for pregnancy by coordinating
      expression of critical receptors and transcription factors with rising estrogen
      and progesterone levels in estrus. The estrogen surge in proestrus has no defined
      mammotropic function. This study provides the first evidence that it is a
      synchronizing signal triggering proteasome-dependent turnover of mammary gland
      ERalpha, PR, and Pax-2. We hypothesize that the delays reflect a previously
      unrecognized timing system, which is present in all ovarian target tissues.

TI  - Pup circadian rhythm entrainment--effect of maternal ganglionectomy or
      pinealectomy.
PG  - 342-9
AB  - In rodents, during late embryonic and early neonatal development, circadian
      rhythms develop in synchrony with those of their mothers, which in turn are
      synchronized with the environmental photoperiod. This paper examines the effect
      of maternal ganglionectomy (pineal gland sympathetic denervation) or extirpation 
      of the pineal gland on pups' drinking rhythms, a behavior that is continuously
      monitored in individual animals starting after weaning and studied up to 3 weeks 
      later. Maternal ganglionectomy or pinealectomy performed on the 7th day of
      gestation significantly disrupts rat pups' drinking behavior, within and among
      litters. In both treatments, circadian rhythm characteristics of the free-running
      period (tau), phase, amplitude and alpha were significantly altered compared to
      those of the control pups born from sham-operated mothers. With the exception of 
      the alpha component, both maternal treatments have similar effects. When
      melatonin was given to the mothers instead of the endogenous pineal secretory
      activity for 5 days during the late period of gestation, this treatment reversed 
      the effects of maternal ganglionectomy and pinealectomy. These observations,
      together with previous studies of our group, indicate that the maternal superior 
      cervical ganglia and pineal gland are necessary components of the mechanism for
      maternal synchronization, and that maternal melatonin may, directly or
      indirectly, affect the performance of the pups' central oscillator during early
      pup rat development.

TI  - Smoking and the sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - 81-103
AB  - The aims of this review are (a) to critically examine the epidemiologic evidence 
      for a possible association between smoking and the sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS), (b) to review the pathology and postulated physiological mechanism(s) by 
      which smoking might be causally related to SIDS, and (c) to provide
      recommendations for SIDS prevention in relation to tobacco smoking. Over 60
      studies have examined the relation between maternal smoking during pregnancy and 
      risk of SIDS. With regard to prone-sleep-position intervention programs, the
      pooled relative risk associated with maternal smoking was RR = 2.86 (95% CI =
      2.77, 2.95) before and RR = 3.93 (95% CI = 3.78, 4.08) after. Epidemiologically, 
      to distinguish the effect of active maternal smoking during pregnancy from
      involuntary tobacco smoking by the infants of smoking mothers is difficult. Clear
      evidence for environmental tobacco smoke exposure can be obtained by examining
      the risk of SIDS from paternal smoking when the mother is a non-smoker. Seven
      such studies have been carried out. The pooled unadjusted RR was 1.49 (95% CI =
      1.25, 1.77). Consideration of the pathological and physiological effects of
      tobacco suggests that the predominant effect from maternal smoking comes from the
      in utero exposure of the fetus to tobacco smoke. Assuming a causal association
      between smoking and SIDS, about one-third of SIDS deaths might have been
      prevented if all fetuses had not been exposed to maternal smoking in utero.

TI  - [Prenatal experience and postnatal development of the rat hippocampus: sleep
      deprivation of pregnant rats].
PG  - 401-7
AB  - The effects of sleep deprivation in pregnancy on the development of hippocampal
      function of the offspring have been investigated. For this purpose we compared
      electrophysiological characteristics in the hippocampal slices of 15-20-old-day
      rats of the control and two experimental groups. In the first experimental group 
      the pups were taken from mother for weighting three times during the first
      postnatal week and then weekly. Another experimental group was brought up without
      handling. We found that CA1 population spikes developed to significantly less
      amplitude in experimental groups of rat pups. This phenomenon was observed at
      higher intensity of monosynaptic activation, although near-threshold stimuli
      didn't reveal any differences among groups. However, under paired-pulse
      stimulation (70 ms inter-pulse interval) small amplitudes in the hippocampal
      slices of experimental animals could facilitate up to control value, and second
      in pair responses didn't differ from corresponding control. Our data doesn't
      confirm the hypothesis about decreased connectivity in the hippocampus of
      experimental rats, but the efficacy of CA3-CA1 inputs seems to be lower. Besides 
      excitatory transmission, the effectiveness of inhibition of paired-pulse
      facilitation at 15 ms inter-pulse interval was also significantly decreased. The 
      observed effects of prenatal influences seem to develop under postnatal
      experience. We observed significant trend to more pronounced modifications upon
      age especially in the case of early handling and testing.

TI  - Maternal melatonin effects on clock gene expression in a nonhuman primate fetus.
PG  - 4618-26
AB  - In the adult mammal the circadian system, which allows predictive adaptation to
      daily environmental changes, comprises peripheral oscillators in most tissues,
      commanded by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The external 
      environment of the fetus is provided by its mother. In primates, maternal
      melatonin is a candidate to entrain fetal circadian rhythms, including the SCN
      rhythms of metabolic activity. We found in the 90% of gestation capuchin monkey
      fetus expression of the clock genes Bmal-1, Per-2, Cry-2, and Clock in the SCN,
      adrenal, pituitary, brown fat, and pineal. Bmal-1, Per-2, and the melatonin 1
      receptor (MT1) showed a robust oscillatory expression in SCN and adrenal gland,
      whereas a circadian rhythm of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found in
      plasma. Maternal melatonin suppression changed the expression of Bmal-1, Per-2,
      and MT1 in the fetal SCN. These effects were reversed by maternal melatonin
      replacement. In contrast, neither maternal melatonin suppression nor its
      replacement had effects on the expression of Per-2 and Bmal-1 or MT1 in the fetal
      adrenal gland or the circadian rhythm of fetal plasma dehydroepiandrosterone
      sulphate. Our data suggest that maternal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the fetal
      SCN but probably not for the adrenal gland.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a population
      of Delhi, India.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized in the Western world
      as a public health burden, but there has been no community-based study performed 
      to assess the prevalence of the condition in India. The study was performed to
      assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population. 
      DESIGN: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study. SETTING: 
      A semi-urban community in Delhi. DURATION: Two years (2003 to 2005). PATIENTS AND
      PARTICIPANTS: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of
      age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial
      infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure,
      pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure,
      systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy. INTERVENTION: An OSA
      assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage 1 of the
      study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual
      and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80
      nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which
      consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS: A
      total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550
      habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73
      nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers
      (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving
      prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome
      (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age,
      obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant
      risk factors for OSAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk factors
      and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is
      contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion
      bias.

TI  - Prenatal malnutrition and sleep states in adult rats: effects of restraint
      stress.
PG  - 156-63
AB  - Independently, prenatal malnutrition and psychological/physical stress have been 
      shown to affect sleep architecture in adult rats. As malnutrition and stress
      commonly co-exist in malnourished human populations, the objective of the present
      study was to ascertain the combined effects of these two insults by examining
      sleep-wake parameters following a brief restraint stress in prenatally protein
      malnourished rats. The male offspring of rats provided with a protein deficient
      diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were
      implanted with recording electrodes beginning at postnatal day 90. Polygraph
      recordings were obtained to quantify sleep states during the first 4 h of the
      dark phase of the cycle on 2 consecutive days. The first followed a 24-h
      habituation session to the recording chamber (baseline). The second occurred at
      the same time of day but followed 20 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglas tube.
      During baseline, prenatally malnourished rats spent more time in rapid eye
      movement sleep (REMS) in the first 2 h after "lights off" (block 1), and greater 
      amounts of wakefulness (W) with a corresponding reduction in slow wave sleep
      (SWS) in the second two hours (block 2), as compared with controls. Following
      stress, the sleep architecture of both groups of rats remained unaltered in block
      1 relative to their baseline day. In block 2, both groups exhibited significant
      reductions in SWS and REMS with significantly greater reductions being expressed 
      in the prenatally malnourished group (most dramatically, REMS was completely
      eliminated). These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be more severe in
      those malnourished human populations subjected to acutely stressful experiences.

TI  - Preconception care between pregnancies: the content of internatal care.
PG  - S107-22
AB  - For more than two decades, prenatal care has been a cornerstone of our nation's
      strategy for improving pregnancy outcomes. In recent years, however, a growing
      recognition of the limits of prenatal care and the importance of maternal health 
      before pregnancy has drawn increasing attention to preconception and internatal
      care. Internatal care refers to a package of healthcare and ancillary services
      provided to a woman and her family from the birth of one child to the birth of
      her next child. For healthy mothers, internatal care offers an opportunity for
      wellness promotion between pregnancies. For high-risk mothers, internatal care
      provides strategies for risk reduction before their next pregnancy. In this paper
      we begin to define the contents of internatal care. The core components of
      internatal care consist of risk assessment, health promotion, clinical and
      psychosocial interventions. We identified several priority areas, such as FINDS
      (family violence, infections, nutrition, depression, and stress) for risk
      assessment or BBEEFF (breastfeeding, back-to-sleep, exercise, exposures, family
      planning and folate) for health promotion. Women with chronic health conditions
      such as hypertension, diabetes, or weight problems should receive on-going care
      per clinical guidelines for their evaluation, treatment, and follow-up during the
      internatal period. For women with prior adverse outcomes such as preterm
      delivery, we propose an internatal care model based on known etiologic pathways, 
      with the goal of preventing recurrence by addressing these biobehavioral pathways
      prior to the next pregnancy. We suggest enhancing service integration for women
      and families, including possibly care coordination and home visitation for
      selected high-risk women. The primary aim of this paper is to start a dialogue on
      the content of internatal care.

TI  - Patient preferences, satisfaction, and resource use in office evacuation of early
      pregnancy failure.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine patient treatment preferences and satisfaction with an
      office-based procedure for early pregnancy failure and to compare resource use
      and cost between office and operating room management of early pregnancy failure.
      METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of 165 women presenting
      for surgical management of early pregnancy failure. Participants completed a
      preoperative questionnaire addressing treatment preferences and expectations and 
      a postoperative questionnaire measuring level of pain experienced and
      satisfaction with care. Resource use was determined by measuring the time
      patients spent at the health care facility and the actual procedure time. Cost
      was estimated using an institutional database. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen women
      from the office and 50 from the operating room were enrolled. Patients selecting 
      outpatient management scored "privacy," "avoiding going to sleep," and "previous 
      experience" higher than the operating room group (P < .05). Patients who
      perceived that their physicians preferred one procedure over the other were more 
      likely to select that procedure (P < .001). Satisfaction was high in both groups,
      and underestimating the procedure's discomfort was negatively associated with
      satisfaction (P < .002). Costs were greater than two-fold higher in the operating
      room group compared with the office group (P < .01). Complications were uncommon,
      but hemorrhage-related complications were four times more common in the operating
      room group than in the office group (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Office-based surgical 
      management of early pregnancy failure is an acceptable option for many women and 
      offers substantial resource and cost savings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.

TI  - Prenatal Cocaine Exposure and Infant Sleep at 7 Months of age: The Influence of
      the Caregiving Environment.
PG  - 383-404
AB  - The primary goal of this study was to examine sleep problems in a sample of
      cocaine-exposed 7-month-old infants and to determine if maternal psychopathology 
      mediated any existing association between substance exposure and sleep behaviors.
      We also examined the differences in sleep behaviors of cocaine-exposed infants in
      parental custody and cocaine-exposed infants in nonparental custody. Participants
      were 65 cocaine-exposed and 53 nonexposed infants and their primary caregivers
      who were recruited at delivery and assessed at 7 months of infant age. As
      expected, women who used cocaine during pregnancy had more psychiatric symptoms
      than nonusers. Prenatal exposure to heavier amounts of cocaine was significantly 
      related to more severe sleep difficulties, and maternal anxiety mediated this
      association. Approximately 28% of cocaine mothers lost custody of their infants
      by 7 months of age. Nonmaternal caregivers had significantly fewer symptoms of
      psychopathology than the cocaine-using women who retained custody of their
      children. Infants who were in nonparental care at 7 months of age also had less
      severe sleep problems than did infants who remained in parental care.

TI  - Rethinking the biological clock: eleventh-hour moms, miracle moms and meanings of
      age-related infertility.
PG  - 1550-60
AB  - Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within
      the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce
      and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on
      the "biological clock". Technological solutions to the biological clock,
      specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess
      "ovarian reserve", or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that
      correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the
      longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive 
      capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical
      designation of "diminished ovarian reserve" has come to imply that a woman has
      "old eggs". This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the
      eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of
      menopause. In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who
      conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different
      narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an 
      apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The "eleventh-hour mom"
      narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their
      own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the
      "miracle mom" narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of 
      whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs,
      but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through
      their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful "diminished ovarian 
      reserve" in varying ways that connect with cultural, social,
      structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they
      reproduced the socio-biological project of the biological clock, but rooted this 
      social project in the metaphor of "old eggs" rather than menopause.

PG  - 659-64
AB  - This descriptive research aimed to analyze the Nursing Diagnoses identified in
      low-risk pregnant patients. Eleven pregnant women received prenatal care in a
      safe maternity in the state of Goias. The data were classified under the NANDA
      (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy II and analyzed according
      to the referrals in obstetrics. Twenty-five different Nursing Diagnoses were
      identified. All pregnant women presented: insufficient knowledge (different
      levels and subjects), disturbed sleep pattern, activity intolerance, self-care
      deficit (bathing and hygiene), stress urinary incontinence, and some risk
      diagnoses. Identifying NANDA's Nursing Diagnoses allows the identification of the
      risk level, early detection of complications, and individualization in nursing
      assistance.

TI  - Migraine is associated with menorrhagia and endometriosis.
PG  - 422-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female
      migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache. BACKGROUND: Migraine 
      predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the 
      menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of
      migraine and menstrual disorders. METHODS: Women diagnosed with migraine, using
      International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control
      group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and
      migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular 
      event history, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty female migraineurs
      between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) 
      were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported
      using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P = .77) and hormone replacement
      therapy (12% vs. 8%, P = .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64 % vs.
      80%, P = .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P = .84). 
      Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current
      and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P = .009),
      with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P = .003), and 
      significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert 
      scale) with work/school participation (P = .02), family activities (P < .0001),
      sleep (P = .003), life enjoyment (P = .001), mood (P = .02), and overall quality 
      of life (P = .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was 
      also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P = .001). The
      migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal
      bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P = .017) but not more serious bleeding problems.
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine
      group (28% vs. 12%, P = .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia,
      endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when
      controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was
      significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI
      1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4).
      There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends 
      of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P = .05), transient ischemic
      attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P = .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P = .08) 
      in the migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Women with migraine have a higher frequency of
      menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These
      findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing
      endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet
      function, in migraineurs.

TI  - Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy secondary to adrenal adenoma: metyrapone
      treatment and laparoscopic adrenalectomy.
PG  - 164-7
AB  - Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is a rare and difficult to diagnose disorder.
      We describe the case of a 30-yr-old woman presenting with symptoms and signs of
      mild hypercortisolism, in which ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome was
      diagnosed. Urinary cortisol excretion was elevated and circadian rhythm of
      cortisol was absent. ACTH levels were low. In addition, plasma cortisol failed to
      suppress after a high dexamethasone dose. An abdominal computed tomography scan
      confirmed a left adrenal mass. While diagnosis work-up was still in progress, the
      patient became pregnant and wanted to carry her pregnancy to full-term.
      Hypercortisolism was successfully controlled with metyrapone, which was started
      at 8 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks of gestation, a laparoscopic left
      adrenalectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the gland showed a benign 
      adrenocortical adenoma. The patient developed secondary adrenal insufficiency and
      was discharged on 20 mg hydrocortisone daily dose. At 30 weeks of gestation, the 
      patient had a pre-term rupture of membranes and underwent spontaneous vaginal
      delivery. The newborn was a normal virilized male who weighed 1280 g. No apparent
      metyrapone-induced teratogenic effects were observed and there was no clinical or
      biochemical suppression of adrenocortical function. In conclusion, in adrenal
      Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy, medical treatment with metyrapone as soon as
      the diagnosis is made, in combination with laparoscopic surgery during the second
      trimester, are useful in preventing complications secondary to hypercortisolism
      and safe both for the mother and infant.

TI  - Obesity: a modern epidemic.
PG  - 103-11; discussion 112-3
AB  - It has recently become obvious that the prevalence of obesity has been rapidly
      increasing in the United States, as well as other countries, over the past two
      decades. This change has involved both sexes, all age ranges and various ethnic
      groups. The rising prevalence in children and adolescents is of particular
      concern because of the implications for negative effects on their morbidity and
      mortality in young adulthood. Obesity is definitely associated with a relative
      increase in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, various cancers, respiratory
      disorders in sleep, gallbladder disease and osteoarthritis. It also has negative 
      effects on a variety of other conditions such as pregnancy complications,
      menstrual disorders, psychological disorders, and urinary stress incontinence. It
      is an integral component of the metabolic syndrome, which is emerging as a key
      constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Dealing with this
      epidemic will require the mobilization of multiple constituencies and allocation 
      of adequate resources. These approaches should be instituted with urgency.

TI  - [Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrom during pregnancy: prevalence of main symptoms
      and relationship with Pregnancy Induced-Hypertension and Intra-Uterine Growth
      Retardation].
PG  - 291-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of main symptoms of Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea Syndrom (OSAS) and their relationship with Pregnancy Induced-Hypertension
      (PIH) as well as Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IGR) as suggested by recent
      studies. METHODOLOGY: Four hundred (and) thirty-eight enquiry forms completed
      during post-partum period were analysed, after exclusion of multiple pregnancies.
      Collected data were demographic characteristics, obstetrical events, sleep
      disorders during last trimester, screening of snoring and vigilance troubles with
      an Epworth score. RESULTS: Forty-five percentages of the patients reported to
      have habitual snoring during pregnancy. Among these, 85% were non-snorers before 
      pregnancy. Daytime somnolence concerned 84,5% of the population with an Epworth
      score significatively increased (P<0,0001). The prevalence of PIH was found to be
      4,5%, with two apparently independent risk factors: the body mass index (OR=1,1) 
      and an association between snoring and increased vigilance trouble (OR=2,6). No
      statistical difference was found concerning IGR. CONCLUSIONS: SAS symptoms are
      frequent during pregnancy and snoring appears to be linked with PIH. However,
      polysomnographic data are not yet sufficient to explain pathophysiological
      mechanisms and find relevant diagnostic markers during pregnancy.

TI  - Organic anion and cation transporter expression and function during embryonic
      kidney development and in organ culture models.
PG  - 837-45
AB  - Organic anion and cation transporters (OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs) mediate the
      proximal tubular secretion of numerous clinically important compounds, including 
      various commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. Here, we report determination of the
      ontogeny of these transporters and of NaP(i)2 and SGLT1, using quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to determine expression levels of transporter
      genes in rat embryonic kidneys on each day of gestation from embryonic day (ed)
      13 to ed18, in cultures of induced and uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (MM), and
      on each day of 1 week of whole embryonic kidney (WEK) culture. We also examined
      ontogeny of Oat1 protein expression in rat embryonic kidney by
      immunohistochemistry. Finally, we used uptake of fluorescein (FL) as a novel in
      vitro functional assay of OAT expression in WEK and MM. Developmental induction
      of OAT and OCT genes does not occur uniformly: some genes are induced early
      (e.g., Oat1 and Oat3, potential early markers of proximal tubulogenesis), and
      others after kidney development is relatively advanced (e.g., Oct1, a potential
      marker of terminal differentiation). The ontogeny of transporter genes in WEK and
      MM is similar to that observed in vivo, indicating that these organ culture
      systems may represent convenient in vitro models to study the developmental
      induction of OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs. Functional transport was evidenced by
      accumulation of FL in the developing tubule in WEK and MM organ cultures. Our
      findings on the renal ontogeny of OATs and OCTs could carry implications both for
      the development of more rational therapeutics for premature infants, as well as
      for our understanding of proximal tubule differentiation.

TI  - Sleep Architecture in Infants of Substance-Abusing Mothers.
PG  - 141-151
LID - 10.1002/imhj.20085 [doi]
AB  - This longitudinal, year-long study compared sleep-wake state organization in two 
      groups of infants-infants whose mothers abused substances during their
      pregnancies and nonexposed, typically developing, age-matched comparison
      infants-to determine whether differences in sleep-wake state organization existed
      between the two groups. Seventeen infants of mothers who were participating in a 
      parent-infant residential treatment program for substance abuse were enrolled.
      Their sleep-wake state organization over the first year of life was compared to
      that of 17 age-matched comparison infants. The intent was to follow each infant
      on five occasions over the first year of life using established methods of
      time-lapse videosomnography to record sleep-wake state organization; however,
      attrition in the substance-abusing group was problematic. Some sleep-wake
      variables (i.e., Active Sleep%, Quiet Sleep%, Awake%, number of nighttime
      awakenings) were similar for both groups of infants at comparable ages across the
      first year. Total sleep time and the longest sustained sleep period (sleep
      continuity variables) differed significantly at some of the ages measured.
      Although overall sleep architecture appears highly resilient and well organized, 
      some indications of sleep fragmentation and shortened nighttime sleep periods
      were observed in the substance-exposed infants. More research is needed to
      explain why sleep-continuity variables and not sleep-state proportion variables
      differed between the two groups.

TI  - Brain deficits associated with fetal alcohol exposure may be protected, in part, 
      by peptides derived from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor and
      activity-dependent neuroprotective protein.
PG  - 107-18
AB  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing 
      brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent
      neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) 
      in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the
      growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through
      cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced
      the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin
      (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline
      development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure
      during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as
      well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural
      tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be
      induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed
      during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have
      identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain
      formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA),
      ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown
      neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated
      with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of
      alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential
      inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides.

TI  - Prospective identification of pregnant women drinking four or more standard
      drinks (> or = 48 g) of alcohol per day.
PG  - 183-97
AB  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of
      pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more
      alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying
      self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health
      professionals at the Maipu Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood
      of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic
      between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined
      criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We
      interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial
      interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption,
      and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per
      day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on
      average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit
      questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 
      women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who
      were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day 
      drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p =
      0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age
      (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or
      appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or
      having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In
      conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during
      pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile,
      clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus
      (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help
      screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women.

TI  - Severity of sleep-disordered breathing improves following parturition.
PG  - 737-41
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late
      pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number
      of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late
      pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare
      the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure
      responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state. DESIGN: Case-controlled, 
      longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and
      postpartum. STUDY PATIENTS: Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered
      breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: None.
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic 
      blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months
      following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea
      hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were
      compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both
      apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred
      consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean
      apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 +/- 15 per hour antenatally to 18 +/- 4 
      per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 +/- 11
      per hour to 22 +/- 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin
      saturation was increased from 86% +/- 2% antenatally to 91% +/- 1% postnatally (P
      = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg
      antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally. CONCLUSION: 
      This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased
      severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

TI  - Postnatal depressive symptoms among Pacific mothers in Auckland: prevalence and
      risk factors.
PG  - 230-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postnatal depressive 
      symptoms in a cohort of mothers of Pacific Island infants in Auckland, New
      Zealand. METHOD: The data were gathered as part of the Pacific Island Families
      Study, in which 1376 mothers were interviewed when their babies were 6 weeks old.
      The interview included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: 
      16.4% of mothers were assessed as probably experiencing depression. Prevalence
      rates varied from 7.6% for Samoans to 30.9% for Tongans. In addition to
      ethnicity, risk factors identified by stepwise multiple logistic regression
      included low Pacific Island acculturation, first birth, stress due to
      insufficient food, household income less than dollar 40,000, difficulty with
      transport, dissatisfaction with pregnancy, birth experience, baby's sleep
      patterns, partner relationship and home. A large prevalence difference between
      Tongans and other groups remained when the effects of other risk factors were
      controlled statistically. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms
      among Pacific mothers is at the upper end of the range typically reported. Focus 
      on the overall rate, however, obscures substantial variation between groups. Risk
      factors are generally similar to those identified in previous research.
      IMPLICATIONS: The findings have implications for prevention and treatment and
      caution against assuming homogeneity within ethnic categories. Further research
      is required to explain differences in prevalence between Tongan and other Pacific
      Island groups.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke affects the physiology of pedunculopontine
      nucleus (PPN) neurons in development.
PG  - 210-9
AB  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal,
      attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN),
      as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to
      modulate arousal, waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep decreases 
      between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, especially at 12-21 days. Pregnant
      dams were exposed to 350 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, 3 times per day, from 
      day E14 until birth, and the pups allowed to mature. Intracellularly recorded PPN
      neurons in 12-21 day rat brainstem slices were tested for intrinsic membrane
      properties, including the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih, which is
      known to drive oscillatory activity. Type II (A-current) PPN cells from 12-16 day
      old offspring of treated animals had a 1/2max Ih amplitude of (mean +/- SE) 4.1
      +/- 0.9 mV, while 17-21 day cells had a higher 1/2max Ih of 9.9 +/- 1.1 mV (p <
      0.0001). Cells from 12-16 day old control brainstems had a 1/2max Ih of 1.3 +/-
      0.1 mV, which was lower (p < 0.05) than in cells from prenatally treated
      offspring; while 17-21 day old cells from controls had a 1/2max Ih of 3.3 +/- 0.3
      mV, which was also lower (p < 0.01) than in cells from prenatally treated
      offspring. In addition, changes in resting membrane potential [control -65. +/-
      0.9 mV (n=32); exposed -55.0 +/- 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], and action
      potential (AP) threshold [control -56.5 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 32), exposed -47.0 +/-
      1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], suggest that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke 
      induced marked changes in cells in the cholinergic arm of the RAS, rendering them
      more excitable. Such data could partially explain the differences seen in
      individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their
      hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and
      cognitive/behavioral disorders.

TI  - A mathematical model for the mating-induced prolactin rhythm of female rats.
PG  - E573-82
AB  - For the first 10 days of pregnancy and the first 12 days of pseudopregnancy, the 
      secretion of prolactin (PRL) from pituitary lactotrophs is rhythmic, with two
      surges/day. This rhythm can also be triggered by bolus injection of oxytocin
      (OT). We describe a mathematical model for the initiation, maintenance, and
      termination of the OT-induced PRL rhythm. In our model, the mechanism for this
      circadian rhythm is mutual interaction between lactotrophs and neuroendocrine
      dopamine (DA) neurons. This rhythm is, under normal lighting conditions,
      entrained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but persists in the absence of
      input from the SCN. We postulate that OT injection triggers the rhythm by
      activating a population of bistable hypothalamic neurons that innervate and
      inhibit DA neurons. The bistable nature of these neurons allows them to act as a 
      memory device, maintaining the rhythm long after OT has been cleared from the
      blood. The mechanism for this memory device and the arguments supporting it are
      detailed with computer simulations. Finally, we consider potential targets for a 
      rhythm-terminating factor and make predictions that may be used to determine
      which mechanism is operational in terminating the OT- or mating-induced PRL
      rhythm.

PG  - 129-44
AB  - This review summarizes studies of sleep and other biological rhythms during the
      menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the postpartum period, focusing, where feasible,
      on studies in women who met DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental 
      Disorders, 4th edition) criteria for a depressive disorder compared with healthy 
      controls. The aim was to review supporting evidence for the hypothesis that
      disruption of the normal temporal relationship between sleep and other biological
      rhythms such as melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol, thyroid stimulating
      hormone (TSH) or prolactin occurring during times of reproductive hormonal change
      precipitates depressive disorders in predisposed women. Treatment strategies,
      designed to correct these altered phase (timing) or amplitude abnormalities,
      thereby improve mood. Although there may be some common features to premenstrual,
      pregnancy and postpartum depressive disorders (e.g. elevated prolactin levels), a
      specific profile of sleep and biological rhythms distinguishes healthy from
      depressed women during each reproductive epoch. Further work is needed to
      characterize more fully the particular abnormalities associated with each
      reproductive state to identify common versus distinctive features for each
      diagnostic group. This information could serve as the basis for developing more
      targeted treatment strategies.

PG  - 105-6
AB  - Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses.
      Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has 
      not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824
      women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed
      that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances
      following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most
      pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not
      significant after the third year.

TI  - Pre-eclampsia is associated with sleep-disordered breathing and endothelial
      dysfunction.
PG  - 328-33
AB  - Pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) may be associated with both endothelial dysfunction 
      (ED) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). It was hypothesised that females with 
      PET would demonstrate both SDB and ED, and that a correlation between these two
      would suggest a potential causative association. A total of 17 females with PET
      and 25 matched females with uncomplicated pregnancy were studied. They underwent 
      a nocturnal ambulatory sleep study (using Watch_PAT100) and noninvasive
      evaluation of endothelial function utilising the reactive hyperaemia test (using 
      Endo_PAT 2000). A higher ratio of post- to pre-occlusion pulse-wave amplitude
      (endothelial function index (EFI)) indicated better endothelial function. Females
      with PET had a significantly higher respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and lower
      EFI than controls (18.4+/-8.4 versus 8.3+/-1.3.h(-1), and 1.5+/-0.1 versus
      1.8+/-0.1, respectively). Blood pressure significantly correlated with RDI and
      with EFI. EFI tended to correlate with RDI. In conclusion, these results suggest 
      that both sleep-disordered breathing and endothelial dysfunction are more likely 
      to occur in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia than in females with
      uncomplicated pregnancies. The current authors speculate that respiratory
      disturbances contribute to the functional abnormality of the blood vessels seen
      in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia, although causality cannot be determined
      based on this study.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing and upper airway size in pregnancy and post-partum.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing and snoring are common in pregnancy. The aim of this
      study was to determine whether pregnancy was associated with upper airway
      narrowing. One-hundred females in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited
      and 50 agreed to be restudied 3 months after delivery. One-hundred nonpregnant
      females were also recruited. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic
      reflection. Snoring was less common in nonpregnant (17%) than pregnant females
      (41%; odds ratio (OR) 3.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-6.74) and returned 
      to nonpregnant levels after delivery (18%; OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40). Pregnant
      females had significantly smaller upper airways than nonpregnant females at the
      oropharyngeal junction when seated (mean difference 0.12; 95% CI 0.008-0.25), and
      smaller mean pharyngeal areas in the seated (mean difference 0.14; 95% CI
      0.001-0.28), supine (mean difference 0.11; 95% CI 0.01-0.22) and lateral postures
      (mean difference 0.13; 95% CI 0.02-0.24) compared with the nonpregnant females.
      Pregnant females had smaller mean pharyngeal areas compared with post-partum in
      the seated (mean difference 0.18; 95% CI 0.02-0.32), supine (mean difference
      0.20; 95% CI 0.06-0.35) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.26; 95% CI
      0.12-0.39). In conclusion, this study confirmed increased snoring and showed
      narrower upper airways during the third trimester of pregnancy.

TI  - Major epidemiological changes in sudden infant death syndrome: a 20-year
      population-based study in the UK.
PG  - 314-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the 
      epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK
      Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their
      back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to
      assess these potential changes. METHODS: Population-based data from home visits
      have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69
      explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993
      and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have
      been used for comparison. FINDINGS: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of
      children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 
      12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed
      has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the
      Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone-rather than 
      because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an
      increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a
      sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic
      backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal
      smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of
      pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from
      large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants 
      who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer
      are breastfed. INTERPRETATION: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in
      their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in
      deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we
      strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths
      now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and
      plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families,
      and particularly, infant sleep environments.

TI  - Developing circadian rhythmicity in infants.
PG  - 38-45
AB  - Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of
      about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian
      timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a
      circadian clock, are present by mid-gestation in human and non-human primates.
      Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is
      responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can 
      regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of
      the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone
      secretion generally developing after two months of age. With the continued
      elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology
      and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will
      become an increasingly important component of neonatal care.

TI  - Biological rhythm disturbances in mood disorders.
PG  - S11-5
AB  - From earliest times, psychiatrists have described biological rhythm disturbances 
      as characteristic of mood disorders. The present flourishing of circadian biology
      has revealed the molecular basis of 24-h rhythmicity driven by 'clock' genes, as 
      well as the importance of zeitgebers (synchronisers). Winter depression was first
      modelled on regulation of animal behaviour by seasonal changes in daylength, and 
      led to application of light as the first successful chronobiological treatment in
      psychiatry. Light therapy has great promise for many other disorders (e.g.
      sleep-wake cycle disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia, bulimia, premenstrual
      disorder, depression during pregnancy) and, importantly, as an adjuvant to
      antidepressant medication in major non-seasonal depression. The pineal hormone
      melatonin is also a zeitgeber for the human circadian system, in addition to
      possessing direct sleep-promoting effects. Chronobiology has provided efficacious
      non-pharmaceutical treatments for mood disorders (such as sleep deprivation or
      light therapy) as well as novel approaches to new drugs (e.g. agomelatine).

TI  - From biological rhythms to social rhythms: Physiological precursors of
      mother-infant synchrony.
PG  - 175-88
AB  - Links between neonatal biological rhythms and the emergence of interaction
      rhythms were examined in 3 groups (N = 71): high-risk preterms (HR; birth weight 
      <1,000 g), low-risk preterms (LR; birth weight =1,700-1,850 g), and full-term
      (FT) infants. Once a week for premature infants and on the 2nd day for FT
      infants, sleep-wake cyclicity was extracted from 4-hr observations and cardiac
      vagal tone was measured. At term age, infant orientation was tested with the
      Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. At 3 months, arousal modulation and emotion
      regulation were assessed, and mother-infant synchrony was computed from
      microanalysis of face-to-face interactions using time-series analysis. Sleep-wake
      amplitudes showed a developmental leap at 31 weeks gestation, followed by a shift
      in vagal tone at 34 weeks gestation. At term, differences among FT, LR, and HR
      infants were observed for biological rhythms in a linear-decline pattern.
      Sleep-wake cyclicity, vagal tone, newborn orientation, and arousal modulation
      were each uniquely predictive of mother-infant synchrony. The organization of
      physiological oscillators appears to lay the foundation for the infant's capacity
      to partake in a temporally matched social dialogue.

TI  - Development of MEG sleep patterns and magnetic auditory evoked responses during
      early infancy.
PG  - 522-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To follow the development of MEG sleep patterns and auditory evoked
      responses (AERs) during the first six months of life. METHODS: The subjects were 
      18 neonates, born at conceptional age (CA) 36-42 weeks, following uncomplicated
      pregnancies. During each session, several 10-min MEG recordings were acquired in 
      the presence of auditory stimulation. The recordings were classified into three
      distinct MEG patterns-low amplitude irregular; high-amplitude slow; and
      mixed-based largely on MEG amplitude and frequency. Averaged AERs were computed
      for the entire recording and for each MEG pattern within the recording. The
      results were based on analysis of 61 recording sessions of the 10 subjects who
      yielded three or more sessions of usable data. RESULTS: Developmental changes in 
      the MEG sleep patterns were most pronounced at the earliest ages. By CA 48 weeks 
      the patterns had progressed to a more mature form, characterized by the
      prevalence of delta wave sleep, absence of discontinuity, and development of
      spindling and higher amplitude delta rhythms. In contrast to the MEG patterns,
      the AERs did not change markedly during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) and
      showed a simple morphology, consisting of a prominent deflection at 250 ms
      (P250m) and a more diffuse one at around 750 ms (N750m). During the period CA
      48-54 weeks, however, a relatively abrupt transition occurred to a more complex
      morphology, characterized by a double peak with peak latencies 150ms (P150m) and 
      350 ms (P350m). Beyond this period the AERs continued to evolve, showing biphasic
      complexes and the emergence of late components arising from outside the auditory 
      cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Over the age range of this study the MEG sleep patterns and 
      AER developed in succession, rather than concurrently; i.e. development of the
      sleep patterns was most rapid during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) while
      major development of the AERs commenced after this time. SIGNIFICANCE: This
      finding suggests that the brain must achieve a certain level of overall maturity,
      reflected in the character of the MEG sleep patterns at CA 48 weeks, before the
      cortex enters a phase of significant functional development, reflected in the
      more rapid evolution of the AER after CA 48 weeks. The results of this study
      affirm the efficacy of MEG for spatiotemporal characterization of neonatal brain 
      activity.

TI  - Changes in symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy.
PG  - 1299-305
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although incident snoring is common in pregnant women and has been
      proposed as a potential risk factor for adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, the
      development of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy has not been
      prospectively described. METHODS: Using the Apnea Symptom Score from the
      Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, we
      prospectively assessed symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime
      somnolence in 155 women to determine whether symptoms increased during pregnancy 
      and the characteristics associated with increasing symptoms. RESULTS: We found
      that sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (Apnea Symptom Score, 0.44 (SEM 0.58) vs
      0.95 (0.09, P < .001) and the degree of daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale, 8.6 (0.3) vs 10.2 (0.4), P = .0003) increased significantly during
      pregnancy. Women with higher baseline body mass indexes and greater increases in 
      neck circumference during pregnancy reported higher apnea symptom scores. Of the 
      155 subjects, 11.4% reported an increase in Apnea Symptom Score of 2 units or
      more, consistent with a clinically significant increase in symptoms; these women 
      experienced a significantly greater increase in subjective sleepiness than other 
      subjects (P = .03). Excessive daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) 
      was prevalent throughout pregnancy (31.0%-45.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      demonstrate that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing increase during pregnancy
      and that more than 10% of our subjects may be at risk for developing sleep apnea 
      during pregnancy. Excessive daytime somnolence was highly prevalent even early in
      pregnancy and became increasingly common as pregnancy progressed.

TI  - Case-control study of sudden infant death syndrome in Lithuania, 1997-2000.
PG  - 41
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome relevant in
      Lithuania. METHODS: A nationwide case-control study surveying parents of 35
      infants who died from sudden infant death syndrome during the period of 1997-2000
      and parents of 145 control infants matched with SIDS infants for date of birth
      and for region of birth was carried out. RESULTS: Deaths incidence was greater in
      the warm period (60%) vs. cold period (40%). Prone and side sleeping positions
      both carried no increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome compared with
      supine because of a rare prone sleeping (4.1% of controls vs. 0% of dead infants)
      and more prevalent side than supine sleeping (84.8% of controls vs. 94.3% of dead
      infants) in the controls as well as the cases. Bed sharing for the whole night as
      a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome has not been confirmed, either, as
      bed sharing was common only for the controls (13.8% of controls vs. 0% of dead
      infants). Routine sleeping environment factors such as heavy wrapping (> or =4
      togs) of an infant (odds ratio 8.49; 95% confidence interval 2.38 to 30.32),
      sleeping in a bassinet (4.22; 1.16 to 15.38) and maternal factors such as
      maternal education < or =12 years (4.48; 1.34 to 14.94), unplanned pregnancy
      (5.22; 1.49 to 18.18) and > or =2 previous live births (3.90; 1.00 to 15.10) were
      significantly associated with sudden infant death syndrome on multivariate
      analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this first population-based case-control
      study have shed some light on the epidemiology of the syndrome in Lithuania.
      Although the mortality of sudden infant death syndrome in Lithuania is not high, 
      it might be lowered moreover by public informing about sudden infant death
      syndrome and related risk factors. Special attention must be paid to mothers with
      low education on potentially modifiable risk factors such as routine heavy
      wrapping of an infant during sleep, routine sleeping in a bassinet and unplanned 
      pregnancy.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of maternal blood pressure and fetal growth.
PG  - S86-91
AB  - This study aimed at examining any relation between the circadian variation in
      blood pressure (BP) in human pregnancy and fetal growth. A prospective study
      included 52 pregnant women monitored during the third trimester of pregnancy.
      There were 33 uncomplicated pregnancies with normal fetal growth (Group 1) and 19
      pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), confirmed at
      birth (Group 2). Ten women (five in each group) had pregnancy-induced
      hypertension. All women were hospitalized and followed a similar daily routine.
      BP was recorded with an automatic wearable device. Measurements were obtained
      every 20 min for 24 +/- 1 h. BP profiles were analyzed by conventional
      statistical methods and by cosinor, involving the least squares fit of cosine
      curves with an anticipated period (24 h) to the data. BP parameters, fetal
      outcome, demographic and obstetric characteristics were compared between the two 
      groups. Logistic regression and multivariate analyses were used to assess factors
      putatively associated with fetal outcome. The circadian amplitude of diastolic BP
      was found to be larger in normotensive women with IUGR. As gauged by odds ratios 
      (OR), the circadian amplitude of diastolic BP (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8; P =
      0.03) and hematocrit (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9; P = 0.04) were the only
      variables positively and independently associated with IUGR. In the presence of
      maternal hypertension, the circadian amplitude of systolic BP was negatively
      associated with IUGR (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0; P = 0.03). A larger circadian
      variation in diastolic BP, rather than a difference in the mean value of systolic
      or diastolic BP, was found to be statistically significantly associated with
      IUGR. This study adds another condition in which the circadian BP amplitude
      constitutes a harbinger of elevated risk, apart from an association with a
      shortened lifespan in the absence or presence of malignant hypertension and with 
      an increased risk of stroke and nephropathy reported earlier.

TI  - The importance of 'awareness' for understanding fetal pain.
PG  - 455-71
AB  - Our understanding of when the fetus can experience pain has been largely shaped
      by neuroanatomy. However, completion of the cortical nociceptive connections just
      after mid-gestation is only one part of the story. In addition to critically
      reviewing evidence for whether the fetus is ever awake or aware, and thus able to
      truly experience pain, we examine the role of endogenous neuro-inhibitors, such
      as adenosine and pregnanolone, produced within the feto-placental unit that
      contribute to fetal sleep states, and thus mediate suppression of fetal
      awareness. The uncritical view that the nature of presumed fetal pain perception 
      can be assessed by reference to the prematurely born infant is challenged.
      Rigorously controlled studies of invasive procedures and analgesia in the fetus
      are required to clarify the impact of fetal nociception on postnatal pain
      sensitivity and neural development, and the potential benefits or harm of using
      analgesia in this unique setting.

TI  - [Domestic violence against women during pregnancy].
PG  - 785-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) against women
      during pregnancy and to identify risk factors for DV and effects on women's
      mental health. METHODS: Pregnant women from an OB-GYN outpatient clinic at a
      hospital in an urban area were recruited consecutively from February to May 2003.
      Women who agreed to participate in the research answered three self-administered 
      questionnaires: the GHQ30, the Rosenberg Self Esteem, and one for demographic
      characteristics at 14 gestational weeks. In order to determine DV prevalence rate
      during pregnancy, the Japanese version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) for
      measuring severity of DV was provided to those women over 35 gestational weeks.
      RESULTS: Two hundred seventy nine women answered all questionnaires. 15 of the
      279 respondents (5.4%) were DV positive during pregnancy based on the Japanese
      version of the ISA. Nine had experienced physical violence, and twelve had
      non-physical violence Compared with women who had not experienced DV during
      pregnancy, DV positive pregnant women were more likely to be multipara (OR = 3.9)
      and to have experienced physical violence in the past from a different partner
      (OR = 9.1). Moreover, general illness (OR = 3.8), sleep disturbance (OR = 5.8),
      anxiety (OR = 6.3), depression (OR = 11.5) and low self-esteem (P = 0.02) were
      identified as effects of DV on women's mental health. CONCLUSION: Some 5.4% of
      women in Japan, approximately 1 in every 20, may experience DV during pregnancy. 
      This is associated with parity and a past history of DV as demographic
      characteristics, and has an adverse impact on mental health, especially
      depression. Development of a support system for screening, intervention and
      referral for DV sufferers is urgently needed.

TI  - Fluoxetine during pregnancy: impact on fetal development.
PG  - 641-50
AB  - Women are at greatest risk of suffering from depression during the childbearing
      years and thus may either become pregnant while taking an antidepressant or may
      require a prescription for one during pregnancy. The antidepressant fluoxetine
      (FX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which increases
      serotonin neurotransmission. Serotonin is involved in the regulation of a variety
      of physiological systems, including the sleep-wake cycle, circadian rhythms and
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Each of these systems also plays an
      important role in fetal development. Compared with other antidepressant drugs,
      the SSRIs, such as FX, have fewer side effects. Because of this, they are now
      frequently prescribed, especially during pregnancy. Clinical studies suggest poor
      neonatal outcome after exposure to FX in utero. Recent studies in the sheep fetus
      describe the physiological effects of in utero exposure to FX with an 8 day
      infusion during late gestation in the sheep. This is a useful model for
      determining the effects of FX on fetal physiology. The fetus can be studied for
      weeks in its normal intrauterine environment with serial sampling of blood, thus 
      permitting detailed studies of drug disposition in both mother and fetus combined
      with monitoring of fetal behavioural state and cardiovascular function.
      Fluoxetine causes an acute increase in plasma serotonin levels, leading to a
      transient reduction in uterine blood flow. This, in turn, reduces the delivery of
      oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, thereby presenting a mechanism for reducing
      growth and/or eliciting preterm delivery. Moreover, because FX crosses the
      placenta, the fetus is exposed directly to FX, as well as to the effects of the
      drug on the mother. Fluoxetine increases high-voltage/non-rapid eye movement
      behavioural state in the fetus after both acute and chronic exposure and, thus,
      may interfere with normal fetal neurodevelopment. Fluoxetine also alters
      hypothalamic function in the adult and increases the magnitude of the prepartum
      rise in fetal cortisol concentrations in sheep. Fetal FX exposure does not alter 
      fetal circadian rhythms in melatonin or prolactin. Studies of the effects of FX
      exposure on fetal development in the sheep are important in defining possible
      physiological mechanisms that explain human clinical studies of birth outcomes
      after FX exposure. To date, there have been insufficient longer-term follow-up
      studies in any precocial species of offspring exposed to SSRIs in utero. Thus,
      further investigation of the long-term consequences of in utero exposure to FX
      and other SSRIs, as well as the mechanisms involved, are required for a complete 
      understanding of the impact of these agents on development. This should involve
      studies in both humans and appropriate animal models.

TI  - Circadian clock and cell cycle gene expression in mouse mammary epithelial cells 
      and in the developing mouse mammary gland.
PG  - 263-71
AB  - Mouse mammary epithelial cells (HC-11) and mammary tissues were analyzed for
      developmental changes in circadian clock, cellular proliferation, and
      differentiation marker genes. Expression of the clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 were
      elevated in differentiated HC-11 cells, whereas Per2 mRNA levels were higher in
      undifferentiated cells. This differentiation-dependent profile of clock gene
      expression was consistent with that observed in mouse mammary glands, as Per1 and
      Bmal1 mRNA levels were elevated in late pregnant and lactating mammary tissues,
      whereas Per2 expression was higher in proliferating virgin and early pregnant
      glands. In both HC-11 cells and mammary glands, elevated Per2 expression was
      positively correlated with c-Myc and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels, whereas Per1 and
      Bmal1 expression changed in conjunction with beta-casein mRNA levels.
      Interestingly, developmental stage had differential effects on rhythms of clock
      gene expression in the mammary gland. These data suggest that circadian clock
      genes may play a role in mouse mammary gland development and differentiation.

TI  - Relation of smoking and drinking to sleep disturbance among Japanese pregnant
      women.
PG  - 877-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated
      by smoking and/or drinking. We investigate here the joint effect of smoking and
      drinking with respect to sleep disturbance during pregnancy. METHODS: Survey of
      about 16,000 pregnant women in Japan, conducted in 2002 using a self-administered
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Both smoking and drinking increased the odds of sleep
      disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating or 
      maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, short sleep duration, excessive
      daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome. The joint odds ratios for smoking 
      and drinking corresponded more or less to the products of the odds ratio for
      smoking or drinking. CONCLUSION: Smoking and drinking are independently
      associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy, in addition to
      their other well-known side-effects.

TI  - An 8 year study of risk factors for SIDS: bed-sharing versus non-bed-sharing.
PG  - 318-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear if it is safe for babies to bed share with adults. In
      Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is
      bed-sharing with an adult. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing
      during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. DESIGN:
      An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and
      831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 
      95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression.
      RESULTS: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants
      with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if 
      the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was > or =10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34).
      The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for
      infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age 
      of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks,
      respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, 
      p<0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping
      environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value 
      of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is
      augmented further by bed-sharing. These factors should be taken into account when
      considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.

TI  - Does sympathetic activity contribute to growth of preterm infants?
PG  - 205-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence on faster growth in preterm infants with higher
      heart rate as opposed to the classical approach calls for further research. AIMS:
      to test whether (1) high or low heart rate and (2) heart rate during the first
      days of life predict greater weight gain in preterm infants. METHODS: A
      retrospective study analyzing two daily measures of heart rate obtained during
      restful sleep, total daily calorie intake and daily weight gain measured always
      in the morning before meal were collected from the medical files. RESULTS:
      Analysis of 90 healthy preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks of gestation revealed 
      that increased mean heart rate during hospitalization predicted greater weight
      gain even when controlling for calorie intake, birth weight, gestational age,
      appropriateness of birth weight for gestational age, and length of
      hospitalization. Mean heart rate during the first three days of life yielded the 
      same pattern of results. Post-hoc analysis of variance between infants with mean 
      daily heart rate </=139 bpm vs. >/=140 bpm showed that infants with higher heart 
      rate achieved a significantly higher weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested
      that, contrary to adults, in neonates an anabolic activity is represented by
      increased sympathetic functioning within the normal range. The implications of a 
      slower growth rate for additional developmental care and individual
      considerations of appropriate stimulation in preterm infants are discussed.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in postpartum depressed women.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association
      between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and
      mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL.
      Seventy-eight women scoring > or =10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
      completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item
      short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women
      underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to
      Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored
      significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and
      mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to 
      worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a
      significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of
      depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for
      severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean
      delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted
      poorer mental health status.

TI  - Sleep disturbances in Chinese pregnant women.
PG  - 1568-71
AB  - In a prospective study of 247 pregnant Chinese women, the prevalence of sleep
      disturbances across pregnancy has been assessed using a set of validated
      questionnaires including the Sleep and Health Questionnaire (SHQ) and the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The frequency of self-reported snoring increased from
      29.7% in the first trimester to 40.5% and 46.2% in the second and third
      trimesters, respectively, with an increase in the prevalence of moderate or
      severe snoring from 1% in the first trimester to 7.2% in the third trimester (P <
      0.01). There was a higher frequency of moderate to severe snoring intensity among
      subjects with BMI >or=25 compared with those with BMI <25 kg/m(2) in the third
      trimester (20.8%vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Subjective sleepiness, as determined by the
      ESS, increased significantly from 8.6 to 9.4 and 9.6 in the first, second and
      third trimesters, respectively.

TI  - Developmental and reproductive performance in circadian mutant mice.
PG  - 68-79
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genes underlying circadian rhythm generation are expressed in many
      tissues. We explore a role for circadian rhythms in the timing and efficacy of
      mouse reproduction and development using a genetic approach. METHODS: We compare 
      fecundity in Clock(Delta19) mutant mice (a dominant-negative protein essential
      for circadian rhythm activity) and in Vipr2-/- null mutant mice (affecting the
      generation and output of the circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic
      nucleus) with wild type (WT) litter mates under both a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle
      and continuous darkness. RESULTS: Uteri from Clock(Delta19) mice show no
      circadian rhythm and Vipr2-/- mice show a phase-advanced rhythm compared to WT
      uteri. In neither mutant line were homozygous or heterozygous fetuses lethal.
      Sexually mature adults of both mutant lines showed mildly reduced male in vivo
      (but not in vitro) fertility and irregular estrous cycles exacerbated by
      continuous darkness. However, pregnancy rates and neonatal litter sizes were not 
      affected. The Clock(Delta19) mutant line was distinguishable from the Vipr2-/-
      null mutant line in showing more peri-natal delivery problems and very poor
      survival of offspring to weaning. CONCLUSIONS: A fully functional central and
      peripheral circadian clock is not essential for reproduction and development to
      term, but has critical roles peri-natally and post-partum.

TI  - Bedsharing and maternal smoking in a population-based survey of new mothers.
PG  - e530-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of
      postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have 
      been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that
      bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence
      for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among
      young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific
      evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some
      states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare
      with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they
      caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this
      study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing
      among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to
      nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare.
      METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified 
      random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth.
      Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and
      non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women
      with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for
      stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population.
      In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The
      median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked
      whether they shared a bed with their infant "always," "almost always,"
      "sometimes," or "never." Frequent bedsharing was defined as "always" or "almost
      always"; infrequent was defined as "sometimes" or "never." RESULTS: Of all new
      mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always:
      14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among 
      postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1%
      sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among
      nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by
      race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any
      racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression,
      there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either 
      prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted
      odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI:
      0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US
      population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and 
      nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in
      Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes
      bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing
      for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group.
      Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency
      of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study
      has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth
      certificates, weighted for nonresponse. CONCLUSIONS: Although a number of case
      series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even
      among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled 
      studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship
      between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by
      maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control
      studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while
      asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds
      ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking
      mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the
      preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase
      the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a
      cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal
      experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death "suffocation" or
      "overlay asphyxiation" simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of
      death. This "diagnostic drift" may greatly complicate future studies of the
      relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there
      is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but
      increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking
      mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months
      old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib
      when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their
      previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age 
      and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified 
      as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death,
      analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other
      issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift.
      Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does 
      not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their 
      infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking
      mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older
      infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific
      information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not 
      elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being
      disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by
      smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both,
      bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly
      discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking
      mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing
      bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to
      inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that
      putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be
      delayed until 3 months of age.

TI  - Methylmercury exposure in Wisconsin: A case study series.
PG  - 113-22
AB  - Many popular varieties of commercially sold fish, including tilefish, seabass,
      shark, and swordfish, contain enough mercury so that eating them once or twice a 
      month can lead to high mercury body burdens. Wisconsin has issued mercury-based
      sport-fish consumption advice to people of all ages since 1985. Wisconsin's
      advisory was revised in 2000 to address all inland waters and again in 2004 to
      integrate information about sport-caught fish with advice for commercially sold
      fish. Because of the increased popularity of fish as a source of dietary protein,
      a significant percentage of the US population may be at risk of
      methylmercury-induced health problems. Although several studies have assessed
      mercury exposure among children and women of child-bearing age, very little is
      known about mercury body burdens among men or postmenopausal women. This article 
      describes fish consumption and mercury exposure among 14 people who consumed fish
      twice a week or more and 1 person who ate no fish. Steady-state blood mercury
      levels available for 10 adults and 1 child ranged from <5 to 58 microg/L and
      correlated well with dietary mercury intake estimates. Three of these individuals
      reported vague, subclinical symptoms such as mental confusion, sleep difficulty, 
      balance problems, or visual disturbances, which improved after their mercury
      levels returned to normal.

TI  - Modifiable risk factors for SIDS in Germany: results of GeSID.
PG  - 655-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been falling
      in Germany over the last decade. However, little is known about the prevalence
      and the importance of well-known risk factors in Germany since a local prevention
      campaign in 1992. DESIGN: A 3-y, population-based, case-control study was
      conducted in half of Germany, consisting of 333 cases. All sudden and unexpected 
      deaths in infancy, if they fitted the inclusion criteria, were included in the
      study. Parental interview was carried out soon after the death, and three living 
      control infants, matched for age, gender, region and sleep time, were recruited. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of placing infants prone to sleep was only 4% in the
      control group, but this was associated with a markedly increased risk of SIDS
      (adjusted odds ration, aOR=6.08). Other modifiable risk factors for SIDS were:
      maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding for less than 2 wk (aOR=1.71)
      and co-sleeping (aOR=2.71), while using a pacifier during the last sleep reduced 
      the risk (aOR=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Previously recognized risk factors for SIDS
      also occur in Germany. Despite knowledge about the major modifiable risk factors 
      for SIDS, these factors are still present in Germany. To reduce the incidence of 
      SIDS in Germany, a continued effort is needed to inform all parents about
      preventable risk factors for SIDS.

      for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report
      exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement
      provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's
      sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for
      relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed
      in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 years. The women
      wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28
      weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring,
      the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The
      pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r =
      49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a
      comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant
      differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day.

TI  - Psychological distress and milk volume in lactating mothers.
PG  - 676-93; discussion 694-700
AB  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as 
      measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in
      lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and(b) to
      determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model
      predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience
      sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant (31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term
      infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards-Campbell
      Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep
      difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for
      mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress,
      sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not
      related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had
      no apparent effect on lactation.

TI  - [Lingual thyroid--case report: a woman with a tumor at the base of the tongue].
PG  - 661-3
AB  - We report a case of lingual thyroid. A woman presented with a few years history
      of mild dysphagia, cough and uncomfortable breathing when going to sleep at
      night. Laryngostroboscopy showed a mass lesion at the base of the tongue. A CT
      scan and thyroid scanning revealed a bilobar mass of thyroid tissue, compatible
      with a lingual thyroid. No thyroid gland was found at its usual location. The
      woman was euthyroid and since her symptoms were mild she was treated with
      thyroxin and observation. Lingual thyroid is a rare phenomenon caused by abnormal
      migration of thyroid cells during the first weeks of fetal life. Females are
      affected more often than males and although this condition is often asymptomatic,
      symptoms can occur, most often during puberty, pregnancy and menopause. On
      examination a mass is noted at the base of the tongue and the diagnosis is then
      confirmed with CT/MRI and thyroid scanning. Treatment can vary from observation
      to thyroxin medication, radioactive iodine and complicated surgical intervention,
      depending on the symptoms and the overall health of the patient.

TI  - Infant sleep and feeding pattern: effects on maternal sleep.
PG  - 399-404
AB  - Factors contributing to maternal sleep when infants are 4 to 10 weeks of age were
      examined. Twenty-four-hour sleep-wake diaries collected from 37 mother-infant
      dyads in the home environment were summarized to describe total, longest, and
      mean sleep period; synchrony of maternal and infant sleep; and feeding frequency 
      and duration. Regression and post hoc analysis of variance were used to examine
      factors contributing to maternal and infant sleep. Maternal sleep is driven by
      infant sleep and feeding pattern. The minimum and maximum numbers of infant sleep
      episodes per day were 6 and 15, respectively, and mean infant total sleep was
      13.47 hours (SD 1.73). Mean maternal total sleep was 7.18 hours (SD 1.51), with
      half of the mothers reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Mean
      number of infant feedings was 11.14 (SD 3.27), with 11 infants (29.7%) receiving 
      13 or more feedings per 24 hours; minimum and maximum times per feeding were 15
      and 41.7 minutes, respectively. Male infants had more sleep episodes, shorter
      sleep periods, and less sleep than females, and these gender differences resulted
      in shorter and more fragmented sleep for mothers. Findings suggest there is
      continued need for interventions to improve maternal sleep following
      childbearing.

TI  - A lower level of entropy in circadian rhythm of the sinus R-R intervals suggests 
      a prevalence of the cardiac sympathetic regulation in early physiological
      pregnancy.
PG  - 711-22
AB  - The study estimates the unpredictable disorder (chaos) within the 24 h pattern of
      sinus R-R intervals (SRRI) in clinically healthy pregnant women (CHPW) and
      clinically healthy non-pregnant women (CHNPW), in order to evaluate the early
      gestational changes in neurovegetative cardiac pacing. SRRI were provided by the 
      24-h Holter ECG of 10 CHPW and 10 CHNPW. SRRI were investigated by descriptive
      conventional statistics by means of the Time and Frequency Domain Analysis, and
      subsequently, in their chaotic component by means of entropy analysis. Both the
      SRRI and entropy were tested via the Cosinor method to better decipher whether or
      not the periodic disorder in heart rate variability is modified in pregnancy as a
      result of a gestational tonic resetting of the cardiac sympatho-vagal regulation.
      Cosinor analysis documented that the circadian rhythm of both the SRRI and
      entropy were preserved in CHNPW and CHPW. However, the circadian rhythm of SRRI
      and entropy in CHPW exhibited a significantly decreased 24 h mean. Via the
      analysis of the rhythmicity of entropy, this study has documented that the chaos 
      in the 24 h pattern of SRRI is less prominent in CHPW than in CHNPW. Such a
      reduction of level in the deterministic periodic chaos of heart rate variability 
      provides evidence that, in early pregnancy, a tonic elevation of the sympathetic 
      activity regulates cardiac pacing.

TI  - [Maternal obesity as a risk factor for complications in pregnancy, labor and
      pregnancy outcomes].
PG  - 107-11, 150
AB  - Obesity is a worldwide growing epidemic. The negative influence of obesity is
      huge and considered to be one of the major contributors to health problems in the
      western world. There is a significant association between obesity and diabetes
      mellitus, ischemic heart disease, some cancers and syndromes of sleep apnea.
      Furthermore, obesity was described to have a negative influence on fertility,
      pregnancy, labor and pregnancy outcomes. It was also discovered that obesity was 
      significantly associated with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational
      diabetes mellitus and complications in cesarean delivery and anesthesia. This
      review aims to present updates on the relationship between obesity and pregnancy 
      and labor outcomes, emphasizing the significance of obesity as a risk factor for 
      adverse pregnancy outcome.

TI  - Type 1 diabetes associated with asymptomatic acromegaly successfully treated with
      surgery after pregnancy: a case report.
PG  - 413-20
AB  - We report a rare case of type 1 diabetes in a woman associated with acromegaly
      who was treated with surgery after pregnancy. An 18-year-old woman came to our
      hospital in April, 1998, complaining of thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, appetite
      loss, body weight loss of 8 kg in a month, and amenorrhea beginning 2 months
      earlier. Based on laboratory data, she was diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes
      mellitus. Although we suspected her of having acromegaly because of high growth
      hormone (GH) levels (6.9 or 8.5 ng/ml), blood levels of insulin-like growth
      factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were within normal range and
      the circadian rhythm of her blood GH levels was normally maintained. Her blood GH
      level was elevated to 12.6 ng/ml 15 minutes after a TRH administration. Blood GH 
      levels were suppressed from 49 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml 4 hours after an oral
      administration of 2.5 mg of bromocriptine. A magnetic resonance images (MRIs)
      showed pituitary swelling, but no nodules were found in the pituitary. Therefore,
      we diagnosed her as having acromegaly and observed her without surgery, while
      prescribing diet therapy and intensive insulin therapy for diabetes. We started a
      treatment of oral administration of 7.5 mg of bromocriptine per day for the
      acromegaly from April 28, 2000, because her elevated GH was suspected of causing 
      her diabetes to be poorly controlled. During a pregnancy from October, 2000 to
      September, 2001, diabetic control was improved with increased administration of
      insulin under a constant dose of bromocriptine. She delivered a normal full-term 
      infant. After the bromocriptine therapy was stopped as she hoped to breastfeed,
      blood levels of GH and IGF-1 became elevated and her diabetic control
      deteriorated. As her pituitary tumor observed in pituitary MRIs became larger
      during the course, a transsphenoidal surgery was performed on March 8, 2002.
      After the surgery, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 lowered and diabetic control
      improved again. We concluded as follows: to rule out acromegaly in patients with 
      poorly controlled diabetes, 1) measurements of serum GH and IGF-1 should be
      performed, and 2) pituitary MRIs should be performed if blood levels of GH or
      IGF-1 are high.

TI  - Factors associated with objective (actigraphic) and subjective sleep quality in
      young adult women.
PG  - 11-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with
      actigraphic and subjective sleep quality in young women. METHODS: Participants
      were 73 regularly menstruating women, 20-40 years old, who were not taking oral
      contraceptives, pregnant, or shift workers. Women contributed an average of 7
      nights of actigraphy data during the luteal menstrual cycle phase, resulting in a
      total of 595 nights of data. RESULTS: One night of actigraphy data was unreliable
      for measuring total sleep time, sleep onset, and time in bed (intraclass
      correlation < or =.15) but was acceptable for measuring sleep efficiency and
      total wake time (intraclass correlation [ICC]=.52). Going to bed late, medication
      use, employment, increased daylight hours, longer menstrual cycle length, and
      higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with poorer actigraphic sleep
      measures. Employment, age, and perceived stress were associated with subjective
      sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Multiple factors were associated with sleep quality in
      these young women who were sleeping at home. However, the associations differed
      for subjectively versus actigraphically assessed sleep quality. Actigraphy is
      feasible for measuring sleep, but multiple recording nights may be needed to
      obtain reliable estimates.

TI  - Death during GH therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome: description of
      two new cases.
PG  - 554-7
AB  - A few cases of death worldwide during GH treatment in pediatric patients with
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been recently described. The evaluation of
      further cases is needed to better identify possible causal mechanism(s), as well 
      as to suggest some additional guidelines for prevention. We report the death of 2
      additional children with genetically confirmed PWS in the first months of GH
      therapy. Case 1: This 3.9-yr-old girl was born at 39 weeks gestation. Low GH
      response to two stimulation tests was observed. GH administration was started at 
      the age of 3.5 yr (0.33 mg/kg per week), when the patient was at 130% of her
      ideal body weight (ibw). Hypertrophy of adenoids was previously demonstrated.
      Snoring and sleep apnea were present before GH treatment, and did not increase
      during therapy. Four months later she died at home suddenly in the morning. Case 
      2: This patient was a 6.3-yr-old boy. He was born at term after an uneventful
      pregnancy. At the age of 6 yr, his weight was at 144% of his ibw. He showed
      reduced GH secretion during provocation tests, and GH therapy was started (0.20
      mg/kg per week). The previously reported nocturnal respiratory impairment had
      worsened after beginning GH administration. Tonsils and adenoids hypertrophy were
      noted. At the age of 6.3 yr he died at home in the morning following an acute
      crisis of apnea. These additional cases seem to confirm that some children with
      PWS may be at risk of sudden death at the beginning of GH therapy.

TI  - Prenatal protein malnutrition induces a phase shift advance of the spontaneous
      locomotor rhythm and alters the rest/activity ratio in adult rats.
PG  - 167-72
AB  - Evidence is accumulating for significant structural and functional changes within
      the central nervous system (CNS) following prenatal protein malnutrition.
      Included among the structures that are likely to be affected are the
      suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) involved in the regulation of locomotor activity,
      sleep-wake cycle, and drinking behavior. To determine the effects of prenatal
      protein malnutrition on the spontaneous activity rhythm, 24 h radiotelemetric
      measurements were recorded over an 8-day period. Male offspring of rats provided 
      with protein-deficient (6% casein) or adequate (25% casein) diets for 5 weeks
      prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were studied. Well nourished rats
      displayed a rise in activity level during the first hour of the 12h light phase, 
      whereas prenatally malnourished rats displayed this increase during the 12h dark 
      phase, approximately 50 min before lights on, reflecting a significant phase
      advance in this group. In addition, cosinor analysis revealed that the alpha/rho 
      relationship was affected in the previously malnourished group, the activity
      phase being shorter than in the well-nourished animals. These findings suggest
      changes in the regulatory systems controlling the locomotor activity rhythm as a 
      consequence of prenatal protein malnutrition. Alterations in entrainment to the
      light-dark cycle, and/or in the coupling force of the circadian oscillators are
      all candidate mechanisms.

TI  - Automated state analyses: proposed applications to neonatal neurointensive care.
PG  - 256-70
AB  - The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1)
      the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms
      of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic
      monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting 
      must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep
      consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over
      370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was
      visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which
      were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined 
      a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the
      prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors 
      have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group
      at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index:
      quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals,
      spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of 
      respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being
      developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify
      new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep
      monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by
      facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily
      as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental
      trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

TI  - Lack of adult-type salivary cortisol circadian rhythm in hospitalized preterm
      infants.
PG  - 20-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Knowledge of the presence or absence of cortisol (F) circadian
      rhythm in preterm infants is important for the interpretation of F measurements
      made in samples taken for both clinical and research purposes. Little is known
      about its emergence in very preterm infants. This study examines circadian rhythm
      in F secretion in hospitalized infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. METHODS: 
      DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study. SUBJECTS: 11 infants
      admitted consecutively and born before 30 completed weeks of gestation.
      MEASUREMENTS: F was measured by highly specific radioimmunoassay on morning and
      evening saliva samples gathered at weekly intervals until discharged home.
      Circadian rhythm was defined as > or =40% reduction from morning to evening
      level. RESULTS: For all data, the median salivary F was 10.3 nmol/l (range
      <0.5-372.8). F levels were highest in the first 3 weeks of life. No infants
      displayed classical circadian rhythm for 4 weeks or more prior to being
      discharged from hospital. The other infants showed randomly distributed morning
      and evening F values with a trend in 4 infants towards periods of consistently
      higher evening than morning values. CONCLUSION: Adult-type F circadian rhythm is 
      rarely evident in hospitalized preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation.

TI  - Sleep and perinatal mood disorders: a critical review.
PG  - 247-56
AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to
      mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes 
      in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in
      perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about
      changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a
      focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and
      psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of
      perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood
      disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited.
      Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period,
      particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as
      polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the
      causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders.

TI  - Sleep quality and health-related quality of life in HIV-infected African-American
      women of childbearing age.
PG  - 959-70
AB  - A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine the associations of sleep
      quality and stage of illness with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in
      HIV-infected African-American women. Participants were recruited from 12 health
      clinics and AIDS service organizations (ASO) in Georgia, North Carolina, and
      South Carolina. The sample consisted of 144 African-American women who ranged in 
      age from 20 to 48 years (m = 34.8, SD = 6.8). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
      (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were
      administered. Participants were categorized as good sleepers (PSQI global score <
      7) or poor sleepers (PSQI global score > or = 7) using the median global sleep
      quality score. Differences in HRQOL between good and poor sleepers, as measured
      by the SF-36, were tested using MANOVA. Good sleepers scored significantly higher
      (p < 0.0001) for each SF-36 quality of life dimension and the mental and physical
      health summary scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep quality 
      is associated with HRQOL, independent of the individual's stage of illness, more 
      so with mental HRQOL than with physical HRQOL. The results suggest that treatment
      for poor sleep quality should be a primary concern for the treatment of HIV
      infection and a means for improving HRQOL.

TI  - Heart rate responses to non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants: effects
      of sleep position, sleep state and postnatal age.
PG  - 673-81
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal smoking,
      sleeping position, sleep state and postnatal age on heart rate changes following 
      non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants. SUBJECTS: We studied healthy term
      infants, 13 of whom were born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who 
      smoked during pregnancy. Each infant was studied using daytime polysomnography on
      3 occasions: (a) 2-3 weeks, (b) 2-3 months and (c) 5-6 months after birth. Nasal 
      air-jet stimulation was presented in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) 
      when infants slept both prone and supine. RESULTS: We found no difference between
      infants of smoking and non-smoking mothers in any of the parameters measured.
      Minimum HR (MinHR) following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation was
      significantly lower in the supine compared to the prone sleeping position at 2-3 
      weeks and 2-3 months of age (p<0.05) in AS, and at all 3 ages in QS (p<0.01).
      MinHR was significantly lower in QS compared to AS at 2-3 months when infants
      slept prone and at 5-6 months when sleeping supine (p<0.01). In QS, MinHR became 
      lower with increasing postnatal age in both sleep positions (p<0.01). In AS,
      there was no maturational effect. The normalized bradycardia (DeltaHR%) was
      significantly greater in AS than in QS at 2-3 weeks of age (p<0.05) when infants 
      slept supine. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that there was a decrease in heart 
      rate (MinHR) following trigeminal stimulation in infants up to 6 months of age
      and this was affected by sleep position and sleep state, being larger in the
      supine sleeping position and the QS state.

TI  - Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants.
PG  - CD002059
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may
      result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities,
      feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate
      symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological 
      treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an
      opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of
      NAS due to withdrawal from opiates. SEARCH STRATEGY: The previous review was
      updated with additional searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-December
      2004) and EMBASE (1980-December 2004) supplemented by searches of conference
      abstracts and citation lists of published articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials
      enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% 
      follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control.
      Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data
      independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence,
      mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative
      risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean
      difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN
      RESULTS: Seven studies enrolling a total of 585 infants met inclusion criteria
      (Carin 1983; Finnegan 1984; Jackson 2004; Kaltenbach 1986; Kandall 1983; Khoo
      1995; Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984; Kaltenbach 1986) may be
      sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled
      infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during
      pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than
      random patient allocation methods in three studies; sizeable, largely unexplained
      differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies; and
      imbalances in group characteristics after randomisation in one study. Opiate
      (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found no significant
      effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase 
      in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in
      time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3, -0.3) and duration of
      supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2, -120.3). Opiate vs
      phenobarbitone: Meta-analysis of four studies found no significant difference in 
      treatment failure (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51, 1.11). One of these studies
      (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant
      reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only
      opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be
      interpreted with caution. One study (Jackson 2004) reported a significant
      reduction in duration of treatment and admission to the nursery for infants
      receiving morphine compared to phenobarbitone. One study (Kandall 1983) reported 
      a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of 
      opiate. Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant
      reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of
      opiate. No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the
      time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but
      increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on
      treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the
      incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment
      failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery
      admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the 
      incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that
      treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants
      born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is
      restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the
      methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review
      should be treated with caution.

TI  - Acupuncture for insomnia in pregnancy--a prospective, quasi-randomised,
      controlled study.
PG  - 47-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to test the effects of acupuncture on
      insomnia in a group of pregnant women under real life conditions, and to compare 
      the results with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone
      (sleep hygiene). METHODS: A total of 30 conventionally treated pregnant women
      were allocated at random into groups with or without acupuncture. Seventeen
      patients formed the study group and 13 the control group. The pregnant women
      scored the severity of insomnia using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10.
      Women were followed up for eight weeks and interviewed five times, at two-week
      intervals. RESULTS: Eight women dropped out, five in the study group and three in
      the control group. The study group reported a larger reduction on insomnia rating
      (5.1) than the control group (0.0), a difference which was statistically
      significant (P = 0.0028). Average insomnia scores decreased by at least 50% over 
      time in nine (75%) patients in the study group and in three (30%) of the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that acupuncture alleviates 
      insomnia during pregnancy and further research is justified.

TI  - [What are the short, mid, and long term consequences of smoking during
      pregnancy?].
PG  - 3S390-446
AB  - A review of the literature shows that maternal or paternal smoking during
      pregnancy has many effects on the newborn, the infant, and even the adult exposed
      during intrauterine life. In the newborn, measurements at birth are lower than
      those observed in non-exposed newborns and the risk of preterm birth is
      increased. There is also a slightly increased risk of cleft lip or palate.
      Newborns exposed to smoking also suffer from altered vascular and pulmonary
      function and have a different neurological behavior. They react less well to
      stress. The risk of sudden infant death is significantly increased among exposed 
      infants, especially if they sleep with their parents. The overall mortality of
      exposed infants is higher. Mid- and long-term consequences are more difficult to 
      evaluate due to the very large number of confounding factors. There is however an
      association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and a slightly decreased
      cognitive level in childhood and adulthood. The risks of hyperactivity disorder
      with attentional deficit, behavioral disorders, delinquency, and childhood and
      adolescence smoking are increased as are the risks of obesity, respiratory
      disorders and infection. Conversely, there is no demonstrated link with childhood
      cancer.

TI  - [Relationship between sudden infant death and in utero exposure to smoking: how
      should smoking parents be informed?].
PG  - 3S223-9
AB  - Recent campaigns on having infants sleep on their back has decreased the rate of 
      sudden infant death. Other risk factors have also been identified, including
      maternal smoking during pregnancy. While many studies have methodological biases,
      most demonstrate a two to three-fold increase in the risk of sudden infant death 
      among mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The effect of smoking is basically
      caused by nicotine which is toxic for the brain. This compound has specific
      trophicity for the respiratory centers rich in nicotinic cholinergic receptors.
      Deficiencies which could result could lead to greater vulnerability of the infant
      to episodes of hypoxia. The risk would be dose dependent and more marked in women
      smoking more than nine cigarettes per day. After birth, certain factors would
      increase the risk, including passive smoking and sleeping in the mother's bed.

TI  - Maternal fluoxetine infusion does not alter fetal endocrine and biophysical
      circadian rhythms in pregnant sheep.
PG  - 356-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression during pregnancy is frequently treated with the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (FX), commonly known as Prozac
      (Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN). FX potentiates serotoninergic
      neurotransmission and serotonin has been implicated in the regulation of
      circadian rhythms. We have therefore investigated the effect of chronic
      administration of FX on maternal and fetal circadian rhythms in sheep. METHODS:
      Following an initial bolus dose of 70 mg FX, an 8-day continuous infusion of FX
      (n = 11, 98.5 microg/kg x d) was performed. Controls (n = 13) were treated with
      sterile water vehicle only. Maternal and fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin
      concentrations were determined every 3 hours for 24 hours and then every 6 hours 
      for 24 hours beginning on the fourth day of infusion. RESULTS: FX treatment did
      not alter either the basal or circadian rhythms of either maternal or fetal
      plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Fetal cardiovascular and
      behavioral state parameters were measured continuously. While the incidence of
      low-voltage (LV) electrocortical (ECOG) activity was significantly reduced in
      fetuses in the FX group, there was no effect of FX on the diurnal rhythms in
      fetal arterial pressure, heart rate, breathing movements, or behavioral state.
      CONCLUSION: These results show that maternal FX treatment does not result in
      significant alterations in maternal and fetal hormonal and behavioral circadian
      rhythms.

TI  - Health departments do it better: prenatal care site and prone infant sleep
      position.
PG  - 165-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public
      health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
      METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a
      stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women
      completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response).
      RESULTS: Overall, 9.2% of all women "usually" chose prone infant sleep position, 
      while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from
      private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women
      receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics
      (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic
      patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep
      position, adjusted odds ratio = 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92).
      CONCLUSIONS: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private
      physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs.
      Providers-especially private providers-should continue to stress the importance
      of supine sleep position for infants.

TI  - Genesis of alcohol-induced craniofacial dysmorphism.
PG  - 366-75
AB  - The initial diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the United States was
      made because of the facial features common to the first cohort of patients. This 
      article reviews the development of an FAS mouse model whose craniofacial features
      are remarkably similar to those of affected humans. The model is based on
      short-term maternal treatment with a high dosage of ethanol at stages of
      pregnancy that are equivalent to Weeks 3 and 4 of human gestation. At these early
      stages of development, alcohol's insult to the developing face is concurrent with
      that to the brain, eyes, and inner ear. That facial and central nervous system
      defects consistent with FAS can be induced by more "realistic" alcohol dosages as
      illustrated with data from an oral alcohol intake mouse model in which maternal
      blood alcohol levels do not exceed 200 mg/dl. The ethanol-induced pathogenesis
      involves apoptosis that occurs within 12 hrs of alcohol exposure in selected cell
      populations of Day 7, 8, and 9 mouse embryos. Experimental evidence from other
      species also shows that apoptosis underlies ethanol-induced malformations. With
      knowledge of sensitive and resistant cell populations at specific developmental
      stages, studies designed to identify the basis for these differing cellular
      responses and, therefore, to determine the primary mechanisms of ethanol's
      teratogenesis are possible. For example, microarray comparisons of sensitive and 
      resistant embryonic cell populations have been made, as have in situ studies of
      gene expression patterns in the populations of interest. Studies that illustrate 
      agents that are effective in diminishing or exacerbating ethanol's teratogenesis 
      have also been helpful in determining mechanisms. Among these agents are
      antioxidants, sonic hedgehog protein, retinoids, and the peptides SAL and NAP.

TI  - Sleep-wake cycles, social rhythms, and sleeping arrangement during Japanese
      childbearing family transition.
PG  - 342-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms of Japanese
      parents are related to their sleeping arrangements before and after the birth of 
      their first child. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal, time-series methods.
      SETTING: Participants' homes in four geographical areas of Japan. PARTICIPANTS:
      Convenience sample of 101 Japanese first-time parent couples who completed
      antepartum and postpartum questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hr sleep-wake
      rhythm from 7-day logs at 32 to 36 weeks gestation and 4 to 5 weeks postpartum
      and daily social rhythm from Monk's Social Rhythm Metric. RESULTS: Mothers' total
      sleep time and activity level decreased after birth. Social rhythms became less
      regular for mothers and more consistent and regular for fathers. Although
      sleeping arrangement had no effect on parents' daily social rhythms, it had a
      significant effect on the 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm. Regularity of sleep-wake
      rhythms was more prominent for fathers sleeping with mother and baby than for
      fathers sleeping alone. CONCLUSIONS: Couples having their first child face great 
      changes in their sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms. Nurses can counsel
      expectant parents to think about their sleeping habits and social activities and 
      assist them in making informed decisions about the best sleeping arrangement
      during transition to parenthood.

TI  - Fetal homologue of infant crying.
PG  - F415-8
AB  - Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are comparable to
      those of the neonate: 1F (quiet sleep), 2F (active state), 3F (quiet awake), and 
      4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is not considered to have a fetal
      correlate. In a study assessing the effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine
      during pregnancy on fetal response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, 
      what appears to be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours
      were seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and include: 
      an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening and tongue
      depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths, the last breath
      ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration and settling. This is
      the first report/video documenting these behaviours and suggests the possibility 
      of a state 5F.

TI  - Increased soluble VCAM-1 serum levels in preeclampsia are not correlated to
      urinary excretion or circadian blood pressure rhythm.
PG  - 144-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is known to be
      elevated in serum of patients with preeclampsia, but there are no data available 
      on the significance of urinary VCAM-1 excretion in preeclampsia. The aim of our
      study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and
      urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to
      ascertain their relation to blood pressure. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 10
      normotensive and 10 preeclamptic pregnant women were included in this study.
      Venous blood was collected hourly, and urine samples were taken every 2 h over a 
      period of 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. We compared these results
      with the circadian blood pressure rhythm. RESULTS: The median VCAM-1 plasma
      levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5
      ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any
      circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed 
      a typical circadian rhythm, with a higher excretion rate during daytime.
      CONCLUSION: For the first time we have demonstrated that urinary VCAM-1 excretion
      in pregnancy shows a circadian rhythm without correlation to plasma levels or the
      circadian blood pressure rhythm. In contrast, VCAM-1 serum levels did not show a 
      diurnal rhythm. We assume that VCAM-1 serum levels do not correlate with systemic
      blood pressure or urinary excretion.

TI  - [Withdrawal symptoms of antidepressants].
PG  - 698-701
AB  - Withdrawal symptoms are encountered with both the classical anti-depressants,
      i.e. the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamineoxidase inhibitors, the modern
      antidepressants, i.e. the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and the new
      antidepressants such as venlafaxine and mirtazapine. The symptoms that are
      reported following the withdrawal of these drugs can be classified into 8 groups:
      influenza-like symptoms, psychic symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep
      disorders, equilibrium disorders, sensory disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms
      and other symptoms. It is characteristic of these symptoms that they appear 1-4
      days after reduction of the dose or the last administration of the drug. They may
      also appear in the infants of mothers who used an antidepressant during the last 
      phase of the pregnancy. It is important that the patient be informed accurately
      and carefully at the start and termination of any treatment with an
      antidepressant. In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is advisable to
      reduce the dosage slowly if possible when the treatment is to be terminated.

TI  - Prenatal stress and children's cortisol reaction to the first day of school.
PG  - 541-9
AB  - Maternal prenatal stress has been found to be related to over-activity and/or
      dysregulation of the HPA-system in the offspring. These effects are more readily 
      apparent in response to novel situations. The aim of the present report was to
      examine whether pregnancy stress predicted HPA-axis reactions of children to the 
      first day of school after the summer break. Children of mothers with more
      prenatal stress were compared to those of mothers with less stress. Habituation
      was studied by comparisons between the first school day and a second school day a
      week later. Finally, cortisol levels at school were compared to those of a
      weekend day. The participants were 29 mother-child pairs (20 girls and nine boys,
      mean age 5.31 years, SD = 0.50). The children's cortisol levels were determined
      in saliva. Multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modelling) was used to
      analyze the data. Both prenatal cortisol and pregnancy anxiety were related to
      the children's cortisol levels as a reaction to the first school day. Children
      whose mothers had higher levels of morning cortisol during pregnancy, and more
      fear of bearing a handicapped child showed higher levels of cortisol on school
      days. In addition, the circadian rhythm of cortisol on school days appeared to
      have a steeper slope as compared to that of the circadian curve on a weekend day.

TI  - The association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and physiological
      regulation in 4- to 8-week-old infants: an examination of possible mediators and 
      moderators.
PG  - 15-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between maternal cocaine use during
      pregnancy and physiological measures of regulation, which included heart rate
      (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). METHODS: Potential mediators and
      moderators of this association were explored. Participants were 141 mother-infant
      dyads (77 cocaine exposed and 64 nonexposed) recruited at birth. Average infant
      HR and RSA was assessed at 4-8 weeks of age during a 15 minute period of sleep.
      RESULTS: Results indicated a dose-dependent effect of prenatal exposure to
      cocaine on RSA. There was no evidence that fetal growth or other prenatal
      exposure to substances mediated this association or that fetal growth or maternal
      age moderated this association. Regression analyses also indicated that birth
      weight (BW), but not birthlength (BL), head circumference (HC) or other substance
      use, mediated the association between prenatal exposure to cocaine and heart
      rate. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cocaine exposure is associated with
      physiological regulation at 4-8 weeks of age and highlight the importance of
      considering level of exposure when assessing infant outcomes.

TI  - [Psychological impact of antenatal diagnosis of increased nuchal translucency a
      woman's pregnancy experience and early mother-child relationship].
PG  - S103-9
AB  - The aim of this article is to study the psychological effects of antenatal
      diagnosis on increased nuchal translucency on a woman's pregnancy experience and 
      early mother-child relationship. The study group was composed of pregnant women
      whose fetus presented increased nuchal translucency at first trimester ultrasound
      examinations. These women consulted a pedopsychiatrist during their pregnancy
      and, for some, during the first years of the life of the child. One of the main
      risks was disinterest in the fetus, with the possible corollary of therapeutic
      abortion or a difficult mother-child relationship. We observed cases of
      attachment disorders, significant separation distress, excessive fear about
      dealing with the baby's health, sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Postnatal
      depression was more frequent in these situations. Multidisciplinary work
      associating psychiatric, obstetric and pediatric units can help in dealing with
      such uncertainty.

TI  - Sleep complaints: snoring and daytime sleepiness in pregnant and pre-eclamptic
      women.
PG  - 163-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To examine whether snoring and sleepiness are linked in
      pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 167 healthy and
      82 pre-eclamptic women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 160 non-pregnant
      women. Subjects and their partners completed a sleep questionnaire. Height,
      weight, neck circumferences and blood pressure were recorded for all. RESULTS:
      Pregnant and pre-eclamptic women were (mean +/-SD) 36+/-3.6 and 36+/-3 weeks
      pregnant, respectively. Age and height did not differ significantly between
      groups (P>0.2), but pre-eclamptic women were heavier than pregnant and
      non-pregnant women and had higher BMI than pregnant women before pregnancy (all
      P<0.05). Thirty-two percent of control, 55% of pregnant and 85% of pre-eclamptic 
      women snored (P<0.001), but pre-pregnancy snoring rates (pre-eclamptic=36%,
      healthy pregnant women=27%) were similar to those in non-pregnant women (32%)
      (P>0.7). Sleepiness was reported by 12% of non-pregnant, 23% of pregnant and 15% 
      of pre-eclamptic women (P<0.04), but non-pregnant women had lower mean Epworth
      Sleepiness scores than both pregnant and pre-eclamptic groups (P<0.001). Snoring 
      was correlated with (P=0.002), but explained only <2%, of the variance in
      sleepiness. CONCLUSION: Snoring and sleepiness increased in the third trimester
      of pregnancy, particularly in patients with pre-eclampsia. However, the study
      suggests that sleepiness in pregnancy is largely due to factors other than
      snoring or breathing pauses.

TI  - [Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)].
PG  - 96-104
AB  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the term first proposed in 1969 for a
      distinctive subgroup of unexpected infant deaths occurring during the first
      months of life, with relatively consistent clinical, epidemiological and
      pathological features, which remain unexplained after a thorough case
      investigation, including a complete autopsy, examination of death scene and
      review of clinical history. Sudden infant death unnecessary means SIDS. According
      to definition, SIDS remains a diagnosis of exclusion, distinguished from others
      only by subjective and permissive variables. Despite the vague and permissive
      nature of the definition, epidemiological studies identified some risk factors as
      prematurity and social disadvantage. Nevertheless, the most interesting findings 
      are those related to environmental and care features, as drug addiction and/or
      smoke exposition during pregnancy, sleep position of the infant, environmental
      temperature, parental bed sharing and breast feeding. Those factors play a
      variable role, but their correction reduced SIDS incidence. Sudden infant death
      is a diagnosis made by expert pathologists with pediatrician's and investigator's
      advice, based primarily on autopsy findings and death scene investigation
      performed through the severe application of investigative protocols.

TI  - Biological rhythms, medication safety, and women's health.
PG  - 38-46
AB  - Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as
      evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian (
      approximately 24-hour), circamensual ( approximately monthly), and circannual (
      approximately yearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche,
      reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have
      been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and
      birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease,
      and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of
      chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as 
      stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and
      preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms
      impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse
      effects of prescription and nonprescription medications widely used by women can 
      vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian
      rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly
      relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal
      toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also 
      with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications
      are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are 
      advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in
      the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may
      elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for 
      their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women
      and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs.
      evening) of drug use.

TI  - Autonomic modulation of sinus and atrioventricular nodes in premature
      low-birth-weight infants.
PG  - S288-91
AB  - Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at
      approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI).
      However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node
      (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals
      at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3
      +/- 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578 +/- 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during
      sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory 
      cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation
      fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms(2)) was calculated for
      the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036 approximately 0.146 Hz), high frequency
      domain (HF: 0.146 approximately 0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036
      approximately 2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency
      bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio
      in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a 
      decrease in the LF/HF ratio and an increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals
      were observed at 1 month, consistent with expression of respiratory vagal
      activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand, the LF/HF ratio increased,
      indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal
      input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations
      suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced
      by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic
      regulation, independent of the SAN.

TI  - Birth prematurity determines prolonged autonomic nervous system immaturity.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - Because of its multiple involvement in physiological processes, autonomic nervous
      system (ANS) activity, a key regulator of homeostatic control, demonstrates a
      progressive increase during pregnancy. The profile of its maturation, mainly in
      the parasympathetic arm, in premature or full term infants, may help us to better
      understand its pathophysiological role. We prospectively evaluated ANS maturity
      in a group of 23 premature (PREM) infants at their theoretical term age and in 8 
      full term (FT) newborns. All recordings were registered close to the theoretical 
      full term period (from 38 to 41 weeks) for the PREM group and during the first
      week of life for the FT newborns. Polygraphic recordings, EEG monitoring
      associated with visual clinical control, and Holter ECG, were performed
      simultaneously. ANS indices were then calculated during quiet sleep periods,
      using Wavelet transform of RR (beat to beat) intervals. High frequency components
      were found to be significantly lower in the PREM than in the FT group (p<0.05).
      Furthermore, at theoretical full term age, the greater the prematurity, the lower
      was parasympathetic activity. Because it is easy, monitoring of parasympathetic
      activity may help us to understand autonomic maturation and its clinical
      prognostic implications.

TI  - Study on circadian variation in folate pharmacokinetics.
PG  - e4-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a new preparation of prenatal multivitamins, PregVit, two tablets 
      a day (a.m. and p.m.) are given. Folic acid is separated from iron and zinc and
      is given in the p.m. tablet to overcome problems due to folic acid interactions
      with iron or zinc, and frequent presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in
      the morning. The circadian variation of folate in humans has not been
      investigated. This is the first study attempting to determine whether circadian
      variation of folate pharmacokinetics exists in humans. OBJECTIVES: To determine
      whether circadian rhythm of folate pharmacokinetics exists in humans. METHODS: In
      a crossover design, six healthy, non-pregnant women were randomized to receive 1 
      tablet of PregVit p.m., containing 1.1 mg of folic acid, in the morning or
      evening. Serum folate levels were measured over 10 hours. The area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC) was used to compare the extent of absorption
      between the two time periods. RESULTS: The mean AUC values for serum folate after
      administration of PregVit p.m. were 334.5+/-119.6 nM*h and 283.1+/-64.3 nM*h for 
      morning and evening, respectively (P = 0.17). The morning and evening peak serum 
      folate concentrations were also similar (135.3+/-41.7 nM and 130.3+/-14.2 nM,
      respectively) (P = 0.75). Similarly, the time to peak for the morning arm (1 0.5 
      hour) was similar to evening administration (1+/-0.4 hour). CONCLUSIONS: There is
      no evidence of circadian variation in folate pharmacokinetics. Thus, the
      introduction of folate in PregVit p.m. will not affect its effectiveness as
      compared to its routine administration in the morning.

TI  - Surgical management of obesity: a review of the evidence relating to the health
      benefits and risks.
PG  - 55-64
AB  - Obesity continues to plague our society in epidemic proportions. Surgery for
      morbid obesity is considered by many as the most effective therapy for this
      complex disorder. Today, multiple surgical procedures for the treatment of
      obesity are available. As with most procedures, there are benefits and risks
      associated with open and laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery, as well as with
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and partial biliopancreatic bypass with a
      duodenal switch. The risks and complications associated with bariatric surgery
      may be serious and in some cases life threatening. However, surgery for obesity
      has shown remarkable results in helping patients to achieve significant long-term
      weight control. In addition, it is associated with improvement and often
      resolution of co-morbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic 
      hypertension, obesity hypoventilation, sleep apnea, venous stasis disease,
      pseudotumor cerebri, polycystic ovary syndrome, complications of pregnancy and
      delivery, gastroesophageal reflux disease, stress urinary incontinence,
      degenerative joint disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

TI  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and prenatal maternal smoking: rising attributed
      risk in the Back to Sleep era.
PG  - 4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parental smoking and prone sleep positioning are recognized causal
      features of Sudden Infant Death. This study quantifies the relationship between
      prenatal smoking and infant death over the time period of the Back to Sleep
      campaign in the United States, which encouraged parents to use a supine sleeping 
      position for infants. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the
      Colorado Birth Registry. All singleton, normal birth weight infants born from
      1989 to 1998 were identified and linked to the Colorado Infant Death registry.
      Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between
      outcomes of interest and prenatal maternal cigarette use. Potential confounders
      analyzed included infant gender, gestational age, and birth year as well as
      maternal marital status, ethnicity, pregnancy interval, age, education, and
      alcohol use. RESULTS: We analyzed 488,918 birth records after excluding 5835
      records with missing smoking status. Smokers were more likely to be single,
      non-Hispanic, less educated, and to report alcohol use while pregnant (p <
      0.001). The study included 598 SIDS cases of which 172 occurred in smoke-exposed 
      infants. Smoke exposed infants were 1.9 times (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) more likely to 
      die of SIDS. The attributed risk associating smoking and SIDS increased during
      the study period from approximately 50% to 80%. During the entire study period
      59% (101/172) of SIDS deaths in smoke-exposed infants were attributed to maternal
      smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Due to a decreased overall rate of SIDS likely due to
      changing infant sleep position, the attributed risk associating maternal smoking 
      and SIDS has increased following the Back to Sleep campaign. Mothers should be
      informed of the 2-fold increased rate of SIDS associated with maternal cigarette 
      consumption.

TI  - New data on the importance of gestational Mg deficiency.
PG  - 694S-700S
AB  - Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. About 20% of the population consumes
      less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg. Women, particularly, have low intakes.
      For example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men have inadequate intakes. Mg
      deficiency during pregnancy can induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric
      consequences that might last throughout life. Studies of gestational Mg
      deficiency in animals show that Mg deficiency may have marked effects on
      parturition and postuterine involution. It has interfered with fetal growth and
      development, and caused morbidity from hematological effects and disturbances in 
      temperature regulation, to teratogenic effects. Emphasis, here, is on effects of 
      chronic clinical gestational Mg deficiency as it affects the infant. Premature
      labor, contributed to by uterine hyperexcitability caused by chronic maternal Mg 
      deficiency, that can be intensified by stress, gives rise to preterm birth. If
      the only cause of uterine overactivity is Mg deficiency, its supplementation
      constitutes nontoxic tocolytic treatment, as an adjuvant treatment, that is
      devoid of toxicity and enhances efficacy and safety of tocolytic drugs such as
      beta-2 mimetics. Evidence is considered that Mg deficiency or Mg depletion can
      contribute to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS may be a fetal
      consequence of maternal Mg deficiency through impaired control of Brown Adipose
      Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set
      point. SIDS can result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. Possibly,
      simple nutritional Mg supplements might be preventive. Various stresses in an
      infant can transform simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion. For example, lying
      prone can be stressful for the baby, as can parental smoking. The role of
      chronopathological stress appears to be often neglected, as it constitutes a
      clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its
      anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (MT) and
      of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked
      to impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT.
      Prophylaxis of this form of SIDS should include atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for
      pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. Consequences
      of maternal primary Mg deficiency have been inadequately studied. To determine
      ultimate outcomes of gestational Mg deficiency in infants, a long-term
      multicenter placebo-controlled prospective study should undertaken on effects of 
      maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality/morbidity in fetus,
      neonates, infants, children and adults, not only during pregnancy and the baby's 
      first year, but throughout life.

TI  - Big dreams, little sleep: dreams during pregnancy after prior pregnancy loss.
PG  - 284-92
AB  - Sleep patterns and dream content may be affected by stressful life events such as
      pregnancy loss. Women who are pregnant subsequent to a prior pregnancy loss tend 
      to have anxious and emotionally charged experiences during their pregnancies.
      Dreams can affect pregnancy outcomes, specifically premature birth. This
      qualitative study is the first investigation to explore sleep disturbances caused
      by dreams as experienced by a diverse group of women pregnant subsequent to a
      pregnancy loss. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 4 categories of
      dreams. We offer clinical assessment and intervention strategies to support these
      women prenatally and present suggestions for research to facilitate our
      understanding of their experiences.

TI  - Patient satisfaction with the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor
      in pregnancy.
PG  - 295-301
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the
      SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor among pregnant women. METHODS: 
      Patients participating in research projects involving ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM) in pregnancy (N = 110) were asked to complete a questionnaire
      relating to patient satisfaction on completion of the monitoring period. The
      first part of the questionnaire involved rating on a visual Likert scale (0-10)
      whether they found the monitor heavy, noisy, cumbersome, disturbing, or
      embarrassing to wear. The second part of the questionnaire addressed whether cuff
      inflation caused significant sleep disturbance or physical discomfort. OUTCOME
      MEASURES: The mean (SD) and range of the Likert scores are reported. The number
      of patients reporting sleep disturbance or physical discomfort was calculated.
      Logistic regression was used to examine which factors were significant predictors
      of discontinuing monitoring. RESULTS: The mean (SD) responses measured by the
      Liken scores were: finding the monitor heavy 3.2 (2.3); comfortable 4.8 (2.3);
      straightforward to use 8.8 (1.8); cumbersome 3.8 (2.3); disturbing 4.5 (2.7);
      noisy 1.6 (2.2); and embarrassing to wear 1.7 (2.1). Difficulty initiating sleep 
      was reported by 28.8% of patients, and a further 56.3% reported difficulty
      maintaining sleep due to the monitor. Sleep disturbance was found to be the
      strongest predictor [r = 0.52; OR 1.68 (1.23, 2.27), p = 0.0009] for the 15% of
      patients discontinuing the monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: While pregnant women tolerate
      the noise, weight, inconvenience, and disturbance associated with ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) well, sleep disturbance is a major cause of
      dissatisfaction and noncompliance. Future studies should evaluate critically the 
      number of nocturnal blood pressure assessments required, and should allow for a
      withdrawal rate of approximately 15% when performing sample size calculations for
      ABPM studies in pregnancy.

TI  - Changes in sleep patterns and depressive symptoms in first-time mothers: last
      trimester to 1-year postpartum.
PG  - 54-67
AB  - Thirty-eight 1st-time mothers were recruited from childbirth classes and were
      assessed at 4 different time periods: the last trimester of pregnancy, 2-4 weeks 
      postpartum, 12-16 weeks postpartum, and 12-15 months postpartum. Measures
      included a daily sleep-wake diary and a depression scale (Center for
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). Results reveal significant
      differences in week-day night sleep schedules (rise time, time awake due to
      disruptions, and nap time) at 2-4 weeks postpartum in comparison to other times
      of measurement. Total sleep time and bedtime was not significantly different
      between times of measurement. More depressive symptoms were reported at 2-4 weeks
      postpartum than at later postpartum measurements. Mothers who developed
      clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D > or = 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum
      reported more total sleep time, later rise times, and more time napping at the
      end of pregnancy in comparison to those mothers that reported fewer depressive
      symptoms (CES-D < 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum.

TI  - Self-reported sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy.
PG  - 191-204
AB  - Retrospective (questionnaire) and prospective (5-day diary) self-reports of sleep
      were obtained from 209 women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. On average,
      the women slept for 465 min, took around 20 min to get to sleep, and were awake
      for just over 30 min after initial sleep onset having woke 2.6 times on average. 
      Sleep efficiency was around 89%. Significant differences were found between
      retrospective and prospective reports only on the number of minutes awake after
      sleep onset and on sleep efficiency. However, these differences were small.
      Retrospective and prospective reports were only moderately correlated. These
      results were not markedly different from values reported in much smaller,
      previous studies of pregnant women using polysomnography, suggesting that the
      self-reports were valid. The findings suggest that sleep parameters are not as
      adversely affected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as is generally
      believed.

TI  - Sleep in late pregnancy predicts length of labor and type of delivery.
PG  - 2041-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigue and 
      sleep disturbance in late pregnancy are associated with labor duration and
      delivery type. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective observational study of 131 women in
      their ninth month of pregnancy, objective (48-hour wrist actigraphy) and
      subjective (sleep logs and questionnaires) measures were used to predict labor
      outcomes using analysis of variance and logistic regression. RESULTS: Controlling
      for infant birth weight, women who slept less than 6 hours at night had longer
      labors and were 4.5 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Women with
      severely disrupted sleep had longer labors and were 5.2 times more likely to have
      cesarean deliveries. Fatigue was unrelated to labor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Health 
      care providers should prescribe 8 hours of bed time during pregnancy to assure
      adequate sleep and should include sleep quantity and quality in prenatal
      assessments as potential predictors of labor duration and delivery type.

AB  - This paper reviews the topic of sleep disorders in pregnant women. We describe
      changes in sleep architecture and sleep pattern during pregnancy, discuss the
      impact of the physical and biochemical changes of pregnancy on sleep in pregnant 
      women and examine whether maternal-fetal outcomes may be adversely affected in
      women with disordered sleep. The literature on common sleep disorders affecting
      pregnant women, including insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs 
      syndrome, is reviewed and recommendations are made for the management of these
      disorders during pregnancy.

TI  - Increased behavioral morbidity in school-aged children with sleep-disordered
      breathing.
PG  - 1640-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), ranging from
      primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with increased
      behavioral morbidity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of
      school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or 
      preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11
      years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a
      cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory
      recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for
      measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and
      hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring
      or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2
      well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral
      Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised:Long. RESULTS: Forty (5%)
      children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per
      hour; interquartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, 
      and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had
      significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains:
      externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive,
      internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems. CONCLUSIONS: Children
      with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher
      prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations
      for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.

TI  - Ontogeny of arousal.
PG  - 290-300
AB  - Ontogeny of arousal data constitute a vital supplement to the sparse literature
      on spontaneous neuronal activity. These data demonstrate that measurable infant
      spontaneous arousals (SAs) with an inherent oscillatory entrainment occur six
      times more in active sleep than in quiet sleep of the same duration and are
      identifiable as a human neurobiologic function. These SAs are not significantly
      associated with race or ethnicity, gender, total hours spent sleeping, percent
      time spent in active or quiet sleep, preterm status, history of a
      life-threatening event, having had a sibling who died of sudden infant death
      syndrome (SIDS), or having had a mother who smoked during this pregnancy. As
      measurable neurophysiologic events, SAs establish parameters for research at
      molecular and molar levels focusing on several critical areas: (1) the neuronal
      control of SA related to neurotransmitters, (2) as a significant antecedent
      factor in clinical cardiorespiratory events occurring in infants at high
      epidemiologic risk for SIDS; (3) as a regulatory biologic factor underlying
      temperament and executive cognitive functioning, and (4) morbidity and mortality 
      effects possibly related to therapeutic interventions that alter SA levels.

TI  - Women's sleep in health and disease.
PG  - 55-76
AB  - A huge amount of knowledge about sleep has accumulated during the last 5 decades 
      following the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nevertheless, there
      are numerous areas of considerable ignorance. One of these concerns the
      particularities of sleep in women. Most basic and clinical studies have been
      performed in male subjects, and only very recently research groups around the
      world have addressed women's sleep in health and disease. In this review, we
      summarize the present knowledge on the influence of oestrogens on the brain and
      on the distinctive changes of sleep across the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy 
      and menopause. In addition, studies in female rodents are reviewed as well as the
      knowledge on female peculiarities regarding the interactions between sleep
      regulation and age-related changes in circadian rhythms. We also address specific
      aspects of sleep loss and sleep disorders in women. Finally, very recent studies 
      on the sociology of sleep are summarized and future directions in the field are
      discussed.

TI  - [The ontogeny and physiology confirms the dual nature of sleep states].
PG  - 569-80
AB  - In the Jouvet's laboratory, as early as 1960 the study of the ontogenesis of
      paradoxical sleep (PS) named "sleep 'with jerks" began in the kitten and led to
      the first publication in 1961. Then, several species were studied, lamb, rat,
      human neonates, etc. These works showed that at birth sleep with jerks was
      preponderant in altricial (immature) species (cat, rat) and the first to appear
      during the second half of gestation in precocious species (guinea pig). For
      Jouvet, sleep with jerks is a immature form of PS. Why PS is so important at
      birth? The maturation of the central nervous system, based on the myelinization, 
      starts in the spinal cord then forwards to the brainstem and forebrain. So, PS
      mechanisms located in the brainstem are the first to mature and the only one to
      function. Then the slow wave sleep (SWS) and waking structures become mature.
      Phylogenetic studies showed that in mammals and birds PS was present even in
      marsupials and monotremes. Until now only the one exception is the dolphin with a
      voluntary breathing. To sleep and breath, dolphin has developed an unilateral
      sleep without classical PS. In other animals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, PS
      was not observed with the parameters used in mammals. The study at birth (not yet
      done) of reptiles would allow perhaps the observation of a temporary PS. Based on
      these findings, a schematic model of the sleep regulation can be elaborated.
      Haeckel's aphorism "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" seems true for PS which
      appears in birds and mammals i.e. at the end of evolution as it appears at the
      end of gestation when PS cerebral structures are present and mature.

TI  - Psychiatric disorders in pregnancy.
PG  - 863-93
AB  - This review, although not exhaustive, provides information on the potential
      impact of psychiatric illness on obstetric outcome. There is clear evidence that 
      psychiatric illness poses a risk to pregnancy outcome. There productive safety
      data on many of the available treatments fail to demonstrate a clear risk from
      treatment. The medications with clear teratogenic, neonatal, and developmental
      risks are, not surprisingly, those used to treat some of the most severe and
      debilitating psychiatric illnesses. Even the amount of information available is
      inadequate without some straightforward clinical guidelines. A model of risk for 
      illness and treatments of illnesses during pregnancy developed by the authors'
      group reminds clinicians that nonexposure does not exist. Rather, the decision is
      which type of exposure is in the best interest of the patient and family-exposure
      to illness or exposure to treatment. Regardless of the choice, clinicians are
      encouraged to think in terms of reducing the total number of exposures; that is, 
      if choosing to treat, patients should be kept well by adjusting and monitoring
      medications-partial treatment simply provides exposure to illness and treatment. 
      Guidelines to accomplish the goal of minimizing exposures include: 1. Treating
      women of reproductive capacity from the first visit as if they are pregnant:
      choosing treatments with reproductive safety information (eg, new and improved = 
      no data) and providing supplemental folic acid for all women (800 microg), with
      higher doses for those treated with anticonvulsants (3 to 4 mg).2. For women who 
      conceive while taking a medication, and if it was efficacious for them, then the 
      majority of decisions for medication selection should be considered already made 
      for pregnancy and lactation (eg, do not switch medications once pregnant or for
      breastfeeding, as that simply exposes the baby to a second medication and the
      data previously discussed do not apply). 3. Because the serum concentration of
      most medications decreases during pregnancy, establishing criteria a priori for
      increasing the maternal daily dose; as a general rule, sleep patterns are good
      markers of psychiatric illnesses. 4. Always preferring monotherapy to two
      medications. 5. Obtaining up-to-date information at www.emorywomensprogram.org (a
      website with links to many support groups, reproductive safety registries) or
      other women's health websites. These basic guidelines can help decrease the
      number of exposures and aid in conducting clinical care with at least some
      reproductive safety data.

TI  - Women and insomnia.
PG  - S8-18
AB  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex
      hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be
      physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women.
      Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to
      demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International
      Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and
      premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of
      menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and
      after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant
      physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal
      transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered
      breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women
      with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression.
      Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between
      menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on
      pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve
      successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants
      for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable.
      The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists
      (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by
      existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guidelines limiting
      the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and,
      as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.

TI  - Drug counselling in pregnancy: an opinion survey of French community pharmacists.
PG  - 711-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to determine whether community
      pharmacists recommend appropriate medications and give valid information to
      pregnant women. METHODS: A total of 163 community pharmacists randomly selected
      in the Midi-Pyrenees area were interviewed by means of an open questionnaire. Ten
      scenarios were proposed concerning back pain, headache, coughs and sore-throats, 
      fever, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, 'venous insufficiency', allergic rhinitis
      and insomnia. RESULTS: Out of the total, 130 pharmacists accepted to answer. Out 
      of them 94.5% reported advising homeopathy, especially for coughs and allergy.
      They often advised medication for pain, fever, nose and oropharynx disorders,
      'venous insufficiency', dyspepsia or constipation. By contrast, they referred the
      women to the general practitioner for nausea and vomiting or back pain. Advice
      without drug dispensation was given for gastrointestinal disorders or 'venous
      insufficiency'. Phytotherapy only concerned 0.5-2% of the answers except for
      anxiety and sleep disturbances (59%), 'venous disorders'(17%) and sore-throat
      (9%). Pharmacists' answers were sometimes inappropriate involving (1)
      pharmacologically illogical advice, (2) drugs for which neither clinical nor
      experimental data are available and (3) drugs potentially harmful in pregnancy.
      CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that French community pharmacists do not
      always give appropriate advice to pregnant women. As primary health care
      providers, pharmacists have to improve counselling regarding drug use in
      pregnancy.

TI  - Breathing patterns in term infants delivered by caesarean section.
PG  - 1216-20
AB  - AIM: To compare the breathing patterns of infants born by elective caesarean
      section to those infants delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of
      labour. METHODS: Healthy term infants born by caesarean section were studied. The
      study group (n = 13) had no trial of labour, whereas infants in the control group
      (n = 13) failed a trial of labour. Polysomnographic study was performed at 36 h
      of age. Heart and respiratory rate, type and duration of apnoeas, arterial oxygen
      saturation and lower limb movements were analysed. RESULTS: Term infants born by 
      elective caesarean section had a shorter duration of pregnancy and weighed less. 
      Their heart rate was faster, they had more mixed apnoeas, and during quiet sleep 
      they had more central apnoeas of longer duration. CONCLUSION: Cardiorespiratory
      patterns in infants delivered by elective caesarean section are different from
      those delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour.

TI  - Home oxygen therapy after preterm birth in Western Australia.
PG  - 519-23
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review our management of infants discharged home receiving
      supplemental oxygen. Stable preterm infants receive low flow O(2) by nasal
      cannulae aiming for SaO(2) of > or = 95%. Oxygen-dependent infants must pass an
      air test (ability to maintain SaO(2) > 80% during 4 h disconnection from oxygen) 
      before discharge home with supplemental oxygen. A sleep study is performed before
      nocturnal O(2) is ceased. METHODS: Infants less than 33 weeks gestational age
      (GA) who were admitted January 1999-June 2001 and discharged home with
      supplemental oxygen were identified through the databases and medical records of 
      the King Edward Memorial/Princess Margaret Hospitals. The data collected were
      compared with an audit performed a decade earlier. RESULTS: Ninety-three infants 
      were discharged home with supplemental oxygen between 1999 and 2001 (10% neonatal
      intensive care unit admissions less than 33 weeks GA; median GA 26 weeks
      (interquartile range 25-28). All infants had an air test before discharge: 63%
      failed the first air test and 30% at least two air tests. The median delay
      between the first air test and discharge was 2 weeks. The median postmenstrual
      age at discharge was 40 weeks gestation (interquartile range 38-41). Ninety
      infants had a sleep study before nocturnal oxygen was ceased and nine failed the 
      first sleep study. Hospital readmission rate was 60%. More preterm infants (less 
      than 33 weeks) were discharged with supplemental oxygen in 1999-2001 (10%, n = 96
      in 1999-2001) than in 1987-1992 (2.5%, n = 53) and this was associated with an
      earlier discharge (40 vs 44 weeks postmenstrual age), lower oxygen requirements
      at discharge (60 vs 125 mL/min), earlier discontinuation of daytime and nocturnal
      oxygen (1 vs 4 months postmenstrual age and 2.5 vs 6 months postmenstrual age)
      and no increase in readmission rate (64% vs 60%). The incidence of
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia for these infants has remained stable at 20%.
      CONCLUSION: Our home oxygen programme, based on an air test predischarge and a
      sleep study prediscontinuation of nocturnal oxygen, facilitates early discharge
      home. Our data suggest that over the last decade, bronchopulmonary dysplasia is
      associated with less impairment in lung function. Further evidence from
      randomized clinical trials is required to determine optimal target range for
      oxygen saturation in preterm infants.

TI  - Delta and theta power spectra of night sleep EEG are higher in breast-feeding
      mothers than in non-pregnant women.
PG  - 216-20
AB  - The power spectra of night sleep EEGs of 12 breast-feeding 9-13 week postpartum
      mothers were analyzed and compared with those of 12 non-pregnant women. The power
      spectra in the delta and theta frequency range during NREM sleep for
      breast-feeding mothers were significantly higher than those for non-pregnant
      women. In addition, the all-night sleep patterns of the mothers were classified
      into two groups - interrupted sleep due to taking care of their infants and
      non-interrupted sleep - in order to observe the influence of partial sleep
      deprivation. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range were not
      significantly different between them. This result suggests that increased delta
      and theta power spectra during postpartum sleep do not result from partial sleep 
      deprivation. The role of prolactin in breast-feeding mothers' sleep is also
      discussed.

TI  - New data on the importance of gestational Mg deficiency.
PG  - 116-25
AB  - Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. Around 20% of the population consumes 
      less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg, in both genders and in women
      particularly: for example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men. Primary Mg
      deficiency may occur in fertile women. Gestational Mg deficiency is able to
      induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences which might last throughout
      life. Experimental studies of gestational Mg deficiency show that Mg deficiency
      during pregnancy may have marked effects on the processes of parturition and of
      postuterine involution. It may interfere with fetal growth and development from
      teratogenic effects to morbidity: i.e. hematological effects and disturbances in 
      temperature regulation. Clinical studies on the consequences of maternal primary 
      Mg deficiency in women have been insufficiently investigated. To check the
      validity of the role of this frequent gestational Mg deficiency, the protocol of 
      a long term multicentric placebo controlled prospective study on the effects of
      maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality and morbidity in fetus,
      neonates, infants, children and adults should be carried out not only during
      pregnancy and the first year of life, but throughout life. Two clinical forms of 
      chronic gestational Mg deficiency in women have been stressed: Premature labor
      when chronic maternal Mg deficiency is involved in uterine hyperexcitability,
      Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when it is caused by either simple Mg
      deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion. Nutritional Mg treatment of
      premature labor. If gestational Mg deficiency is the only cause for uterine
      overactivity, nutritional Mg supplementation constitutes the etiopathogenic
      atoxic tocolytic treatment. But although it is an adjuvant factor in premature
      labor, it is only a useful accessory treatment, devoid of toxicity but which
      increases the effectiveness and safety of the associated tocolytic drugs such as 
      beta-2 mimetics. SIDS due to gestational Mg deficit: Mg deficiency or various
      forms of Mg depletion. SIDS may be caused by the fetal consequences of maternal
      Mg deficiency through an impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT)
      thermoregulation, mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS
      may result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. A possible prevention
      could rest on simple maternal nutritional Mg supplementation. Various stresses in
      pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg
      depletion: stress in baby care such as bedding in prone position, environmental
      factors such as parental smoking, but the role of chronopathological stress
      particularly appears to be too often neglected as it constitutes a clinical form 
      of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical
      stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (MT) and of its urinary
      metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked to an impaired
      maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. A preventive treatment
      of this form of SIDS should associate atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant 
      women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. The place of Mg
      therapy for the infant and of MT, L Tryptophan and taurine is uncertain for the
      moment.

TI  - Alterations in sleep during pregnancy and postpartum: a review of 30 years of
      research.
PG  - 231-42
AB  - Pregnancy, childbirth, and early motherhood physiologically and psychologically
      affect a woman's sleep. Hormonal alterations during early pregnancy, enlargement 
      of the fetus during late pregnancy, and a newborn with random sleep-wake patterns
      all contribute to disrupted sleep. Since the initial study of sleep and pregnancy
      in 1968, fewer than 20 articles have been published which address alterations in 
      sleep architecture related specifically to childbearing women. Furthermore, many 
      of these studies suffer from small sample sizes and lack statistical power for
      consistent interpretation and replication of findings. While almost all of these 
      studies included both nulliparas and multiparas in their samples, rarely have
      effects of parity been reported. The majority of older studies were
      cross-sectional designs, with comparisons to age-matched healthy controls. More
      recent studies have been longitudinal designs to describe changes in sleep during
      the course of pregnancy. However, women's baseline, prepregnancy sleep patterns
      or sleep histories have not been considered. With very few published reports of
      sleep changes related to mental health outcomes, we are no closer to
      understanding the implications of altered sleep patterns on postpartum depression
      or other women's health outcomes than we were when it was originally questioned
      30 years ago.

TI  - Characteristics of heart period variability in intubated very low birth weight
      infants with respiratory disease.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart period variability provides a measure of balance between the
      sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since 
      the PNS develops during the final weeks of gestation, premature infants have an
      overriding SNS. Spectral power analysis of heart period variability reveals two
      main frequency regions, the low frequency region (LF) representing primarily SNS 
      activity and the high frequency region (HF) representing PNS activity.
      OBJECTIVES: To identify the characteristics of heart period power in the LF and
      HF regions in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the neonatal intensive care
      unit across gestational age groups and between sleep and awake states. METHODS:
      Data were collected from 16 intubated and mechanically ventilated VLBW infants
      with respiratory disease. Using spectral analysis techniques, heart period power 
      in the two main frequency regions was extracted. RESULTS: HF power did not
      improve with gestational age as expected. LF power did increase with age, albeit 
      nonsignificantly. LF and HF power were not significantly different between awake 
      and sleep states. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study suggest that
      PNS tone does not improve with gestational age in VLBW infants with respiratory
      disease. The intensive care environment may stimulate a sympathetic response in
      these infants and disrupt normal PNS development.

TI  - Circadian clock mutation disrupts estrous cyclicity and maintenance of pregnancy.
PG  - 1367-73
AB  - Classic experiments have shown that ovulation and estrous cyclicity are under
      circadian control and that surgical ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) 
      results in estrous acyclicity in rats. Here, we characterized reproductive
      function in the circadian Clock mutant mouse and found that the circadian Clock
      mutation both disrupts estrous cyclicity and interferes with the maintenance of
      pregnancy. Clock mutant females have extended, irregular estrous cycles, lack a
      coordinated luteinizing hormone (LH) surge on the day of proestrus, exhibit
      increased fetal reabsorption during pregnancy, and have a high rate of full-term 
      pregnancy failure. Clock mutants also show an unexpected decline in progesterone 
      levels at midpregnancy and a shortened duration of pseudopregnancy, suggesting
      that maternal prolactin release may be abnormal. In a second set of experiments, 
      we interrogated the function of each level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
      (HPG) axis in order to determine how the Clock mutation disrupts estrous
      cyclicity. We report that Clock mutants fail to show an LH surge following
      estradiol priming in spite of the fact that hypothalamic levels of
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), pituitary release of LH, and serum levels 
      of estradiol and progesterone are all normal in Clock/Clock females. These data
      suggest that Clock mutants lack an appropriate circadian daily-timing signal
      required to coordinate hypothalamic hormone secretion. Defining the mechanisms by
      which the Clock mutation disrupts reproductive function offers a model for
      understanding how circadian genes affect complex physiological systems.

TI  - Environmental factors associated with body mass index in a population of Southern
      France.
PG  - 291-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Environmental-factor changes may largely be accountable for the 
      dramatic increase of obesity prevalence in industrialized countries. This study
      investigated the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and various
      socio-economic, clinical, behavioural and reproductive factors in a population
      from Southern France. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study, a sample of 3127
      current and former salaried workers (1658 men and 1469 women) completed a
      questionnaire on personal and medical histories, and had a clinical examination
      including height and weight measurements. Age-adjusted and multiple linear
      regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of obesity
      (BMI> or =30 kg/m) was 9.8% and was higher in men than in women (11.1 versus
      8.3%). Multivariate analyses showed that in both sexes, low educational level,
      television watching, low physical activity and ex-smoking habits, were
      independently associated with a higher BMI. Furthermore, in women, we found
      independent and positive associations between BMI and the number of naps per
      week, short sleep duration, daily alcohol consumption, the number of pregnancies,
      early age at menarche or the non-use of oral contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results reveal the complexity that exists between BMI and environmental factors
      and stress the need to analyse and to handle these factors simultaneously.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to interleukin-6 results in hypertension and increased
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in adult rats.
PG  - 4897-911
AB  - During pregnancy, systemic inflammatory responses induce cytokines that may
      stress the fetus and contribute to cardiovascular and neuroendocrine dysfunction 
      in adulthood. We evaluated the effects of early and late prenatal exposure to
      IL-6 on mean systolic arterial pressure (MSAP) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      (HPA) axis regulation in male and female rats at 5-24 wk of age. MSAP and ACTH
      and corticosterone levels were measured basally and in response to a novel
      environment, immobilization stress, and stimulation with corticotropin-releasing 
      factor (CRF) and ACTH. In addition, mRNA expression and protein levels of
      glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, CRF receptor type 1, and CRF
      were estimated in brain areas thought to mediate central effects of
      corticosteroids on the HPA axis and on central neuroendocrine regulation of MSAP.
      Both early and late prenatal IL-6 exposure led to hypertension, which was evident
      in females at 5 wk of age. In adult rats, basal ACTH and corticosterone levels
      were elevated, the responses to stress and stimulation tests were of extended
      duration, and circadian rhythm during the light period was flattened and
      reversed. Mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression 
      was reduced in the hippocampus, the CRF level was increased in the hypothalamus, 
      and CRF receptor type 1 mRNA expression was increased in the pituitary. These
      findings suggest that fetal stress induced by prenatal exposure to IL-6 leads to 
      hypertension and dysregulation of HPA axis activity during adulthood.

TI  - Effect of a nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep patterns in young women.
PG  - 224-9
AB  - Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is
      important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic
      field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a
      randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 micro T above ambient
      levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement
      periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of 
      age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had
      not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted 
      between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy.
      The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 micro T during the ambient
      period and 0.41-1.21 micro T during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were 
      not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement 
      periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns,
      suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep 
      of young women who sleep at home.

TI  - Circadian melatonin concentration rhythm is lost in pregnant women with altered
      blood pressure rhythm.
PG  - 124-9
AB  - We assessed the correlation between the rhythm of melatonin concentration and
      circadian blood pressure patterns in normal and hypertensive pregnancy.
      Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and blood samples every 4 h were monitored in 16
      primigravidae who had shown an abnormal circadian blood pressure pattern (eight
      pre-eclamptic and eight normotensive) in pregnancy and 6-12 months after
      pregnancy. The circadian rhythm was analyzed by chronobiological measures. Eight 
      normotensive women with maintained blood pressure rhythm served as controls.
      During pregnancy, melatonin concentration was significantly higher in
      pre-eclamptic than in normotensive women (pre-eclampsia, 29.4 +/- 1.9 pg/ml,
      normotensin, altered rhythm, 15.6 +/- 2.1; controls, 22.7 +/- 1.8; p < 0.001).
      This difference faded after pregnancy, owing to the fall observed in
      pre-eclampsia (11.8 +/- 3.2 pg/ml, 9.8 +/- 2.1, and 11.1 +/- 2.0, respectively;
      NS). The rhythm of melatonin concentration was lost in all pregnant women with
      loss of blood pressure rhythm. After pregnancy, normotensive women showed a
      reappearance of both melatonin and blood pressure rhythm, whereas pre-eclamptic
      women showed a reappearance of blood pressure but not melatonin rhythm. The loss 
      of blood pressure rhythm in pregnancy is consistent with the loss of melatonin
      concentration rhythm. In pre-eclamptic women, the normalization of blood pressure
      rhythm, while melatonin rhythm remained altered, suggests a temporal or causal
      priority of circadian concentration of melatonin in the determination of blood
      pressure trend.

TI  - Circadian rhythms in diet and habitat use in red ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra)
      and white-fronted brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus albifrons).
PG  - 353-63
AB  - Daily variation in niche use among vertebrates is attributed to a variety of
      factors, including thermoregulatory, reproductive, and nutritional requirements. 
      Lemuriform primates exhibit many behavioral and physiological adaptations related
      to thermoregulation and sharp, seasonal reproduction, yet they have rarely been
      subjects of a quantitative analysis of circadian (or daily) rhythms in niche use.
      In this study, I document daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use over an
      annual cycle in two sympatric, frugivorous lemurs, Varecia rubra and Eulemur
      fulvus albifrons. Data on diet, forest site, and forest height were recorded at
      5-min time points on focal animals and divided into three time blocks for
      analysis (06:00-10:00 hr, 10:00-14:00 hr, and 14:00-18:00 hr). I employed
      multivariate tests of independence to examine daily rhythms in diet and
      microhabitat use according to sex, season, and reproductive stage. Throughout the
      day, V. rubra is frugivorous and dwells in the upper canopy, with notable
      departures (especially for females) during the hot seasons, gestation, and
      lactation. E. f. albifrons has heterogeneous daily rhythms of food choice and
      microhabitat use, particularly across seasons, and both sexes are equally
      variable. These daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use appear related to
      thermoregulatory and nutritional requirements, seasonal food availability and
      circadian rhythms of plant (and possibly insect) palatability, predator avoidance
      tactics, and in the case of Varecia, to reproduction. Daily rhythms of food
      choice in V. rubra support two previously suggested hypotheses explaining why
      primates consume more nonfruit items late in the day, whereas those of E. f.
      albifrons are too variable to lend support to these hypotheses.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy.
PG  - 292-4
AB  - A 25-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, at 37 weeks gestation was evaluated and
      treated for preeclampsia. Overnight, the patient had a witnessed apneic episode
      with maternal oxygen desaturation and concurrent fetal heart rate deceleration.
      She subsequently delivered an infant that was small for gestational age. This is 
      the first case described with confirmed obstructive sleep apnea by formal
      polysomnography and witnessed maternal desaturation with fetal heart rate
      decelerations. Recognizing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) early in gestation will 
      help dictate treatment options and may prevent adverse maternal fetal outcomes.
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) seems to be a safe treatment with
      minimal adverse effects. Questioning of patients at the first prenatal visit and 
      monitoring for increased snoring during gestation may help detect early signs and
      symptoms of OSA. Treatment of OSA with CPAP might improve perinatal outcomes.

TI  - Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may be a marker of underlying sympathetic bias.
PG  - 357-61
AB  - Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a condition that accompanies many
      seemingly unrelated diseases. It is commonly associated with various clinical
      conditions such as pregnancy, aging, pulmonary diseases, cancers, and other
      systemic illnesses. The condition has been attributed to various causes such as
      platelet abnormalities, hormonal disturbances, and cytokine dysfunction, but the 
      exact underlying mechanism has been elusive. We propose a unifying hypothesis
      that activation of the adrenergic system is the common thread that links all of
      the disparate clinical associations of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. In diseased
      states, autonomic stimulation may occur as a result of chemoreceptor activation
      in response to acidosis, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. Examples include sleep apnea,
      congestive heart failure, renal failure, and tumor-induced hypoxia. In this
      setting, clinical signs of HOA may be a marker of underlying autonomic
      dysfunction. Autonomic stimulation may also occur as a normal part of pregnancy
      or as an abnormal component of aging. The exact pathway linking adrenergic excess
      to HOA remains to be clarified, but a plausible scenario based on current
      molecular evidence is offered.

      unknown, and any sort of physical, social or psychological variation may change
      the normal sleep-wake cycle. PURPOSE: This research aims is to determine the
      sleep disorders (SD) for each of the three trimesters of the pregnancy comparing 
      them to the pre-pregnancy state (PG). METHOD: SD were investigated in three
      hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical
      interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered
      for each trimester. RESULTS: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased
      by 23% in the 2nd trimester (p< 0.005); the rate for excessive daytime sleepiness
      (EDS) by 15% in the 1st trimester (p<0.003), 55% in the 2nd trimester (p<0.001)
      and by 14% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.002); the rate for mild sleepiness increased
      by 33% in the 2nd trimester (p<0.002) and by 48% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001); 
      the rate for specific awakenings increased by 63% in the 1st trimester, by 80% in
      the 2nd trimester and by 84% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: SD were 
      more frequent during pregnancy comparatively to PG state, mostly at the expenses 
      of EDS and specific awakenings.

TI  - Surveillance for disparities in maternal health-related behaviors--selected
      states, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), 2000-2001.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Disparities in maternal and infant health have been observed
      among members of different racial and ethnic populations and persons of differing
      socioeconomic status. For the Healthy People 2010 objectives for maternal and
      child health to be achieved (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy 
      People 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for
      improving health [2 vols.]. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human
      Services, 2000), the nature and extent of disparities in maternal behaviors that 
      affect maternal or infant health should be understood. Identifying these
      disparities can assist public health authorities in developing policies and
      programs targeting persons at greatest risk for adverse health outcomes.
      REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2000-2001. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Pregnancy
      Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and
      population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal
      behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among
      women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection
      methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of
      mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews.
      Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and
      weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS
      analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of different
      perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants in
      31 states and New York City. This report summarizes data for 2000-2001 from eight
      states (Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, and North 
      Carolina) on four behaviors (smoking during pregnancy, alcohol use during
      pregnancy, breastfeeding initiation, and use of the infant back sleep position)
      for which substantial health disparities have been identified previously.
      RESULTS: Although the prevalence of each behavior varied by state, consistent
      patterns were observed among the eight states by age, race, ethnicity, education,
      and income level. Overall, the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy ranged from
      9.0% to 17.4%. Younger (aged <25 years) women, white women, American Indian
      women, non-Hispanic women (except in Hawaii), women with a high school education 
      or less, and women with low incomes consistently reported the highest rates of
      smoking. Overall, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy ranged from 3.4%
      to 9.9%. In seven states, women aged >35 years, non-Hispanic women, women with
      more than a high school education, and women with higher incomes reported the
      highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. Overall, the prevalence of
      breastfeeding initiation ranged from 54.8% to 89.6%. Younger women, black women, 
      women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes reported
      the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation. The size of the black-white
      disparity in breastfeeding varied among states. Overall, use of the back sleep
      position for infants ranged from 49.7% to 74.8%. Use of the back sleep position
      was lowest among younger women, black women, women with lower levels of
      education, and women with low incomes. Ethnic differences in sleep position
      varied substantially by state. INTERPRETATION: PRAMS data can be used to identify
      racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in critical maternal health-related
      behaviors. Although similar general patterns by age, education, and income were
      observed in at least seven states, certain racial and ethnic disparities varied
      by state. Prevalence of the four behaviors among each population often varied by 
      state, indicating the potential impact of state-specific policies and programs.
      PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: States can use PRAMS data to identify populations at
      greatest risk for maternal behaviors that have negative consequences for maternal
      and infant health and to develop policies and plan programs that target
      populations at high risk.sk. Although prevalence data cannot be used to identify 
      causes or interventions to improve health outcomes, they do indicate the
      magnitude of disparities and identify populations that should be targeted for
      intervention. This report indicates a need for wider targeting than is often
      done. The results from this report can aid state and national agencies in
      creating more effective public health policies and programs. The data described
      in this report should serve as a baseline that states can use to measure the
      impact of policies and programs on eliminating these health disparities.

TI  - Low back pain during pregnancy: prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the severity of the low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy, 
      including prevalence, risk factors, impact on daily living, and health provider
      management. METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 36 questions was
      distributed to pregnant women participating in various prenatal care clinics and 
      educational classes in New Haven County, Connecticut. A total of 950 surveys was 
      returned from May 2002 through October 2003. At each site, a researcher was
      available each week to answer questions and gather surveys. RESULTS: Six hundred 
      forty-five (68.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-72%) respondents reported
      experiencing LBP during their current pregnancy. The prevalence was not affected 
      by gestational age (P =.56). Low back pain during the current pregnancy was
      predicted by age (younger women were more likely to develop it; P =.004), history
      of LBP without pregnancy (P =.002), during menstruation (P =.01), and during a
      previous pregnancy (P =.002). The majority of respondents reported that LBP
      during pregnancy caused sleep disturbances (58%; 95% CI 54-62%) and impaired
      daily living (57%; 95% CI 53-62%). Average pain was moderate in severity. Nearly 
      30% of respondents stopped performing at least one daily activity because of pain
      and reported that pain also impaired the performance of other routine tasks. Only
      32% (95% CI 28-36%) of the respondents with LBP during pregnancy informed their
      prenatal care providers of this problem, and only 25% (95% CI 21-28%) of prenatal
      care providers recommended a treatment. CONCLUSION: Low back pain during
      pregnancy is a common problem that causes hardship in this population. Further
      studies are indicated in the areas of prevention and treatment.

TI  - [Postpartum seizures in 2 epileptic patients].
PG  - 281-3
AB  - We report the cases of 2 women with epilepsy who suffered generalized postpartum 
      seizures on the first day after giving birth. The first had a history of febrile 
      convulsions in childhood and had a seizure in the 36th week of gestation due to
      sleep deprivation. She had received epidural analgesia for labor pain. The second
      patient had had her most recent crisis at the beginning of the third trimester of
      pregnancy. Both patients had low serum levels of antiepileptic drugs. The
      pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs can change during pregnancy, making
      seizures more difficult to control. Serum levels of these drugs should therefore 
      be monitored more often, given that a generalized maternal seizure can have
      devastating consequences for the fetus. More careful planning and management of
      pregnancy is necessary for epileptic patients to ensure successful outcomes for
      both mother and fetus.

TI  - Epidemiology and clinical findings of restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 293-9
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor disorder characterized by
      discomfort of and urge to move the legs, primarily during rest or inactivity,
      partial or total relief with movement, with presence or worsening exclusively in 
      the evening. It is a relatively common but frequently unrecognized disorder, with
      a prevalence ranging from 2.5 to 15% of the general population, increasing with
      age and with a female preponderance. The diagnosis is clinical but
      polysomnography is useful to determine its profound impact on sleep (difficulties
      in sleep onset, maintaining sleep during the night, and sleep fragmentation) and 
      for the evidence of periodic legs movements during sleep and wake. RLS is
      generally idiopathic, with familial association in 40-60% of the cases, but may
      also be symptomatic of such associated conditions (secondary forms) as peripheral
      neuropathies, uremia, iron deficiency (with or without anemia), diabetes,
      Parkinson's disease and pregnancy. Response to dopaminergic drugs indicates that 
      dopamine receptors are implicated, and although much progress has been made in
      diagnosis and treatment in the last decade, more is needed for complete
      elucidation of the etiology and pathophysiology of RLS.

TI  - Practice parameters for the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome and 
      periodic limb movement disorder.
PG  - 557-9
AB  - Dopaminergic agents, particularly dopamine agonists, have been used with
      increasing frequency in the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb
      movement disorder. These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to 
      the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic 
      Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999. These practice parameters were
      developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the
      Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are
      based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature
      regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic
      limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned
      by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as
      a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and
      PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists
      pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and 
      PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and
      alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline 
      may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness
      of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific
      recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or
      pregnant women with RLS or PLMD.

TI  - Mother-infant bedsharing is associated with an increase in infant heart rate.
PG  - 507-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary 
      sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was
      to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to
      test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported,
      differences in the same infants. DESIGN: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants
      over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants
      routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a
      room alone. SETTING: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine
      Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for
      routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were 
      more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the
      study. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Analysis of variance indicated that,
      irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary 
      sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions
      were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during
      solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2
      and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were
      independent of basal heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Infant heart rate is affected by
      the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic
      activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained
      by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping
      environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between
      bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the
      physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

TI  - Sleep Problems Across the Life Cycle in Women.
PG  - 319-330
AB  - Across the life cycle of women, the quality and quantity of sleep can be markedly
      impacted by internal (eg, hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms) and external
      (financial and child-care responsibilities; marital issue) factors. This paper
      will outline some of the major phases of the life cycle in women that have been
      associated with sleep problems. The main messages from this paper include 1) that
      very little systematic, large-scale research has been performed in virtually
      every area reviewed; and 2) once identified, the sleep problem is generally best 
      addressed by the standard therapeutic approach, except in the case of pregnant
      and lactating women in which concern for the fetus and child must be considered
      in the treatment decision. This paper is organized into sections that address
      sleep problems associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and
      perimenopause. Anecdotal reports recommend treatment that addresses the specific 
      physical discomfort experienced by the woman (eg, analgesics for premenstrual
      pain, pregnancy pillows for backache, and hormone replacement therapy for hot
      flashes). The importance of developing standard treatment recommendations is
      stressed because the development of chronic insomnia has been linked to
      precipitating events. In addition, primary sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea or
      restless legs syndrome) have been shown to increase during pregnancy and
      menopause, but treatment recommendations may be contraindicated or are not
      specific for women.

TI  - Actigraphic recordings of activity-rest rhythms of neonates born by different
      delivery modes.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - Activity-rest behavior of 20 neonates born vaginally, 18 neonates born by
      medically planned Cesarean section (C-section), and 19 neonates born by medically
      required C-section after labor onset (all born in the thirty-seventh to
      forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in
      the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record and show time patterns of
      activity and rest in neonates by using small wristwatch-like Actiwatch
      actometers. Nursing/feeding times were recorded by using the actometers'
      integrated event marker button. Recordings in both C-section groups were
      performed in the hospital; for neonates born vaginally and for some born by
      C-section, recordings were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In
      addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. 
      To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest
      behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation. Amount of sleep time
      during daytime, nighttime, and 24 h, as well as sleep bouts during the daytime
      and nighttime, were compared. The majority of vaginally born neonates showed a
      distinct circadian frequency in their spectra. In contrast, both groups of
      neonates born by C-section showed significantly less distinct circadian
      frequencies in their spectra. All three groups showed a significant difference in
      amount of nighttime sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at nighttime. There 
      were no differences in the amount of nighttime sleep, daytime sleep, and sleep
      time during 24 h between the groups born by different delivery modes.

TI  - The effect of noise on the health of children.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - The effects of noise on health, especially that of children, were reviewed. (1)
      From the point of view of disturbance of daily living, subjective recognition of 
      "noisiness" is an important issue in relation to the study of noise. Concerning
      the effects of airplane noise on school children, while no effects on the hearing
      level were detected, a significant increase in the complaint of "noisiness" was
      observed. (2) Exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be
      associated with a decrease in the body weight of newborn babies. Moreover, the
      height of 3-year-old boys and girls was found to be significantly decreased in
      association with increase in the environmental noise. (3) Noise levels that
      seemed to have some influence on the sleep of adults did not affect the sleep of 
      children. (4) In a group of children living in noisy districts exhibiting poor
      academic performance, the academic performance seemed to become progressively
      worse as the school grade advanced. (5) No consensus has been arrived at in
      regard to headphone-induced hearing impairment. Researches and studies effective 
      enough to influence policy decisions must be continually conducted in the future,
      with appropriate control for related factors.

TI  - Sex differences in adult suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons emerging late prenatally
      in rats.
PG  - 2488-96
AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is implicated in the control of circadian
      rhythms of gonadal function. Although several structures surrounding the SCN are 
      sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain
      unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually
      differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number
      of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these 
      differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
      (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity
      peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of
      oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 mL peanut oil) from E15 until
      parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on
      postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN
      from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN 
      sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the
      cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher 
      number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and
      caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with
      testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that
      BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal 
      peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously
      unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to
      the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.

TI  - Effects of night work on urinary excretion rates of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin,
      norepinephrine and estriol in pregnant women.
PG  - 268-76
AB  - It has been suggested that shift work, night work in particular, affects worker's
      psychophysical health. However, the effects of night work on the health of
      pregnant women are not physiologically well elucidated. The effects of night work
      on the biological function of pregnant women were studied in the present study.
      Three pregnant and six non-pregnant nurses that engaged in fast-rotating shift
      system cooperated for the study. The 24-h urine samples were collected in two
      time frames, daytime (07:00 to 23:00) and nighttime (23:00 to 07:00) on the day
      shift, the night shift and the days off. Urinary concentrations of
      6-sulfatoxymelatonin and norepinephrine were measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay and estriol by radioimmunoassay. The excretion profiles of
      urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the pregnant and the non-pregnant women were
      altered on the night shift, which might relate the derangement of circadian
      rhythm of melatonin secretion. The urinary norepinephrine level during the night 
      work was considerably higher in the pregnant women, which indicated the presence 
      of higher physical burden in them due to the night work. The urinary estriol
      level was not significantly affected by shift, day/night and individual factors, 
      and the effect of night work on urinary estriol level of the pregnant women
      remained uncertain. The results of the present study suggested that the night
      work of the pregnant shift workers should be much more relieved.

TI  - [Disorders affecting the digestive system during sleep].
PG  - 757-65
AB  - AIMS: In this work we review the major publications dealing with disorders that
      affect the digestive system and how they are related to sleep. Development. Sleep
      disorders occur in 12-25% of the general population and a large percentage of
      these pathologies are related to disorders of the digestive system. We review the
      different pathologies and symptoms linked to the digestive tract that give rise
      to sleep disorders. The study first examined the upper digestive tract, that is, 
      the teeth and teeth grinding, and we then went on to look at gastroesophageal
      reflux, esophageal motility disorders, peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis,
      gastric ulcer, irritable bowel, proctalgia, the extent to which the disorders are
      related to pregnancy, disorders at the paediatric age and eating disorders.
      CONCLUSIONS: Digestive pains during sleep form a heterogeneous clinical picture
      that disrupts patients' sleep and exerts an influence on their quality of daily
      living, which in turn may affect sleep and favour the appearance of pains. To
      date these symptoms have received relatively little attention, but in the few
      studies that have been carried out, it has not been possible to establish with
      any degree of accuracy whether sleep and the digestive system share common
      control mechanisms or not. Research into this type of disorders could help to
      prevent the appearance of the complications that appear in these clinical
      pictures.

TI  - Gender differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing.
PG  - 257-68
AB  - Sleep and sleep disorders are different in several important ways between men and
      women. Because of pregnancy and menopause, women experience changes in sleep that
      may present as clinical problems. In clinical populations, women are more likely 
      to present with insomnia than are men, although their sleep may be better
      preserved. The presentation of sleep apnea in women is distinct from that of men 
      and is less likely to include a "classic" history of witnessed ap-nea or heavy
      snoring. More likely it presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue or
      mood disturbance. There are little data on the effects of different treatments
      for OSA between men and women. OHS is a syndrome that may be as common in women
      as in men. The role of hormones in its pathophysiology is not well-defined.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of bright light therapy for antepartum depression:
      preliminary findings.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bright light therapy was shown to be a promising treatment for
      depression during pregnancy in a recent open-label study. In an extension of this
      work, we report findings from a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study.
      METHOD: Ten pregnant women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly
      assigned from April 2000 to January 2002 to a 5-week clinical trial with either a
      7000 lux (active) or 500 lux (placebo) light box. At the end of the randomized
      controlled trial, subjects had the option of continuing in a 5-week extension
      phase. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal 
      Affective Disorder Version was administered to assess changes in clinical status.
      Salivary melatonin was used to index circadian rhythm phase for comparison with
      antidepressant results. RESULTS: Although there was a small mean group advantage 
      of active treatment throughout the randomized controlled trial, it was not
      statistically significant. However, in the longer 10-week trial, the presence of 
      active versus placebo light produced a clear treatment effect (p =.001) with an
      effect size (0.43) similar to that seen in antidepressant drug trials. Successful
      treatment with bright light was associated with phase advances of the melatonin
      rhythm. CONCLUSION: These findings provide additional evidence for an active
      effect of bright light therapy for antepartum depression and underscore the need 
      for an expanded randomized clinical trial.

TI  - Sleep patterns and fatigue in new mothers and fathers.
PG  - 311-8
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep patterns and fatigue of both 
      mothers and fathers before and after childbirth. The authors used wrist
      actigraphy and questionnaires to estimate sleep and fatigue in 72 couples during 
      their last month of pregnancy and 1st month postpartum. Both parents experienced 
      more sleep disruption at night during the postpartum period as compared to the
      last month of pregnancy. Compared to fathers, with their stable 24-h sleep
      patterns over time, mothers had less sleep at night and more sleep during the day
      after the baby was born. Sleep patterns were also related to parents' work status
      and type of infant feeding. Both parents self-reported more sleep disturbance and
      fatigue during the 1st month postpartum than during pregnancy. Mothers reported
      more sleep disturbance than fathers, but there was no gender difference in
      ratings of fatigue. At both time points, fathers obtained less total sleep than
      mothers when sleep was objectively measured throughout the entire 24-h day.
      Further research is needed to determine the duration of sleep loss for both
      mothers and fathers, to evaluate the effect of disrupted sleep and sleep loss on 
      psychosocial functioning and job performance, and to develop interventions for
      improving sleep patterns of new parents.

TI  - Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: a call to arms.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health
      Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland,
      USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to
      reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were
      addressed: (1). biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the
      toxic effects of alcohol; (2). alcohol and gene-environment interactions that
      affect the health of diverse groups; (3). alcohol pharmacogenetics in
      Mexican-Americans; (4). determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority
      populations; (5). consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium
      studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6). interaction
      between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep,
      nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7). disparities of brain functional reserve
      capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8). alcohol and
      pregnancy disparities; (9). role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10).
      ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11). postmenopausal health
      disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1).
      Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. 
      (2). These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in
      different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3). Differences between and
      among population groups can be critically important for the design and
      interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of
      phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. 
      (4). Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in
      Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for
      these differences. (5). The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found
      in white Hispanic men. (6). Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the
      protective alleles ADH1B(*)2 and ALDH2(*)2 and a relatively high frequency of
      CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7). The incidence
      rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of
      the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking.

TI  - 11- to 15-Year-old children of women who danced during their pregnancy.
PG  - 63-5
AB  - AIM: To determine whether high levels of maternal physical activity (dancing
      during pregnancy), influenced the offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four
      women (32 of whom had continued to dance for at least 2 months after the
      beginning of pregnancy) filled in a questionnaire to assess the health and
      behavior of their offspring, now 11-15 years of age. RESULTS: More children born 
      from women who had continued to dance during pregnancy needed to be rocked to
      sleep during their first year (p < 0.05). More children in the study group played
      musical instruments (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the
      groups regarding other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The greater need to be rocked to 
      fall asleep and the attitude to play musical instruments recorded in the children
      of dancers may be related to prenatal maternal movement. But they may also be due
      to other causes as discussed.

TI  - Management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
PG  - 608-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United
      States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing 
      women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General
      guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American 
      Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are
      applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge
      regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum 
      period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components
      of the illness. METHOD: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the
      management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood
      stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. RESULTS:
      The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant
      challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are 
      human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium
      may have been overestimated in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Since treatment can be
      managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the
      issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has
      childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional
      research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum
      women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to
      offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and
      cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in
      the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include 
      multiple collaborating centers.

TI  - Ontogeny of sleep and awake states in relation to breathing in preterm infants.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - This review will focus on the development of behavioural states and breathing
      during early developmental stages prior to term gestation. Although these
      behavioural states are immature during early development, their cyclicity is
      clearly seen. Preterm infants characteristically have a large proportion of
      indeterminate sleep and small amount of wakefulness. Whereas oxygenation is
      relatively stable during active and quiet sleep in ventilated preterm infants,
      indeterminate sleep and arousals are associated with hypoxaemic episodes.
      Arousals have also been linked to apnoea in spontaneously breathing infants.
      Since well-defined sleep cycles are beneficial for the oxygenation of preterm
      infants, we should explore ways to promote their natural sleep while they are
      exposed to neonatal intensive care. Care practices such as clustering procedures,
      kangaroo care and optimal positioning have been shown to improve the integrity of
      sleep. Optimizing the sleep cycling might improve the long-term outcome of
      preterm infants. More studies in this area are clearly needed.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and physical ability among pregnant women with and
      without back pain in late pregnancy.
PG  - 351-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Back pain during late pregnancy is a frequent clinical problem. Very 
      little is known about the impact of this symptom on the quality of life among
      pregnant women with back pain. OBJECTIVES: To study the influence of back pain
      and physical ability on quality of life in late pregnancy. METHODS: One hundred
      and sixty women in the 34th-37th week of pregnancy and attending two different
      midwife receptions, were asked to fill out questionnaires including: general
      questions about background factors, the Disability Rating Index (DRI) to score
      the physical ability, and The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) for assessing
      health-related quality of life. Two groups were defined, with and without back
      pain. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six (85%) out of 160 screened women
      returned the questionnaire for evaluation. The 69 (51%) women with back pain
      rated significantly (p < 0.05) higher on the DRI; on NHP part I, sub scales
      sleep, energy, pain, physical functioning and total score; and on NHP part II,
      aspects occupation, ability to perform jobs around the house, social life and
      hobbies compared with women without back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of back 
      pain the pregnant women studied featured lower quality of life (QOL) compared
      with published data on healthy women. Among the women with back problems, who had
      the most impaired QOL, the factors affecting QOL were mostly related to physical 
      ability.

TI  - A multivariate "time based" analysis of SIDS risk factors.
PG  - 267-71
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the influence of analytical design on the variability of
      published results in studies of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: The
      results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622
      control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis
      were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with
      sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables
      relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth 
      to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep 
      period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last
      sleep period. RESULTS: As additional variables are added, previously published
      SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, > or =3
      previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in
      pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation,
      being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week
      before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in
      the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many
      significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal 
      age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to
      sleep prone for the last sleep period caused > or =3 previous live births and a
      reduced birth weight to become significant. CONCLUSION: The variables found to be
      significant in a case-control study, depend on what is included in a multivariate
      model.

TI  - Umbilical venous volume flow and fetal behavioral states in the normally
      developing fetus.
PG  - 138-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between umbilical venous (UV) volume
      flow and fetal behavioral states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) in normal
      pregnancies at 36-40 weeks of gestation. METHODS: Fetal behavioral states were
      established in 17 normal pregnancies by means of combined assessment of fetal
      heart rate patterns (FHRP), and fetal eye and body movements. UV vessel area
      (mm(2)) as obtained by tracing the inner vessel area using Labview and Imaq
      Vision software and UV time-averaged flow velocity (mm/s Doppler) were multiplied
      to calculate UV volume flow (mL/min) including flow/kg fetus. The pulsatility
      index (PI) in the umbilical artery was also determined. In each woman, all
      parameters were measured between three and five times in each behavioral state.
      Data are reported as mean +/- 1 SD and analyzed by paired t-test. RESULTS: No
      statistically significant behavioral-state-related changes were observed for UV
      time-averaged velocity and UV volume flow, resulting in UV volume flow/kg fetus
      of 69.1 +/- 14.9 mL/min*kg at 1F and 71.6 +/- 12.1 mL/min*kg at 2F (not
      significant). A statistically significant increase (P = 0.02) was established for
      UV cross-sectional area (46.4 +/- 8.6 mm(2) vs. 49.0 +/- 10.1 mm(2)) and for
      fetal heart rate (FHR) from 134.2 +/- 10.3 bpm in 1F to 144.2 +/- 7 bpm in 2F.
      Umbilical artery PI was not significantly different between the two behavioral
      states. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of high venous vessel wall compliance, the
      significant increase in UV cross-sectional area during fetal behavioral state 2F 
      may be determined by a rise in mean venous pressure. The significant rise in FHR 
      may reflect increased fetal cardiac output during state 2F while the resistance
      at the hepato-ductal pathway remains relatively constant with the purpose of
      meeting raised energy demands during the active sleep state. This is further
      supported by the observed trend towards an increase in UV volume flow.

TI  - [Prevention of sudden infant death in Germany].
PG  - 874-80
AB  - In Germany there are several committed which however haven't got together yet in 
      order to set up a systematic health education campaign. So far the knowledge of
      other professional fields like that of graphic designers, specialists of
      communication and public health scientists hasn't been sufficiently used to
      familiarize nearly all pregnant women, parents, grandparents and babysitters with
      those known medical subject matters. Hopefully paediatricians, gynaecologists,
      children's nurses, midwives, breast-feeding consultants, paediatric preventive
      assistants, consultants for pregnant women who smoke and mothers in general will 
      soon start to get going an effective lasting and possibly nationwide preventive
      campaign which will be supported by the competent social ministries and financing
      authorities, self-help groups, graphic designers, specialists for communication
      and public health scientists. The aim should be to reduce the amount of sudden
      infant death cases to or even below the level of The Netherlands (minimum figure 
      in 2002: 0.11 SID cases per 1.000 live births). Already in 1972-15 years before
      the beginning of the Dutch preventive campaign--in former East Germany a
      ministerial instruction had advised mothers not to let infants sleep on prone
      position. Historically, the promotion of infants sleeping on prone position seems
      to have been a tragic break of tradition in the western world in between 1970 and
      1990, as infants had been put to sleep almost only on their back during the past 
      centuries. If we compare East and West Germany concerning the influence on the
      ways of looking after infants since the 1960th of the last century it has become 
      clear that the advice of medical authorities mainly effects the way of nursing
      regardless of the political system. More and more, paediatricians,
      gynaecologists, midwives and children's nurses should become aware of this
      responsibility.

TI  - Arterial oxygen tension during sleep in the third trimester of pregnancy.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity
      (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar difference for oxygen and, in 
      the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related
      disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during
      sleep. OBJECTIVES: Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in 
      pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 21 pregnant women at the 36th
      week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the partial pressure of 
      oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO2) in the supine and sitting positions. METHODS:
      We tested 21 healthy pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation. Arterial
      samples were taken in the sitting position. Complete polysomnography was
      performed in all of the pregnant women. Before the polysomnography arterial
      samples were taken in the supine and sitting positions and then every 2 h until
      termination of the study. RESULTS: We did not find any correlation between
      SaO2/PaO2 levels and apnea, hypopnea or percent of rapid eye movement (REM)
      sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during
      pregnancy (5.81 +/- 2.1 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) than postpartum
      (12.1 +/- 2.7 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) (p < 0.001), which may be
      due to the raised level of progesterone. The PaO2 levels in the supine position
      were significantly lower than in the sitting position at 36 weeks of gestation (p
      < 0.001). No differences were found between PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine
      positions postpartum (p < 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results we conclude
      that 1) the frequency of apnea and hypopnea in pregnancy was significantly lower 
      than postpartum, and 2) a significant difference in PaO2 levels in the sitting
      and supine positions was observed at 36 weeks of gestation.
