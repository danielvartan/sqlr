## Overview

`sqlr` is an R package that provides a complete and consistent toolkit
to process Systematic Quantitative Literature Reviews (SQLR), a method
of systematic reviews presented by Catherine Pickering and Jason Byrne
in [2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2013.841651). The aim of
`sqlr` is to facilitate the work of PhD candidates and other
early-career researchers with evidence synthesis while also helping with
research reproducibility.
