N2  - In recent years the number of functional neuroimaging studies on adolescence has exploded. These studies have led to important new insights about the relation between functional brain development and behavior. However, special consideration is warranted when working with adolescents. In this review, we review variables, including pubertal stage, sleep patterns and pregnancy, which are particularly relevant for developmental cognitive neuroscience studies involving adolescents. Consideration of the unique challenges associated with adolescence will help the growing field of developmental neuroimaging standardize procedures and will eventually facilitate interpretation across studies.

N2  - This chapter discusses Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and its management in premenopausal women. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent sleep-induced collapsibility of the pharyngeal airway. Normal adult women (ages 20-45 years) are a cohort of women in whom menstrual cycles, the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and lactation are associated with a varied hormonal environment. These differences in the hormonal status may in turn potentially change the likelihood for the development of OSAHS in premenopausal women. The clinical spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing includes apnea, hypopneas, and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by L. M. Glynn (see record 2012-27387-005). Glynn presented a controlled, large-sample longitudinal study to assess verbal memory performances in primiparous (PRIM) and multiparous (MULT) women in different stages of pregnancy. The behavior examined was a paired-association learning task, which consists of recalling word-pair lists presented verbally. Glynn's results showed that PRIMs outperformed MULTs across gestation and that a cumulative effect of multiple pregnancies was associated with poor performance in the last weeks of pregnancy. Further examinations of diverse forms of maternal memory or of adult reproduction-related developmental offspring-relevant tasks are required to comprehensively address the wholesale renovation of the female brain into the maternal brain. The current authors conclude that Glynn’s article is a very good start, and it raises many questions worth following up in humans, other mammals, and additional postreproduction models.

N2  - Presents a case report of a 34-year-old married, requested urgent evaluation in the 10th week of a wanted pregnancy. From the fourth week of gestation, she had suffered from intractable vomiting and severe anxiety with bouts of tearfulness she found frightening. The patient was anhedonic and unable to focus on work. She also reported awakening earlier than normal and diurnal mood variation, with mornings being her worst time. She had no history of hallucinations or delusions or periods of discreet mood elevation. She denied current substance use. this patient’s anhedonia, diurnal variation, sleep disorder, and agitation suggested either a severe but unspecified anxiety disorder, or depression with melancholic features. Research suggests that genetically based individual sensitivity to normal hormonal variation contributes to psychiatric disorders that arise during pregnancy.

N2  - Across the life cycle of women, the quality and quantity of sleep can be markedly impacted by both internal (e.g., hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms) and external (financial, marital, and child care responsibilities) factors. This chapter will outline some of the major phases of the adult life cycle in women that have been associated with sleep problems. The main messages from this chapter include that sleep disturbance and sleep disorders are common in women and increase across the lifespan for a variety of reasons; once identified, the sleep problem is generally best addressed by the standard therapeutic approach, although special cases arise in pregnant and lactating women due to concern for the fetus and child; and little systematic, large-scale research has been performed in virtually every area reviewed. This chapter is organized into sections that address sleep problems associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and the perimenopause.

N2  - Sleep disorders affect people at all stages of life. For women, sleep complaints may vary by hormonal status as well as life stage. Certain broad perceptions about sleep and sleep disorders are supported by population surveys. In earlier research, most study populations that included women did not differentiate findings by gender. Even in studies of women with sleep disorders, the potential effects of hormonal condition or reproductive status were not identified. These topics have been more frequently addressed in recent years. Women develop more sleep problems during pregnancy and with menopause. Postmenopausal and elderly woman have more insomnia complaints while sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases in the peri- and postmenopausal population. This chapter provides an introduction to recent findings on sleep and women from menarche to menopause. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This chapter reviews restless leg syndrome and its management, particularly as found in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), commonly affects women and can significantly affect sleep and quality of life. The etiology of the disorder is multifactorial, but in women it may be influenced by higher rates of anemia and sex hormone levels. Treatment includes correction of iron deficiency, if present, and both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Current first-line agents include the non-ergotamine dopamine agonists, ropinerole and pramipexole. The use of these agents in women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should be carefully considered due to potential risks to the fetus.

N2  - Gestational restless legs syndrome (gRLS) is a common and often unrecognized symptom constellation that produces discomfort, sleep fragmentation, and daytime somnolence. The etiology of gRLS remains undetermined. When discovered, other conditions that can produce gRLS should be investigated, including diabetes, iron deficiency, hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, and neuropathy. A number of pharmacologic therapies are available, though their use in pregnancy poses many obstacles. Iron and folate supplementation should be implemented. A review of concurrent medications and limiting agents that may exaggerate RLS can often produce improvement. Non-pharmacological strategies are the mainstay of treatment. Although most women will have resolution of RLS symptoms in the weeks immediately prior to or following birth, there is an increased risk of symptom recurrence with future pregnancies or later in life.

N2  - Pregnancy is a period of profound physiologic change. During gestation, alterations in sleep and breathing are common. In some cases, these normal physiologic alterations may result in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The purpose of this chapter is to describe the normal physiologic changes seen in sleep and breathing during pregnancy, and discuss the pathologic implications of these alterations as they relate to snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

N2  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman’s life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

N2  - Sleep dysfunction is one of the primary symptoms reported by patients with psychiatric disorders, specifically those suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders. Conversely, primary insomnia and other sleep dysfunctions produce symptoms of mood disturbance that are similar to those reported by patients with psychiatric disorders. Because of this overlap in the symptoms and treatments for insomnias and psychiatric disorders, it is important for clinicians to be able to accurately identify the root cause of sleep dysfunction in individual patients in order to optimize treatment. Part of the Oxford Psychiatry Library series, Sleep Disorders, Second Edition provides clinicians with an overview of the current understanding of sleep physiology, the pathophysiology of sleep disturbance, and the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. This second edition includes new sections covering sleep problems in children and the elderly, sleep in pregnancy and menopause, and new algorithms from the British Association of Psychopharmacology's (BAP's) new Consensus Guidelines on the management of sleep disorders.

N2  - Comments on an article by Diane M. Blyton et al. (see record 2013-13435-006). In their article, Blyton et al. reported a series of three small studies of fetal activity in women with and without preeclampsia. They found objective evidence of reduced fetal movements in women with preeclampsia, many of whom had sleep disordered breathing, and improvement in fetal movements following intervention with continuous positive airway pressure. The current author discusses the results and limitations of the Blyton et al. study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0–4 years. Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11–17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0–4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments.

N2  - Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n−3) is highly important during pregnancy for optimal development and functioning of fetal neural tissue. Infant ability to organize sleep and wake states following parturition is highly associated with later developmental outcomes. The impact of maternal DHA intake on sleep organization has not been previously investigated. Aims: To examine the effect of a DHA-containing functional food consumed during pregnancy on early neurobehavioral development as assessed by infant sleep patterning in the first 48 postnatal hours. Study design: A longitudinal, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design was used. Subjects: Women (18–35 y) with no pregnancy complications consumed a cereal-based functional food (92 kcal) containing 300 mg DHA an average of 5 d/week or placebo bars (n = 27 DHA, n = 21 Placebo). The intervention began at 24 weeks gestation and continued until delivery (38–40 weeks). Outcome measures: Infant sleep/wake states were measured on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) using a pressure sensitive mattress recording respiration and body movements. Results: Using ANCOVA and controlling for ethnic variation, there were significant group differences in arousals in quiet sleep on D1 (P = 0.006) and D2 (P = 0.011) with fewer arousals in the DHA intervention group compared to the placebo group. Similarly, arousals in active sleep on D1 were significantly lower in the DHA-intervention group (P = 0.012) compared to the placebo group. Conclusions: We conclude that increased prenatal supply of dietary DHA has a beneficial impact on infant sleep organization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aims and objectives: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women’s postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera’s physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design: Cross-sectional study design. Methods: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0–12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women’s socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results: The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions: Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To describe the physical and social environment of sleep self-management in postpartum socioeconomically disadvantaged women. Design: Descriptive, exploratory design. Setting: Participants were recruited in the hospital after giving birth. Data were collected in participant homes after discharge. Participants: Postpartum women on Medicaid with normal healthy infants. Methods: Participants completed a survey about features within their physical and social sleep environment at 2 weeks postpartum. Participants then completed 3 days and nights of sleep diaries at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum to document perceived awakenings, select sleep hygiene practices, bed sharing, and reasons for sleep disruption. Results: The sleep environments of participants were dynamic from night to night. Bed sharing was common with nearly one half of participants sharing with a partner, approximately 25% with the infant, and 20% with older children. Fifty-two percent of participants slept with the television on part (31%) or all (69%) of the night. Eighty-five percent of participants drank caffeine and 24% smoked. Conclusions: These results inform theory-driven postpartum sleep interventions. Modifications to the physical and social sleep environment that attend specifically to how sleep hygiene and environmental factors are manifested in the postpartum period have the potential to improve sleep for socioeconomically disadvantaged women. Future research is needed to articulate which changes can be effectively self-managed by mothers through nursing interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Circadian rhythm disorders represent an important component underlying the pathology of depression. One of the subtypes of depression, in which these disorders may play a crucial role, is the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The bright light therapy (BLT) has been reported as a novel, promising treatment method for SAD since 1984, and most of the data revealing its efficacy has been referred to adult patients, without comorbid disorders. However, in the recent years, more and more reports have been presented, which confirm the usefulness of BLT in some specific subpopulations of patients, including children, adolescents and pregnant women. The present review summarizes the applications of BLT in antepartum depression, childhood and adolescence depression as well as in patients suffering from eating disorders. Although the body of evidence is still too small to recommend the use of BLT as the first line of treatment for the depression or eating disorders in these patient subpopulations; it appears that BLT may be a useful alternative or adjunctive therapy for these diseases. However, the specific clinical applications of BLT in these areas need further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A population-based questionnaire study of 2,816 women was conducted in week 32 of pregnancy to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for insomnia and depressive symptoms. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms. The prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9%, and mean BIS score 17.5 (SD = 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 10) was 14.6%. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with sleep durations10 hours, sleep efficiency <75%, daytime impairment, and long sleep onset latency. Pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain was associated with insomnia, but not with depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods: An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results: Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p = 0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p = 0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions: Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

N2  - This study assessed the links between maternal sleep and mothers’ perceptions of their attachment relationship with their infant among women at risk for postpartum depression by virtue of having been depressed during pregnancy. Sixty-two mothers completed sleep diaries and questionnaires at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Regression analyses, controlling for depression severity and infant temperament, revealed significant prospective correlation between maternal shorter total sleep time at 3 months and lower scores on a mother–infant attachment questionnaire at 6 months. At 6 months, the longer time mothers were awake tending to their infants the lower were their attachment scores. The findings suggest that improving sleep of mothers who suffered from prenatal depression may have a positive effect on mothers’ self-reported relationship with their infants.

N2  - Objective: To assess characteristics of short sleepers and long sleepers and to assess association between sleep duration and central obesity in a population-based sample of women. Method: Non-pregnant women ⩾ 20 years that were randomly selected from the population-registry of Uppsala, Sweden, answered a questionnaire (n = 6461) including questions on sleeping habits and somatic disorders. Results: There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and waist circumference. Short sleeping women (< 5h) had a waist circumference of 89.2 ± 14.9 cm (mean ± SD) decreasing to 82.9 ± 11.9 cm for women sleeping 7–< 8h and increasing to 89.0 ± 16.7cm for women sleeping ⩾ 10h. Both short sleepers and long sleepers were more often physically inactive, smokers, ill or taking medication, and psychologically distressed than normal sleepers (6– < 9h). In women < 50 years both short and long sleep duration were risk factors for central obesity. Short sleep duration remained a risk factor for central obesity, whereas the association with long sleep duration did not reach statistical significance after adjustments. Conclusions: Short sleepers and long sleepers showed differences in characteristics compared to normal sleepers. Furthermore, we showed an independent association between short sleep duration and central obesity, which was strongest in younger women. It is important to identify short sleepers, especially in younger women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Since 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended a separate but proximate sleep surface for infants (AAP, 2005). However, racial differences in the prevalence of bed-sharing and infant mortality (especially as a result of SIDS or unsafe sleep) continue. Limited research has examined predictors of bed-sharing by racial group, especially the AAP's 2005 policy statement against it. The purpose of this study was to explore maternal-infant bed-sharing and infant sleep position for African-Americans and Whites in a sample of 2,530 respondents (822 African-American and 1,708 Whites) to the Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS), a stratified sample of linked survey and birth certificate data between 2007 and 2010. Significantly more African-Americans (70.5%) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.5%),  z = 56.67, SEM = 0.005, p < .001 (one-tailed). Factors associated with bed-sharing varied by race. In the final models, for African-Americans, a higher likelihood of bed-sharing was associated with ≥ 16 years of education (Odds Ratio[OR]: 2.540, 95% CI: 1.098-5.875), 13-15 years of education (OR: 1.924, 95% CI: 1.129-3.278), partner-related stress (OR: 1.859, 95% CI: 1.272-2.715), currently breastfeeding (OR: 1.598, 95% CI: 1.012-2.522), non-supine infant sleep (OR: 1.573, 95% CI: 1.077-2.297), and maternal age (OR: 0.963, 95% CI: 0.931-0.995). When Medicaid as method of payment was included, it reduced the likelihood of bed-sharing (OR: 0.550, 95% CI: 0.372-0.814). For Whites, bed-sharing was associated with currently breastfeeding (OR: 2.444, 95% CI: 1.939-3.081), income of $10,000-$14,999 (OR: 1.833, 95% CI: 1.004-3.344), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR: 1.704, 95% CI: 1.234-2.351), being unmarried (OR: 1.667, 95% CI: 1.184-2.346), non-supine infant sleep (OR: 1.407, 95% CI: 1.069-1.852), and partner-related stress (OR: 1.381, 95% CI: 1.058-1.802). Needing money for food was also associated with bed-sharing (OR: 1.575, 95% CI: 1.158-2.143). Overall, subtle differences in the factors at play for African-American and White families who bed-share were demonstrated. Practice implications include culturally-relevant discussions and interventions. In-depth investigation of the family level context of bed-sharing, the ecology of infant sleep, and information received by families is suggested. These results help inform development of a targeted, culturally sensitive approach to educating families on sleep-related infant safety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Nearly 13% of infants born in the United States each year are preterm—that is, born before 37 weeks gestation. Although improvements in clinical care have contributed to survival rates that now exceed 85%, premature infants are at high risk for motor, sensory, cognitive and behavioral disabilities. In order to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent these adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, we must first understand the nature of cerebral injury associated with premature birth and the mechanisms by which it leads to altered brain development. A baboon (Papio papio) model of preterm birth was used to evaluate cerebral development from 90 days of gestation (dg) to term (∼ 185 dg). Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained on fixed brains. In addition, histopathology was obtained. Analysis of this model led to the following conclusions. (1) MRI/DTI findings during brain maturation closely paralleled those from live premature infants, indicating that the preterm baboon is a good model of human development. (2) Both qualitative MRI scoring and quantitative analysis of DTI parameters correlated with pathologic abnormalities in cerebral white matter. In particular, reduced oligodendrocyte number was associated with increased radial diffusivity and decreased diffusion anisotropy, while astrocytosis corresponded to increased apparent diffusion coefficient. (3) The birth weight of control animals correlated strongly with cerebral development as measured with MRI/DTI, with lower weight corresponding to less mature brain. Since birth weight may be an indicator of the quality of the intrauterine environment, it may better predict cerebral growth and maturation than gestational age. (4) Clinical therapies differentially affect cerebral development and provide opportunities for neuroprotection. Positive pressure and high frequency ventilation were associated with more cerebral injury (as measured using both histology and MRI/DTI) than nasal continuous positive airway pressure. (5) High-dose erythropoietin, a novel neuroprotective agent, had no adverse effects on cerebral development and may increase the potential for cerebral repair by inducing proliferation of cells in the subventricular zone.

N2  - The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods, but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery. Demographic and obstetric information was collected via questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24 hours, however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors. Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week, although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon, while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods during immediate postpartum, and this redistribution raises questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after giving birth.

The design of this study was descriptive and correlational. The samples of this study were secondary school students in five education districts of Esfahan including 360 students selected by multistage random sampling. Baumrinds parenting style questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and a demographic questionnaire were used for collecting data. Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis and test were used for data analysis. Findings showed that physical symptoms (p < 0/01), anxiety sleep disturbance (p < 0/01), impairment in social interaction (p < 0/01), major depression (p < 0/01), mental health (p < 0/01), and academic achievement had significant relationship. The permissive approach to child rearing and academic achievement of students have no significant relationship (p < 0/05). The authoritarian and authoritative parenting styles were significantly related to students achievements (p < 0/01). Mental health components and methods of child rearing and education of fathers and mothers were not significantly different (p < 0/05). The difference was significant among the different groups in terms of mental health components and methods of child bearing (p < 0/05). Mental health components and methods of child bearing between girls and boys were significant only in the authoritarian parenting style. Regression analysis showed that the methods of parenting and mental health variables predict academic achievements of secondary school students (R = 0/603 and P = 0/001).

N2  - Study Objectives: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder. Design: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Patients or Participants: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). Measurements and Results: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). Conclusions: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

N2  - Dopamine agonists are commonly used in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, Parkinson’s disease, and restless leg syndrome. While generally well tolerated, these agents can cause psychiatric adverse side effects including depression, somnolence, anorexia, anxiety, insomnia, impaired concentration, nervousness, hallucinations, nightmares, psychosis, and mania. Here we present a case of a cabergoline-associated manic episode. Ms. C, a 45-year-old woman, was evaluated 8 months prior to presentation for a 2-year history of amenorrhea. Ms. C was not sexually active, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had never been pregnant. Three days prior to presentation, Ms. C was noted to have increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and to be planning overly-ambitious projects. On the day of presentation, she reported racing thoughts, stated that she was on a divine mission and began intruding into ongoing classes to recruit students to join her. This case suggests a possible adverse drug reaction. Although the circumstances of her case suggest that cabergoline may have contributed to the precipitation of her mania, Ms. C has not been re-challenged with cabergoline, so causality cannot be proven. In conclusion, while cabergoline is generally a safe and effective method of reducing prolactin levels, it is associated with psychiatric side effects, including mania. Physicians should carefully screen patients for a personal as well as family history of psychiatric illness before initiating therapy. At-risk patients may benefit from more frequent monitoring and cessation of therapy at the earliest safe juncture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Taiwanese women. Methods: We enrolled 461 pregnant women (18–45 years) admitted at Mackay Memorial Hospital for delivery from September 2010 to May 2011. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included assessment of RLS diagnostic criteria, and questions related to RLS. Results: The overall prevalence rate of RLS among the study participants was 10.4%; 2.8% were categorized as having chronic RLS. Participants without RLS reported higher folate and iron supplement consumption than those with RLS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of RLS with anemia and peptic ulcer disease. Participants with transient RLS during pregnancy reported more regular coffee consumption before pregnancy, and better sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, than those with chronic RLS. Overall, 81.2% of RLS sufferers reported sleep disturbances. Conclusions: Our study revealed highly prevalent but poorly recognized RLS among Taiwanese pregnant women. The identification of predictors such as medical comorbidities, and protectors such as folate and iron supplements, is warranted for obstetric RLS. In most cases, symptoms began during the second or third trimester and resolved within a week after delivery. Restricted coffee consumption before pregnancy is encouraged, but further evidence is needed to support this recommendation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period. Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function.

N2  - Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences. Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism.

N2  - This narrative review explains the development of excess weight gain in babies and children. It takes a life course approach which includes genetics, pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood. The paper focuses on feeding behaviours, physical activity, parental influences and the wider social and environmental context. Risk factors which can cumulatively lead to excess childhood weight gain include: under- or overweight during pregnancy; the presence of diabetes during pregnancy; low or high birth weight; having obese parents; early weaning; prolonged formula feeding; rapid weight gain in the first year; disinhibited eating patterns and the consistent availability of energy dense food at home; feeding practices which are not responsive to the child’s cues; insufficient sleep among preschool children; sedentary parents; low parental education; living in poor socio-economic circumstances; absence, or perceived absence, of safe play areas; parents who lack time or confidence to authoritatively parent; environments where there is poor access to affordable lower energy dense foods; and parents who do not accept that excess weight is a health problem. Recommendations for health professionals are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Our research aimed to build on this idea of a comparative focus, by exploring maternal ideas and behavior about infant sleep, about falling asleep and awakening, in two different Italian towns of northern and southern Italy. In doing so, we wished to evaluate if there were differences in two cultural contexts of the same country. Two different towns, Ferrara in the north of Italy and Cosenza in the south, separated by a distance of some 1000 miles, were identified as quite contrasting Italian cultural settings. These towns express different cultural backgrounds related to their different economic, historical, and social traditions. We hypothesized that the two towns might express different cultural patterns of infant care. The timing of the questionnaires was chosen with different aims. Interview One, which was administered to pregnant women a few days before delivery of their child, was intended to check maternal ideas at a time when ideas about the infants and their sleep are more socially rooted, not yet negotiated through the experience of interacting with, and knowing their own infants, and their sleep. Interview Two, given to mothers of one-month-old infants, was addressed to mothers whose ideas and concerns might have been influenced by their relationship with the infant. Our first hypothesis was that the two groups of mothers would have different ideas about infants falling asleep and about their awakenings. Our second hypothesis was that the two groups of mothers would use different practices for inducing sleep; that the Ferrara mothers (in the north of Italy) would be more "distal" oriented, whereas the mothers of Cosenza (in the south of Italy) would be more "proximal" oriented. Our third hypothesis was that even over the short period of one month, we would see some changes occurring between the ideas and practices expressed in the first questionnaire and those expressed in the second.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep–wake behavior following AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6 g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4–9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were sham-intubated (S group). On PD52–80, they were instrumented for tethered electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the recording procedures. Sleep–wake behavior was then recorded during one 24 h-long session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored in 10 s epochs during 6 h of the lights-on (rest) and 6 h of the lights-off (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly lower (4.7 ± 0.9 (SE) vs. 8.2 ± 0.9; p p = 0.07) in AE than S rats (N = 6/group). During the rest period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (p = 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep–wake behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a non-pregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in brain regions known to regulate the sleep/wake cycle and body temperature might reflect altered rhythms in these overt functions. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS in early pregnant and diestrous rats in the medial septum (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca (VDB and HDB), perifornical lateral hypothalamus (LH), and ventrolateral, medial, and median preoptic areas (VLPO, MPA, and MnPO, respectively). In the pregnant animals, FOS expression was reduced and the daily rhythms of expression were lost or attenuated in the MS, VDB, and LH, areas known to support wakefulness, and in the MPA, a brain region that may coordinate sleep/wake patterns with temperature changes. However, despite the well-documented differences in sleep patterns between diestrous and pregnant rats, reproductive state did not affect FOS expression in the VLPO or MnPO, two brain regions in which FOS expression usually correlates with sleep. These data indicate that plasticity in sleep/wake patterns during early pregnancy may be driven by a reduction in wakefulness-promotion by the brain, rather than by an increase in sleep drive.

N2  - Cognitive and mood changes during pregnancy and postpartum have been subjectively reported by women and have also been objectively measured. However, evidence relating to the relationship between hormone levels and these changes is sparse and contradictory. The studies presented in this thesis were undertaken to investigate the possible influence of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), testosterone (T), cortisol (CORT) and prolactin (PRL) levels on cognitive functioning and mood during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period. In Study 1, pregnant women were tested on a battery of neuropsychological tests once during late pregnancy and once during the early postpartum period and their scores were compared to non-pregnant controls. Results showed that the pregnancy group had significantly lower scores than the controls on tasks of verbal recall and processing speed both during the pregnancy and the postpartum test times. CORT levels were significantly associated, in an inverted-U function, with verbal recall scores during pregnancy and postpartum and with spatial abilities at postpartum. During pregnancy, negative linear associations were observed between PRL and executive function and paragraph recall scores along with an inverted-U association with paragraph recall scores. At postpartum, E2 and CORT were negatively associated, in a linear fashion, with attention scores. In Study 2, linear and non-linear associations between hormones and mood during pregnancy and postpartum were investigated while taking into consideration psychosocial factors previously found to be related to mood changes during these reproductive periods. Perceived stress, social support from friends, social support from a significant other and sleep were found to be significant predictors of mood scores. During pregnancy, a small positive linear correlation was obtained between levels of PRL and lower mood scores. At the postpartum visit, moderate U-shaped correlations were found between mood disturbances and level of E2 and P while smaller increases in the Cortisol Awakening Response were associated with poorer mood. Collectively, the present studies provide new evidence that aspects of cognitive function and mood are altered during pregnancy and the postpartum periods and may be modulated, at least in part, by hormonal and psychosocial factors during these reproductive events.

N2  - Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population. Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women’s Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS. Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach’s alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1α = .754; Factor 2α = .524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established. Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women.

N2  - Sleep disruption has been suggested to contribute to postpartum mood, but few studies have explored differences in this relationship between nulliparous and multiparous mothers. This study compared the interaction of sleep and mood as a function of parity. Thirty-five nulliparous and 34 multiparous mothers completed questionnaires on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within 2 weeks postpartum. Mood and objective sleep were better in multiparas than in nulliparas after delivery. However, other than a stronger association between subjective sleep and stress in nulliparous mothers, the relationship between sleep and mood did not differ significantly between the two groups. This suggests that parity might play only a limited role in the interaction between sleep and mood during the immediate postpartum period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To examine the continuity and discontinuity of trouble sleeping behaviors (TSB) from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood in a community-based prospective birth cohort study. Methods: The original study comprised 7223 mother–offspring pairs who were followed prospectively at pregnancy, 6 months, 5, 14 and 21 years post-delivery. Participant numbers differ by follow-up stages. There were 3184 offspring for whom we have consistently collected information on TSB retrospectively at 2–4 years, and prospectively at 14 and 21 years of age. Results: These comprised maternal-reported offspring TSB at 2–4 years and 14 years, and offspring-reported trouble sleeping at 14 and 21 years. One in two children had persistent trouble sleeping from 2–4 to 14 years and two-thirds from 14 to 21 years. In the adjusted analysis, compared with 2–4-years-old children with no trouble sleeping, those who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) times more likely to have trouble sleeping at 21 years. Similarly, adolescents who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.27) times more likely to experience trouble sleeping at 21 years. Conclusions: There is a continuity of TSB from early childhood through adolescence and young adulthood, although the persistence of TSB is strongest from adolescence to young adulthood. Interventions improving sleep in young children may prevent longer term difficulties in adolescents and young adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of a 7-year-old boy, who presented with a history of developmental delays and learning problems. A neuropsychological assessment was requested by his parents and school to understand more about his cognitive functioning, and to assist in behavioral support and school placement. Alex was born following an uncomplicated pregnancy, and was full term, weighing 8 pounds, and 2 ounces. There were perinatal complications, including low sugar and jaundice, which resulted in a week-long stay in the NICU for light therapy. Upon discharge from the hospital, he had some difficulty with latching on to the breast, and was bottle fed soy formula. He did not sleep through the night until age 2, which resolved after having a tonsilar-adenoidectomy. He has been diagnosed with asthma, and takes occasional asthma medications. Parents opted to try stimulant medication at one point, but they felt that Alex became "zombie like," and very emotionally labile, so they stopped the medication. With the exception of occasional flare-ups of asthma, Alex is now healthy and well nourished. He sleeps soundly, around 10 hours per night, and is refreshed upon waking. On the basis of the assessment of Alex's cognitive, academic, adaptive skills, and behavior functioning, he was diagnosed with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), and ADHD. His measured Full Scale IQ score of 60 falls in the extremely low range, or what is considered mild mental retardation, according to the DSM-IV-TR. Furthermore, he shows concurrent deficits in adaptive functioning when compared with peers of a similar age, in areas including communication, self-care, social skills, self-direction, and functional academic skills.

N2  - Presents a case report of an 8-year, 8-month-old child who lives with her parents and 3 younger siblings in a Midwestern U.S. city. Regarding emotional and behavioral functioning, Sarah reportedly exhibits problems with anxiety and difficulties with adjustment. She was described as "shy" and tends to avoid interacting with same-aged peers. Her mother reported that Sarah is "slow to warm" to others but has a few "very close" friends in the neighborhood. Available medical records were reviewed. No complications were noted during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. Sarah weighed 7 lbs, 11 oz at birth. Medical history is significant for recurrent headaches; however, the headaches have diminished in the past 4 months. No history of seizures or head injury was noted. No concerns regarding hearing, vision, or other sensory issues were noted. Her sleep and appetite are reportedly normal as well. She is prescribed no medications. Developmental speech and language and motor milestones were reportedly attained within normal limits. Sarah has a history of a learning disability, specifically dyslexia, expressive language delay, and headaches. Neuropsychological testing suggests that her academic abilities are lower than what would be expected given her cognitive functioning. Her cognitive abilities vary, but she demonstrated strength in the areas of fluid reasoning, visual-spatial abilities, and short-term memory span. She had greater difficulty with long-term retrieval of semantic information. While Sarah's basic reading skills are average, her reading comprehension and written expression is low average.

N2  - Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning that can emerge in relation to any sleep stage at any time of the night. These disorders may result in injuries, sleep disruption, adverse health effects, and psychological or interpersonal distress affecting a person and his or her bed partner or roommate. This chapter will begin by outlining a practical method to clinically investigate parasomnias in women. Subsequently a review will be presented on the pathophysiology and management of individual parasomnias. These include the NREM parasomnias, which including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors. Next, they will review REM parasomnias including REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other forms of dream-enactment behavior as well as isolated sleep paralysis. Previously, RBD has been considered primarily a disorder of elderly men. The authors extensively review two conditions that predominantly affect women but also defy current classification, sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) and sleep-related dissociative disorder. Interestingly, many cases of SRED may in fact actually be a non-motor manifestation of restless legs syndrome (RLS), a condition with a strong female predominance. Finally, they conclude with a review of parasomnias during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The large majority of women (84%) complain of insomnia at least a few nights a week during pregnancy, and one of three pregnant women say they rarely or never get a good night's sleep. Sleep continues to be disrupted for new mothers during the postpartum period, regardless of type of infant feeding, location of infant, or extent of support with infant care at night. Postpartum depression may be difficult to distinguish from chronic sleep deprivation. Chronic postpartum sleep loss places women and their families at risk for accidents if they are driving or caring for their infant while excessively sleepy. Sleep-deprived parents coping with a difficult infant may even place the infant at risk for physical abuse. This chapter reviews the expected changes in sleep that occur during pregnancy and postpartum, and highlights particular issues of concern to guide clinical assessment with the goal of minimizing risk for adverse maternal health outcomes associated with insomnia.

N2  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families. Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and childrelated factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother’s lack of satisfaction with the baby’s sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD.

N2  - Comments on an article by J. Y. Ko et al. (see record 2012-21336-003) & J. L. Payne (see record 2012-21336-002). The recent articles by Ko et al. and Payne are fascinating and important. Both discusses that in the setting of care by obstetricians and gynecologists, screening is low for psychiatric disorders, which are often under diagnosed. Furthermore, the diagnosis of depression may be missed because of the overlap of pregnancy side effects with symptoms consistent with mood disorder, including sleep disorder and changes in energy, appetite, and concentration. These interesting articles by Ko et al. and Payne highlight the ongoing problem of women suffering from depression, which is not recognized and, therefore, not treated. The issue of unrecognized and untreated depression is significant, however, among all women regardless of age or whether or not they are pregnant. Symptoms of depression, as discussed, can mimic common changes during pregnancy. In older women, they can also mimic angina, and vice versa. In addition, depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and, therefore, is important to recognize in women. Postmenopausal women are at high risk for depression as well as coronary ischemia. The recently published articles by Ko et al. and by Payne are significant in highlighting that women should be screened and treated for depression.

N2  - Aims: The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self‐reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background: Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design: This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods: Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self‐reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21–40 years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post‐traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results: Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self‐reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion: When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over‐crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

N2  - Obesity is derived from the Latin term 'Obesus', which means 'one who has become plump through eating'. The negative effect of obesity on an individual's health has been known for a longer time and can be found in the writings of Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna. The rising prevalence of obesity is a pandemic of public concern affecting all age groups and not only confined to developed countries. Obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, cancer (particularly colon and breast), cerebrovascular disease and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis including data from 57 prospective studies with 894,576 participants reported that for every increase in body mass index (BMI) of 5 kg/m² there was a 30% overall higher mortality with a 40% increase in vascular mortality, a greater than 50% increase in diabetic, renal and hepatic mortality, a 10% increase in neoplastic mortality and 20% increase in respiratory and other mortality [2]. In addition, overweight and obesity increases the risk of many other conditions including cerebrovascular disease, gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apnoea, impaired physical functioning, psychological illness and social discrimination. The impact of obesity on fertility and adverse outcomes of pregnancy are well recognised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. Design, Setting, and Participants: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. Intervention: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. Measurements and Results: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). Conclusions: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring’s neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use. Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD = 38). Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

N2  - The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women (mean age = 46.6 years, range 34.3–67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women.
