N2  - Background: Repetitive episodes of hypoxia and reoxygenation during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) resemble an ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress occurs in pregnant women with OSAS. We also aimed to compare thiol/disulfide homeostasis with ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of ischemia-reperfusion injury in pregnant women with and without OSAS and healthy control. Methods: This study included 29 pregnant women with OSAS, 30 women without OSAS in the third trimester applying for periodic examinations, and 30 healthy women. Serum IMA and TAC (using the ferric reducing power of plasma method) were measured. Serum thiol/disulfide homeostasis was determined by a novel automated method. Results: The mean age of the pregnant women with OSAS was 31.0 ± 4.7 years with a mean gestational age of 36.5 ± 3.0 weeks. The mean age of pregnant women without OSAS was 29.8 ± 4.9 years with a mean gestational age of 36.9 ± 2.7 weeks. The mean age of the nonpregnant control group was 29.7 ± 6.4 years. Both native thiol (291 ± 29 μmol/L versus 314 ± 30 μmol/L; p =.018) and total thiol (325 ± 32 versus 350 ± 32, p =.025) levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to pregnant women without OSAS, respectively (p <.01). Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in pregnant women with OSAS. Native thiol and total thiol levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to those without OSAS. However, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis parameters cannot provide valuable information to discriminate OSAS in pregnant women.

N2  - Background: The programming of sleep architecture begins in pregnancy and depends upon optimal in utero formation and maturation of the neural connectivity of the brain. Particulate air pollution exposure can disrupt fetal brain development but associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during pregnancy and child sleep outcomes have not been previously explored. Methods: Analyses included 397 mother-child pairs enrolled in a pregnancy cohort in Mexico City. Daily ambient prenatal PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved prediction model. Child sleep periods were estimated objectively using wrist-worn, continuous actigraphy over a 1-week period at age 4–5 years. Data-driven advanced statistical methods (distributed lag models (DLMs)) were employed to identify sensitive windows whereby PM2.5 exposure during gestation was significantly associated with changes in sleep duration or efficiency. Models were adjusted for maternal education, season, child's age, sex, and BMI z-score. Results: Mother's average age was 27.7 years, with 59% having at least a high school education. Children slept an average of 7.7 h at night, with mean 80.1% efficiency. The adjusted DLM identified windows of PM2.5 exposure between 31 and 35 weeks gestation that were significantly associated with decreased sleep duration in children. In addition, increased PM2.5 during weeks 1–8 was associated with decreased sleep efficiency. In other exposure windows (weeks 39–40), PM2.5 was associated with increased sleep duration. Conclusion: Prenatal PM2.5 exposure is associated with altered sleep in preschool-aged children in Mexico City. Pollutant exposure during sensitive windows of pregnancy may have critical influence upon sleep programming.

N2  - Cannabis is probably the drug most commonly used globally since ancient times. Following the trend of legalization of access to cannabis in several Western countries, its use has increased in North America over the past few years. In spite of warnings of the potential hazards associated with in-utero exposure to cannabis, approximately 10% of pregnant women in an American study reported using cannabis in recent years, and most of them on a daily basis. Significant effects of prenatal cannabis exposure have been found on children's sleep, cognitive functions (memory and scholastic skills), as well as on executive (frontal lobe) functions (reasoning, attention, impulsivity, and motivation), and affective (depression) and anxiety symptoms throughout the stages of development. Following the presentation of two case vignettes, we integrate the published information on outcomes of maternal use of cannabis during pregnancy on the developing fetus and the “soft” neurological deficits and neuro-behavioral disturbances manifested by them from early childhood and evolving to peaks in adolescence. Taken together, these data serve to define what we call a heretofore unspecified “fetal cannabis spectrum disorder”.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there is a consensus on what guidance to share with expectant fathers from the prenatal through early infancy period among a multidisciplinary group of professionals with expertise on father involvement. DESIGN: Consensus-building approach using mixed methods involving two rounds of data collection. In Round 1, participants were requested to individually generate content as text messages to share with expectant fathers that a father should know or do for his infant, his partner, and himself starting prenatally and through early infancy. A content analysis of Round 1 data was conducted to identify domain content to share with fathers. During Round 2, experts were asked to rate their perceived level of importance of the content generated in Round 1. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were calculated for Round 2. SETTING: Electronic survey. PARTICIPANTS: Nine multidisciplinary professionals with expertise on father involvement, representing psychology, pediatrics, nursing/midwifery, and sociology. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: During Round 1, participants individually generated 302 message content items across domains in the following contexts: plan for/participate in birth (n = 71); his infant (n = 95); his partner (n = 107); and himself (n = 38). During Round 2, participants achieved greatest consensus in more content items in two contexts: infant support and partner support. For infant support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with for fathers included: knowledge about signs of infant illness, feeding, sleep patterns, and impact of second hand smoke/drug use; training on providing newborn care; and taking action including participating in infant care, providing verbal stimulation, engaging in age-appropriate play and physical contact, supporting safe sleep, and making/attending doctor appointments. For partner support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with fathers included: communicating with partners with regular check-ins, and about parenting styles and shared responsibilities, signs/symptoms of maternal depression, and hopes/dreams for infant; and taking actions to support partner's physical and emotional health and breastfeeding. Although less content was generated in the other two contexts - plan for/participate in birth and father support - participants achieved consensus on some content in these domains as being important to share with fathers. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Despite lack of professional guidelines for expectant fathers, experts generally agreed on the content that should be shared with expectant fathers from pregnancy through early infancy, especially in the domains of infant support and partner support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study can assist clinicians and practitioners on guidance to share with expectant fathers during their partner's pregnancy and the early postnatal period. Dissemination of such guidance to fathers can assist in benefiting all members of the family.

N2  - Background: Chronotype is a construct contributing to individual differences in sleep-wake timing. Previous studies with children have found that evening-types exhibit greater sleep difficulties. Infant sleep quality can be modulated by several factors, such as parental characteristics. We examined the association between parental circadian preference and sleep in early childhood. Methods: This study was based on a longitudinal birth cohort, with several measurement points. We used information regarding parental questionnaires during pregnancy and children's sleep measures at three, eight, 18 and 24 months. In total, 1220 mothers, 1116 fathers, 993 infants at three months, 990 infants at eight months, 958 children at 18 months, and 777 children at 24 months were analyzed. Parental circadian preference was measured using the Horne-Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Concerning children's sleep, we used the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and the Infant Sleep Questionnaire (ISQ) at each time point. Results: Maternal circadian preference was associated with infants’ circadian rhythm development at three, eight, 18 and 24 months. Furthermore, increased maternal eveningness was also related to short sleep during daytime at three months, and nighttime at three and eight months, to long sleep-onset latency at three, 18 and 24 months, to late bedtime at three, eight and 18 months, and to sleep difficulties at eight and 24 months. Paternal circadian preference was not associated with any sleep variable at any time point. Conclusion: Maternal circadian preference is related to several sleep difficulties in early childhood, and it may be considered a potential risk factor for the onset of early sleeping problems.

N2  - Infant mortality remains a problem in the United States with sleep-related deaths accounting for a significant portion. Known risk reduction strategies include breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco use and following the American Academy of Pediatrics' safe sleep guidelines. The purpose of this project was to evaluate outcomes of Safe Sleep Instructor-led community baby showers, which included safe sleep promotion, breastfeeding promotion and tobacco cessation education. Certified Safe Sleep Instructors (n = 35) were trained on how to plan and host a Community Baby Shower to provide education to pregnant women of low socioeconomic status or with high risk of infant mortality. Eighteen Community Baby Showers were held across two urban and eight rural counties in Kansas. Surveys were administered pre- and post-event to assess participant knowledge, confidence and intentions to follow through with planned action related to safe sleep, breastfeeding and reducing tobacco risk. Matched data were summarized and evaluated for differences using McNemar's and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. Significant increases were observed in Baby Shower participants' (n = 845) reported plans to follow the AAP Safe Sleep guidelines (all p < 0.001), likelihood to breastfeed (p < 0.001), confidence in ability to breastfeed for more than 6 months (p < 0.001), knowledge of local breastfeeding support resources (p < 0.001), knowledge of ways to avoid second-hand smoke exposure (p < 0.001) and knowledge of local tobacco cessation services (p = 0.004). Based on the result of the pre- and post-event surveys, certified Safe Sleep Instructors were able to plan and host successful events to increase knowledge and confidence related to risk reduction strategies to reduce sleep-related infant deaths.

N2  - Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to examine associations of objectively measured sleep duration with weight changes in black and Hispanic mothers over the first postpartum year. Methods: Data were from 159 mothers (69% black, 32% Hispanic). Nocturnal sleep duration was assessed using wrist actigraphy at 6 weeks and 5 months post partum, examined as a continuous variable and in categories (< 7 vs. ≥ 7 hours/night, consistent with American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendations). Body weights were abstracted from medical records in pregnancy and measured at 6 weeks, 5 months, and 12 months post partum. Outcomes included early postpartum (6 weeks to 5 months) and late postpartum (5 to 12 months) weight changes. Results: The majority of participants slept < 7 hours/night at 6 weeks (75%) and 5 months (63%) post partum. Early postpartum weight change did not differ by 6-week sleep duration category. By contrast, adjusted average late postpartum weight gain (SE) was 1.8 (0.7) kg higher in participants sleeping < 7 hours/night at 5 months post partum compared with those sleeping ≥ 7 hours/night (P = 0.02). Results did not show statistically significant associations of continuous measures of sleep duration, nor of measures of sleep quality, with postpartum weight changes. Conclusions: Sleeping < 7 hours/night was associated with late postpartum weight gain in minority mothers.

N2  - Introduction: Women commonly use massage therapy during pregnancy for pregnancy-related health conditions such as lower back and neck pain; however, there is little to no research related evidence on the side effects or mother or child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Objectives: This study aims to report on the side effects and mother or child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Design: An observational study methodology. Setting and time frame: Two massage clinics, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne recruited participants from December 2016 to December 2017. Intervention: Massage. Main outcome measure: Side effects and mother or child physical harm from massage. Results: One hundred and one participants were recruited to the study. Two fifths of the participants (n = 32, 40%) experienced one of more post-massage side effects. There were no mother or child physical harm events. Low back pain was the most common condition women sought massage treatment for 34 (33.7.%). A significant benefit (p < 0.001) was seen pre-massage to post-massage and pre-massage to 1-week post massage in decreasing stress, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion and improving sleep Discussion: Similar to previous research, low back pain was the most common condition that women sought massage treatment for followed by hip pain, shoulder pain, neck pain and to improve mental health. Ninety-seven percent of the cohort received a full body massage including the feet leading credence that ‘massage on the feet during pregnancy is harmful’ is mythic in nature. Conclusion: While our findings lead credence that massage on the feet during pregnancy is a myth the study was not powered to determine the safety of pregnancy massage and further research is needed. Massage was commonly sought for low back pain with promising benefits in decreased pain and improved range of movement and further research on the effectiveness of massage for low back pain in pregnancy.

N2  - We herein present the case of a 27-year-old woman with clinical and biochemical features of virilism. Imaging studies revealed the presence of a bilateral adrenal tumor. Although the secretion of androgens was remarkable, the autonomous production of cortisol was also evident because of a loss of circadian rhythm and the absence of cortisol suppression by dexamethasone. The surgical excision of both adrenal tumors was performed, and the histological examination showed no malignancy. We also report the successful pregnancy and delivery of the patient who showed evolving adrenocortical insufficiency along with virilization and Cushing's syndrome and who continued to receive glucocorticoid replacement therapy during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Smart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum. Methods: The feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n = 20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands. Conclusions: A smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.

N2  - Worldwide, every year there is an increase in the number of people exposed to inorganic arsenic (iAs) via drinking water. Human populations present impaired cognitive function as a result of prenatal and childhood iAs exposure, while studies in animal models demonstrate neurobehavioral deficits accompanied by neurotransmitter, protein, and enzyme alterations. Similar impairments have been observed in close association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to determine whether iAs promotes the pathophysiological progress of AD, we used the 3xTgAD mouse model. Mice were exposed to iAs in drinking water from gestation until 6 months (As-3xTgAD group) and compared with control animals without arsenic (3xTgAD group). We investigated the behavior phenotype on a test battery (circadian rhythm, locomotor behavior, Morris water maze, and contextual fear conditioning). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and respiration rates of mitochondria were evaluated, antioxidant components were detected by immunoblots, and immunohistochemical studies were performed to reveal AD markers. As-3xTgAD displayed alterations in their circadian rhythm and exhibited longer freezing time and escape latencies compared to the control group. The bioenergetic profile revealed decreased ATP levels accompanied by the decline of complex I, and an oxidant state in the hippocampus. On the other hand, the cortex showed no changes of oxidant stress and complex I; however, the antioxidant response was increased. Higher immunopositivity to amyloid isoforms and to phosphorylated tau was observed in frontal cortex and hippocampus of exposed animals. In conclusion, mitochondrial dysfunction may be one of the triggering factors through which chronic iAs exposure exacerbates brain AD-like pathology.

N2  - Objective: The national sleep foundation recommends 7-9 hours of sleep per night for adults. Pregnancy is associated with an overall reduction in sleep duration and general wellbeing. Restrictive sleep is associated with metabolic disturbance in the non-pregnant population and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to investigate the effect of the PEARS intervention on sleep duration and behaviours and general wellbeing. We also sought to examine the association between suboptimal sleep (<7 hours) and maternal and fetal metabolic and pregnancy outcomes on the entire patient cohort Study Design: Secondary analysis of the PEARs study cohort-a RCT of the effects of a complex behavioral antenatal lifestyle intervention with smartphone app support on the incidence of GDM in overweight and obese pregnancies. 474 women with sleep and wellbeing data at both study entry (circa 16 weeks) and in the 3rd trimester (28-34 weeks’ gestation) were included in the analysis. At baseline, 28 weeks and birth, blood samples were taken for analysis of glucose, insulin, c-peptide, HOMA, and lipids. Data pertaining to pregnancy outcomes was also recorded. Results: Mean sleep duration and wellbeing was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to control 400.4 ± 81 vs. 383.3 ± 71 minutes p= 0.04 and 62.7 ± 15.3 vs. 59.3 ± 14.1 p= 0.03. The intervention group was significantly more likely to achieve ‘optimum sleep time’, p=0.04. Insulin resistance (HOMA 2 IR) in early pregnancy was greater in those that had severe sleep restriction < 6 hours of sleep per night. p=0.03. Moderate and severe sleep restriction in the 3rd trimester was associated with higher lipid profiles, less adherence to GWG guidelines and lower breastfeeding rates (Table 1&2) Conclusion: An antenatal healthy lifestyle intervention improves sleep behaviour in an at-risk population which is imperative to achieve optimum maternal weight gain, metabolic health and breastfeeding rates in pregnancy [Figure presented] [Figure presented]

N2  - Objective: Elevated inflammatory markers are associated with alterations in fetal development and adverse birth outcomes. Adequate sleep may be important for regulating inflammatory processes during pregnancy. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate associations between inflammatory markers and self-reported sleep duration in pregnant women. Study Design: Of 744 pregnant women enrolled in a multi-site prospective cohort study, 694 completed a survey on sleep quality and provided a serum sample between 12-20 weeks gestation. Sleep quality was evaluated using the validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which includes a question on average hours of sleep per night. Levels of inflammatory markers, including TNFα, CRP, IL6, and IL10, were measured in maternal serum and log transformed. A ratio of IL6:IL10 was calculated as an indicator of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory balance. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between each of the inflammatory markers and self- reported hours of sleep per night. Results: Women reported an average of 6.9 hours of sleep per night (standard deviation: 1.6). In models adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, income, BMI, marital status, smoking, and gestational age at assessment, a one-hour decrease in average amount of sleep per night was associated with increases in log CRP and log IL6:IL10 ratio (CRP β: 0.024, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.003, 0.046; IL6:IL10 β: 0.039, 95% CI: 0.008, 0.070). The average amount of sleep per night was not associated with TNFα, IL6, or IL10 alone. Conclusion: Self-reported shorter sleep duration was associated with increases in CRP and IL6:IL10 ratio, even when controlling for key maternal demographics including BMI. Further studies should evaluate whether adequate sleep during pregnancy can help regulate inflammatory processes and improve outcomes.

N2  - Objective: Obesity has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity in reproductive aged women. It is associated with multiple maternal and fetal co-morbidities including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and fetal growth restriction. It is also associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a treatable condition that is independently associated with gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and fetal growth restriction. Despite the known association between obesity and OSA, pregnant women are rarely screened for OSA. Identification of high-risk women should be a priority in pregnancy as OSA can be treated. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the severity of obesity and the odds of objectively-assessed OSA. Study Design: A secondary analysis of home sleep tests, conducted for research purposes between 2011-2018, in snoring and non-snoring pregnant women was conducted. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was classified as normal weight (<25; referent) overweight (25.0-29.9), obesity class I (30.0-34.9), obesity class II (35.0-39.9) and obesity class III (≥40.0). Obstructive sleep apnea was defined by the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) with a threshold of AHI≥5 indicating the presence of OSA. The severity of OSA was stratified as not present (<5.0), mild (5.0-14.9), moderate (15.0-29.9) and severe (≥30.0). The odds of OSA for each obesity category was investigated. Results: The sample size included 181 pregnant women (mean age 29.9±5.8 years, and mean gestational age 30.4±7.3 weeks). Twenty-nine percent of women were overweight and an additional 56% were obese; 33% had OSA. The odds ratio for the presence of OSA for each obesity class is shown in Table 1. The positive predictive value for the presence of OSA in women with obesity class II or III was 95% and with a negative predictive value of 66%. Conclusion: Pregnant women overweight and obese are at significantly increased odds of unrecognized OSA. This is particularly apparent in those with obesity class II or III. Since OSA is associated with significant morbidity and can be treated in pregnancy, it would be pertinent to evaluate all women with a BMI≥35 for OSA. [Figure presented] [Figure presented]

N2  - Objective: Maternal sleep position on the back or right side has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), leading to recommendations to always sleep on the left side and maternal anxiety about sleep. However, available data are from case-control studies, which are subject to recall bias. Our purpose was to examine the relationship between prospectively assessed sleep position and subsequent APOs. Study Design: Secondary analyses of the nuMoM2b and sleep sub-study observational cohort were performed. Nulliparous women prospectively completed in-depth sleep questionnaires between 6+0 and 13+6 week’s gestation (V1) and 22+0 and 29+6 week’s gestation (V3). At each visit, women were asked in what position they went to sleep last night and on average during the past week. At V1, they were also asked in what position they went to sleep prior to pregnancy. Adjusted ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using regression models to relate sleep position at V1 and V3 to APO (a composite of stillbirth, SGA birth weight, and gestational hypertensive disorders). Adjustment covariates included age, BMI and chronic hypertension in early pregnancy; V3 analyses were also adjusted for rate of weight gain from early to mid-pregnancy. Results: 8,706 (of 10,038 total) women had data from at least one sleep questionnaire and for pregnancy outcomes, and they comprised the population for this analysis. There was no association between reported non-left lateral sleep during the last week at V1 or V3 and the APO composite or any individual outcome, except for an apparent protective effect for stillbirth at V3 (table). The same was true for position going to sleep last night and prior to pregnancy. In addition, women who reported going to sleep slept in the supine position were not more likely to experience the composite or any individual outcome compared to the left lateral position. Conclusion: Going to sleep in the supine or right lateral position, as reported prior to the development of pregnancy outcome, was not associated with an increased risk of a composite APO including stillbirth, SGA fetus or gestational hypertensive disorders. These data do not support recommendations for women to avoid going to sleep in the supine or right lateral position. [Figure presented]

N2  - Objective: Pregnant women often complain of fatigue but this is generally thought to be part of pregnancy due to hormonal changes. In the non-pregnant population obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known contributor to fatigue but this has not been investigated in pregnant women. We therefore examined whether underlying OSA plays a role in fatigue during pregnancy. Study Design: A secondary analysis of home sleep tests conducted among pregnant women for research purposes. All women were queried about symptoms of fatigue and daytime sleepiness using a fatigue scale and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale respectively. Women who reported that they experienced fatigue “often” were classified as cases. Excessive daytime sleepiness was considered present with a sleepiness score of ≥10. The presence of OSA was determined by an overnight home sleep test with an apnea-hypopnea index of ≥5 events/hour. Demographics and medical information was obtained by chart abstraction. Regression analyses were constructed to determine key contributors to fatigue. Results: The sample size included 84 pregnant women (mean age 31.3±5.9 years, and mean gestational age 29.0±7.6 weeks). Thirty-six percent of women reported that they were “often” fatigued, 46% screened positive for daytime sleepiness, and 42% had OSA. Demographics are shown in Table 1. There was no association between fatigue and daytime sleepiness. In a logistic regression model, a complaint of fatigue was strongly associated with the presence of OSA (OR 5.1, 95%CI 1.4-19.3) after controlling for maternal age, gestational age, parity, BMI, race, and daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: Unrecognized OSA is a significant contributor to fatigue in pregnancy. Clinicians caring for pregnant women should consider OSA in women who are often fatigued. [Figure presented]

N2  - Animal studies strongly suggest that timed feeding can have beneficial physiological effects, including protection against the obesogenic and metabolic consequences of a high-fat diet. However, the relationship between variables related to the timing of eating and diet quality in pregnancy women, which is considered as a period of nutritional vulnerability, is still poorly described in the literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 100 pregnant women in the first gestational trimester (≤12 weeks of gestation). The information regarding food intake was obtained by three 24-Hour Dietary Recall (24HR). Time-related eating patterns, i.e., the interval between the first and the last meal (eating duration), nightly fasting, time of the first and last meals, and number of meals eating on a day were determined. Chronotype was derived using the mid-sleep time on free days on weekends, with a further correction for calculated sleep debt. Diet quality was evaluated using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R), validated for the Brazilian population. Linear regression modeling analyses adjusted for confounders were used to investigate the association between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality. The BHEI-R total score was negatively associated with time of the first meal (β =  -0.355; p = 0.002; r2 adjusted = 0.141), and positively associated with eating duration (β = 0.262; p = 0.024; r2 adjusted = 0.086) and number of meals (β = 0.273; p = 0.019; r2 adjusted = 0.091). In addition, the score of total fruit component was negatively associated with chronotype (β = -0.236; p = 0.033; r2 adjusted = 0.078), time of the first meal (β = -0.393; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.171), and positively associated with eating duration (β = 0.259; p = 0.022; r2 adjusted = 0.087) and number of meals (β = 0.376; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.159). The score for whole fruit component was negatively associated with time of the first meal (β = -0.388; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.152), and positively associated with number of meals (β = 0.403; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.164). A longer eating duration, earlier time of the first meal, higher number of meals and morningness tendency are associated with a better diet quality in the first gestational trimester - higher scores of the total BHEI-R and/or fruit components. We suggest that nutritional guidelines should consider time-related eating patterns and chronotype to ensure good diet quality of pregnant women since the beginning of gestation, contributing on prevention of metabolic-nutritional complications.

N2  - For some women, lumbopelvic pain (LPP) developed during pregnancy becomes a continuing post-partum problem. Increased understanding of potential prognostic factors is required. This study investigated whether active straight leg raise (ASLR), sleep dysfunction and pressure pain sensitivity during pregnancy are correlated with LPP intensity and quality, disability, and physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) post-partum. An exploratory, prospective cohort study design was used. Baseline factors of interest were: (1) ASLR, (2) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and (3) pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) collected from pregnant women from sites local and distal to the lumbopelvic area. Follow-up data collected 11-18 months post-partum (n=29) were: (1) pain intensity score (numerical rating scale), (2) pain quality (McGill Pain Questionnaire), (3) disability (Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire), and (4) HRQoL (36-item Short Form Health Survey). Correlation analysis was performed. Greater difficulty with an ASLR during pregnancy correlated with lower post-partum physical HRQoL scores (r=-0.563, p=0.002). Likewise, reduced PPTs at the sacrum during pregnancy was correlated with a higher post-partum pain quality score (r=-0.384, p=0.040). In this cohort, findings indicate that poor ASLR performance and localised pressure pain hypersensitivity at the pelvis during pregnancy are correlated with post-partum physical HRQoL and pain quality, respectively. Pain sensitivity may contribute to the prognosis of women with LPP during pregnancy. These explorative findings may be important for designing larger prognostic studies and may assist in directing potential pain management in post-partum LPP.

N2  - Whether or not childhood sleep problems and anxiety occur simultaneously, or one precedes the other, and any effect of autistic traits on this relationship remains unclear. We investigated longitudinal associations between sleep and anxiety at 2 years and sleep and anxiety at 8 years controlling for demographic variables. We also examined the additional influence of autistic traits at 2 years on sleep problems and anxiety at 8 years. Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, where 2900 pregnant women were recruited between 1989 and 1991 and their children assessed every 2–3 years thereafter. Demographic information was provided at 16–18 weeks gestation. Children’s sleep and anxiety at 2 and 8 years and autistic traits at 2 years were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical multiple regression models tested the prediction of both anxiety and sleep problems at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and 8 years, anxiety at 2 years, and autistic traits at 2 years were significantly associated with anxiety at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and anxiety at 8 years were significantly related to sleep problems at 8 years. Each of these models explained about 20% of variance. Childhood sleep problems, anxiety and autistic traits are interrelated and can occur concurrently in young children, but the best predictor of poor sleep in middle childhood is concurrent anxiety and vice versa. Anxiety and sleep problems may be an early indicator of autism in young children and early autistic traits may also contribute to anxiety problems later in childhood.

N2  - Objective: Studies have indicated an association between sleep apnea and fetal growth abnormalities. The mechanisms behind those observations have not been elucidated. We sought to examine the association between biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress (8-hydroxydeoxyguanisine) and neonatal adiposity in obese pregnant women. Study Design: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to identify risk factors and outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) pregnant women. Participants underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA) that recorded nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movements. Sleep studies were manually scored by an independent masked Sleep Reading Center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. Any SpO2<90% was considered an episode of hypoxemia. The subsequent first morning void maternal urine samples were collected and stored at -70C. Samples were analyzed in duplicate for levels of 8-OHdG and C-reactive protein using a commercially available kit and corrected for creatinine level. Maternal and neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography (BodPod, PeaPod). Neonatal morphometry was evaluated using a standardized protocol within 72 hours of birth. The primary outcome was neonatal lean body composition (%lean body mass, NLBM %). This analysis was restricted to neonates delivered ≥ 37 weeks. Results: The cohort included 78 maternal/neonatal pairs. On average women were screened for OSA at mean [S.D.] gestational age of 22 [5] weeks, were age 27 [6] years, BMI 40.1 [8] kg/m2, % body fat (MBF %) 44 [6] %. And delivered at 38.6[1.3] weeks. Chronic hypertension (33%), pregestational (18%) and gestational diabetes (14%) were common. Eleven percent of these mothers had OSA who spent 2.5[1.1] % of the total sleep time with hypoxemia, and had a mean lowest SpO2 of 85 [5] %. Mean birth weight for the cohort was 3284 [507] gm, and NLBM% 86 [4] %. NLBM% was associated with maternal BMI (r=−0.23, p=0.04), but not MBF% (−.15, p=0.06), degree of nocturnal hypoxemia (r=−.03, p=0.77), 8OHdG (r=-.21, p=.20), CRP (r=.05, p=.66). Conclusion: In obese pregnant women, using standardized methodology and criteria, neither prospectively diagnosed maternal OSA, nocturnal hypoxia, markers of inflammation or oxidative stress were associated with increased neonatal lean body mass.

N2  - Background and Purpose Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep-related neurological disorder that affects the quality of sleep. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence, predictive factors, and natural course of RLS, and its effect on sleep quality in pregnant Thai women. Methods A cross-sectional study that included 214 pregnant women was performed. RLS was diagnosed according to the revised criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG). General demographic and antenatal-care data were reviewed. Scores on the Thai versions of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the IRLSSG Rating Scale were determined. Results RLS was diagnosed in 24 of the pregnant women (11.2%): 4.2%, 25.0%, and 70.8% in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a hemoglobin level (Hb) less than 11 g/dL [odds ratio (OR)=3.21, 95% CI=1.27– 8.13] and a history of RLS (OR=16.62, 95% CI=1.52–181.32) were associated with RLS during pregnancy. Subjects with RLS significantly had higher Thai-ESS scores (p<0.01). All subjects with RLS had severe symptoms that subsided within 1 week after delivery. No immediate labor complication was associated with RLS. Conclusions Our study has confirmed a high prevalence of RLS and its impacts on sleep in pregnant women. An Hb of less than 11 g/dL and a history of RLS are predictive factors for RLS developing during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related RLS has a benign course and usually disappears within 1 week after delivery.

N2  - Biological rhythms may play an important role in the physio-reproductive lifecycle of Pashmina goats. However, such a study is lacking. Present study focuses on same. A total of 30 female Pashmina goats (N = 30) from 3 flocks (n = 10) having 10 animals each were selected randomly in 3 villages of Changthang, Ladakh (India). Average life span was 9.93 ± 0.462 years, body weight of adult female was 23.0 ± 1.08 kg and age of puberty was 11.93 ± 0.55 months. Average duration of oestrus cycle was 20.73 ± 0.23 days and that of standing estrus was 36.40 ± 1.67 h. Seasonal breeding was noted with breeding cycle being influenced by light hours. Average gestation length was 149.5 ± 1.05 days, frequently single kidding and usually singlets were born. Pashmina wool grows during winter season and starts shedding from spring. Seasonal cyclicity of diseases including neonatal diarrhea, endo-ectoparasitic infections, and respiratory infections [contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP)/peste des petits ruminants (PPR)] was noted. No significant difference (p > 0.05) of biological rhythms was noted in the three villages. This study provides the baseline data for biological rhythms of Pashmina goats that can have both physio-biological- and production- related importance.

N2  - Background: Trauma-exposed women may be at magnified risk for posttraumatic stress (PTSS) and depression symptoms in the perinatal period, but few studies have examined symptomatology across the perinatal period in high-risk samples. Further, the role of sleep in perinatal symptomatology has been largely neglected in the violence literature, despite its well-established associations to mental health in other samples. This study aimed to examine the trajectory of PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period and the effects of childhood adversity, intimate partner violence and prenatal sleep impairment on PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period. Method: In a longitudinal, prospective study, 101 low-income pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy, at 6-weeks postpartum, and 4 months postpartum. N = 83 women completed at least 2 interviews and were included in the analyses. Prenatal sleep, childhood adversity, and IPV exposure were assessed at the prenatal interview; PTSS and depression were assessed at all interviews. Results: Past year IPV was associated with elevated prenatal mental health symptoms and prenatal sleep difficulties were associated with a worsening trajectory in perinatal PTSS. Conclusions: Screening for IPV and prenatal sleep difficulties may be paramount in identifying those at risk for the development or exacerbation of mental health symptoms in the perinatal period.

N2  - The aim of this study was to analyze relationships among general health, coping style, and perceived stress in healthy primigravida pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city, Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH model fit well; general health (β = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep disorders (β = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, and only planning-preparation was related to perceived stress through general health (β = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping styles. Further studies on the effect of coping style interventions on stress are warranted.

N2  - Periconceptional care such as lifestyle plays an important impact role in offspring health. The aim of the present study was to clarify the perspective of Avicenna on periconceptional care. Avicenna (980–1037 A.D.) was one of the outstanding Persian physicians, who made great contributions to the field of medical sciences, in particular, obstetrics. In advance, Avicenna's book, Canon of Medicine, was considered to find his perspectives on periconceptional care. Then, his ideas and theories were compared to the current findings by searching the keywords in main indexing systems including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. Current investigations show that gamete quality, pregnancy outcome, and offspring health at birth and long term depend on both parents’ lifestyle in pre- and periconceptional period, as well as the intrauterine environment. Avicenna believed that seminal fluid, sperm, ovum, and developing conditions in utero were influenced by the stages of food digestion and the function of some organs. On the other hand, food digestion and function of the organs also depend on each parent's lifestyle and environmental factors. He mentioned 6 principles of healthy lifestyle: exercise, nutrition, sleep and awareness, excretion of body wastes and retention of necessary materials, psychic features, as well as air and climate. Thus, a multicomponent healthy lifestyle should be considered by parents of child-bearing age in an appropriate period before and in early pregnancy as well as elimination of any disorders in parents, to give birth to more healthy offspring.

N2  - Motivation: Multiple biological clocks govern a healthy pregnancy. These biological mechanisms produce immunologic, metabolomic, proteomic, genomic and microbiomic adaptations during the course of pregnancy. Modeling the chronology of these adaptations during full-term pregnancy provides the frameworks for future studies examining deviations implicated in pregnancy-related pathologies including preterm birth and preeclampsia. Results: We performed a multiomics analysis of 51 samples from 17 pregnant women, delivering at term. The datasets included measurements from the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome and metabolome of samples obtained simultaneously from the same patients. Multivariate predictive modeling using the Elastic Net (EN) algorithm was used to measure the ability of each dataset to predict gestational age. Using stacked generalization, these datasets were combined into a single model. This model not only significantly increased predictive power by combining all datasets, but also revealed novel interactions between different biological modalities. Future work includes expansion of the cohort to preterm-enriched populations and in vivo analysis of immune-modulating interventions based on the mechanisms identified. Availability and implementation: Datasets and scripts for reproduction of results are available through: https://nalab.stanford.edu/multiomics-pregnancy/. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

N2  - Objective: To determine if objectively-measured sleep disturbances in the second trimester are associated with high depression scores later in pregnancy Study Design: In a large prospective cohort study of nullipara, participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during the first trimester and again at the third study visit (between 22 and 29 6/7 weeks). In the midtrimester, between these depression assessments, a subgroup underwent actigraphy and completed a sleep diary for 7 days. A high EPDS score was defined as an EPDS score > 10 or any thoughts of self harm. Sleep disturbances were defined as follows: short sleep duration < 7 hours, high fragmentation index >75%ile, high wake after sleep onset (WASO) >75%ile, elevated sleep onset latency >30 minutes, low time above light threshold 1000 lux (TALT) <25%ile, low sleep efficiency <80%. Univariable analyses were performed to investigate the association between maternal baseline characteristics, sleep disturbances and high depression scores later in pregnancy. All significant (P<0.05) covariates in univariable analysis were included in multivariable analysis. Results: The study population for this analysis includes 778 women who had visit 3 EPDS scores and who underwent actigraphy assessment. This cohort represented a racially and ethnically diverse group of women with an average age of 27 years (Table). At visit 3, 108 (13.9%) women had high EPDS scores. Univariable analyses demonstrated that these women were significantly more likely to be younger, single, publicly insured, smokers, diagnosed with a mental health condition prior to pregnancy, and to have high EPDS scores at the first study visit as compared to women with low scores at visit 3. Women with elevated sleep onset latency and low-sleep efficiency were significantly more likely to have high EPDS scores at visit 3 (Table). However, in multivariable logistic regression, only preexisting mental health conditions (OR 3.7, confidence interval 2.2-12.0) and high EPDS scores at the first visit (OR 7.7, confidence interval 3.4-17.5) remained associated with high EPDS scores at visit 3. Conclusion: Objectively-measured sleep disturbances in the middle of pregnancy were not independently associated with high depression scores later in pregnancy. [Figure presented]

N2  - Objective: Sleep disturbance is a common issue that can arise from emotional distress. Women who received the complicated invasive in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures can be stressful. The purpose of this study is to understanding the association between emotional distress (measured as anxiety and depression) and sleep quality for women undergoing IVF treatment. Materials and methods: This research was of a cross-sectional questionnaire design. Questionnaires were completed during the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation of IVF treatment. A total of 97 participants complete the survey. The questionnaires included basic personal information, The Chinese Traditional Childbearing Attitude Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Beck depression and anxiety scales. Results: A total of 42.9% and 30% of the participants were determined to be anxious and depressed, respectively. Some participants (18.8%) required more than 30 min to fall asleep, and 56.2% of the participants had less than 7 h of sleep, 43.6% of the participants had less than 85% of sleep efficiency, and 43.3% of the participants were determined with poor sleep quality (PSQI>5). The linear regression analysis indicated that the score of the Beck anxiety index was significantly associated with sleep quality (F = 44.85, p =.000, adjust R2 = 49.4%). Conclusion: This study revealed that some women when receiving early stage IVF treatments were anxious, depressed, and have sleep disturbance. Anxiety was significantly associated with sleep quality. It is suggested that medical care professional should understand these common issues when assisting women undergoing these complicated reproductive treatments.

N2  - Aim: To examine the desire for a baby “if I want and when I want” through the feminist movement, the reasons why women want to delay the arrival of a baby which require us to better understand the changes that have taken place in society, affecting the desire for a baby, and raising a very specific public health issue, but seen by society as an entitlement, free-choice, a form of liberty. This modification in our behaviour is in turn reflected in the politics of the nation and has become the subject of much controversy in bioethical circles. Methodology: Using data from INSEE, 2011–2017 and our experience, we analysed the impact of late pregnancies on fertility, the consequences for the mother and her unborn child, the factors behind the desire for a baby late in life. Age is the enemy of women. Artificial conception (data from the biomedical agency, FIVNAT, 2006) cannot offset the effects of age. The birth rate in women aged over 40 has doubled in 20 years, and is growing at an exponential rate, and receiving enormous attention from the media (pregnant celebrities). Results: The main risk for a woman who decides to wait before thinking about a baby, is to never have a baby at all. The consequences for the mother and the unborn child are not trivial : increased number of miscarriages, chromosomic abnormalities, difficult pregnancies, higher rate of maternal mortality, and for the child, a higher rate of premature births. (Epidemiology of fertility: B Rossin, gynécologie & obstétrique pratique no 287, sept 2016, and Procédure de suivi d'une cohorte d'enfant FIV: revue de d’épidémiologie et de santé publique no 2, avril 2011, vol 59 pp 97–106). Why this desire to wait before having a baby? Contraception, serious relationships later in life, studies, career, divorce and remarriage, financial problems (having a baby is expensive, unemployment, housing), leisure time, reduced influence of religion in our western societies, are all factors, in a fast-paced society, time passes without necessarily considering one's biological clock. Being young is the fashion (denial, dreams). We all want to stay young or become young again, and stay in good shape. Our longer life expectancy complicates things still further. In parallel, we can see an increase in the number of single individuals and the demand for pregnancy from single women using sperm donation. Discussion: What solution can we propose? In the bible, the desire to have a baby was seen as a legitimate desire. Sarah, Abraham's wife, found the ideal solution for the time: “come hither, servant, I will have a baby through you”: surrogate mothers with oocyte donation. Today the solution has to be found by the public authorities in their public health policies, including information, prevention, supported by scientific progress (conservation of oocytes, genetic diagnosis, gamete donation, and in the near future, artificial gametes, scientific or reproductive cloning, ovary rejuvenation. Conclusion: The desire for pregnancy late is life has difficulty in accepting failure. We turn to science for a solution, and science in turn looks to society. Sexuality could well become destabilised in all this disruption: the sexuality of failure to reproduce, the sexuality of substitution, violated sexuality, desire's role could be totally undermined.

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine the convergence between actigraphy, sleep diaries, and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) in the assessment of infant nocturnal wakefulness (i.e. minutes awake after sleep onset [WASO] and number of night-wakings [NW]) in the context of a longitudinal study. Methods: The sample included 226 families, who were recruited during pregnancy. Data were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum. Infants' sleep was monitored at home for five nights using actigraphy, sleep diaries, and the BISQ. Outcome measures included WASO and NW, as well as sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep onset. Results: Trajectory analyses demonstrated that all three methods showed declines in NW and WASO from 3 to 18 months. Statistically significant correlations were found between the three methods at all assessment points for all sleep variables. However, agreement rates (using Krippendorff's α and Bland-Altman analyses) between actigraphy and parental reports were poor. For NW, agreement between actigraphy and parental reports at 18 months was lower than that at 3 and 6 months. Diaries and BISQ showed satisfactory agreement for sleep latency. Conclusions: Although the three methods' measures of infant nocturnal wakefulness are significantly correlated during infancy, absolute agreement between these methods is poor overall. The growing disagreement between actigraphy and parental reports (in NW) across development probably suggests that parents become less aware of infants' awakenings, due to the increasing ability of infants to self-soothe. Using both objective and subjective assessment methods seems especially important after the age of 6 months.

N2  - There are in France several millions of shift-workers and night-workers (20 to 25% of employees). These workers are therefore subject to variations in their working and rest schedules. These regular schedule changes are associated with repeated desynchronization of circadian biological clock. The negative impacts on sleep are insomnia, drowsiness, and reduced sleep time in 24 hours. There is also a proven effect on the occurrence of a metabolic syndrome, with a likely effect on obesity, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure and coronary artery disease. There is a likely effect on the occurrence of cancer (including breast cancer). Night working is not recommended for pregnant women because of the risk of miscarriage, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation.

N2  - Background: Few studies on the relationship between sleep quantity and/or quality and cognition have been conducted among preschoolers from the healthy general population. We aimed to identify, among 3-year-old children, early polysomnography (PSG) sleep factors associated with estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) using the Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale Intelligence-III test (WPPSI-III) and its indicators: full-scale (FISQ), verbal (VIQ), and performance (PIQ) intelligence quotients. Methods: We included full-term children from the French birth-cohort AuBE with PSG recording at term (M0) and/or six months (M6), and available WPPSI-III scores at three years. Sleep and arousal characteristics of these infants were evaluated during day and night sleep periods. Relationships between IQ scores and sleep parameters were estimated using models with the child as a repeated effect adjusted for time (night/day), maturation (M0/M6), tobacco exposure (yes/no), anxiety-depressive scores during pregnancy, maternal age, duration of breastfeeding and child's gender. Results: A total of 118 PSG recordings were obtained, representing a total of 78 unique children (38 with one PSG and 40 with two PSG). No correlations were found between night and day sleep durations at M0 or M6. Mean VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ scores were within normal ranges. In multivariate models, longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency during the day were negatively associated with all IQ scores. More frequent arousals during the night were associated with lower VIQ scores. Conclusion: Early sleep characteristics such as night sleep fragmentation or longer naps could be associated with impaired cognitive function at three years of age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a global burden with 10 million incidences annually and 210 daily deaths worldwide. Diagnosis is mainly based on the features following full presentation. OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether early pregnancy circadian changes of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) could predict preeclampsia and hypertension. METHODS: In a prospective study, 294 pregnant women who were referred to Sarem Women's Hospital, Iran were recruited. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were recorded (diurnally and nocturnally) in each trimester. Dipping was defined as a minimum 10% decrease in blood pressure. RESULTS: Of the 251 women who completed the study, 25 percent (n=63) experienced blunted MAP dipping during sleep phases in the second trimester. Eighty-nine percent (n=56) experienced hypertensive disorder in the third trimester, one-third of which experienced preeclampsia. Of the women with normal MAP dipping (n=188), 5 percent (n=10) had gestational hypertension and 1 percent (n=2) became preeclamptic. (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrated blunted blood pressure dipping overnight during the second trimester which is a strong predictor of forthcoming pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia. A scoring system was developed to predict hypertensive disorder and it was significantly correlated with preeclampsia occurrence.

N2  - Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is the largest modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes in the infant. Investigations have focused on the psychoactive component of cigarettes, nicotine. One proposed mechanism leading to adverse effects is the interaction between nicotine and its nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Much data has been generated over the past three decades on the effects of cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) on the expression of the nAChRs in the brainstem and physiological parameters related to cardiac, respiration and sleep, in the offspring of smoking mothers and animal models of nicotine exposure. This review summarises this data and discusses the main findings, highlighting that findings in animal models closely correlate with those from human studies, and that the major brainstem sites where the expression level for the nAChRs are consistently affected include those that play vital roles in cardiorespiration (hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus of the solitary tract), chemosensation (nucleus of the solitary tract, arcuate nucleus) and arousal (rostral mesopontine sites such as the locus coeruleus and nucleus pontis oralis). These findings provide evidence for the adverse effects of CSE during and after pregnancy to the infant and the need to continue with the health campaign advising against CSE.

N2  - Background: Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) in pregnancy presents practical challenges for healthcare professionals' (HCPs), and communication that elevated BMI is the primary reason for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Objective: To determine emergent themes and reported outcomes in focus groups with clinicians involved in managing obesity in pregnancy. Methods: HCPs were recruited from Mount Sinai Hospital and Toronto Public Health. Semistructured focus group interviews were conducted, using an interpretive description approach. Field notes were color-coded and thematically analyzed to determine outcomes. Preliminary Results: The first session comprised of a maternal fetal medicine (MFM) fellow, MFM nurse, social worker, clinical nurse specialist, and an ultra-sonographer, and the second comprised of three MFM fellows, an MFM specialist, a labor, and delivery anesthetist, two dieticians, and an obesity-specialized family physician. Both groups discussed challenges with the terminology and communication of obesity. They reported difficulty with fulfilling day-today tasks due to fear of the patient's mental and physical health and safety, and the physical limitations of fat distribution in clinical and surgical practice, such as speculum insertion, cesarean incisions, or epidural insertion. Clinical outcomes included mode of delivery, incision type, wound healing, response to analgesia used, details of labor, nutrition, hyperlipidemia, depression, anxiety, macrosomia, maternal and fetal death, postpartum pain, breastfeeding, diabetes in child. Additional outcomes included lifestyle modification (diet and exercise), coordination between HCPs, patient mobility, resource utilization (sleep apnea-related hospital stay, longer operations), and alignment of patient and provider concerns. Discussion: Focus group dialogue transpired very easily, as HCPs seemed in need of expressing opinions for this patient group specifically, and was further enhanced by the interplay between stakeholder roles. Determined themes emphasize the strained patient-physician relationship for obesity in pregnancy. Participants tended to discuss higher class obesity, therefore individual interviews will be conducted to explore HCPs' perspectives on lower class obesity.

N2  - Objective: To present the clinical features and videos relating to an interesting and challenging case. Method: Case notes review with parental consent gained for the use of patient's videos. Case Summary: 3-years old was referred with suspected seizure like episodes at night. At the time of presentation, he was suffering with recurrent episodes of transient unilateral weakness since 2-years of age. These episodes are exclusively nocturnal, arising from the sleep usually anytime from 10pm until the early hours of the morning, lasting between 1 and 4 minutes. On most occasions the parents were alarmed one to two hours after going to sleep by his distressing noises. During typical episode the patient appears wake, seems distressed and there appears to be a lack of fluency of movements of his face, arm and leg in the hemiplegic distribution affecting either the right or the left side independently. Parents are unable to rouse him during episode and, once the attack passes, patient continues to sleep; and in the morning, when he wakes up, there is no suggestion of any weakness. So far, he hasn't had any daytime episodes. He is the third child of healthy parents. There is no significant family history including migraine or epilepsy. He was born at 38 weeks gestation with no perinatal problems. He achieved normal developmental milestones. He is a sociable child with good hand functions. He is well grown for his age and general physical examination, including neurology, was normal. His investigations including MRI brain, EEGs and genetic testing are normal. The video acquired by parents confirmed the hemiparetic episodes during the night sleep. A diagnosis of alternating hemiplegia of childhood was entertained but the patient showed no response to flunarizine. At present he is undergoing further assessments and investigations to establish the cause of these episodes. Discussion: By reporting this interesting case we draw the attention that alternating hemiplegia arising from the sleep is a diagnostic challenge. It is important to consider differentials of alternating hemiplegia of childhood and focal epilepsy however there is more evidence to recognise the benign nocturnal alternating hemiplegia of childhood as a separate entity, for appropriate management.

N2  - Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development. Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers’ capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing. Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers’ aversive response to infant crying. Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

N2  - Objective: Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the transcriptomes of myometrial tissues from pregnant women at term who were in labor vs. women at term who were not in labor to elucidate genes associated with spontaneous labor. Study Design: Study Design: Using human myometrial tissues from pregnant women at term who were not in labor (TNIL; n=8), and women at term who were in labor (TIL; n=6), we performed deep RNA-sequencing using the DESeq platform at a total of 30-40 million reads per sample. Results: Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated the TNIL and TIL transcriptomes can be distinguished as two distinct clusters. Over 44,000 genes were differentially expressed between TIL and TNIL samples. A total of 23,330 genes (51%) were upregulated and 21,770 (49%) downregulated. Pathway analysis revealed that muscle contraction, ion transport, and oxytocin signaling pathways are activated in TIL myometrial tissues compared to TNIL myometrial tissues. Conversely, compared to TNIL myometrium tissues, the pathways downregulated in TIL myometrial tissues included those involved in RNA/protein stability, the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and the regulation of circadian rhythm (Figure 1). Conclusion: Conclusion: Transcriptomes of myometrium from women at term who are in labor are distinct from women at term who are not in labor; this difference may be essential to understanding the initiation of spontaneous labor. Understanding the various pathways enriched in both up and downregulated genes in women in labor at term could prove useful in identifying the gene signatures that can be used as a basis for understanding the etiology of and targets for the prevention of preterm labor and birth.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that Dilapan-S is not inferior to the Foley balloon for pre-induction cervical ripening at term. Study Design: Pregnant women > 37 weeks with unfavorable cervix (<3cm and < 60% effaced) were randomly assigned to 12 hours of either Foley balloon (FB) inflated with 60 cc saline or Dilapan-S (DS) for cervical ripening. If cervix remained unfavorable, then one more round of the assigned dilator was used. Following ripening, oxytocin and labor management were left to the clinical providers. The primary outcome was vaginal delivery. Secondary outcomes are listed in Table. Patient completed a satisfaction survey after the pre-induction period. On the basis of noninferiority margin of 10% and a frequency of vaginal delivery of 76% in FB, a sample size of 420 women was needed (90% power & 87% protocol adherence). Results: From November 2016 – February 2018, 419 women were randomized (209 in FB; 210 in DS). In the intent to treat analysis, vaginal delivery was more common in DS versus FB (81.3% vs 76.1%), with an absolute difference with respect to the FB of 6% (95%CI -2.1% to 13.9%) indicating noninferiority for the pre-specified margin. The difference was not large enough to show superiority (Figure). Noninferiority was confirmed in the per-protocol population (N=204 in FB, N=188 in DS), supporting the robustness of the results (Figure). Secondary outcomes were not different between groups, except for a longer time device remained in place in DS compared with FB (Table). Maternal and neonatal adverse events were not significantly different between groups. A priori interaction analyses showed no difference in the effect on vaginal delivery according to cervical dilation at randomization, parity, or BMI > 30 kg/m 2. Patients in DS were more satisfied than patients in FB as far as sleep (P=0.01), relaxing time (P=0.001) and performance of desired daily activities (P=0.001). Conclusion: Dilapan-S is non-inferior to Foley balloon for pre-induction cervical ripening at term. Advantages of Dilapan-S over Foley include FDA approval, safe profile, no protrusion from the introitus, no need to keep under tension and better patient satisfaction.

N2  - Maternal perinatal depression (PND), a common mental disorder with a prevalence of over 10%, is associated with long-term health risks for both mothers and offspring. This study aimed at describing characteristics related to background and lifestyle, pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum of different PND trajectories defined according to the onset of depressive symptoms. Participants were drawn from a large population-based cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden (n = 2,466). Five trajectory groups of depressive symptom onset were created using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ≥13 (pregnancy) or ≥12 points (postpartum): (a) healthy (60.6%), (b) pregnancy depression (8.5%), (c) early postpartum onset (10.9%), (d) late postpartum onset (5.4%), and (e) chronic depression (14.6%). In multinomial logistic regressions, the associations between trajectories and the included characteristics were tested using the healthy trajectory as reference. Background characteristics (younger age, lower education, unemployment) were primarily associated with pregnancy depression and chronic depression. Characteristics associated with all PND trajectories were smoking prior to pregnancy, migraine, premenstrual mood symptoms, intimate partner violence, interpersonal trauma, negative delivery expectations, pregnancy nausea, and symphysiolysis. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery, or a negative delivery experience was associated with early postpartum onset. Postpartum factors (e.g., infantile colic, lack of sleep, low partner support, and bonding difficulties) were associated with early and late postpartum onset together with chronic depression. The findings suggest that different PND trajectories have divergent characteristics, which could be used to create individualized treatment options. To find the most predictive characteristics for different PND trajectories, studies with even larger and more diverse samples are warranted.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the cross-sectional associations between musculoskeletal pain experience and measures of pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Participants and Methods: In total, 917 participants were eligible for analysis if they provided data pertaining to musculoskeletal pain status at the 22-year follow-up and had data for at least 1 valid pain sensitivity test. Standardized protocols were used to assess pressure pain threshold (4 sites: lumbar spine, tibialis anterior, upper trapezius, and wrist) and cold pain threshold (wrist). Four pain experience groups ("No pain" [n=562, 61.3%], "Low" [n=84, 9.2%], "Medium" [n=147, 16.0%], "High" [n=124, 13.5%]) were determined by latent class analysis using parameters of pain chronicity, frequency, intensity, and number of pain areas. Variables considered as confounders included sex, age, ethnicity, waist-hip ratio, psychological symptoms, sleep quality, physical activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and income. Results: There were no associations between pain experience and pressure pain sensitivity after adjusting for confounders. The "Medium" and "High" pain experience groups demonstrated heightened cold pain sensitivity compared with the "No pain" group (P=0.023), adjusted for sex and smoking. Discussion: This study provides the most extensive investigation of the relationship between musculoskeletal pain experience and pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults. Heightened cold pain sensitivity in those classified as "Medium" and "High" pain experience may suggest altered nociceptive processing and has implications for clinical management.

N2  - Background: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) means the amount of energy utilized by body in physical and psychological resting rate, after a night sleep, awake without any previous physical activity post meal (10 h after last meal) & neutral environment. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is an increase in BMR which is said to be associated with the level of glycaemic control. So, the objective of the study was to find out the correlation between BMR, Insulin resistance and Visceral fat in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy. Materials & methods: A total of 50 participants with T2DM with peripheral neuropathy were included. Age group of 30–75 years were selected for the study. Participants with a known history of neurological disease, locomotor disability, and pregnancy were excluded from the study. Demographic details of the participants like duration of diabetes mellitus, age, Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR, Glycated Haemoglobin (HBA1c), Neuropathy and Blood pressure values were noted. We measured Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by using Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy. Results: The mean age of the participants is 60.16 ± 10.62. The mean duration of T2DM 13.44 ± 11.92. In the present study we found a statistical significant correlation between BMR and HOMA IR (r = 0.913*; p = 0.000), BMR & Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (r = 0.281*; p = 0.048), BMR and Visceral fat (VF) (r = 0.332*; p = 0.018). Conclusion: Basal metabolic rate is correlated to Homa-IR, visceral fat, fasting blood sugar and musculoskeletal mass among T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.

N2  - Background: Naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). It is easily emitted into the atmosphere, posing a significant risk to human health. However, limited studies have described the impact of naphthalene exposure on birth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between the maternal urinary metabolites of naphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OH NAP), and birth outcomes. Method: In the present study, four urinary PAH metabolites were measured in 263 pregnant women during late pregnancy. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of 2-OH NAP and birth outcomes, and restricted cubic spline models were further used to examine the shapes of the dose-response association. Result: General linear models showed that prenatal urinary 2-OH NAP was associated with lower birth weight (BW) (- 4.38% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.049) and higher cephalization index (CI) (4.30% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.038). These associations were linear and significant when 2-OH NAP was modeled as a continuous variable in restricted cubic spline models (P linear = 0.0293 for 2-OH NAP and BW; P linear = 0.0326 for 2-OH NAP and CI). Multiple linear regression data indicated that each 1 ln-unit increase in 2-OH NAP was significantly associated with a 2.09 g/cm increase in the CI. The associations among 2-OH NAP, BW, and CI were also observed in a subset of participants residing close to arterial traffic. Conclusion: Our data indicated that prenatal exposure to naphthalene had an adverse effect on fetal birth outcomes, especially the brain development index. Reduced exposure to naphthalene may improve newborn health outcomes. In Taiyuan, naphthalene may result from traffic pollution.

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine the relationship of self-reported sleep during pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A secondary objective was to describe the concordance between self-reported and objectively assessed sleep during pregnancy. Methods: In this prospective cohort, women completed a survey of sleep patterns at 6 to 13 weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again at 22 to 29 weeks' gestation (visit 3). Additionally, at 16 to 21 weeks (visit 2), a subgroup completed a week-long sleep diary coincident with an actigraphy recording. Weekly averages of self-reported sleep duration and sleep midpoint were calculated. A priori, sleep duration < 7 hours was defined as "short," and sleep midpoint after 5:00 am was defined as "late." The relationship of these sleep abnormalities with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was determined. Results: Of the 10,038 women enrolled, sleep survey data were available for 7, 524 women at visit 1 and 7, 668 women at visit 3. A total of 752 women also provided ≥ 5 days of sleep diary data coincident with actigraphy at visit 2. We did not observe any consistent relationship between self-reported short sleep and HDP or GDM. There was an association between self-reported late sleep midpoint and GDM (visit 1 adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.17, 2.38; visit 2 adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.23, 2.43). At visit 2, 77.1% of participants had concordance between their diary and actigraphy for short sleep duration, whereas 94.3% were concordant for sleep midpoint. Conclusions: Self-reported sleep midpoint, which is more accurate than self-reported sleep duration, is associated with the risk of GDM.

N2  - We present a case of a 27-year-old woman in whom idiopathic hypersomnolence was diagnosed in adolescence with adequate symptomatic control on daily dosage of 250 mg of modafinil. She maintained this dosage throughout her pregnancy and during the peripartum period, but did not breastfeed her newborn because of a lack of information on the transmission of modafinil in human breast milk. Samples of her breast milk were obtained at various times over a 24-hour period and analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The relative infant dose was calculated to be 5.3%, below the threshold of concern for drug passage via breast milk. This is the first reported case of modafinil transfer into human breast milk. Given the drug's use in a variety of sleep disorders, the results of this case can be used to advise breastfeeding mothers prescribed modafinil.

N2  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: There is limited evidence about the role of herbal and traditional medicine in pregnancy-related insomnia. Extant documents on traditional Persian medicine refer to many plants which could induce sleep and which were used by pregnant women. In Iran, local herbal shops continue to provide these herbs to pregnant women to treat insomnia. One such herb is Lactuca sativa L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lettuce seed on pregnant women for the treatment of insomnia. Methods and materials: In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 100 pregnant women with insomnia aged 20–45 years were assigned to receive capsules containing 1000 mg of lettuce seed or a placebo daily for two weeks. The main outcome was the quality of sleep, which was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Each group contained 50 participants. An improvement in the PSQI score was significantly greater in patients receiving lettuce seed than those receiving the placebo. Linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the other variables, the average sleep score of the experimental group was significantly lower than for the placebo group (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that lettuce seed decreased insomnia during pregnancy and could be recommended as a safe natural remedy for treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia.

N2  - Background: Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; obstructive sleep apnea is highly comorbid with obesity and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women has remained a challenge because of a lack of validated screening tools. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate established obstructive sleep apnea screening tools, a sleepiness scale, and individual component items in a cohort of pregnant women with extreme obesity in mid pregnancy with the use of objective testing to determine obstructive sleep apnea status and to describe the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among women with extreme obesity. Study Design: Adult pregnant subjects, between 24 and 35 weeks gestation, with a body mass index ≥40 kg/m2 at the time of enrollment completed obstructive sleep apnea screening tools (Berlin Questionnaire, American Society of Anesthesiologists checklist, and STOP-BANG questionnaire) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale; they also underwent physical examination of the neck, mouth, and airway. The published obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy prediction score was calculated for each subject. Obstructive sleep apnea status for each subject was determined by the results of an overnight, unattended type III home sleep apnea test. Results: Twenty-four percent of pregnant women with extreme obesity had obstructive sleep apnea on home sleep apnea testing in mid pregnancy (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, ≥5 events per hour]. Established obstructive sleep apnea screening tools performed very poorly to screen for obstructive sleep apnea in this cohort. Age, body mass index, neck circumference, frequently witnessed apneas, and highly likely to fall asleep while driving were associated most strongly with obstructive sleep apnea status in this cohort. Conclusion: We found that 24% of pregnant women with body mass index ≥40 kg/m2 between 24 and 35 weeks gestation have obstructive sleep apnea, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index ≥5 events per hour on an overnight type III home sleep apnea test. We found the Berlin Questionnaire, American Society of Anesthesiologists checklist, STOP-BANG, obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy score by Facco et al, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were not useful screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea in a cohort of obese pregnant women. However, age, body mass index, neck circumference, frequently witnessed apneas, and likely to fall asleep while driving were associated with obstructive sleep apnea in this cohort. Further studies are needed to adjust the criteria and thresholds within the available screening tools to better predict obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with obesity.

N2  - Objective: Sleep is critical for glucose metabolism. Pregnant women often have sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed. Results: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM. Conclusions: Extreme sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM.

N2  - Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15–20% of obese pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific perinatal factors are associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children. Methods: A retrospective case–control study was conducted. All cases of OSAS were obtained from a tertiary pediatric hospital between April 2013 and April 2016. A total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood OSAS. Results: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13–3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03–1.68) were significantly associated with OSAS. Exposure of the mother to smoke (aOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.57–4.26) was also associated with an increased risk of childhood OSAS. Mothers aged 35 years and above, performing manual labor, and living in suburban areas significantly increased the risk of childhood OSAS. Multiparous mothers decreased the risk of childhood OSAS (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42–0.83). Maternal education, gravidity, prenatal care times, pregnancy-induced hypertension, multiple pregnancies, sex of the child and birth weight were not significantly associated with OSAS in children. Conclusion: Perinatal risk factors are important for predicting childhood OSAS. Our findings provide evidence regarding several potentially useful factors for recognizing OSAS in children, which could be important in diagnosis of pediatric OSAS by physicians.

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine trajectories of poor sleep quality from late pregnancy to 36 months postpartum, baseline indicators, and association with prospective maternal mood disturbances. Methods: A cohort of 262 nonclinical women was followed at late pregnancy, 42 days, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postpartum. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at all time points, and mood disturbances were assessed at late pregnancy and 36 months postpartum. Results: The rate of poor sleep quality followed an inverted U-shaped curve. Women reporting poor sleep quality at late pregnancy held a consistently higher risk of poor sleep quality at postpartum points. Three sleep trajectories were distinguished, namely, the stable-low (29.4%), the decreasing-mild (56.5%), and the stable-high (14.1%). Poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety at baseline were linked to trajectory groups with poorer sleep quality. Adjusting for covariates, the trajectory of the poorer sleep quality group demonstrated increased mood disturbances at 36 months postpartum. Replicating the analyses in women without baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety above clinical cutoffs obtained similar results. Conclusions: Women are vulnerable to poor sleep quality from late pregnancy to postpartum years, but follow distinct trajectories. Poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety at late pregnancy help us to anticipate the sleep trajectories. Trajectories of poor sleep quality indicate increased mood disturbances at 36 months postpartum. A flexible suite of interventions targeting both poor sleep quality and mood disturbances should be implemented and tailored to women in the prenatal and postpartum periods.

N2  - Key points: Light at night is essential to a 24/7 society, but it has negative consequences on health. Basically, light at night induces an alteration of our biological clocks, known as chronodisruption, with effects even when this occurs during pregnancy. Here we explored the developmental impact of gestational chronodisruption (chronic photoperiod shift, CPS) on adult and fetal adrenal biorhythms and function. We found that gestational chronodisruption altered fetal and adult adrenal function, at the molecular, morphological and physiological levels. The differences between control and CPS offspring suggest desynchronization of the adrenal circadian clock and steroidogenic pathway, leading to abnormal stress responses and metabolic adaptation, potentially increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases. Abstract: Light at night is essential to a 24/7 society, but it has negative consequences on health. Basically, light at night induces an alteration of our biological clocks, known as chronodisruption, with effects even when this occurs during pregnancy. Indeed, an abnormal photoperiod during gestation alters fetal development, inducing long-term effects on the offspring. Accordingly, we carried out a longitudinal study in rats, exploring the impact of gestational chronodisruption on the adrenal biorhythms and function of the offspring. Adult rats (90 days old) gestated under chronic photoperiod shift (CPS) decrease the time spent in the open arm zone of an elevated plus maze to 62% and increase the rearing time to 170%. CPS adults maintained individual daily changes in corticosterone, but their acrophases were distributed from 12.00 h to 06.00 h. CPS offspring maintained clock gene expression and oscillation, nevertheless no daily rhythm was observed in genes involved in the regulation and synthesis of steroids. Consistent with adult adrenal gland being programmed during fetal life, blunted daily rhythms of corticosterone, core clock gene machinery, and steroidogenic genes were observed in CPS fetal adrenal glands. Comparisons of the global transcriptome of CPS versus control fetal adrenal gland revealed that 1078 genes were differentially expressed (641 down-regulated and 437 up-regulated). In silico analysis revealed significant changes in Lipid Metabolism, Small Molecule Biochemistry, Cellular Development and the Inflammatory Response pathway (z score: 48–20). Altogether, the present results demonstrate that gestational chronodisruption changed fetal and adult adrenal function. This could translate to long-term abnormal stress responses and metabolic adaptation, increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases.

N2  - Although maternal morbidity and mortality in the US is among the worst of developed countries, pregnant women have been under-represented in research studies, resulting in deficiencies in evidence-based guidance for treatment. There are over two billion smartphone users worldwide, enabling researchers to easily and cheaply conduct extremely large-scale research studies through smartphone apps, especially among pregnant women in whom app use is exceptionally high, predominantly as an information conduit. We developed the first pregnancy research app that is embedded within an existing, popular pregnancy app for self-management and education of expectant mothers. Through the large-scale and simplified collection of survey and sensor generated data via the app, we aim to improve our understanding of factors that promote a healthy pregnancy for both the mother and developing fetus. From the launch of this cohort study on 16 March 2017 through 17 December 2017, we have enrolled 2058 pregnant women from all 50 states. Our study population is diverse geographically and demographically, and fairly representative of US population averages. We have collected 14,045 individual surveys and 107,102 total daily measurements of sleep, activity, blood pressure, and heart rate during this time. On average, women stayed engaged in the study for 59 days and 45 percent who reached their due date filled out the final outcome survey. During the first 9 months, we demonstrated the potential for a smartphone-based research platform to capture an ever-expanding array of longitudinal, objective, and subjective participant-generated data from a continuously growing and diverse population of pregnant women.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies have suggested a relevance between maternal nutrition and offspring diseases, and it has been demonstrated that maternal malnutrition can be a risk factor for adult diseases in the offspring. However, most of the reports focused on nutrients without paying attention to the environment during pregnancy. We presumed that late pregnancy environment could affect both maternal and offspring. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect on the circadian rhythm disruption of late pregnancy to the offspring. METHODS: Over seven-week-old C57BL/6J mice were mated, and isolated female mice on the basis of having a vaginal septum. The dam mice were divided into control and disruption groups at the late pregnancy, then circadian disruption was conducted by controlling light/dark cycle. The animals were kept under controlled temperature, and food and water were provided ad libitum during the experiments. We monitored the changes of body weight and food intake of dam mice, and measured birthweight and changes in the fetal body weight for 20 weeks. RESULTS: Maternal body weight and food intake were unaffected irrespective of the light-dark conditions. Likewise, no significant difference was found in birthweight and postnatal weight gain regardless of disorder of the circadian rhythm of dam mice. There was no evidence of low body weight or overweight at birth due to the disruption of the circadian rhythm of dam mice. CONCLUSION: Circadian rhythm disruption during late maternal period did not cause aberrant birth weight of offspring. Our findings suggest that the circadian rhythm disruption during late gestation is not the major reason for birthweightassociated metabolic disorder in offspring.

N2  - Objective: Circadian rhythms are generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and involve rhythmic expression of clock genes and proteins. This rhythmicity is transferred to peripheral tissues by neural and hormonal signals. Late pregnancy is considered a state of inflammation which impacts on peripheral tissues such as joints. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediates inflammatory and circadian responses through its p55 receptor (TNFRp55). Neuroimmunoendocrine interactions in joints have not been studied completely. The purpose of this study was to analyze these interactions, investigating the circadian rhythms of progesterone (Pg) and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the joints at the end of pregnancy (gestational day 18). Moreover, the impact of TNFRp55 deficiency on these temporal oscillations was explored. Methods: Wild-type and TNFRp55-deficient (KO) C57BL/6 mice were kept under constant darkness in order to study their endogenous circadian rhythms. The expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Per1 at circadian time 7 was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in the ankle joints of nonpregnant and pregnant (gestational day 18) mice. In late pregnancy, Pg and the cytokines interleukin 17 (IL-17), IL-6, and IL-10 were measured in the joints throughout a 24-h period by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: A significant increase in Bmal1 and Per1 mRNA expression was detected in the joints of pregnant KO mice. Furthermore, KO mice displayed a desynchronization of articular Pg and cytokine production. Conclusions: Our results show that TNF, via TNFRp55 signaling, modulates articular Pg and cytokine circadian rhythms in late pregnancy. These findings suggest a temporal neuroimmunoendocrine association in peripheral tissues in late pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes. Mechanisms underlying the association between obstructive sleep apnea and gestational diabetes remain to be elucidated. Methods: Twenty-three participants with gestational diabetes underwent home sleep apnea testing. Obstructive sleep apnea was defined as an apnea hypopnea index > 5. Fasting morning blood samples were measured using multianalyte profiling (xMAP) multiplexed bead array immunoassay for Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and Interleukin 8. Results: Age, body mass index, and gestational age at enrollment were 31 + 4.4 years, 35.7 + 7.4 kg/m2, and 28 ± 4 weeks, respectively. Participants were 52% Caucasian and 16% had obstructive sleep apnea. We observed positive correlations between apnea hypopnea index and Interleukin 6 (r = 0.62, p = 0.005), Interleukin 8 (r = 0.56, p =.56), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r =.58, p =.009). Women with obstructive sleep apnea had higher levels of Interleukin 6 (F = 5.01, p =.037) and Interleukin 8 (F = 6.33, p =.021) vs. women without obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that in women with gestational diabetes, apnea hypopnea index is associated with an elevated inflammatory profile.

N2  - Good quality sleep of sufficient duration is vital for optimal physiological function and our health. Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired neurocognitive function and emotional control, and increases the risk for cardiometabolic diseases, obesity and cancer. Sleep develops during fetal life with the emergence of a recognisable pattern of sleep states in the preterm fetus associated with the development, maturation and connectivity within neural networks in the brain. Despite the physiological importance of sleep, surprisingly little is known about how sleep develops in individuals born preterm. Globally, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (<37 weeks gestation) each year, and these babies are at significant risk of neural injury and impaired brain development. This review discusses how sleep develops during fetal and neonatal life, how preterm birth impacts on sleep development to adulthood, and the factors which may contribute to impaired brain and sleep development, leading to altered neurocognitive, behavioural and motor capabilities in the infant and child. Going forward, the challenge is to identify specific risk factors for impaired sleep development in preterm babies to allow for the design of interventions that will improve the quality and quantity of sleep throughout life.

N2  - Objective: Sleep is a physiological process of vital importance for the integral health of human beings. It could present alterations and to produce cognitive, organic and psychosocial dysfunction. There are different factors that could affect it. The hormonal changes during climacteric provoke the apparition of sleep disorders. The objective to establish the factors associated with sleep disorders in Colombian women in climacteric, who live in the Caribbean. Design: Cross-sectional study, which is part of the CAVIMEC (Calidad de Vida en la Menopausia y Etnias Colombianas) project, carried out in Colombian women in climacteric, with age between 40-59 years old. Pregnant women, those who did not want to participate, those with psychiatric history, mental deficiency or physical disorders that made difficult the participation in the study, were excluded. An anonymous survey was applied, which included general socio-demographic questions and the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short-Form (ICIQ-SF), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS), the SCOFF questionnaire, a screening tool for eating disorders, and the short loneliness scale. A sample of 585 women was calculated. The population was divided in two groups according to the JSS: Women with sleep disorder (with scoring greater than or equal to 1) and without it (scoring equal to 0). The analysis was carried out with SPSS-21. Categorical data was expressed as percentages with confidence interval of 95% (CI95%) and continuous data was expressed as median (Me) with interquartile range (IR). The differences of percentages were evaluated with χ2 test and differences of medians with Mann Whitney. Association, Odds ratio (OR), was established between sleep disorders and the other variables by means of logistic regression. A p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Universidad de Cartagena. Results: 90,3% [CI95% 87,5-97,5] of the studied women presented sleep disorder. There were no significant differences in the age between women with sleep disorder, Me=47 [IR:6,5], and those who were not presenting it, Me=48 [IR:6,0], p=0,51. The presence of sleep disorder was higher in mestizos [91,5% [CI95% 88,8-93,7], followed by afro-descendants and indigenes, 73,9% [CI95% 51,6-89,8] and 75% [CI95% 50,9-91,3], respectively, p=0,001. 92,7% [CI95% 89,1-95,1] of postmenopausal women presented sleep disorders, different from women in perimenopause and premenopause, 90,0% [CI95% 82,4-95,1] and 85,4% [CI95% 79, 0-90,5], respectively, p=0,04. The median of the punctuation of the MRS was greater in those women with sleep disorder, Me=18 [IR:10], than in those without it, Me=11,0 [IR;18,5], p=0,003. To have clinically meaningful depressive symptoms (Goldberg) increased more than five times the risk of presenting sleep disorder. To have symptoms of anxiety, urinary incontinence, eating disorders, perceived stress, loneliness and deterioration of the quality of life, were not factors associated significantly. Conclusion: The prevalence of sleep disorder, especially in postmenopause, was high. Clinically meaningful depressive symptoms were identified as risk factor to develop sleep disorder in a Colombian population.

N2  - Background: : The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Methods: : This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors. Results: : Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (β = 0.10 and β = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (β = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (β = 0.12, all p<.01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks. Limitations: : Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health. Conclusions: : Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems and long-term child development.

N2  - Background: Fatgue is common in rheumatoid arthrits (RA).[1] The complex interplay of sleep quality on fatgue has not been studied much. Objectve: This is a cross-sectonal study for evaluatng the correlaton between the quality of sleep and the fatgue scale, in RA patients in remission. Methods: Inclusion criteria: Patients (n = 46) who fulfilled American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatsm 2010 RA classificaton criteria, and in remission were recruited. Exclusion criteria: Patients aged <16, serious comorbidites, patients on biologicals, and pregnant and lactatng mothers. Procedure: Afer writen consent, patients were examined; disease actvity (disease actvity score 28, simplifed disease actvity index, and clinical disease actvity index) were recorded. Fatgue was evaluated with FACIT-F and sleep quality was assessed using Pitsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). There were 32 (70%) females and 14 males (30%). The mean age was 36 ± 8.2 (interquartle range 28). The mean disease duraton was 5.66 ± 2.9. 37 (80%) patients were on double disease-modifying antrheumatc drugs (DMARDs) methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine. Six (13%) patients were on triple DMARDs. Three (6.5%) patients had received biological in the form of injecton etanercept 50 mg/every week for 12 doses. The mean FACIT-F score was 28.6 ± 8.9. The mean PSQLI score was 9.12 ± 3.8. The score of <5 was taken as poor sleep quality and >5 as poor sleepers. In poor sleepers (33 patients [71%]) the mean score was 2.2 ± 1.3. The fatgue scale among the poor sleepers was 24 ± 4.8. The mean fatgue scale among the good sleepers was 32 ± 3.7. The mean fatgue scale was 22.2 ± 3.4 in females and 38 ± 2.9 in males. Spearman's correlaton coeficient was 0.27 (P < 0.03). Conclusion: Fatgue is common in RA. This study was able to document fatgue even in patients in remission. Fatgue was more common in female patients than males. Sleep might be important in the multfaceted etology of fatgue.

N2  - To explore the influence of the parturients’ mental factors on the delivery mode and postpartum hemorrhage and the nursing intervention countermeasures, the research randomly divided the expectant primiparae hospitalized in our hospital during February 2012–February 2013 into the intervention group and the control group. Wherein, the control group received routine nursing, while the intervention group received nursing intervention based on the routine nursing, to compare the postpartum hemorrhage and satisfaction of the two groups of parturients. Result: 36 of 112 parturients suffered from dysphoria, accounting for 32.14%; 37 parturSients suffered from depression, accounting for 33.04%. The parturients’ hemorrhage incidence, postpartum amount of bleeding within 2 h and postpartum amount of bleeding within 24 h all significantly declined compared with those of the control group (x2/t = 398402496p < 005). The cesarean rate of the control group (7.14%, 4/56) was significantly higher than that of the control group (16.07%, 9/56) (x2 = 402p < 005). The postpartum satisfaction of the patients in the intervention group was apparently higher than that of the control group (x2 = 426p < 005). Conclusion: The nursing intervention can obviously reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and improve postpartum satisfaction, so it is worth popularizing.

N2  - Objectives: Parental incarceration (PI) is a prevalent adverse childhood experience (ACE) that has been linked to numerous social, emotional, and health problems in childhood and adulthood. A growing body of research has emphasized the importance of the timing of parent's incarceration on developmental outcomes. Study design: The present study uses case–control matching to examine the impact of recent PI on newborn health and home safety outcomes. Methods: Neonatal health and newborn sleep and home safety data, including rates of premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), neonatal intensive care unit admittance, breastfeeding initiation, safe sleep, and home environment (e.g. working smoke alarm, proper firearm storage), were collected from 108 women who completed the Virginia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring survey. Half of these women (n = 54) had experienced the incarceration of themselves or their partner during the previous 12 months. Participants were matched by age, race, income, and the education level with those of 54 women who completed the survey and who had not experienced incarceration in the previous year. Results: Controlling for nicotine and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other stressors, path analyses show that the women who experienced incarceration of themselves or their husband/partner were significantly less likely to deliver an LBW infant and more likely to live in a home with a loaded firearm in the home. No other significant differences emerged between the two matched groups among neonatal health or newborn sleep and home safety outcomes. Conclusions: This result is considered from a public health perspective, as PI is an ACE which can be impacted by policy, particularly policies that promote practices that healthcare workers can use in correctional and other environments to encourage healthy pregnancies and home environments for newborns.

N2  - Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder characterized by the presence of orthostatic symptoms (including lightheadedness, palpitations, nausea, dyspnea, and tremulousness) as well as excessive upright tachycardia. POTS predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Treating POTS involves a multi-faceted approach using non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. There are no pharmacological treatments that are currently United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for POTS due to lack of randomized controlled trials. Yet, several medications can improve POTS symptoms and are supported by small prospective studies or retrospective case series. Drugs that are most commonly used for POTS target the following mechanisms 1) blood volume expansion, 2) reduction of heart rate, 3) peripheral vasoconstriction and 4) sympatholysis. Pharmacological approaches can also be used to target specific symptoms including “brain fog,” fatigue, sleep, and depression. This review outlines pharmacological approaches for treating POTS and summarizes evidence supporting each treatment approach.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated independently with central serous retinopathy (CSR) in a Greek population, using multivariate approach. Methods: Participants in the study were 183 consecutive patients diagnosed with CSR and 183 controls, matched for age. All participants underwent complete ophthalmological examination and information regarding their sociodemographic, clinical, medical and ophthalmological history were recorded, so as to assess potential risk factors for CSR. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed. Results: Univariate analysis showed that male sex, high educational status, high income, alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, coronary heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, autoimmune disorders, H. pylori infection, type A personality and stress, steroid use, pregnancy and hyperopia were associated with CSR, while myopia was found to protect from CSR. In multivariate analysis, alcohol consumption, hypertension, coronary heart disease and autoimmune disorders lost their significance, while the remaining factors were all independently associated with CSR. Conclusions: It is important to take into account the various risk factors for CSR, so as to define vulnerable groups and to shed light into the pathogenesis of the disease.

N2  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sleep related neurological disorder with prevalence between 1 and 10%, increasing with age. Women are more frequently affected than men. RLS is characterized by an urge to move the legs accompanied by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, worsening of complaints during periods of rest, improvement by movement and an increase of symptoms in the evening or at night. In addition, affected patients may also suffer from severe sleep disorders and negative effects on daily activities. There is often a history of RLS among first-degree relatives, especially with the primary form. Among other, comorbidities or causal factors are iron deficiency, terminal renal insufficiency, pregnancy, polyneuropathy, or psychotropic drugs. The etiology of primary (idiopathic) RLS has not been clarified yet; however, genetic factors and dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission as well as alterations of central iron metabolism play an important role. In addition to non-pharmacological treatment such as lifestyle modifications or behavioral strategies, levodopa, dopamine agonists, or anticonvulsants are effective. Opioids may be used in otherwise refractory forms. In the case of secondary or comorbid RLS, treatment of the underlying disease is necessary.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the clinical experience with brivaracetam as add-on treatment in adult patients with difficult-totreat epilepsy. Methods: In the period June 2016-January 2018, adult (> 18 years) patients treated with brivaracetam at the National Center for Epilepsy in Norway were recruited consecutively. The only exclusion criterion was pregnancy. Results: So far, 47 refractory patients have been included. Of these, 37 (19 men and 18 women) have been followed for more than 6 months. Average age at epilepsy debut was 10.8 years, median duration of epilepsy was 32 years, mean number of previously tried AEDs was 7.4, and number of AEDs currently in use was 0-4. Nine of the patients had an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The responder rate (> 50% seizure reduction) was 41% (n = 15). Two patients (5%) became seizure-free. Fifteen patients (41%) had been tapered off the drug: 10 due to adverse effects, 4 due to a combination of adverse effects and lack of efficacy, and one because of pregnancy. Twenty-four patients (65%) reported adverse effects. Most common was psychiatric symptoms (n = 10, mostly aggression), gastrointestinal problems (n = 5), sleep disturbance (n = 4) and cognitive problems/tiredness (n = 6). Three patients experienced a seizure aggravation. Four patients reported speech disturbances. This has not previously been reported as an adverse effect for brivaracetam. The speech problems seemed to be dose-related. Conclusion: Brivaracetam appears to be a promising addon treatment for patients with intractable seizures. However, it is important to be aware of psychiatric and cognitive adverse effects.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Stillbirth is a devastating event for the pregnant woman, families, and care providers alike. No preventable stillbirths should be tolerated, no matter how low the incidence is. The rate of reducing stillbirth rate is less than satisfactory and warrants continued efforts. Indeed, massive researches from all specialties bloomed in recent years. Some interventions are with good evidence and feasible to be practiced, while others are preliminary but exciting to be investigated further. The purpose of this review is a comprehensive overview of the recent studies on stillbirth prevention. An emphasis is placed on novel ideas or areas to be improved on that might interest prospective readers. Recent Findings: For pregnant women, optimized healthy lifestyle including body weight, blood sugar, and blood pressure control is warranted. Vigilance on fetal movement is important for detecting fetal distress. Sudden vigorous movement means no less than reduced movement and should prompt timely evaluations. Sleep in supine position compromises maternal vena cava and poses increased stillbirth risks; thus, mothers are advised to sleep on their left side. For health professionals, biomarkers are studied to detect early placental insufficiency. Doppler velocimetry, fetal cardiotocography, and biophysical profile are helpful in evaluating fetal well-being but require adequate training and careful interpretation. Timely iatrogenic delivery is effective in lowering perinatal deaths but should be balanced against newborn prematurity. Precision medicine, utilizing genetic studies, microarrays to analyze causes of death or fetal hypoxia severity in utero is promising in filling the knowledge gaps about stillbirth. Special effort should be allocated to bereavement services, follow-up clinics, and social support to minimize the psychological impact on stillbirths. Moreover, care bundles that set specific goals, algorithms, including stillbirth investigations and cause classifications should be implemented, followed by auditing and data analysis. In the long run, health promotion in women by empowerment through gender equality and access to medical resources should be strived for. Summary: Stillbirth prevention is a work undone but has received ongoing attention and massive research efforts. Individuals, healthcare providers, and policy makers alike should stay interested and up to date.

N2  - Key points: We evaluated the effect of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) on seizures induced by asphyxia in preterm fetal sheep. MgSO4 did not prevent seizures, but significantly reduced the total duration, number of seizures, seizure amplitude and average seizure burden. Saline-asphyxia male fetuses had significantly more seizures than female fetuses, but male fetuses showed significantly greater reduction in seizures during MgSO4 infusion than female fetuses. A circadian profile of seizure activity was observed in all fetuses, with peak seizures seen around 04.00–06.00 h on the first and second days after the end of asphyxia. This study is the first to demonstrate that MgSO4 has utility as an anti-seizure agent after hypoxia–ischaemia. More information is needed about the mechanisms mediating the effect of MgSO4 on seizures and sexual dimorphism, and the influence of circadian rhythms on seizure expression. Abstract: Seizures are common in newborns after asphyxia at birth and are often refractory to anti-seizure agents. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) has anticonvulsant effects and is increasingly given to women in preterm labour for potential neuroprotection. There is limited information on its effects on perinatal seizures. We examined the hypothesis that MgSO4 infusion would reduce fetal seizures after asphyxia in utero. Preterm fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation (104 days, term = 147 days) were given intravenous infusions of either saline (n = 14) or MgSO4 (n = 12, 160 mg bolus + 48 mg h−1 infusion over 48 h). Fetuses underwent umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) for 25 min, 24 h after the start of infusion. The start time for seizures did not differ between groups, but MgSO4 significantly reduced the total number of seizures (P < 0.001), peak seizure amplitude (P < 0.05) and seizure burden (P < 0.005). Within the saline-asphyxia group, male fetuses had significantly more seizures than females (P < 0.05). Within the MgSO4-asphyxia group, although both sexes had fewer seizures than the saline-asphyxia group, the greatest effect of MgSO4 was on male fetuses, with reduced numbers of seizures (P < 0.001) and seizure burden (P < 0.005). Only 1 out of 6 MgSO4 males had seizures on the second day post-UCO compared to 5 out of 6 MgSO4 female fetuses (P = 0.08). Finally, seizures showed a circadian profile with peak seizures between 04.00 and 06.00 h on the first and second day post-UCO. Collectively, these results suggest that MgSO4 may have utility in treating perinatal seizures and has sexually dimorphic effects.

N2  - Purpose: The purposes of our study were to assess the clinical and etiological peculiarities of West syndrome, based on MRI data and its relation to the long-term outcome and to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome after 12 and 24 months and their early predictors. Method: We performed a prospective, clinical, cohort, hospital-based study. 1st year-We enrolled 31 newly diagnosed patients (17 male, 14 female) with infantile spasms. We collected birth, family and seizure detailed history. All patients were examined neurologically, investigated with prolonged sleep and awake video-EEG, brain MRI, developmental screening tests (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development™, Third Edition; Ages & Stages Questionnaires®, Third Edition, ASQ-3™) were done. Results: One year follow-up assessment in 22 (74%) and 2 years follow-up assessment were provided in 8 (25%) cases. One patient died during the study. On the 2nd assessment neuropsychological development was without changes in 12 (55%) and 3 years after in 3 (37%) individuals. Some improvement was detected in 3 (9.7%) cases on 2nd and 3 (37%) on 3rd assessment. The deterioration of development was identified in 6 (19%) individuals 2 years after and in 2 (25%) individuals on 3rd assessment. On the 2nd assessment in all cases with developmental deterioration, seizures were started before seven months of age, this association was statistically significant (Pearson Chi-Square 6.3; df 1; p=0.019). There was no relationship between developmental changes and sex, birth from full term pregnancy, infantile spasm type, treatment, or EEG pattern, however. Conclusion: Despite the fact, that the number of included patients was small, preliminary findings are in accordance to the other published data. The current study is still in process. 12-24 months follow-up with clinical, EEG and neuropsychological monitoring is planned for all cases.

N2  - In neonatal animal models, isolated limb movements during active sleep provide input to immature somatomotor cortex necessary for its development and are somatotopically encoded by alpha-beta oscillations as late as the equivalent of human full-term. Limb movements elicit similar neural patterns in very pre-term human infants (average 30 corrected gestational weeks), suggesting an analogous role in humans, but it is unknown until when they subserve this function. In a cohort of 19 neonates (31-42 corrected gestational weeks) we showed that isolated hand movements during active sleep continue to induce these same somatotopically distributed oscillations well into the perinatal period, but that these oscillations decline towards full-term and fully disappear at 41 corrected gestational weeks (equivalent to the end of gestation). We also showed that these highly localised alpha-beta oscillations are associated with an increase in delta oscillations which extends to the frontal area and does not decline with age. These results suggest that isolated limb movements during active sleep could have an important role in experience-dependent somatomotor development up until normal birth in humans.

N2  - Core and peripheral body temperatures are affected by changes in reproductive hormones during the menstrual cycle. Women worldwide use the basal body temperature (BBT) method to aid and prevent conception. However, prior research suggests that taking one’s daily temperature can prove inconvenient and subject to environmental factors. We investigate whether a more automatic, non-invasive temperature measurement system can detect changes in temperature across the menstrual cycle. We examined how wrist skin temperature (WST), measured with wearable sensors, correlates with urinary tests of ovulation and may serve as a new method of fertility tracking. One hundred and thirty-six eumenorrheic, non-pregnant women participated in an observational study. Participants wore WST biosensors during sleep and reported their daily activities. An at-home luteinizing hormone (LH) test was used to confirm ovulation. WST was recorded across 437 cycles (mean cycles/participant = 3.21, S.D. = 2.25). We tested the relationship between the fertile window and WST temperature shifts, using the BBT three-over-six rule. A sustained 3-day temperature shift was observed in 357/437 cycles (82%), with the lowest cycle temperature occurring in the fertile window 41% of the time. Most temporal shifts (307/357, 86%) occurred on ovulation day (OV) or later. The average early-luteal phase temperature was 0.33C higher than in the fertile window. Menstrual cycle changes in WST were impervious to lifestyle factors, like having sex, alcohol, or eating prior to bed, that, in prior work, have been shown to obfuscate BBT readings. Although currently costlier than BBT, the present study suggests that WST could be a promising, convenient parameter for future multiparameter fertility awareness methods.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed countries. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria. Results: In total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence. Conclusions: Health-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG). PROCESS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. RECOMMENDATIONS The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.

N2  - Background: Women of childbearing age (18-44 years) present an important group for understanding sleep, but few studies have focused on this population. No study has investigated the associations among sleep, overweight/obesity, and risk of type 2 diabetes among childbearing-age women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: Data were from NHANES, 2005-2008. The study population consisted of 18-44 year old women. Pregnant women and those diagnosed with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep duration and quality were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) measurements, and a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed by trained NHANES staff. An unadjusted linear regression analysis; a second adjusted for demographics only (partially adjusted model); and a third adjusted for demographics and variables associated with overweight/obesity and diabetes (fully adjusted model) were computed to assess associations among sleep duration/quality and BMI, WC, and 2-hour OGTT. Results: Total sample consisted of 2388 childbearing-age women. Only sleep duration was significantly associated with BMI and WC in the unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but was no longer significant in the fully adjusted model. Neither sleep duration nor quality was significantly associated with 2-hour OGTT in any of the models. Conclusions: Targeting sleep duration and sleep quality alone would not likely contribute to significantly lower BMI, WC, or risk of type 2 diabetes in US childbearing-age women. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones using objective measures of sleep, are needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - Among obese pregnant women, 15%-20% have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and this prevalence increases along with body mass index and in the presence of other comorbidities. Prepregnancy obesity and pregnancy-related weight gain are certainly risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy, but certain physiologic changes of pregnancy may also increase a woman's risk of developing or worsening OSA. While it has been shown that untreated OSA in postmenopausal women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic comorbidities, a body of literature is emerging that suggests OSA may also have serious implications for the health of mothers and fetuses during and after pregnancy. In this review, we discuss the following: pregnancy as a vulnerable period for the development or worsening of OSA; the associations between OSA and maternal and fetal outcomes; the current screening modalities for OSA in pregnancy; and current recommendations regarding peripartum management of OSA.

N2  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality is common in pregnancy and associated with increased psychological distress, which has adverse consequences for families. Emerging theory suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may help reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity to stressful events. The current study examines the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on the relationship between poor sleep quality and increased depression symptom severity and perceived stress during pregnancy. Additionally, we explored the prevalence of poor sleep quality in this unique sample and the impact of intervention on sleep quality. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 215 ethnically diverse, overweight and obese, predominantly low-income pregnant women drawn from a study examining the impact of an 8-week mindfulness-based program (Mindful Moms Training; MMT) to reduce excessive gestational weight gain, stress, and depression compared to treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: Participants reported global sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress at baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: Most participants (63%) were categorized as poor sleepers at baseline. MMT participants did not experience significantly greater improvement in sleep quality compared to TAU participants. Baseline poor global sleep quality predicted increased depression symptom severity for all participants. Baseline poor global sleep quality predicted increased perceived stress for the TAU group only; this association was not evident in the MMT group. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality is prevalent in overweight and obese predominantly low-income pregnant women. Poor sleep quality was associated with worsening psychological distress, but mindfulness training significantly attenuated the influence of poor sleep on perceived stress.

N2  - Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, little is known about the association of SDB with timing of delivery. We examined the association of snoring frequency, a key SDB marker, and snoring intensity, a correlate of SDB severity, with time-to-delivery among a cohort of pregnant women. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1483 third trimester pregnant women were recruited from the University of Michigan prenatal clinics. Women completed a questionnaire about their sleep, and demographic and pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of those with hypertension or diabetes, 954 women were classified into two groups by their snoring onset timing, chronic or pregnancy-onset. Within each of these groups, women were divided into four groups based on their snoring frequency and intensity: non-snorers; infrequent-quiet; frequent-quiet; or frequent-loud snorers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery, adjusting for maternal characteristics. Results: Chronic snoring was reported by half of the pregnant women, and of those, 7% were frequent-loud snorers. Deliveries before 38 weeks’ gestation are completed occurred among 25% of women with chronic, frequent-loud snoring. Compared with pre-pregnancy non-snorers, women with chronic frequent-loud snoring had an increased hazard ratio for delivery (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.45). Conclusions: Snoring frequency and intensity is associated with time-to-delivery in women absent of hypertension or diabetes. Frequent-loud snoring may have a clinical utility to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver earlier.

Methods: It is a cross-sectional observational study, from July to September 2017, conducted at Tertiary Care Hospital in Karachi. The tool used for data collection was interviewer based closed ended questionnaire, 279 pregnant women who fasted during Ramadan were included in the study. Results: One to ten days of fasting was observed by 85.7% (198) of women. About 72.4% (202) never consulted any doctor for pre-Ramadan advice regarding fasting in pregnancy. Pregnant women 81.7% (228) believed that fasting would not cause any harm to their unborn child, while 42.7% (119) of family members feared about the health of mother and unborn child. Seventy four percent (208) of respondents had a reduced sleep cycle of about 3-4 hours. The food items consumed at Sehri and Iftar were rich in carbohydrates and fats. Conclusions: Pre-Ramadan medical consultation regarding safety of fasting during pregnancy should be structured and customized for women and their families. Gaps in knowledge identified in this study may help healthcare professionals to address these issues.

N2  - Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the association between nightly, napping, and 24-h sleep duration throughout pregnancy and birth weight z-score among nulli- and multiparous women. Methods: Nightly,napping, and 24-h sleep duration and birth weight z-score (calculated on thebasis of the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st century standards) were studied in a cohort of 176 pregnant women from Brazil. Linear mixed-effect analyses were performed to assess the longitudinal evolution of sleep duration and the best unbiased linear predictors of the random coefficients were estimated. The best unbiased linear predictor estimates of sleep duration intercept and slope were included in the linear regression models with birth weight z-score as the outcome. Results: The mean hours of nightly sleep decreased during pregnancy in nulliparous women (β = −0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.83 to −0.27) but the decrease was not statistically significant in multiparous women (β = −0.19; 95% CI, −0.30 to 0.01). Twenty-four hour sleep duration decreased during pregnancy in both multiparous (β = −0.50; 95% CI, −0.76 to −0.25) and nulliparous women (β = 0.77; 95% CI, −1.06 to −0.48). Napping sleep duration did not change in either group. Among the nulliparous women, both first-trimester 24-h sleep duration and its change throughout pregnancy were inversely associated with birth weight (β = −0.44; 95% CI, −0.68 to −0.21; β = −1.75; 95% CI, −3.17 to −0.30, respectively). No associations were detected in multiparous women for nightly and napping sleep duration. Conclusions: Nulliparous women with greater decreases in sleep duration throughout their pregnancy gave birth to newborns with lower birth weight z-scores.

N2  - Women who have experienced significant adversities during childhood and adulthood are at risk for excessive inflammation during pregnancy, but the mechanisms are unclear. Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress in 214 women assessed at mid-pregnancy (5–31 weeks gestation). Self-reported data on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation. These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Compared to women who have given birth before (i.e., multiparas), those giving birth for the first time (i.e., primiparas) show higher cortisol levels. Psychological factors may play a role; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation is a well-described stress response. Primiparity also predicts greater risk for postpartum depression, which may be related to greater correspondence between cortisol and mood following prenatal cortisol elevations. The current study examined associations among parity, perinatal cortisol adaptation, pregnancy-specific distress, and postpartum mood. Methods: This longitudinal study assayed serum cortisol levels among 137 women at early, mid-, and late pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy-specific distress and depressive symptoms were assessed. Maternal age, race, body mass index, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and sampling time of day were statistically controlled. Results: Primiparous women showed higher cortisol levels than multiparous women during mid- (χ2 = 11.8, p < 0.01) and late pregnancy (χ2 = 18.9, p < 0.01) and higher distress across pregnancy (F1,126 = 22.1, p < 0.01). Mediation analyses demonstrated that the association between parity and prenatal cortisol (per area under the curve; AUC) was partially accounted for by distress (ab = 1.0, 95%CI [0.05, 2.9]). Prenatal cortisol (per AUC) did not predict postpartum depressive symptoms (b* = 0.03, p = 0.81), with no difference by parity (b* = 0.03, p = 0.91). At postpartum, a significant interaction between parity and cortisol (b* = 0.40, p = 0.03) revealed no significant association between cortisol and mood among multiparas (b* = −0.11, p = 0.28) but a trend toward a positive association among primiparas (b* = 0.24, p = 0.06). Discussion: Cortisol levels and pregnancy-specific distress are higher in primiparas versus multiparas, with pregnancy-specific distress partially mediating the association between parity and cortisol levels. Cortisol levels and mood display correspondence at postpartum in primiparous but not multiparous women. While observational studies must be interpreted with caution due to potential unmeasured confounders, these findings suggest that future studies examining mechanisms underlying perinatal and postpartum hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal perturbations and designing interventions aimed at preventing related complications should carefully consider potential differences by parity.

N2  - There are in France several millions of shift-workers and night-workers (20 to 25% of employees). These workers are therefore subject to variations in their working and rest schedules. These regular schedule changes are associated with repeated desynchronization of circadian biological clock. The negative impacts on sleep are insomnia, drowsiness, and reduced sleep time in 24 hours. There is also a proven effect on the occurrence of a metabolic syndrome, with a likely effect on obesity, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure and coronary artery disease. There is a likely effect on the occurrence of cancer (including breast cancer). Night working is not recommended for pregnant women because of the risk of miscarriage, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation.

N2  - Introduction: Given the increasing number of women service members and veterans of childbearing age, it is important to understand the preconception risks in this potentially vulnerable population. This study compared the prevalence of modifiable preconception risk factors among women with and without a history of service. Methods: Analyses included data from the 2013 and 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Preconception risk factors included health behaviors, chronic conditions, and mental health among women of childbearing age. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to compare the adjusted prevalence of each outcome among women with and without a history of service. Interaction terms assessed variation by age and history of service. Results: Compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service reported higher prevalence of insufficient sleep (49.6% vs. 36.3%; p <.001) and diagnosed depression (26.5% vs. 21.6%; p <.01). Women with a history of service were overall less likely to have obesity (19.8% vs. 26.5%; p <.001). Age-stratified results suggested that, compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service were more likely to smoke in the 25 to 34 age group and reported comparable levels of obesity in the 35 to 44 age group. Conclusions: Women with a history of service demonstrated a preconception health profile that differs from women without a history of service. It is critical that providers are aware of their patients’ military status and potential associated risks.

N2  - Time of day is a critical factor for most biological functions, but concepts from the field of chronobiology have yet to be fully translated to clinical practice. Circadian rhythms, generated internally and synchronised to the external environment, promote function and support survival in almost every living species. Fetal circadian rhythms can be observed in utero from 30 weeks gestation, coupled to the maternal rhythm, but synchronise to the external environment only after birth. Important cues for synchronisation include the light/dark cycle, the timing of feeding, and exposure to melatonin in breast milk. Disruption to these cues may occur during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. This can impair the development of circadian rhythms, and influence survival and function in the neonatal period, with a potential to impact health and well-being throughout adult life. Here we outline the rationale and evidence to support a chronobiological approach to neonatal care.

N2  - Introduction: This study of 20 patients evaluated the effectiveness of TMS on symptoms of depression, insomnia, and weight change using the Brainsway system at 18 Hz over the prefrontal cortex. Methods: Each patient completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the beginning and the end of treatment. Results: The average weight of our clients was 220.1 pounds, with an average change of +1.44 pounds, which was not statistically significant. (One patient was excluded from these weight results due to the fact that she was pregnant.) The average Beck score improved from a score on the borderline of moderate/severe at 30.1 to a mild depression category of 13.55. PHQ-9 scores improved on average from a moderate/severe level of 15.95 to mild at 7.1. Average Insomnia Severity Index scores improved from 12.9 to 8.65. The average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score improved from 11.55 to a score of 8.25 with treatment. The change in the Beck Depression Inventory, PHQ-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were all statistically significant using paired sample t-tests. Discussion: The overall change of weight of only 1.44 pounds is clinically relevant in the fact that antidepressants when used to treat depression may have a side effect of weight gain. We also had some patients that experienced weight loss. Our study demonstrated statistically significant findings using TMS for the treatment of both depression and insomnia.

N2  - Congenital anomalies are caused by gene-environmental interaction during embryonic development. Hypoxic stress, which can be induced by smoking, arrhythmia, sleep apnea syndrome, living at high altitudes and uptake of medicine, is known as one of environmental factors during pregnancy. Since the effect of hypoxic stress in tooth development has not been fully understood, we established an experimental model and analyzed dental phenotypes. Pregnant wild-type mice were intraperitoneally injected with phenytoin, an antiepileptic drug and a known arrhythmia inducer, at embryonic day (E) 15 and 16 and then dissected for sampling at E17 for histological and molecular analyses. In phenytoin-treated tooth germs, ectopic congestion in the pulp and disappearance of neighboring odontoblasts were observed and hypoxic markers Hif1a, VEGFa and Hypoxyprove were immunopositive in odontoblasts. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis using cDNA derived from E17 tooth germs revealed that Hif1a and VEGFa were significantly up-regulated in phenytoin-treated group than non-treated. Our data suggest that ectopic congestion can occur in tooth germs under hypoxic stress during pregnancy and it may affect proper tissue organization leading to partial congenital dentinogenesis imperfecta in mice.

N2  - Maternal morbidity is associated with cesarean deliveries. However, new evidence suggests that short- and long-term neonatal morbidity is also associated. This includes respiratory morbidity with conflicting results. To determine whether mode of delivery has an impact on the long-term risk for respiratory morbidity in the offspring, a population-based cohort analysis was conducted including all singleton term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. A comparison was performed between children delivered via elective cesarean delivery (CD) and those delivered vaginally. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis as were all cases of urgent CDs. Pediatric hospitalizations involving respiratory morbidity of offspring up to the age of 18 years were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity incidence and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. During the study period, 132,054 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 8.9% were via elective CDs (n = 11,746) and 91.1% (n = 120,308) were vaginal deliveries. Hospitalizations of the offspring involving respiratory morbidity were significantly more common in offspring delivered by CDs (5.2 vs. 4.3% in vaginal deliveries, p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity in the elective CD group (log rank p < 0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model, while controlling for maternal age, gestational age, and birthweight, CD exhibited a significant and independent association with long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.22 (CI, 1.12–1.33), p < 0.001). Conclusion: Elective cesarean delivery at term is a significant risk factor for long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring.What is Known:• Cesarean delivery is a major surgery with known possible complications.• Cesarean delivery has possible immediate complications for the newborn including respiratory complications.What is New:• Our study shows more long term respiratory morbidity in the CD group including asthma and obstructive sleep apnea.• Different possible explanations have been proposed including exposure to maternal flora during vaginal delivery and the stress hormones secreted during contractions and delivery.

N2  - A 33-year-old primiparous woman was admitted on her 14th day postpartum to the psychiatric clinic of the Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai, China. The patient had a healthy pregnancy, followed by an uneventful vaginal delivery and slow recovery from childbirth, but during the first 2 weeks after birth, she developed signs of somatic discomfort and emotional instability, leading her to seek professional help. On admission, she reported having difficulties in controlling emotions, feeling sad, crying, and worrying constantly throughout the day. She felt tired and hopeless and was losing interest in daily activities such as feeding the baby and cooking. She had lost her appetite and was eating irregularly. Her sleep was also impaired; she could not sleep even when the baby was asleep. These symptoms had a gradual onset within the first week after delivery. Although she did not have suicidal ideation, she did express feelings of guilt. The patient had no significant past medical history, and she did not report any history of misuse of alcohol, medication, or illicit drugs. There was no relevant personal or family history of mental illness. Results of a clinical assessment, including physical examination, laboratory studies (total blood count, thyroid function tests), and cerebral CT scan, were normal. The patient scored 21/30 on the Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a depression screening tool that has satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in identifying depression in the early postpartum period in Chinese populations (1-4). The patient was diagnosed as having postpartum depression and was offered treatment with a combination of psychotherapy and antidepressant or anxiolytic medication. The patient and her family were concerned about the safety of the medications for the mother and baby and declined pharmacotherapy but agreed to proceed with psychotherapy. They believed that help, support, and reassurance from family or friends would lead the patient to recovery. For the following 4 weeks, the patient practiced the traditional Chinese postpartum ritual of "doing the month." According to traditional practices, a new mother is in ayin state (depletion of vitality) and needs to recover her health by resting in bed, eating certain foods, and taking tonics. During the first postnatal month, while her body recovers from childbirth, she is spared from all household chores and is attended by a female relative, usually the mother or mother-in-law. This social support in the early postpartum period is an integral part of the zuoyuezi, which translates to "doing the month." The intimacy and enriched emotional and material support made possible through these indigenous practices and rituals strengthen a mother's self-esteem, provide emotional support, and buffer the stress experienced by women in early motherhood. Within the first week of adhering to the custom, the patient had prolonged sleep, wakingup only to eat. From the second week, a notable improvement was observed, with complaints of sadness and anxiety gradually subsiding. The patient resumed nursing her baby in the fourth week. On her 6-week postnatal checkup (42nd day postpartum), she scored 8/30 on the EPDS. Her signs and symptoms of depression gradually subsided, and after 4 weeks of practicing the ritual, she was symptom free and her social and family reintegration was complete.

N2  - Prokineticins are involved in many physiological processes including circadian rhythms, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer. Recently, they have been found to play a role in regulating food intake. Historically, proteins that increase feeding behavior in mammals decrease reproductive behavior to prevent pregnancy and lactation when food is scarce. In the current study, prokineticin-2 (PK2) had pronounced effects on reproductive and ingestive behaviors when given to female Syrian hamsters. Administration of PK2 prevented ingestive behaviors induced by food restriction, such as the amount of time spent with food and eating. Hamsters given PK2 preferred to engage in reproductive behaviors, including spending time with a male and lordosis. Furthermore, analysis of blood plasma revealed that changes to behavior persisted despite similar levels of des-acyl ghrelin (DAG) and reduced glucose concentrations in the blood. Additionally, administering 10 mg/kg of acyl ghrelin (AG) to a different cohort of animals significantly decreased the amount of time females spent with a potential mating partner, increased the amount of time females spent with food, decreased the duration of lordosis, and increased the duration of eating. Results from the current study support the need for further research investigating the reproductive and ingestive roles of PK2 and ghrelin.

N2  - To investigate effects of Ca level varying with feeding time daily in sows during late pregnancy on placental lipid metabolism and transport in pigs, sixty pregnant sows were assigned to 3 groups: the CON group was fed low-Ca diet with 11.25 g CaCO3 at 0600 h and 1500 h, H-L group was fed low-Ca diet with 22.5 g CaCO3 at 0600 h and low-Ca diet at 1500 h, and L-H group was fed low-Ca diet at 0600 h and low-Ca diet with 22.5 g CaCO3 at 1500 h, respectively. Serum from sows and umbilical cord and placenta were collected during delivery. Results showed that, compared with the CON group, H-L feeding significantly increased maternal serum total triglyceride (TG) and umbilical serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P < 0.05). The results showed that long chain fatty acid (FA) contents in placenta were significantly increased in H-L and L-H groups (P < 0.05). Experiments on genes involved in glycolipid metabolism showed that H-L or L-H feeding inhibited mRNA expression of GLUT3, GLUT4, FAS, FABP1, FABPpm, FAT/CD36, while activated the mRNA expression of FASD1, FASD2 and SCD in placenta (P < 0.05). In addition, experiments on genes involved in biological clock showed that L-H feeding sequence activated the mRNA expression of per1 and clock, while H-L and L-H feeding sequence inhibited mRNA expression of per2 in placenta (P < 0.05). It is concluded that maternal supplementation with Ca varying with feeding time daily during late pregnancy affects placental lipid metabolism and transport in pigs by regulating the mRNA expression related to lipid metabolism and the circadian clock.

N2  - We hypothesized that poor sleep quality exacerbates glucose intolerance manifested as elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which increases the risk for gestational diabetes. To test this, 38 pregnant and 22 non-pregnant (age, 18–35 years; body-mass index, 20–35 kg/m2) otherwise healthy women were enrolled in the study. Sleep quality was assessed during gestational week 24 (pregnant), or outside of the menstrual period (non-pregnant), using qualitative (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and objective (actigraphic wrist-watch) measures. Blood glucose, total cortisol, and depression status were evaluated. Eight pregnant and one non-pregnant women were lost to follow-up, or withdrew from the study. There was a higher incidence of poor sleep quality in pregnant (73%) relative to non-pregnant women (43%). Although actigraphic data revealed no differences in actual sleep hours between pregnant and non-pregnant women, the number of wake episodes and sleep fragmentation were higher in pregnant women. Poor sleep quality was positively correlated with higher HbA1c in both pregnant (r = 0.46, n = 26, p = 0.0151) and non-pregnant women (r = 0.50, n = 19, p = 0.0217), reflecting higher average blood glucose concentrations. In contrast, poor sleep was negatively correlated with cortisol responses in pregnant women (r = −0.46, n = 25, p = 0.0167). Three pregnant women had elevated one-hour oral glucose tolerance test results (>153 mg/dL glucose). These same pregnant women exhibited poor sleep quality. These results support the suggestion that poor sleep quality is an important risk factor that is associated with glucose intolerance and attendant health complications in pregnancy.

N2  - Background: While the distribution of mosquito bed nets is a widely adopted approach for malaria prevention, studies exploring how the usage of a net may be influenced by its source and other factors remain sparse. Methods: A standardized questionnaire and home-visit observations were used to collect data from 9 villages in Budondo sub-county, Uganda in 2016. Household- and individual-level data were collected, such as bed net ownership (at least one net versus none), acquirement source (free versus purchased), demographics, as well as knowledge of malaria and preventative measures. Net-level data, including alternative uses, and bed net quantity and integrity, were also collected. Mixed effects logistic regression models were performed to identify the key determinants of bed net use. Results: Overall, the proportion of households with at least one bed net was 40%, while bed net availability was only reported among 27% of all household members. Awareness of the benefits of bed net use was statistically significantly associated with ownership of at least one net (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.11-2.68, p = 0.02). Among those who own net(s), the odds of a bed net being correctly used (i.e., to sleep under) after adjusting for potential confounders were significantly lower for nets that were obtained free compared to nets that were purchased by the owners themselves (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.51, p < 0.01), resulting in an alternative use of the net. Other factors such as female gender, children ≤ 5 years old, and pregnancy status were also significantly associated with having a net to sleep under (all p < 0.01). Conclusion: Understanding inter- and intra-household net-use factors will help malaria control programmes more effectively direct their efforts to increase public health impact. Future studies may additionally consider socioeconomic status and track the lifetime of the net.

N2  - Background: Despite the high prevalence of malaria among pregnant women and its associated complications, the level of compliance with insecticide-treated nets (ITN) remains very low. Motivation and self-efficacy have been reported as important determinants of health behaviour, and may be important factors to consider in developing health intervention programmes. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, motivation and self-efficacy of ITN use, and their association with its practice, among pregnant women in a secondary health centre in Maiduguri. Methods: The study utilized a cross-sectional study design, using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire to obtain information from 380 respondents. Respondents were classified as ITN users if they slept under an ITN for at least 3 days in a week, while those who did not at all, or slept under it less frequently were classified as ITN non-users. Chi squared test was performed to test the bivariate association between ITN use and each of the items of the questionnaire. A further multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors of ITN use. Results: The respondents' ages ranged from 15 to 45 years, with median (interquartile range) age of 25 (8) years. Eighty percent of them were aware of ITN, but 50.5% believed ITNs could be dangerous. Only 5.5% and 0.8% respectively felt that sleeping under and ITN was either just bad or very bad for their health. Thirty-five percent of the respondents were ITN users. Not having a previous miscarriage (OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.41-4.03, p = 0.001), knowledge that ITNs were not to be washed after every 1 month (OR = 3.60; 95% CI 1.18-11.06), significant others thinking they should sleep under an ITN (OR = 3.06; 95% CI 1.35-6.96), ability to effectively persuade others to sleep under an ITN (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.94) were significantly associated with ITN use. Conclusions: A large proportion of pregnant women in this study were not sleeping under ITNs. The development of health promotion interventions aimed at boosting their self-efficacies for ITN use, and improving social support from their spouses are, therefore, recommended. Health education on ITN use should also be incorporated into post-abortal management.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing is more common in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy; however, most studies have not adequately accounted for the potential confounding impact of obesity. This study evaluated the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in women with gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia compared with body mass index- and gestation-matched normotensive pregnant women. Women diagnosed with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia underwent polysomnography shortly after diagnosis. Normotensive controls body mass index-matched within ±4 kg m−2 underwent polysomnography within ±4 weeks of gestational age of their matched case. The mean body mass index and gestational age at polysomnography were successfully matched for 40 women with gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and 40 controls. The frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in the cases was 52.5% compared with 37.5% in the control group (P = 0.18), and the respiratory disturbance index overall did not differ (P = 0.20). However, more severe sleep-disordered breathing was more than twice as common in women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia (35% versus 15%, P = 0.039). While more than half of women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy meet the clinical criteria for sleep-disordered breathing, it is also very common in normotensive women of similar body mass index. This underscores the importance of adjusting for obesity when exploring the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension in pregnancy. More severe degrees of sleep-disordered breathing are significantly associated with gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and sleep-disordered breathing may plausibly play a role in the pathophysiology of pregnancy hypertension in these women. This suggests that more severe sleep-disordered breathing is a potential therapeutic target for reducing the prevalence or severity of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) occurs in approximately 8% of pregnancies and is associated with an increase in cesarean delivery, NICU admission, and future metabolic dysfunction. In the non-pregnant population sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent in T2DM. Moreover, a growing body of literature has now demonstrated that SDB in pregnancy is associated with the development of gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, despite the significant overlap between SDB and T2DM, the role of SDB has yet to be studied in pregnant women with T2DM. Methods: Third trimester pregnant women at least 18 years of age with and without T2DM were recruited from prenatal clinics of a large tertiary medical center. Women were asked about the presence of symptoms of SDB, particularly habitual snoring (snoring at least 3 nights/week), prior to pregnancy (chronic snoring) as well as that which developed during pregnancy (pregnancy-onset snoring). Demographic data including diagnoses of T2DM were abstracted from medical records. The frequency of SDB symptoms and the timing of the symptoms in relationship to pregnancy was investigated. Results: A total of 1,651 pregnant women were recruited of which 252 had T2DM. Mean age was 29.9±5.9 years, mean BMI 31.5±7.3 Kg/M2, and mean gestational age 33.7±4.4 weeks. The odds ratio for T2DM in habitual snorers was 2.08 (95%CI 1.37-3.16). Overall,152 women reported chronic snoring and 418 reported pregnancy-onset snoring. T2DM was more common in chronic snorers compared to pregnancy-onset snorers 23% vs. 16.7%). When women were stratified by obesity (BMIC30), the relationship between habitual snoring and T2DM was not present for obese women. However, in women with a BMI\30, the odds for T2DM in chronic snoring remained significant (OR 2.06, 95%CI 1.08-3.90). Conclusions: In pregnancy, chronic snoring is associated with T2DM in non-obese women. Women with T2DM, particularly when not obese, may represent a target for SDB screening.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare different actigraphy scoring settings with polysomnography (PSG) for 1 night of total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL) in healthy pregnant women between 6 and 7 months of gestation.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis using data from a case-control study.
SETTING: A large university-affiliated hospital in the Midwestern United States.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 78 pregnant women were recruited, among which 38 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies were included for this analysis.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants had an overnight PSG assessment at a sleep center while simultaneously wearing an actigraph (Minimitter; Philips Respironics, Andover, MA). Sleep parameters from both devices included TST, SE, WASO, and SOL. Four scoring settings were used to obtain these parameters from actigraphy. Bland-Altman tests were used to evaluate the agreement between sleep variables scored independently from actigraphy and PSG.
RESULTS: The default scoring setting (10-by-40) yielded significantly different results from the PSG (P < .01). The 10 immobile/mobile minutes for sleep onset/end with an activity threshold of 10 (10-by-10) produced estimations of TST, SE, and WASO closest to those produced by PSG. When this setting was used, the mean differences between PSG- and actigraphy-assessed TST, SE, and WASO were -1.9 minutes, -0.4%, and 7.4 minutes. When the 10 and 15 immobile/mobile minutes for sleep onset/end were used, the difference between PSG- and actigraphy-assessed SOL was approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study do not support the use of default actigraph settings in pregnant women. In contrast, the 10-by-10 scoring setting provided the greatest agreement and least bias in comparison with PSG for sleep measurements. The 10-by-10 scoring setting is recommended to be used in studies consisting of pregnant women.

N2  - There is a growing realization that proper sleep during pregnancy is essential for the health of the mother and the offspring. However, there are no reports on the effects of maternal sleep restriction on the sleep-wake profiles of newborns. So, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during the third term of pregnancy on the sleep-wake profiles of neonates born to them. The female pregnant Wistar rats were sleep restricted for 5 h/day on gestational days 15–20 by gentle handling. Sleep-wake profiles of the pups born to them and to the control rats were recorded on postnatal days 1–21. Pups of sleep restricted dams had higher active sleep (AS) and lower quiet sleep (QS) as well as wakefulness. Higher ratio of AS to QS, longer duration of sleep cycles, lesser bout frequency and reduced EEG delta power were also observed in these pups, all of which indicated brain immaturity. All these signs of delayed maturation, usually found in premature babies, were observed in the pups of sleep restricted mothers, who had longer gestation period. This report not only shows the importance of sleep during pregnancy, but it also suggests that neonatal sleep monitoring can be used as a tool for early assessment of retarded brain development.

N2  - Sleeping in the lateral position during pregnancy can potentially reduce the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). However, this hypothesis has not been formally investigated in pregnant women. Unlike previous studies that have relied largely on self-reported measures of sleeping position, we investigated the relationship between SDB and sleeping position during late pregnancy using objective measurements. Thirty pregnant women at the 37th gestational week and 30 non-pregnant women (n-Pr) participated in the present study. The pregnant women were divided into 2 groups: those with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 (with obesity, p-Ob), and those with BMI < 30 kg/m2 (without obesity, p-nOb). Data were collected using a portable screening device to detect SDB indicated by the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), as well as sleeping position. The occurrence of the lateral sleeping position was higher in pregnant women than in n-Pr (P < 0.05). The total RDI significantly differed among the 3 groups [P < 0.01; p-Ob, 10.7 (3.1); p-nOb, 7.0 (3.0); n-Pr, 4.3 (2.9)]. The p-Ob group showed significantly lower RDI in the lateral position than in the supine position (P = 0.04). Moreover, there was a significant difference in RDI between p-Ob and p-nOb for the supine position (P = 0.001), but there was no between-group difference for the lateral position. Sleeping in the lateral position is likely to mitigate existing SDB in pregnant women with obesity in late pregnancy and may be an effective precaution against undiagnosed SDB and associated complications.

N2  - Poor quality sleep during pregnancy is an emerging health concern. By conducting series of experiments, the effects of REM sleep and total sleep restriction during the third term of pregnancy on the behavioural phenotypes and sleep-wakefulness patterns in neonates were studied in the Wistar rat model. REM sleep restriction (22 h per day from gestational day 15-20) produced distinct decrease in the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) patterns during initial postnatal development indicating expression of depression like traits. There was also disruption and delay in the pattern of USVs which is a marker for altered emotional behaviour of pups in the isolation paradigm. The sleep-wake (S-W) patterns of the pups born to the control and sleep restricted dams were assessed through EEG and EMG during postnatal days 1 to 21 at five developmental time-points at their thermo-neutral temperature. The pups born to REM sleep deprived dams showed higher percentage of active sleep (AS) and lower quite sleep (QS) in comparison to control pups. Longer length of the sleep-wake (S-W) cycles and higher ratio of AS/QS compared to control indicated delay in maturation of brain circuitry for S-W. The behavioural phenotypes of the pups born to sleep restricted dams during the third trimester (5h/day from gestational days 15 to 20 by gentle handling method) were akin to hyperactivity and increased risk taking behaviour. This is in contrast to phenotypes in pups born to REM sleep deprived dams. Gestation period was a day longer in sleep restricted group than control, yet pups born to them had higher AS % than the control during postnatal days 1 to 16. They also had higher AS/QS but lower W/AS ratio during initial nine postnatal days with lesser S-W cycles. On postnatal day 21, delta power was higher but power was low in other frequencies (alpha, beta and theta) compared to the control. Increased AS in pre-term babies in human is a marker of prematurity. High delta power on postnatal day 21 reconfirmed disruption in neuro-maturational control which is comparable to the children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These novel findings in rat model highlight the importance of prenatal sleep for the appropriate development of EEG networks, emotional and cognitive development in growing newborns.

N2  - Objectives: Obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for pregnancy complications, yet all women with obesity are generally assumed to be at equal risk. The aim of this systematic review was to identify unique characteristics that place women with obesity at higher risk of common and serious pregnancy complications. Method: A systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase from January 2009 to January 2017 was performed by an experienced information specialist to identify studies enrolling obese pregnant women that explored the effects of their patient demographics on a series of adverse outcomes of interest. Data wer extracted. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD#42017060503). Based upon considerable between-study heterogeneity in terms of outcomes and characteristics assessed, study design, population characteristics and methods of analysis, a narrative summary of findings was prepared with reporting that adhered to PRISMA standards. Results: A total of 29 studies of 2,563,769 women were included. In reviewing findings from the included studies, potentially important effects of maternal characteristics were found for each of preeclampsia (maternal age, ethnicity, type of obesity (android versus gynoid), history of sleep apnea, type 1 diabetes), low birth weight/SGA infants (maternal age, ethnicity, increased DII), gestational diabetes mellitus (ethnicity, type of obesity, history of gastric bypass surgery) and pre-term births (ethnicity, type 1 diabetes, maternal height, type of obesity, extent of maternal weight gain). Conclusions: The individual patient factors identified in this review provide evidence for risk stratification of pregnant women with obesity. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate care plans for obese women deemed to be at low risk and those at higher risk of pregnancy complications.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has been associated with significant pregnancy complications including increased rates of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, caesarean section rates and follow-on effects in the new-born. The incidence of OSA in pregnancy has been shown in population based screening to be 4% in the 1st trimester increasing to 8% in the 2nd trimester. CPAP therapy is the recommended first line treatment of OSA in pregnancy, however there are few studies reporting the tolerance of CPAP during pregnancy. The aim of this retrospective audit was to determine: (1) the number of pregnant patients being referred for diagnostic polysomnogram at our clinical sleep service; (2) the prevalence of OSA in this group and (3) treatments prescribed and tolerability of CPAP in pregnant OSA patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients reviewed from 2007-2018 at the Sleep Health Service, Southern Adelaide Local Health Network was conducted using the keywords-pregnant-and-pregnancy-as search terms. Patients who underwent a diagnostic polysomnogram during pregnancy will be identified by case note review of these records. OSA was defined an apnoea/hypopnea index of >15/hr (Chicago criteria, pre April 4, 2011) or >10/hr (AASM 2007 alternate criteria post April 4, 2011). Treatment recommendations and tolerability of CPAP therapy were determined by case note review of compliance and download data along with documentation in case notes/clinic letters. Progress to date/Results: Ethics approval to conduct the audit was obtained on May 28, 2018. A search of the sleep study database has identified 283 individual documents which will be reviewed. Intended outcome and impact: This study will aim to determine the frequency of referral for diagnostic polysomnography in pregnant patients, subsequent treatment of OSA during pregnancy and treatment tolerability. The outcome of this study will be to increase awareness of the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy and treatment tolerability.

N2  - Aim: To elucidate the changes in the daily variation seen in the autonomic nervous system during pregnancy brought about by maternity yoga and to evaluate how maternal yoga affects stress and sleep. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014. Pregnant women who were attending maternity yoga classes at Palmore Hospital between 20 and 23 weeks’ gestation were enrolled as the yoga group, and a matched control group was also enrolled. Study participants completed questionnaires, including a perceived stress scale and sleep logs, during their second and third trimesters. Heart rate variability and salivary α-amylase levels were evaluated as stress indices at 20–23 weeks’ gestation, 28–31 weeks’ gestation and 36–40 weeks’ gestation. Results: A total of 38 women were in the yoga group, with 53 in the control group. At 28–31 weeks’ gestation, heart rate variability during night and late-night periods was significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control group. At 36–40 weeks’ gestation, variability between the morning, afternoon and late night was significantly higher in the yoga group. Salivary α-amylase levels decreased significantly immediately after practicing yoga during all evaluation periods in the yoga group. Night-time sleep duration was significantly longer in the yoga group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that practicing yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system during the third trimester of pregnancy, consolidating sleep during the night and decreasing α-amylase levels, which indicates reduced stress.

N2  - Introduction: Insomnia Disorder (Insomnia) is diagnosed when sleep complaints persist despite adequate sleep opportunity, and are associated with clinically significant distress or impairment. During late pregnancy, sleep complaints are common and multi-factorial. Not all women with sleep complaints meet the diagnostic criteria for Insomnia. This study examined sleep-related impairment and cognitions, and mental health in women during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods.: 159 first-time mothers (age M ± SD=33.4 ± 3.4), with singleton pregnancy and without severe physical/psychiatric conditions, completed the following assessments at 28-30 weeks' gestation: Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, Sleep Related Impairment, Depression, and Anxiety Short Forms, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, and Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale. These measures were compared amongst women who met criteria for Insomnia (Insomnia Group), and those who did not, further separated into High (ISI>7) and Low (ISI<8) Complaint Groups. Results: 37.1% women scored >7 on the ISI, and 18.9% met DSM-5 criteria for Insomnia (without criterion of 3 months duration). Compared to the Insomnia Group, the High Complaint Group had comparable score on all sleep related measures. The High Complaint Group (and not the Insomnia Group) also reported significantly higher symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to the Low Complaint Group (p-values<.05, d=.93 and.53 respectively). The Low Complaint Group scored the lowest on all sleep measures (p ranges <.001 to.02, d ranges 0.53 to 3.03). Discussion: Sleep complaints, even in absence of Insomnia, are associated with less adaptive sleep-related cognitions and poorer mental health. These findings contradict the notion that during the perinatal transition, sleep complaints are-expected-and do not merit clinical attention unless Insomnia is present. Women with sleep complaints but fall short on Insomnia criteria may be vulnerable for future insomnia and mood disorders. Clinical attention is needed for not only Insomnia, but also complaints of sleep disturbances and related daytime impairment in perinatal women.

N2  - Sleep problems in young children are among the most common concerns reported to paediatricians. Sleep is thought to have important regulatory functions, and sleep difficulties in early childhood are linked to several psychosocial and physiological problems. Moreover, several prenatal factors have been found to influence infants’ sleep. Among them, most of the studies have been focused on maternal prenatal depression and/or anxiety as potential risk factors for sleep problems in childhood, whereas other relevant psychological factors during pregnancy have not received as much attention. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of several psychiatric maternal risk factors during pregnancy (i.e. symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, alcohol use, seasonality, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and/or stressful life events) on the onset of some sleep problems related to sleep quality and sleep practices in 3-month-old infants. We examined 1,221 cases from a population-based birth cohort, with subjective measures during pregnancy in mothers, and at 3 months after birth in the infants. The findings showed that all the maternal risk factors during pregnancy, except for symptoms of alcoholism and sleepiness, were related to sleep difficulties in infants. Interestingly, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptomatology in mothers during pregnancy was the only variable that predicted more than two sleeping difficulties (i.e. long sleep-onset latency, co-sleeping with parents and irregular sleeping routines) at 3 months old. Our results highlight the relevance of maternal risk factors during pregnancy, and not only prenatal depression and/or anxiety, as variables to be considered when examining sleep difficulties in infants.

N2  - Objective: This study was aimed to estimate the prevalence, natural history, and associated factors of Restless legs syndrome in pregnant Thai women. (Table Presented) Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related neurological disorder that causes sleep disturbances and affects the quality of sleep. Pregnancy-related Restless legs syndrome has been proposed, but the natural history has not been cleared. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 214 pregnant Thai women who attended Thammasat university hospital delivery unit was performed. The diagnosis of Restless legs syndrome was made according to the revised criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG). General demographic data and antenatal care were reviewed. Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and restless legs syndrome rating scale were determined. Results: A total of 24 pregnant women (11.2 %) were diagnosed with RLS; 4.2% of those reported the symptoms in the first trimester, 25% in the second trimester, and 70.8% in the third trimester. Multivariate analysis revealed that anemia was associated with RLS (p < 0.01). Anemia was a risk of developing RLS during pregnancy (OR, 5.44; 95 % CI, 2.02-14.65). Subjects with RLS significantly had higher ESS score (p < 0.01). All subjects with RLS had severe symptom severity according to the IRLSS, and the symptoms subsided within a week after delivery. There was no immediate labor and newborn complications associated with RLS. Conclusions: Our study confirmed a high prevalence of RLS and its negative impacts on sleep in pregnant Thai women. Anemia was a risk factor of RLS during pregnancy. Furthermore, RLS is commonly found and more pronounced in the second to third trimesters of pregnancy and disappear within a few days after delivery.

N2  - There is a wealth of evidence to say that sleep impacts maternal health during pregnancy, however, little has been published on fetal health and maternal sleep. This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including sleep disordered breathing, sleep quality, sleep duration and supine sleep position, as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight, growth, preterm birth and stillbirth. An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea, sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the fetus resulting in altered growth, gestational length and even death. These effects are biologically and physically plausible. In conclusion, there is limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes. However, existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future research. This area is ripe for investigation if there is to be reduction in the physical, emotional, and financial burden of poor fetal outcomes related to maternal sleep.

N2  - Background: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep. Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep. Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum. Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures. Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

N2  - Introduction: Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) include Gestational Hypertension (GH) and Preeclampsia (PE), both associated with worse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported to occur more commonly in HDP, although the confounding effect of obesity has been variably accounted for. SDB could amplify the adverse consequences of HDP given similar pathological pathways. We aimed to (a) confirm if the link between SDB and HDP persists after controlling for obesity, and (b) determine if SDB increases the risk of adverse outcome among women with HDP. Methods: Women diagnosed with HDP and normotensive BMI-and gestation-matched controls underwent PSG with time-synchronised fetal heart rate monitoring in the third trimester. Fetal growth was assessed by ultrasound and maternal venous and fetal cord blood were sampled at delivery for markers of HDP severity and fetal growth. Results: Forty women with HDP and 40 matched controls were recruited. The frequency of SDB (RDI = 5) in the cases was 52.5% compared to 37.5% in the controls (p = 0.18), but more severe SDB (RDI = 10) was twice as common in women with HDP (35% vs. 15%, p = 0.04). SDB had no impact on outcomes for GH and PE women, including gestation at diagnosis, severity of hypertension or biomarkers of disease severity. There was no temporal relationship between maternal apnoea and fetal distress on CTG, but severity of SDB was weakly related to overall fetal heart rate decelerations in controls with well-grown fetuses (r = 0.44, p = 0.02). The presence of SDB had no effect on birthweight centile, third trimester fetal growth trajectory or regulators of fetal growth in cord blood. Among the HDP women, infants of those with SDB were larger at birth (p = 0.02). Discussion: Mild SDB occurs in half of women with HDP, but also in over a third of BMI-matched normotensive women, suggesting the link between SDB and HDP is in part due to the confounding effect of obesity. SDB did not affect the course of GH or PE nor adversely affect fetal health. Given the high prevalence of mild SDB and that only more severe SDB was related to HDP, a threshold for clinical significance likely exists. Future research needs to identify the relevant threshold for SDB in pregnancy, and proposed causative pathways to inform clinical trials investigating the role of CPAP to improve pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Pregnancy and lactation are metabolically challenging states, where the mother must supply all the energy requirements for the developing fetus and growing pups respectively. The aim of the current study was to characterize many aspects of energy homeostasis before and during pregnancy in the mouse, and to examine the role of voluntary activity on changes in energy expenditure during pregnancy. In a secondary aim, we evaluate measures of energy homeostasis during pregnancy in mice that successfully reared their litter or in mice that went on to abandon their litter, to determine if an impairment in pregnancy-induced adaptation of energy homeostasis might underlie the abandonment of pups soon after birth. During pregnancy, food intake was increased, characterized by increased meal size and duration but not number of meals per day. The duration of time spent inactive, predicted to indicate sleep behaviour, was increased both early and late in pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Increased x + y beam breaks, as a measure of activity increased during pregnancy and this reflected an increase in ambulatory behaviour in mid pregnancy and an increase in non-ambulatory movement in late pregnancy. Energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry, increased across pregnancy, likely due to the growth and development of fetal tissue. There was also a dramatic reduction in voluntary wheel running as soon as the mice became pregnant. Compared with successful pregnancies and lactations, pregnancies where pups were abandoned soon after birth were associated with reduced body weight gain and an increase in running wheel activity at the end of pregnancy, but no difference in food intake or energy expenditure. Overall, during pregnancy there are multiple adaptations to change energy homeostasis, resulting in partitioning of provisions of energy to the developing fetus and storing energy for future metabolic demands.

N2  - Background: Low parental tolerance for crying has been associated with infant sleep problems, yet the directionality of this link remained unclear. This longitudinal study aimed to assess the synchronous and prospective bidirectional links between parental cry-tolerance, soothing, and infant sleep from pregnancy through six months postpartum. Methods: Sixty-five couples were recruited during pregnancy and assessed for cry-tolerance using a paradigm in which participants were shown a videotape of a crying infant and were asked to stop the video when they feel it is necessary to intervene. Infant sleep was assessed objectively using actigraphy for five nights at three and six months postpartum. Parental soothing techniques were reported by parents at both assessment points, and cry-tolerance was reassessed at six months. Results: Concomitant associations were found between maternal cry-tolerance and infant sleep at six months, indicating that lower maternal cry-tolerance was correlated with poorer actigraphic sleep quality. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling analyses yielded significant prospective associations, showing that lower cry-tolerance at pregnancy predicted better infant sleep at three months, whereas more disrupted sleep at three months predicted lower cry-tolerance at six months. Moreover, fathers showed higher cry-tolerance compared to mothers, and parents became more similar to each other across time in their reactivity to infant crying. Conclusion: Consistent with the transactional model of infant sleep, the findings of this study highlight the role of parental cry-tolerance in infant sleep development, and demonstrate bidirectional links between this construct and infant sleep throughout the first six months of life.

N2  - Number of women experience disturbed sleep during their pregnancy (Facco et al., 2010). They are also suffered from nightmares (Lala-Carrasco et al., 2014). Kron & Brosh (2003) found that more unpleasant dreams during pregnancy were found in the women who did not later develop postpartum depression (PPD) than the women who did develop PPD. They suggested that women who work with their stress during their dreaming are less vulnerable to PPD. However, their judgement of 'unpleasant' dreams seems somewhat subjective and nightmare is also known to be related with depression. Moreover, expectant mothers who were later diagnosed as PPD had already been depressive in the late pregnant period. If these findings in the preceding studies are taken into account, pregnant women, who tend to develop PPD after the delivery, have more bad dreams during the late pregnancy. Methods: Sixty one pregnant women participated in the study and were asked to answer about their personality traits (NEO-FFI; McCrae & Costa, 2004), nightmare and dream frequencies and the contents of the dreams (TDQ; Nielsen et al., 2003), which they dreamt during the third trimester of their first pregnancy. About 12 weeks after their delivery, they were asked to answer about their depression (EPDS; Cox et al., 1987). We also conducted the survey of 60 female university students with the same questionnaires for obtaining control data. We employed self-reporting methods, which would have relatively low risk for researchers' judgement biases compared with interview method, which the previous study employed. Results and discussion: Contents of dreams, occurrence of which differed significantly between the expectant mothers and female students were 'eating delicious food,' 'being a member of the opposite sex,' 'unable to find or embarrassed about...toilette,' 'fire,' and 'a person now dead as alive' and all contents were more frequent in the expectant mothers. Concerning personality traits, only 'openness' was significantly high in the mothers. Depression score was significantly higher in the female students. University students were reported to show considerably higher depression score than community samples (Ibrahim et al., 2013). Depressive symptom was severer in the person who reported relatively frequent dreams and nightmares both in the mothers and the female students. We classified contents of dreams, which TDQ described, according to the criteria of 'masochistic (unpleasant)' dreams, which Kron & Brosh (2003) defined, using cluster analysis with the data of judgements of independent raters. The analysis revealed there categories (physical assaultive masochistic dreams, non-physical assaultive masochistic dreams, failure, hardly masochistic dreams, and non-masochistic dreams). We compared averaged EPDS score between the mothers with and without masochistic dreams. Averaged EPDS score was not different between the two groups.

N2  - Objectives: Recently, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to be associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Accordingly, as this is emergent area of research that has significant clinical relevance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between SDB with GDM. Method: The review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The risk of bias was assessed using the New Castle Otawwa tool for non-randomized studies of intervention. We assessed whether the type of SDB measurement (questionnaire or polysomnography), the type of study (case-control or cohort), and BMI used as a confounder or effect modifier n multivariate analysis explained the variability across studies Results: The meta-analysis involved 954 554 pregnant women among the 14 studies. The group of pregnant women with sleep apnea presented an absolute risk increase of 7 % [4% -10%] in relation to the development of gestational diabetes p (<0.05). In absolute terms it represents that every 100 pregnant women with sleep apnea 7 will develop gestational diabetes. The variability between the measures of association of the studies was due to the presence of high heterogeneity, evaluated through the statistic I2 71%. Conclusions: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a group of disorders characterized by breathing pauses during sleep and is associated with microarousals, oxygen desaturations, and/or hemodynamic changes. Mounting evidence, from observational and experimental intervention studies, indicates that sleep disturbances, such as Obstructive sleep Apnea/ hypopnea syndrome (defined as habitual snoring or sleep study -documented obstructive sleep apnea), are associated with poor glucose control and possibly gestacional diabetes mellitus.

N2  - Introduction: High risk pregnancy represents a clinical enigma with several management strategies suggested as prophylaxis or therapeutic approach. In most cases of women with Unexplained Bad Obstetric History (BOH) or Preterm Birth (PTB), luteal phase insufficiency has often been suggested as the underlying cause that may require long-term administration of progesterone. Natural progesterone offers complimentary anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and uterine quiescence actions that go a long way in continuing pregnancy till term while avoiding complications of preterm delivery or infant mortality. Aim: To understand the clinical efficacy and safety of Natural progesterone as primary or secondary prophylactic strategy for High risk women with risk factors for PTB or BOH. Materials and Methods: Retrospective, case cohort analyses of Natural progesterone prescriptions utilising the Drug utilisation surveillance sheet were carried out at 40 centres across India between July and October’16. Descriptive statistics was utilised to describe the numerical and categorical (nominal and continuous) data. Results: Consecutive prescription records of 185 patients with High risk pregnancy were available for analyses. Baseline demographics included mean age of 28.4 yrs, body weight 60.5 kg with mean abortion rate of 1.5 and 2 for BOH women with first or second trimester loss. Natural progesterone as OMP SR was supplemented for PTB prophylaxisin BOH cases with first or second trimester loss cases, Cervical factor, Still birth, Spotting and Placenta previa. The preferred dosage of OMP SR for women with Cervical factor, First or Second trimester loss was 300 mg for mean duration of 19, 16 and 21 weeks respectively. Similarly in the unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) cases, OMP SR was administered in mean dosage of 271mg for 18±5 weeks to prevent pregnancy loss. In all cases, pregnancy was continued till 34th week with no adverse health outcome. Common adverse events including gastritis (n=4, 2.2%), vomiting (n=4, 2.2%), drowsiness (n=8, 4.3%), dizziness (n=6, 3.2%), spotting (n=2, 1.1%), and treated symptomatically with none requiring further hospitalisation or referral. Conclusion: Clinical supplementation with oral NMP SR suggests therapeutic compliance and safety profile for long-term administration especially in High risk pregnancies involving unexplained BOH or PTB risk.

N2  - For pregnant women who complain of poor-quality sleep, a number of non-pharmacological measures are safe for the mother and the unborn child. There are concerns that exposure to any of the benzodiazepines during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of cleft lip or cleft palate. Hypotonia, poor suckling, drowsiness, swallowing disorders, and withdrawal symptoms have been reported in neonates exposed close to delivery, especially with high doses. In the long term, in utero benzodiazepine exposure can provoke behavioural disorders, especially after long exposure.Valerian should be avoided during the first trimester as the risk of teratogenicity is unknown. With the exception of strong alcoholic extracts, valerian is an option for occasional use during the second and third trimesters, and possibly close to delivery. The long-term impact on the unborn child's neuropsychological development is unknown.In general, repeated use of concentrated medicinal plant extracts is best avoided during pregnancy, due to the great uncertainty over their effects.The following are best avoided due to their unfavourable harm-benefit balance: neuroleptic antihistamines such as alimemazine and promethazine; melatonin; and plants such as Cimicifuga (black cohosh), black horehound and pulsatilla.As of early 2018, given what we know of their harm-benefit balance, even short-term use of sedative drugs must only be considered in exceptional cases. In such cases, the antihistamine doxylamine is the first choice in all three trimesters. Its longterm effects are poorly documented.

N2  - Background: Population cohort studies show that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is 3 to 6 times more likely in preterm born children than those born at term. Being born preterm is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications as is SDB. In this study we aimed to compare the effects of SDB on cardiovascular outcomes in a group of children born preterm with a group of children born at term referred to our sleep laboratory for assessment of SDB. Methods: 100 children (3-12 years) studied between 2011 and 2016 were recruited; 50 were born preterm (< 37 weeks of gestation) and 50 were born at term, matched for age and SDB severity. All children underwent overnight polysomnography. The mean heart rate for each child for wake and sleep, and in stages, N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep across the entire night were calculated. Power spectral analysis of the ECG was used to determine heart rate variability as a measure of autonomic control. Low Frequency (LF) power reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, High Frequency (HF) power reflects parasympathetic activity and the LF/HF ratio is a measure of sympathovagal balance. Results: Ex-preterm children were born between 23-35 weeks of gestational age (29.3 ± 3.6 weeks, mean ± sem). There were no differences in the demographic, sleep and respiratory characteristics between the groups. Heart rate tended to be lower in the ex-preterm children in each sleep state and this reached statistical significance in N3 (p<0.05). HF power was greater in the ex-preterm children in both N2 and N3 (p<0.05 for both) and Total power was greater in N3 (p<0.05). There was no relationship between gestational age at birth and either heart rate or any heart rate variability parameter in the ex-preterm children. Conclusions: Preterm born children matched for age and SDB severity with children born at term showed no differences in sleep and respiratory characteristics, however they did exhibit increased parasympathetic tone during NREM sleep. Changes in HF ECG power are attributed to respiratory-related changes (sinus arrhythmia) and reflects an important component of the vagal system that is used as a marker of vagal efferent activity to the heart. This suggests, that despite similar SDB severity, ex-preterm children exhibited increased work of breathing compared to their term born peers.

N2  - Background: Children born preterm are is 3 to 6 times more likely to sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Being born preterm is associated with an increased risk of developing behavioural and developmental complications. SDB in children born at term is associated with adverse effects on behaviour and neurodevelopment. In this study we aimed to compare the effects of SDB on sleep in a group of children born preterm with a group of children born at term referred to our sleep laboratory for assessment of SDB. Methods: 100 children (3-12 years) studied between 2011 and 2016 were recruited; 50 were born preterm (< 37 weeks of gestation) and 50 were born at term, matched for age and SDB severity. All children underwent overnight polysomnography. Sleep macro-architecture was assessed using standard criteria and micro-architecture using spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) (C4-M1 and F4-M1) with total, Delta (0.5-3.9Hz), Theta (94.0-7.9 Hz), Sigma (8.0-11.9 Hz), Alpha (12.0-13.9 Hz), Beta (14.0-30 Hz) and spectral edge frequency calculated for each sleep stage N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep across the night. Results: Ex-preterm children were born between 23-35 weeks of gestational age (29.3 ± 3.6 weeks, mean ± sem). There were no differences in the demographic, respiratory or sleep macro-architecture characteristics between the groups. Both C4 and F4 Delta Power were higher in the preterm group (p<0.05 for both). Theta Power in N2 was also higher in N2 for F4 (p<0.05) and this just failed to reach statistical significance for C4 (p<0.07). There were no differences between groups in any of the frequency bands for N3 or REM sleep and spectral edge frequency was also not different. Conclusions: Preterm born children matched for age and SDB severity with children born at term showed no differences in sleep macro-architecture characteristics, however they did exhibit increased power in N2. This suggests that there are subtle differences in sleep micro-architecture in children born preterm.

N2  - Background: Night shift workers might be under the effect of an altered circadian rhythm, psychosocial stress and sleep deprivation which may influence their general health and semen quality. To date, association studies analyzing the relationship between night shift work and men0s health suggest an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease in shift workers. On the other hand, the relationship between night shifts and semen quality remains debated. Objective: To evaluate the effect of night shift work on routine sperm parameters and on general health in fertile men. Methods: 469 fertile men prior vasectomy. All participants completed an interview about reproductive history, employment, occupational exposures, chronic diseases, medications, and lifestyle habits. Semen analysis was done according to WHO (2010 Manual). We divided the participants into two groups: 74 night shift workers (NW) and 395 Non NW workers (NNW). Results: No differences in age, body mass index, number of children, number of abortion, alcohol consumption, tobacco consumption and certain occupational exposures were observed between the NW and NNW. Lipid and glucose metabolism: No statistically significant differences between NW and NNW concerning cholesterol HDL, LDL and triglycerides levels were observed. Night shift work is not associated with arterial hypertension neither (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.30-2.62). On the contrary, glycemia was statistically significantly inferior (p = 0.048) in the NW (89.4 ± 8.9 mg/dL) vs. the NNW (92.3 ± 15.2 mg/dL). Semen parameters: No differences concerning semen volume (mL) (3.2 ± 1. vs. 3.3 ± 1.6; p = 0.871), % of progressive sperm motility (43.7 ± 17.7 vs. 47.9 ± 16.4; p = 0.66) and % of normal sperm morphology (11.6 ± 8.6 vs. 12.7 ± 8.9; p = 0.302) were observed between NW and NNW, respectively. On the other hand, the total sperm number was significantly lower in the NW group vs. the NNW (175.6 ± 169.3 vs. 227.4 ± 188; p = 0.02). Similarly, the total motile sperm count was significantly reduced in NW in respect to the NNW (85.4 ± 94 vs. 118.4 ± 107.8; p = 0.008). Finally, the percentage of non-normozoospermic men (those with at least one routine sperm parameter altered) were 48.6% in NW and 30.6% in NNW (OR = 2.14; 95% Cl: 1.30-3.55; p = 0.003). Conclusion: NW does not significantly affect “fertility” status (number of children and time to pregnancy are the same) and general health (no relationship between night shifts and an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidemia was observed). Our is the first study reporting data on fertile men with known sperm count in relationship with NW. The significantly lower total sperm number/total motile sperm number in the NW group and the doubled likelihood of having at least one abnormal sperm parameter in respect to NNWs indicates a plausible biological effect on spermatogenesis. Although the exact mechanism by which the misregulation of circadian rhythms may alter spermatogenesis is not known, it has been proposed that it may affect chromatin remodeling of a number of genes involved in germ cell development.

N2  - Objectives: Recent advances in wearable sensor technology allow for amassing unprecedentedly detailed physiological profiles for large numbers of individuals for long periods of time with minimal invasiveness and cost. The major use of wearables to date has been to study different effects of activity on health. In this study, we evaluate the use of these devices, with reference to clinical measurements, in assessing the association of sleep patterns and quality with the menstrual cycle and its phases. Method: Healthy women, with self-reported regular cycles (23<cycle length<36), aged 18-42) were recruited for a prospective observational study. Participants wore the Ava bracelet daily for up to one year. Based on the biophysical parameters recorded by the bracelet, sleep and its phases were determined (deep-sleep= N2+N3 from AASM). Ovulation day was estimated using a home LH-urine test. Mixed effects models were used to assess the changes of the physiological parameters between menstrual phases (with menses as the reference phase). Results: We recorded 541 cycles from 181 women. Total sleep time did not change across the phases of the menstrual cycle. However, deep sleep lasted significantly longer in the follicular and early luteal phases, and shorter around menstruation. Women also tended to wake up more often during the luteal phase. Stress, age, and coffee or meals before sleep were all negatively associated with total sleep time. While alcohol and long exercising correlated with longer sleep. Intercourse, ethnicity, and BMI showed no correlation with total sleep duration. Finally, deep sleep was negatively associated with meals and alcohol. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated the correlation between sleep patterns and the phases of the menstrual cycle. First, simple behavioral and nutritional changes could allow women to sleep better for longer. Second, we were able to reproduce correlations earlier reported in the literature in clinical settings using wearable technology in ambulatory setting. This opens the door for using wearables in large scale population studies were sleep and its quality are of great interest, such as in pregnancies (less sleep is associated with premature delivery) or (pre)-menopause.

N2  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied in pregnancy and postpartum. Scores on standardized measures of sleep (PSQI) at 6 months postpartum, and symptoms of anxiety and depression (OASIS, the PHQ9, and EPDS) were assessed by structured interviews in 116 women in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who had significantly higher OASIS (anxiety) scores (β = .530, p < .001), PHQ9 (depression) scores (β = .496, p < .001), and EPDS (postpartum depression and anxiety) scores (β = .585, p < .001) also had elevated total PSQI scores after adjustment for covariates, including prenatal depression and anxiety scores. Though inferences about causality are not feasible, these results support emerging research showing sleep quality is a risk factor for negative maternal affect in the postpartum period. Assessment of maternal sleep hygiene is worth consideration as a component of identifying women at risk for postpartum depression and anxiety.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy are growing health concerns because these conditions are associated with adverse outcomes for newborn infants. SDB/OSA during pregnancy exposes the mother and the fetus to intermittent hypoxia. Direct exposure of adults and neonates to IH causes neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and exposure to IH during gestation (GIH) causes long-term deficits in offspring respiratory function. However, the role of neuroinflammation in CNS respiratory control centers of GIH offspring has not been investigated. Thus, the goal of this hybrid review/research article is to comprehensively review the available literature both in humans and experimental rodent models of SDB in order to highlight key gaps in knowledge. To begin to address some of these gaps, we also include data demonstrating the consequences of GIH on respiratory rhythm generation and neuroinflammation in CNS respiratory control regions. Pregnant rats were exposed to daily intermittent hypoxia during gestation (G10-G21). Neuroinflammation in brainstem and cervical spinal cord was evaluated in P0-P3 pups that were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.1 mg/kg, 3 h). In CNS respiratory control centers, we found that GIH attenuated the normal CNS immune response to LPS challenge in a gene-, sex-, and CNS region-specific manner. GIH also altered normal respiratory motor responses to LPS in newborn offspring brainstem-spinal cord preparations. These data underscore the need for further study of the long-term consequences of maternal SDB on the relationship between inflammation and the respiratory control system, in both neonatal and adult offspring.

N2  - Preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module (P = .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P = .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.

N2  - Aim: The knowledge on biological rhythms is rapidly expanding. We aimed to define the longitudinal development of the daily (24-hour) fetal heart rate rhythm in an unrestricted, out-of-hospital setting and to examine the effects of maternal physical activity, season and fetal sex. Methods: We recruited 48 women with low-risk singleton pregnancies. Using a portable monitor for continuous fetal electrocardiography, fetal heart rate recordings were obtained around gestational weeks 24, 28, 32 and 36. Daily rhythms in fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variation were detected by cosinor analysis; developmental trends were calculated by population-mean cosinor and multilevel analysis. Results: For the fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variation, a significant daily rhythm was present in 122/123 (99.2%) and 116/121 (95.9%) of the individual recordings respectively. The rhythms were best described by combining cosine waves with periods of 24 and 8 hours. With increasing gestational age, the magnitude of the fetal heart rate rhythm increased, and the peak of the fetal heart rate variation rhythm shifted from a mean of 14:25 (24 weeks) to 20:52 (36 weeks). With advancing gestation, the rhythm-adjusted mean value of the fetal heart rate decreased linearly in females (P <.001) and nonlinearly in males (quadratic function, P =.001). At 32 and 36 weeks, interindividual rhythm diversity was found in male fetuses during higher maternal physical activity and during the summer season. Conclusion: The dynamic development of the daily fetal heart rate rhythm during the second half of pregnancy is modified by fetal sex, maternal physical activity and season.

N2  - Objectives: During postpartum period, mothers at high-risk for developing mood changes including anxiety and depression. Particularly, during the first few days after delivery, mothers can experience postpartum blues symptoms such fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbance and a changing mood. Postpartum depression is characterised by a changing mood, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, panic. It occurs in approximately 10-20% mothers depending on the criteria used for detection. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of postpartum depression and factors effecting it. Method: This prospective cohort study was conducted in 31 different cities in Turkey between July-September 2017. The sample of the study was comprised of pregnant women applied to obstetrics outpatient clinic. To collect data, participant definition form, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used during pregnancy and postpartum 4-6 weeks. Total 864 pregnant women agreed to participate in the study. Of these women 668 filled the questionnaires completely, but during postpartum 4-6 weeks, 171 of these women could not be interviewed for the second part of the study. Results: Total 497 women included in the data' analysis. The mean of total BDI score was 10.13±6.64 (0-63), the mean of total EPDS score was 4.08±4.189 (0-30) during postpartum 4-6 weeks. Of women 13.5% had higher total score of BDI indicating depressive mood and of women 4.8% had higher score of EPDS indicating postpartum depressive mood and three women had higher score both during pregnancy and postpartum. There is no significant relationship between total score of BDI and EPDS, however there were significant negative relationship between EPDS and the mean age of women and their husband. Conclusions: As conclusion, although depression during pregnancy and postpartum period is relatively low in this group of women, due to the negative effect of depression during and postpartum period, healthcare professions should screen women who at high risk. Since factors effecting depression in this group are only the age of women and their husband, family planning education may be considered as an important intervention to prevent depression in young couples. Moreover, it should be also noted that the nature of depression needs to be explained by not only socio-demographic, but also biological characteristic of women.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring, the symptom of partial airway obstruction during sleep, is a common complaint during pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Mechanisms underlying this association have not been studied. We investigated the relationship between snoring in pregnancy and maternal serum markers of feto-placental wellbeing. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross sectional study designed to investigate perinatal outcomes of sleep-disordered breathing. Women admitted for delivery were systematically selected and answered a questionnaire about snoring using the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index. Participants who had screening markers measured were included and divided into snorers and non -snorers. Markers measured included first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers, reported as multiples of the median (MoM). An additional analysis was performed with snorers categorized as acute or chronic snorers based on duration of snoring in relation to pregnancy. Results: While significant differences were noted in co-morbid maternal medical conditions between snorers and non-snorers, there were no significant differences in the neonatal outcomes assessed between the two groups. No significant differences were noted in any of the first trimester (PAPP-A) or second trimester (AFP, uE3, hCG, inhibin-A) markers between snorers and non-snorers, p > 0.25. In addition, no significant differences in marker levels were noted between acute and chronic snorers. Conclusion: Snoring is not associated with alterations in the markers of fetal or placental wellbeing tested here and suggests that there are alternative mechanisms underlying the association between snoring and adverse perinatal outcomes.

N2  - Ramadan is observed by 1.6 billion Muslims. In an accompanying article that uses data from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Burkina Faso, Schoeps et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(10):2085-2092) find that exposure to Ramadan in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of mortality among children under age 5 years. Ramadan exposes observant individuals to a specific pattern of nutrition and other behaviors, including changes in sleep patterns. How these behaviors might result in child mortality is not yet understood, and the findings reported in this paper should be replicated in other settings.

N2  - Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p < .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

N2  - Objectives: Peripartum has been reported as a period of both enhanced motivation for wellness engagement and also of heightened barriers. Although there is substantial evidence that wellness-based interventions, such as exercise, yoga, mindfulness, parenting, and community involvement, have positive outcomes in the general population, it is unknown how women across a range of demographic risk will engage in these programs if freely offered. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 92) were offered free wellness programs according to the Vermont Family-Based Approach (VFBA) model (n = 52) or perinatal care as usual (n = 40). The free programs were co-located with their prenatal clinic. Women were recruited from 3 risk groups: 1) private insurance (PI); 2) Medicaid insurance (MI); and 3) medicated-assisted treatment (MAT). ANOVAs were used to examine differences in characteristics and program engagement across groups. Linear regressions were used to examine engagement supports and barriers, and t-tests compared intervention group reporting after birth. Results: At baseline, the MAT group reported significantly more stress, more symptoms of mental illness, more familial support, less spousal support, and poorer general health than MI and PI. They were less likely to breastfeed, had more childhood trauma, and had better self-reported sleep quality than PI. The MAT (R = 0–5; M = 1) group was least likely to attend the programs compared with MI (R = 0–18; M = 4) and PI (R = 1–40; M = 12). Across groups, program attendance was best predicted by plan to breastfeed and childhood trauma (R2 = 0.26). Top attended programs for MAT were yoga and coaching (25%); MI and PI groups participated in yoga (35%; 61%), community events (30%; 30%), and parenting (30%; 61%). Women receiving the intervention reported learning more about exercise and mental health than control subjects (p = 0.039; 0.003). Conclusions: Peripartum women with PI appear far more likely to engage in freely offered evidence-based wellness programs than MAT and MI groups. Findings suggest that low breastfeeding intention and high childhood trauma are key barriers to wellness engagement. In our next study iteration, we will be developing methods to incentivize women in MAT and MI groups and who experience more barriers, to attend the programs and we will be examining long-term impact.

N2  - Objectives: This review intends to analyse the use and efficacy of Bryophyllum in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted on Scielo and Pubmed using the tags “Bryophyllum” and “Bryophyllum pinnatum”, searching for studies published from 2008 to 2018. A total of 39 studies were found. We excluded studies that involved Bryophyllum's use in other areas that are not Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and then selected and reviewed a total of 11 studies. Results: Bryophyllum (Bp) was analysed on Overactive Bladder by several studies. Two studies verified that Bp inhibited detrusor contractility in electrically stimulated porcine bladder strips. Bryophyllum was also tested on a group of post menopause women, and it improved their quality of sleep, descreased their fatigue and urinary frequency (9.5 to 7.8 times a day). Literature describes Bp as tocolytic on preterm labor, due to its effect on relaxing myometrial fibers. One study involving 134 pregnant women compared the use of Bp and beta agonists finding similar results (38 vs 37.1 weeks) on prolonging labor. Conclusions: Bryophyllum was initially describe as an alternative on treating hysteria. Recent studies have found great evidence on its use on Overactive Bladder Syndrome an preterm labor tocolysis. More studies are necessary to discover what other uses Bryophyllum may have on Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

N2  - Introduction The Maternal Infant Health Outreach Worker (MIHOW) program is a home visiting program, utilizing peer mentors to improve maternal/child health outcomes in underserved communities. Findings are presented from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women entered the study during pregnancy (< 26 weeks gestation) and were followed through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (MEI = 94; MIHOW = 94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI = 87; MIHOW = 91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effects of MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved families.

N2  - Introduction: Early life interventions have traditionally focused on nutrition or physical activity but have shown relatively limited success in changing these behaviours, particularly over the long-term. Sleep provides an alternative target behaviour that has merit. Our recent Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study suggested that a brief sleep intervention in infancy reduced the risk of obesity at two years of age. In contrast, we observed no benefit from the nutrition and activity intervention. The objective of this study was to determine how these interventions influenced growth at 3.5 and 5 years of age in comparison to those receiving standard Well-Child care (controls). Methods: A follow-up of a parallel 4-arm RCT in 802 women (86% European, 48% primiparous) recruited in pregnancy was undertaken. All groups received standard Well-Child care with additional support for three intervention groups: FAB (promotion of breastfeeding, healthy eating, physical activity: 8 contacts, antenatal-18 months), Sleep (prevention of sleep problems: antenatal, 3 weeks), Combination (both interventions). The primary outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z-score, and secondary outcomes were prevalence of obesity (BMI ≤ 95th percentile), self-regulation (psychological measures), sleep, physical activity (accelerometry, questionnaires), and dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire). Analyses were conducted using multiple imputation. Results: Retention was 77% at 3.5 years and 69% at 5 years. Children in the FAB group had significantly higher BMI z-scores than Controls at 5 (adjusted difference; 95% CI: 0.25; 0.04, 0.47) but not 3.5 (0.15;-0.04, 0.34) years of age. Children who received the Sleep intervention (Sleep and Combination groups) had significantly lower BMI z-scores at 3.5 (-0.24;-0.38,-0.10) and 5 (-0.23;-0.38,-0.07) years of age than children who did not (Control and FAB groups). Conclusions: A conventional intervention had unexpected adverse weight outcomes long-term, while positive outcomes from a less conventional sleep intervention remained promising at 5 years. Further work should examine the mechanisms by which sleep could alter weight trajectories in early life, including the most effective-dose' and duration in more diverse or higher risk population groups.

N2  - Background: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Results: 11,759 citations were identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening. Limitations: Studies not explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors. Conclusions: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

N2  - Decline in cognitive functioning in the workplace is a major concern for health care systems. Understanding factors associated with nighttime functioning is imperative for instituting organizational risk management policies and developing personalized countermeasures. The present study aims to identify individual factors associated with cognitive functioning during the night shift of hospital nurses working on irregular rotating-shift schedules. Ninety-two female nurses were recruited from 17 wards in two general hospitals, using convenience sampling by clusters. Inclusion criteria were working at least 28 h a week (75% of full time) and one night shift per week. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, diagnosed sleep disorders or medical conditions that may affect sleep and/or function. Cognitive performance was measured during the middle (03:00 h) and at the end (07:00 h) of the night shift using the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and the Letter Cancellation Task (LCT) over two night shifts. Subjective sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at the same time points. All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for Shift-Workers (MCTQShift) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep duration 24 h before the night shift and time awake since last sleep opportunity were monitored by actigraphy. Univariate repeated measures ANOVA found main effects for clock time (p<0.001), age (p<0.05), time awake (p<0.05) and sleepiness (p<0.01) for DSST correct responses; main effects for clock time (p<0.001) and sleepiness (p<0.001) for LCT capacity; and main effects for clock time (p<0.001) and age (p<0.01) for LCT omission errors. All factors remained significant in a mixed-model analysis for DSST. Cognitive performance among hospital nurses is low during the middle of the night shift and increases at the end of the shift; decreased functioning is associated with increased subjective sleepiness, older age and prolonged time awake. Identifying factors contributing to performance during the night shift may provide a basis for the development of risk management policies and preventative interventions.

N2  - Background: Intramuscular immunisation with a vaccine composed of three recombinant Helicobacter pylori antigens—vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA), and neutrophil-activating protein (NAP)—prevented infection in animal models and was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in healthy adults. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in prevention of a H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain (BCM 300) in healthy volunteers. Methods: In this randomised phase 1/2, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study, healthy non-pregnant adults aged 18–40 years who were confirmed negative for H pylori infection were randomly assigned (3:4) to three intramuscular doses of either placebo or vaccine at 0, 1, and 2 months. Randomisation was via a computer-generated list with study numbers ensuring the correct ratio within a block size of seven. Participants were consecutively assigned in a double-blind manner to existing study numbers of the study protocol. Investigators and participants were blinded to allocation throughout the study. One month after the third immunisation, participants underwent challenge with a CagA-positive H pylori strain, which, for safety reasons, was initially administered in a subset of participants. The primary efficacy outcome was the efficacy of the vaccine as measured by the proportion of participants infected with H pylori 12 weeks after the challenge. At the end of the study, participants infected with H pylori were treated for 14 days with combination therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics twice daily. Safety and immunogenicity were monitored at pre-established visits. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00736476, and is completed. Findings: 63 patients were randomly assigned, 27 to placebo and 36 to the vaccine. 34 participants (19 in the vaccinated group and 15 in the placebo group) underwent infectious challenge, all but one of whom experienced transient mild-to-moderate epigastric symptoms. 12 weeks after infectious challenge, six (32%) of 19 people in the vaccinated group and six (40%) of 15 people in the placebo group remained positive for H pylori. Eradication was successful in everyone who remained infected at 12 weeks. The geometric mean concentrations of antibodies specific to CagA (202 [95% CI 69–588] vs 4·73 [95% CI 1·41–16]; p=0·001), VacA (1469 [838–2577] vs 73 [39–138]; p=0·001), and NAP (208 [139–313] vs 8·01 [5·05–13]; p=0·001) were significantly higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group 12 weeks after infectious challenge. Interpretation: Compared with placebo, the vaccine did not confer additional protection against H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain, despite increased systemic humoral responses to key H pylori antigens. The finding of spontaneous clearance of H pylori infection in more than half the participants in the placebo group is remarkable and suggests important immune protection in the healthy adult population.

N2  - Introduction: Activity in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) is monitored endoscopically to adjust ongoing pharmacologic treatment in order to achieve defined therapeutic targets such as mucosal healing. However, many patients opt out of endoscopic evaluation. Bowel preparation, pain, anxiety, embarrassment, and logistics are factors affecting adherence. Aims and Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of deep sedation on the attitude towards colonoscopic monitoring in patients with IBD. A prospective, randomized clinical trial of deep nurse administered propofol sedation (NAPS) versus moderate midazolam and fentanyl sedation. Patients provided a satisfaction score prior to discharge. Patient aged > 17 years with a strong suspicion or established diagnosis of IBD and scheduled colonoscopy were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria: ASA class > II, pregnancy, noncompliant with fasting, a history of complicated anaesthesia or inability to complete satisfaction survey. Results: A total of 126 patients were randomized to deep (n=62) or moderate sedation (n=64). The deep sedation group was sedated significantly more to their liking (p=0.001), experienced less pain (5=no pain, 1 worst pain) (4.97 vs 3.42, p=<0.001), and rated the current experience better than prior sedations and higher than the moderate sedation group, (4.30 vs 3.65, p=<0.001). Of note, the deep sedation group were more likely to accept frequent endoscopies (4.33 vs 3.55, p=<0.001), and scored higher on Overall Satisfaction score (4.94 vs 4.04, p=<0.001) than the moderate sedation group. The results were consistent within a week after the procedure. Conclusion: Patients with IBD significantly favor deep sedation over moderate sedation. Pain and previous experience with moderate or deep sedation are important contributing factors. Availability of deep propofol sedation may facilitate patient adherence to endoscopy-based monitoring programmes, including drug adjustment and cancer surveillance.

N2  - Introduction: In Australia there are 6 stillbirths every day, many of which are preventable and occur unexpectedly in an apparently healthy mother and baby. Therefore a substantial opportunity for prevention exists. A systematic approach must be taken to reduce stillbirths and neonatal deaths in Australia, while also ensuring families receive the best possible care and support through the promotion of high quality research and evidence based clinical practice. The midwife is integral to achieving this as they provide education, support and care throughout the continuum of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care. Approach: A workshop style session will be conducted, enabling participants to explore contemporary issues about the role of the midwife in preventing stillbirth (and other perinatal deaths). Experienced facilitators with an expert knowledge around stillbirth will be leading the workshop, a collaboration between Women and Newborn Health Service and the Stillbirth Centre for Research Excellence (Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane). A report detailing the conversations, themes and actions will be disseminated to participants to further progress the call to action. Implications: This workshop will ask midwives to explore their role and responsibilities when providing care to women pre pregnancy, during pregnancy and childbirth, and in the postpartum period, in an effort to prevent stillbirth. Topics to be explored include: fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, decreased fetal movements, maternal sleep position, smoking cessation, intrapartum fetal monitoring and risk factor assessment. Issues that relate to policy, guidelines & practice, and subsequent pregnancy care will be considered. Midwives will be expected to focus on midwifery actions that can be implemented: the aCall to Actiona. They will be asked to reflect on current practices in regard to recognising risk, applying risk minimisation strategies, and communicating this information to women.

N2  - ATA guidelines emphasize shared decision making when selecting between medication, radioactive iodine, and surgery for Graves' Disease treatment. There is limited literature on the effect of TPOAb on success with anti-thyroid medication. TPOAb has been associated with lower relapse rates after remission. This is a retrospective analysis of patients with Graves' disease (defined by clinical presentation, imaging features, or TSI+) who presented to Scottsdale Endocrinology Institute between 1/2011-04/2017 and received pharmacological treatment. Exclusion: <1 year of follow-up, thyroid cancer, pregnancy. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and two-sided Wald test were used in analysis. Of the 107 patients with a new hyperthyroidism diagnosis, 40 patients (age: 46.90-16.53; BMI: 23.68-3.52 kg/m2; 62.5% female; 55% white, 7.5% Hispanic, 15% Asian, 10% African American) met inclusion criteria. 67.5% had TPOAb. The mean number of presenting symptoms was 4.35-2.30 with a mean of 1.93 more symptoms in TPOAb+ patients. Lower TPOAb levels were associated with more symptoms. TPOAb+ patients had more sleep disturbances, anxiety/depression, and dry skin. Although symptoms significantly decreased with treatment, TPOAb positivity was associated with an average of 1.50 more persistent symptoms. Average post-treatment BMI was 1.62 kg/m2 higher for TPOAb+ patients, although non-significant. Mean time to euthyroid was 68.7 days for TPOAb+ patients and 62.5 days for TPOAb-patients (nonsignificant difference). 19.05% of patients seen in clinic for >2 years achieved full remission and an additional 29.41% required only minimal maintenance dose therapy. TPOAb was not associated with remission. Presence of goiter, fatigue, palpitations, Vitamin D deficiency, and progression to hypothyroidism were also not associated with TPOAb. Initial TPOAb level impacted initial symptoms but no other outcomes. Although time to euthyroidism and remission rates were similar, patients with TPOAb positivity, especially low level positivity, exhibited more symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and had persistent symptoms despite normalization of thyroid function. Larger multi-center studies could further inform the use of anti-thyroid therapy for TPOAb+ patients.

N2  - Marked secular trends in the occurrence of many male reproductive disorders have been observed. Thus, the incidence of testicular cancer, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, impaired Leydig cell function and poor semen quality appear to be increasing worldwide. The testicular dysgenesis syndrome (RDS) hypothesis suggest that these male reproductive disorders have a common fetal origin. Thus, fetal environment including the fetal endogenous hormone milieu, is crucial to the fetal gonadal development and subsequent adult reproductive capacity. Recent meta-analyses have suggested a marked decline in semen quality in studies all over the world for which we have no explanation. Many lifestyle factors have been associated with semen quality. Smoking is inversely associated with semen quality, but maternal smoking during pregnancy has an even stronger detrimental effect on semen quality of a young man. Other life style factors like obesity, physical marijuana smoking, alcohol, self-perceived stress and poor sleep quality have all been associated with semen quality. Importantly, the exposure to environmental chemicals with endocrine properties have been suggested to be related to the decreasing sperm counts. Thus, many studies have shown associations between concentrations of persistant and non-persistant chemicals and sperm concentration in fertile and infertile men.

N2  - Objective: To compare the clinical features of RLS patients with asymmetric distribution of discomfort and symmetry distribution, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Background: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder of sensory dyskinesia. The main symptom of the patients is the discomfort of both lower extremities. In recent years, many studies have found that this discomfort in patients with RLS can also be displayed in unilateral or bilateral asymmetric distribution. Methods: A total of 179 patients diagnosed as having restless legs syndrome in the Movement Disorders Clinic, Department of Neurology at Shanghai General Hospital from July 2014 to December 2016 were enrolled in the study. The patients demographic information and RLS clinical features were collected by face-to-face assessment. According to the distribution of patients with discomfort, patients with RLS were divided into bilateral symmetry group, upper limb group and unilateral group, and unilateral group was divided into simple unilateral and bilateral asymmetric group, the scales of International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (IRLSRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and various statistical methods were used to explore the clinical features of RLS. Results: In the 179 RLS patients, 45 patients (36%) had unilateral discomfort and 9 patients (5%) had upper extremity discomfort. There were 79 women (63.2%) in bilateral symmetrical RLS and 36 (80.0%) women in unilateral group (P<0.05). Bilateral symmetry group IRLSRS was 22.78 ± 6.52 points, PSQI score was 10.51±4.97 points, while unilateral group scores were 25.89±4.59 points and 13.00 ± 3.62 points (P<0.05). 18 patients (14.4%) in the bilateral symmetry group and 11 patients (24.4%) in the unilateral group with secondary RLS were associated with pregnancy. Compared with 1 patient (0.8%) in the bilateral symmetry group, unilateral group appeared in 4 cases (8.9%), there was a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). Conclusions: Patients with unilateral or asymmetrical distribution of RLS have a greater proportion of women and higher IRLSSG and PSQI scores than those with bilateral symmetry. The proportion of RLS patients with secondary to pregnancy is higher than those with bilateral symmetrical symptoms. These results suggest that discomfort occurs in RLS patients with unilateral limbs or asymmetrically distributed are worse and may be associated with hormone levels. No differences in clinical features between patients with bilateral upper extremity discomfort and bilateral symmetry were found in this study.

N2  - Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Originally thought to be primarily responsible for disposing of cellular debris and responding to neural insults, emerging research now shows that microglia are highly dynamic cells involved in a variety of neurodevelopmental processes. The hypothalamus is a brain region critical for maintaining homeostatic processes such as energy balance, thirst, food intake, reproduction, and circadian rhythms. Given that microglia colonize the embryonic brain alongside key steps of hypothalamic development, here we tested whether microglia are required for the proper establishment of this brain region. The Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (Csf1r) is expressed by microglia, macrophages and osteoclasts, and is required for their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therefore, to eliminate microglia from the fetal brain, we treated pregnant dams with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. We showed that approximately 99% of microglia were eliminated by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) after pregnant dams were placed on a PLX5622 diet starting at E3.5. Following microglia depletion, we observed elevated numbers of apoptotic cells accumulating throughout the developing hypothalamus. Once the PLX5622 diet was removed, microglia repopulated the postnatal brain within 7 days and did not appear to repopulate from Nestin+ precursors. Embryonic microglia depletion also resulted in a decreased litter size, as well as an increase in the number of pups that died within the first two postnatal days of life. In pups that survived, the elimination of microglia in the fetal brain resulted in a decrease in the number of Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and a concomitant accelerated weight gain starting at postnatal day 5 (P5), suggesting that microglia could be important for the development of cell types key to hypothalamic satiety centers. Moreover, surviving PLX5622 exposed animals displayed craniofacial and dental abnormalities, perhaps due to non-CNS effects of PLX5622 on macrophages and/or osteoclasts. Finally, depletion of microglia during embryogenesis had long-term sex-specific effects on behaviour, including the development of hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour in juvenile and adult female mice, respectively. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for microglia during the development of the embryonic hypothalamus, and perhaps the CNS more broadly.

N2  - Objective: To report a case of ADCY5-related disorder case associated with status dystonicus and DBS efficacy in this patient. Background: Early-onset hyperkinesias may occur in many disorders. ADCY5-related disorders has been recently recognized as a cause. Genetic advances has allowed to expand the phenotype in several known genetic disorders. Methods: Case report. Results: A 28 year-old female was referred to our movement disorder clinic due to involuntary generalized movements, disarthria and gait disorder. She had a history of delayed gait acquisition and onset of frequent and paroxystic generalized dystonic movements at the onset of sleep, lasting 30 seconds, at 6 years of age. Pregnancy and delivering occurred without complications, and there was no family history or consanguinity. Her dystonic movements progressively worsened and also occurred during the daytime with nocturnal predominance. She subsequently developed marked oromandibular dyskinesias and lost her independente gait due to dystonia. Metabolic and genetic tests, including GLUT1-SD, episodic ataxia type 1, and mutation of tyrosine hydroxylase were negative. ADCY5 genetic test with a compound heterozygous mutation (c.1252C> T) was present. In 2011 she developed status dystonicus during a respiratory infection and was admitted to intensive care unit for 10 days with improvement of dystonia. She underwent a bilateral DBS in GPi with significant improvement being able to walk independently again. This benefit is mantained 6 years after the surgery. Conclusions: We report a case of ADCY5 characterized by with childhood-onset generalized dystonia, nocturnal worsening and oromandibular dyskinesias. The status dystonicus is not described in this pathology, and may improve significantly after DBS. ADCY5 makes a differential diagnosis with cerebral palsy, and should be considered in cases of oromandibular hypercines with nocturnal aggravation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Snoring, the symptom of partial airway obstruction during sleep, is a common complaint during pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Mechanisms underlying this association have not been studied. We investigated the relationship between snoring in pregnancy and maternal serum markers of feto-placental wellbeing. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross sectional study designed to investigate perinatal outcomes of sleep-disordered breathing. Women admitted for delivery were systematically selected and answered a questionnaire about snoring using the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index. Participants who had screening markers measured were included and divided into snorers and non -snorers. Markers measured included first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers, reported as multiples of the median (MoM). An additional analysis was performed with snorers categorized as acute or chronic snorers based on duration of snoring in relation to pregnancy. RESULTS: While significant differences were noted in co-morbid maternal medical conditions between snorers and non-snorers, there were no significant differences in the neonatal outcomes assessed between the two groups. No significant differences were noted in any of the first trimester (PAPP-A) or second trimester (AFP, uE3, hCG, inhibin-A) markers between snorers and non-snorers, p > 0.25. In addition, no significant differences in marker levels were noted between acute and chronic snorers. CONCLUSION: Snoring is not associated with alterations in the markers of fetal or placental wellbeing tested here and suggests that there are alternative mechanisms underlying the association between snoring and adverse perinatal outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nocturia, defined as waking at night to urinate causes both sleep fragmentation and disruption. Consequently, it is associated with short-term and lifelong metabolic disturbances including hypertension, heart disease with declines in both physical and mental well-being. There are limited data evaluating the economic burden of nocturia in a large, nationally representative United States (U.S.) based population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic burden related to healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and work productivity outcomes associated with nocturia. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2014 (i.e., years for which nocturia data were available). Adults aged ≥ 18 (excluding pregnant women) were categorically stratified into nocturia group (NG; ≥ 2 voids/night) and control group (CG; < 2 voids/ night), based on the threshold for clinically significant nocturia. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted with a threshold of ≥ 1 void/ night, per International Continence Society (ICS) nocturia definition. Outcomes included 12-month self-reported HRU (hospitalizations, outpatient visits), work productivity (annual family income, weekly hours worked, employment), and current self-evaluated health status. Multivariate regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, insurance, education, alcohol and tobacco use, and self-reported co-morbid conditions were used for statistical cohort comparisons. RESULTS: 22,300 individuals were included (NG: 6,782; CG: 15,518). Median age was 55.2 and 43.2 years, while the proportion of males was 43.3% and 51.3%, for NG and CG respectively. The NG had significantly more HRU including hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.64) and outpatient visits (IRR = 1.18). The NG had a significantly lower family income (difference [2017 USD] = $-8,404.00), worked significantly fewer hours weekly (difference = -6.90), and were significantly less likely to be employed (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65), P < 0.001. They were also significantly less likely to self-report being in very good or excellent health (OR = 0.53; P < 0.001). When using a threshold of ≥ 1 void/night, statistical comparisons remained significant between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that nocturia is associated with a substantial economic burden, specifically in terms of HRU and work productivity. This study underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment for patients with nocturia to alleviate the burden on patients and the healthcare system.

N2  - Objective: To describe a case of NKX2-1 mutation presenting with nocturnal hyperkinetic movements. Background: NKX-2-1 mutation is associated with benign hereditary chorea, respiratory distress in neonates, and hypothyroidism (brainlung-thyroid syndrome) [1]. ACDY5 mutation can also present with childhood-onset chorea, and is characteristically associated with episodic hyperkinetic movements such as dystonia during sleep. Both have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Here we describe a case of NKX2-1 mutation with hyperkinetic/dystonic movements in sleep. Methods:We present the case of a 10 year old boy presenting with chorea since infancy and violent contortions of his legs at night while sleeping or drowsy. His was born at thirty-six week gestation and required CPAP and steroids for premature lungs. His neurodevelopmental history was notable for sitting unsupported at 17 months, walking a few steps at age 2, with independent walking at age 3.5. He commenced reading at age 8. Family history was notable for an autosomal dominant pattern of father, grandfather, and aunt requiring braces. His father had hyperkinetic movements “he outgrew”, but details were limited. On examination he had choreiformmovements of all extremities and face, exacerbated withmovement/running. There was no ataxia, peripheral neuropathy or spasticity. Results: CSF and Brain imaging was non-diagnostic. Genetic testing revealed a 271.47 kb deletion in the NKX2-1 gene, and ADCY-5 testing was negative. Conclusions: In the literature, violent dyskinesias in stages of sleep and drowsiness has been described as characteristic of an ADCY5 mutations, and not in NKX2-1 deletions. [2] Our patient also had motor/language milestone delay and axial hypotonia (during infancy only) which has been reported more frequently in ADCY5 mutations [2]. He did have a history of subclinical hypothyroidism and respiratory distress syndrome in infancy, fitting with other well known medical issues reported in NKX2-1 [1]. When developing a differential diagnosis, it is important to consider that nocturnal dyskinesias may be related to NKX2-1 rather than ADCY5 mutations.

N2  - Given the large number of families that bed-share for some time on a regular basis despite widespread advice not to bed-share, particularly with young infants or if the mother smoked in pregnancy, it is important to understand the potential risks and benefits to the infant. We systematically searched the literature related to adult-infant bed-sharing and infant physiology, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the risks and benefits to the infant, with additional emphases on infant behaviour and breastfeeding outcomes. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was developed. A primary search using text words relating to adult-infant/baby bed-sharing/co-sleeping were combined with outcome terms for physiology, sleep, cardiovascular, respiratory, temperature and behaviour. The following databases were searched up to October 2017: PubMed; SCOPUS; CINAHL; EMBASE; PsychINFO; Web of Science and EBM Reviews including Cochrane. Results: After exclusion of duplicate papers, abstracts of 836 papers and the full text of 115 papers were scrutinized for inclusion criteria. This led to 59 papers being included in the review. Variable definitions of bedsharing made comparisons difficult however, physiological and behavioural differences between bedsharing and cot-sleeping infants were identified. These included increased behavioural arousals, warmer in-bed temperatures and increased breastfeeding duration in bedshare infants as well as differences in infant overnight sleep architecture, cardiorespiratory control and cortisol responses to stress. Conclusion: Many differences are context specific-possibly influenced by cultural values and subjective views of parents. Objective measures identify infants are at risk if unable to mount an appropriate physiological or behavioural response to their micro-environment. This study has highlighted a lack of research differentiating between experiences of infants at low risk and high risk of SUDI, although it is challenging to research the latter. As well, more understanding of the benefits and ways to provide a safe environment may be advantageous for families. These results aid understanding as to why bed sharing presents a greater risk to infants in some situations and will provide evidence to inform public health messages about safe infant sleep enabling more informed discussions with parents.

N2  - Importance: Maternal depression and anxiety can have deleterious and lifelong consequences on child development. However, many aspects of the association of early brain development with maternal symptoms remain unclear. Understanding the timing of potential neurobiological alterations holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of future therapies and interventions. Objective: To examine the association between exposure to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms and offspring white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads used a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms measured in mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy and measures of white matter microstructure characterized in the mothers' 1-month offspring using diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging performed from October 1, 2014, to November 30, 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research facility during natural, nonsedated sleep. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the association between maternal depression and anxiety and 1-month infant white matter microstructure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging findings. Results: In the 101 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] age of mothers, 33.22 [3.99] years; mean age of infants at magnetic resonance imaging, 33.07 days [range, 18-50 days]; 92 white mothers [91.1%]; 53 male infants [52.5%]), lower 1-month white matter microstructure (decreased neurite density and increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) was associated in right frontal white matter microstructure with higher prenatal maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant sex × symptom interactions with measures of white matter microstructure were also observed, suggesting that white matter development may be differentially sensitive to maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in males and females during the prenatal period. Conclusions and Relevance: These data highlight the importance of the prenatal period to early brain development and suggest that the underlying white matter microstructure is associated with the continuum of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms..

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nutrition in the first 1000 days between pregnancy and 24 months of life is critical for child health, and exclusive breastfeeding is promoted as the infant's best source of nutrition in the first 6 months. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant occurring naturally in some foods and used to treat primary apnoea in premature babies. However high caffeine intake can be harmful, and caffeine is transmitted into breastmilk. AIM: To systematically review the evidence on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption during breastfeeding on the breastfed child. : METHOD: A systematic search was conducted to October 2017 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. The British Library catalogue, which covers doctoral theses, was searched and PRISMA guidelines followed. Two reviewers screened for experimental, cohort, or case-control studies and performed independent quality assessment using the Newcastle- Ottawa scale. The main reviewer performed data extraction, checked by the second reviewer. RESULTS: Two cohort, two crossover studies, and one N-of-1 trial were included for narrative synthesis. One crossover and two cohort studies of small sample sizes directly investigated maternal caffeine consumption. No significant effects on 24-hour heart rate, 24-hour sleep time, or frequent night waking of the breastfed child were found. One study found a decreased rate of full breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum. Two studies indirectly investigated caffeine exposure. Maternal chocolate and coffee consumption was associated with increased infant colic, and severe to moderate exacerbation of infant atopic dermatitis. However, whether caffeine was the causal ingredient is questionable. The insufficient and inconsistent evidence available had quality issues impeding conclusions on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child. CONCLUSION: Evidence for recommendations on caffeine intake for breastfeeding women is scant, of limited quality and inconclusive. Birth cohort studies investigating the potential positive and negative effects of various levels of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child and breastfeeding mother could improve the knowledge base and allow evidence-based advice for breastfeeding mothers. Systematic review registration number: CRD42017078790.

N2  - Background: Physical inactivity and inadequate amounts of sleep are two potential causes for excessive weight gain in infancy. Thus, parents and caregivers of infants need to be educated about decreasing infant sedentary behavior, increasing infant unrestrained floor time, as well as age specific recommended amounts of sleep for infants. The aims of this study were to determine if maternal knowledge about infant activity and sleep changed over time and to evaluate maternal compliance rates with expert recommendations for infant sleep in a two-arm, randomized, controlled, comparative impact trial. Methods: Pregnant women at least 18years of age, less than 19weeks pregnant, and residing in a lower Mississippi Delta county were recruited between March 2013 and December 2014. Postnatal data was collected from 54 participants between September 2013 and May 2016. McNemar's test of symmetry was used to determine if maternal knowledge changed over time, while generalized linear mixed models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess compliance with expert recommendations for infant sleep. Results: The postnatal retention rate was 85%. Maternal knowledge significantly increased for correct infant sleep position (back) and beginning tummy time by one month of age. Odds of meeting sleep duration recommendations increased by 30% for every one month increase in infant age. Only 20% of the participants were compliant with the back to sleep recommendation for the first 12months of their infant's life; median time to noncompliance was 7.8months. Conclusions: Although baseline knowledge concerning infant activity and sleep was high in this cohort of rural, Southern, African American mothers, compliance with recommendations was not optimal.

N2  - BACKGROUND Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are linked to excessive maternal weight and frequent snoring. However, pathways between maternal excessive weight, pregnancy-onset snoring, and HDP are only partially estimated. We examined and quantified the total and direct associations between excessive maternal weight and incident HDP and their indirect pathway through pregnancy-onset snoring. METHODS Third trimester pregnant women enrolled from prenatal clinics of a large tertiary medical center. Sleep data were collected through a questionnaire. Demographic and pregnancy information and first trimester maternal weight were abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of women with prepregnancy hypertension and/or chronic snoring, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the total and direct association between maternal weight and incident HDP and their indirect association through pregnancy-onset snoring. The proportion of the mediated association through pregnancy-onset snoring from the total association of maternal weight and HDP was also quantified. RESULTS After excluding those with chronic hypertension and/or snoring, the final sample included 1,333 pregnant women. In adjusted analysis, excessive maternal weight was directly associated with incident HDP; odds ratio (OR) = 1.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30, 2.70). Pregnancy-onset snoring significantly mediated the association between maternal weight and incident HDP; OR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.01, 1.17). The mediated pathway accounted for 15% of the total association between maternal weight and incident HDP. CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy-onset snoring mediates the association between maternal weight and incident HDP in women without prepregnancy snoring or hypertension. These findings demonstrate the relative contributions of excessive maternal weight and pregnancy-onset snoring to incident HDP.

N2  - Introduction: The disorder insomnia represents a relevant and frequent condition in clinical care. Cognitive behavioral therapy of insomnia (CBT-I) is regarded as first line treatment. Pharmacotherapy can be considered if CBT-I is not available or effective. Therefore, pharmacological approaches for disturbed sleep are still among the most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments in clinical care. Areas covered: In this review, the authors highlight basic physiological pathways of sleep regulation to understand fundamental pharmacological principles of sleep medicine. Available guidelines and reviews are summarized and recommendations formulated regarding the use of benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines, and orexin receptor antagonists in insomnia disorder. Variations in the treatment of insomnia disorder in subpopulations with increased prevalence of sleep disorders–childhood, pregnancy and old age–are specified. Expert opinion: The well-established off-label use of hypnotic drugs should evocate a debate about a better alignment of clinical practice and scientific evidence and guidelines. Better understanding of sleep regulation could help in the development of completely new substance classes. Focusing subjective sleep disturbances, such as superficial sleep perception might help identify novel pathways.

N2  - Women often experience sleep disturbances and worsening sleep quality throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Circadian rhythms are closely linked to sleep problems and mood disorders. This systematic review provides a summary of studies of circadian rhythms and associated sleep problems and maternal distress, among postpartum women. Articles were idenitfied through a systematic literature search. Circadian rhythm disturbances were strongly correlated with depression, social factors and mothers’s exposure to light postpartum. Future research should include larger, prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials for measuring effect of circadian rhythm interventions on postpartum mental health outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep beginning in early pregnancy. Among nonpregnant populations, exercise has been associated with improved sleep; however, research in pregnant samples has been equivocal. We examined whether varying degrees of exercise were associated with better nocturnal sleep among pregnant women during early gestation. PARTICIPANTS: 172 pregnant women. METHODS: Self-reported sleep and exercise and objective sleep were collected during early gestation: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks), and T3 (18-20 weeks) from 172 pregnant women. Exercise was categorized into three time-varying groups: 0 metabolic equivalent minutes per week (MET-min/week), 1 to < 500 MET-min/week, or ≥ 500 MET-min/week. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to test hypotheses. RESULTS: A significant main effect for Time (F[2,254] = 9.77, p < 0.0001) and Time*Exercise group interaction were observed for actigraphic sleep efficiency (aSE) (F[4,569] = 2.73, p = 0.0285). At T2, women who reported ≥ 500 MET-min/week had higher aSE than those who reported 0 MET-min/week. Significant main effects for Exercise Group and Time were observed for actigraphic wake after sleep onset (aWASO; F[2,694] = 3.04, p = 0.0483 and F[2,260] = 3.21, p = 0.0419). aWASO was lowest for those reporting 1 to < 500 MET-min/week (t[701] = 2.35, adjusted p = .0489) and aWASO decreased from T1 to T3 (t[258] = 2.53, adjusted p value = 0.036). Lastly, there was a main effect for Time for the PSQI (F[2,689] = 52.11, p < 0.0001), indicating that sleep quality improved over time. CONCLUSIONS: Some level of exercise among pregnant women appears to be more advantageous than no exercise at all. Moderate exercise, while still unclearly defined, may be a worthwhile adjunct treatment to combat sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives/Instruction: Delusional ideation (DI) is relatively prevalent in non-clinical populations, including pregnant women. DI may be a precursor of psychiatric conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia and postpartum psychosis. Disordered sleep during pregnancy and in the postpartum is well-documented, and includes insomnia, fragmented sleep, daytime fatigue, sleep apnea and periodic limb movement. Poor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with a number of adverse outcomes including mood disorders and postpartum psychosis. Thus, both disordered sleep and DI may be related to postpartum psychosis and to development of psychopathology. The present study investigated the relationship between sleep quality and DI during pregnancy and in the postpartum. Methods: A community sample of 300 women pregnant expecting a singleton birth (mean age = 31.92 ± 4.55 y.o.) participated in a longitudinal study of perinatal mental health in Montreal, Canada. Participants were assessed during the third trimester of pregnancy (32- 34 weeks gestation, PN, N = 300) and at 2 months postpartum (PP, N = 287). Sleep quality was measured by the Sleep Symptom Checklist (SSC) self-report questionnaire, and DI was measured by a total score on the Peters Delusional Ideation scale (PDI). Four sleep scores were calculated: SSC total score and three subscales: insomnia, daytime symptoms, and sleep disorders. Results: Stepwise regressions were performed with SSC subscales as predictors and PDI scores at PN and at PP as outcome. PDI at PN was positively associated with daytime symptoms (F(1, 246) = 21.779, p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.081); and at PP, PDI score was positively associated with the severity of scores on insomnia and sleep disorder subscales (F(2, 269) = 17.921, p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.111). Total SSC score at PN predicted PDI symptoms at PP (F(3, 259) = 9.234, p < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.086) Conclusions: Severity of delusional ideation was associated with sleep disturbances in women both during pregnancy and in the postpartum. Different aspects of disordered sleep predicted DI during pregnancy and at postpartum. These differences may reflect specific qualities of sleep disorders and of sleep-associated distress at each time point. These results suggest that sleep quality may exacerbate delusional ideation during pregnancy and in the postpartum, which, in turn may contribute to increased risk of psychopathology.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy can present as snoring and/or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and the prevalence is increasing due to the increase in maternal obesity. Pregnant women often present with fatigue and daytime sleepiness rather than the classic symptoms. Habitual snoring, older age, chronic hypertension, and high prepregnancy body mass index are reliable indicators of increased risk for SDB and should trigger further testing. The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA is an overnight laboratory polysomnography. Although there are no studies linking SDB to poor fetal outcomes, fetal well-being remains paramount throughout the course of pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives/Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder that increases in prevalence during pregnancy. It is estimated to affect approximately 25% of all pregnancies with a peak in the third trimester. However, less attention has been focused on the RLS diagnostic testing or therapy in Georgia; accordingly, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy remains unexplored. The current study was aimed to identify RLS and insomnia symptoms in the Georgian pregnant women. Methods: A total of 43 pregnant women (age range: 21-38, pregnancy: second and third trimester) selected from two Tbilisi ambulatory care centers participated in the study and answered four questions to detect RLS as proposed by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). Subjects who answered positively the four questions were asked to complete two questionnaires: Sleep Impairment Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: A total of 9 subjects (20.9%) met the four criteria for RLS (33.3% with symptoms once/month, 22.2% with symptoms ≥3 times/month, 33.3% with symptoms ≥3 times/week, and 11.1% with symptoms once/year). Of these, 4 subjects (44.4%) were in the second trimester (age: 24-37) and 5 subjects (55.6%) were in the third trimester (age: 24-34). Family history was positive in 5 participants (55.6%). 4 subjects (44.4%) reported the onset of symptoms of RLS at the given pregnancy. 5 women (55.6%) had experienced symptoms of RLS more early than the onset of pregnancy; however, no one has been applied to doctor before to tell this problem. Of the 9 pregnant subjects having RLS, main insomnia symptoms were detected in 6 subjects (66.7%); of these, four women had sleep onset insomnia and two subjects had excessive daytime sleepiness. Conclusions: Although the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy is still under investigation in the general population, the findings point out the relationship of RLS to sleep deterioration and history of pregnancy. The results show: (a) pregnancy affects the development of RLS and (b) sleep difficulties are common in pregnant women who experience the symptoms of RLS. It is needed to implement Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS in Georgian Healthcare Settings.

N2  - Objectives/Introduction: The 10% birth rate of preterm infant in Japan is increasing. This study examined preterm infants' sleep development under nocturnal co-sleeping conditions. We examine quiet sleep, active sleep, and wakefulness during their first 1 year. Methods: Subjects were 4 first-born preterm-infant without complications with a gestation period greater than or equal to 32 weeks, and had been admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The caregivers gave verbal and signed informed consent before participating in the study. Videosomnographic recordings were made on 2 consecutive nights, and Actigraphic recordings were made using Actiwatch® (Respironics, Inc.) for 5 consecutive days, at home under co-sleep conditions, at 4-weeks, 7-weeks, 12-weeks, and 25 weeks. The sleep parameters were analyzed by video data, and the circadian rhythm of restactivity for the mothers and the infants was examined by autocorrelograms for 5 continuous days during each week. (Nishihara, et al., 2002). Results: Quiet sleep increased 7% at 4 weeks and 20-30% in 25 weeks. Active sleep decreased 0-3% in 25 weeks. By 25 weeks the longest sleep period was 400-500 min. Nocturnal waking decreased during the same period. Typical self-soothing behavior was observed. Actiwatch data of each infant during the four observation periods was calculated. The autocorrelation function indicated a 24-hr amplitude peak at 12 and 25 weeks (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We observed the transitioning of preterm infants nocturnal sleep over 25 weeks. Quiet sleep was increasing and active sleep was decreasing, and self-soothing occurred early similarly to term infants. Development of circadian rhythm was delayed compared to term birth infants, however, if calculated from the time of fertilization the timing was similar.

N2  - Objectives/Instruction: Future and new mothers experience sleep changes during pregnancy and after childbirth. These are important to manage as they can affect women's physical, mental and emotional well-being, including the development of depressive symptoms and postpartum depression. We aimed at gaining more insight in sleep parameters, fatigue and depressive symptoms during late pregnancy and in postpartum. Additionally, differences in breast- and bottle feeding mothers are investigated. Methods: At 35-37 weeks gestation 2 and 8 weeks postpartum, women filled out a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Women without exclusive breast- or bottle feeding at the time of measurement were excluded from analyses. Results: One hundred fifteen woman were included at the first 61 at the second and 35 at the third time point. During late pregnancy, the whole sample showed a mean global PSQI score of 7.4 (SD 3.20, range 1-15), with 79.8% scoring above the cut-off value for poor sleep (PSQI 5). The sample showed a mean ISI score of 8.82 (SD 4.21, range 0-21), with 56.5% showing subclinical (ISI 8-14) and 8.7% moderately/severe (ISI 15-22) insomnia. Mean FSS and CES-D scores fell within the normal range. Mean PSQI and FSS further increased at 2 weeks postpartum, mean ISI remained unchanged and mean CES-D decreased in the whole sample. At 8 weeks postpartum, all mean global scores decreased as compared to the first time point, with only mean PSQI (5.46, SD 2.68, range 1-12) exceeding the cut-off value. Sixty percent of the women still experienced poor sleep. At 2 and 8 weeks postpartum, there were no significant differences (p = 0.05) in any global score between breast- and bottle feeding mothers. Conclusions: Mean global PSQI, ISI and FSS of the whole sample were highest at 2 weeks postpartum and lowest at 8 weeks postpartum as compared to late pregnancy. Mean CES-D scores decreased over time from pregnancy till 8 weeks postpartum. No significant differences were observed between breast-feeding and bottle feeding mothers.

N2  - Using scoping review methodology, this article investigates the literature on sleep duration, continuity/efficiency, timing, daytime sleepiness/alertness, and perceived sleep quality in each trimester of a healthy pregnancy. Data suggest significant variability in sleep between women, with less evidence to support major changes in sleep health across trimesters. There is a need for further research on this topic to better inform women and their health providers.

N2  - Objective: Sleeping problems are reported to be common in early childhood, but only a few longitudinal studies describe the development of sleep quality in early childhood. In this study, we studied the prevalence of infant sleeping problems as reported by the parents. Methods: Altogether 1667 families from Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Finland, participated in the CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort study. The data collection started during pregnancy approximately at 32nd week and infant sleep quality was measured at the ages of three, eight, 18 and 24 months. We studied sleep quality and quantity as well as development of circadian rhythm. In addition, we aimed to recognize some environmental factors related to persistence of sleeping difficulties in early childhood (e.g. gender, family structure). Results: Average sleep duration was 14.1 hr (Standard deviation, SD 2.1) at the age of 3 months, 13.3 hr (SD 1.0) at 8 months, 12.3 hr (SD 0.9) at 18 months and 11.9 hr (SD 0.9) at 24 months. Proportion of daytime sleep decreased from 34.6% (SD 4.3) at the age of 3 months to 25.7% (SD 5.0) at 8 months, 16.9% (SD 3.0) at 18 months and 15.7% (SD 3.2) at 24 months. At these four measurement points, prolonged sleep onset latency (≥30 min) was reported in 24.9%, 9.7%, 9.9% and 18.3% of the infants while frequent night wakings (≥3) decreased clearly during the follow up (the prevalence being 18.4%, 14.1%, 10.0% and 5.3% at 3, 8, 18 and 24 months, respectively). Approximately 20% of infants had persistent difficulties in self-soothing. Overall, mild, moderate or severe sleeping problems were reported by 22.5%, 39.8%, 24.8% and 21.9% of the parents. We also evaluated gender differences and factors related to persistence of sleeping difficulties. Conclusion: Infant sleep quality is highly variable in early childhood and many sleeping difficulties are highly prevalent and persistent in early childhood. Many of them may warrant treatment in clinical settings.

N2  - Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common arrhythmia in pregnancy. The main mechanism is via atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT). In women with history of SVT it occurs with increased frequency during pregnancy. We present the management of pregnancy and delivery of parturient with history of SVT. Description A 35-year-old primigravida with a body mass index of 35 was booked for a caesarean section after failed induction of labour. Past medical history included sleep apnoea, mild asthma and SVT. SVT was clinically diagnosed at 32 years of age due to AVNRT and was started on bisoprolol 5 mg. She remained symptomfree but wished to come off beta blockers to start a family. Cardiologist suggested ablation therapy before pregnancy in case she suffers from symptomatic SVT while off beta blockers. She had an unplanned pregnancy. Bisoprolol was weaned off by the cardiologist, with a plan to first use non-pharmacologic vagal manoeuvres in the event of SVT followed, if necessary, by adenosine treatment to cardiovert. She suffered two episodes of SVT during weeks 25 and 32 of pregnancy, and required adenosine treatment. The cardiology plan was to add propranolol, which is safe in pregnancy. By this time she developed pre-eclamptic toxaemia of pregnancy and was started on labetalol and nifedipine instead. The anaesthetic plan for her caesarean section was combined spinal epidural anaesthesia. Bupivacaine 0.5% heavy 2.2 ml with fentanyl 25 lg was given intrathecally. This gave adequate block; hence, an epidural top-up was not necessary. Although phenylephrine was started immediately after spinal, it was stopped within 7 min as her blood pressure remained high. Syntocinon 5 U was given slowly intravenously over 10 min. She remained stable throughout surgery and the postoperative period. Discussion Treatment of SVT during pregnancy may also affect the fetus. Hence, pharmacological management is best reserved for cases where there is haemodynamic instability. Adenosine is the first-line drug during pregnancy. As the concentration of adenosine deaminase decreases as a result of the expansion of maternal circulatory volume, successful cardioversion can be achieved by doses of 6- 12 mg [1, 2]. If that fails, propranolol, metoprolol and acebutolol can be used in acute setting. Calcium channel blockers can be considered if beta blockers do not convert arrhythmia. If medical interventions fails and haemodynamic instability persists, cardioversion can be considered in all trimesters [1].

N2  - Objectives/Introduction: Newborns are reported to recognize their mother's voice after birth, suggesting that a fetus has in principal the ability to learn. The aim of our study was to examine overt signs of recognition in newborns to a more complex stimulus, namely a prenatally repeatedly presented nursery rhyme. Given that sleep is prominent in third term fetuses and newborns, we were additionally interested if and how prenatal stimulation influences the distribution of sleep/wake states in newborns during periods of renewed stimulation and non-stimulation (silence) after birth. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 30) either replayed a taped nursery rhyme from week 34 of gestation until birth, twice a day, to the unborn (experimental group; EG) or did not (control group; CG). Two and five weeks after birth, infants' electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected while playing the same (familiar) rhyme and a newly presented (unfamiliar) rhyme back over speakers, each with the maternal (familiar) and a strange female (unfamiliar) voice. Randomized stimulation periods were alternating with non-stimulation (silence) periods. Every stimulation and non-stimulation block lasted 180 seconds, resulting in a total recording time of 27 min per recording. Results: After calculating differences in mean heart rates (HR) between stimulation and preceding non-stimulation blocks, repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant main effects for rhymes or voices at both recordings. In a next step mean HR and heart rate variability (HRV) for summed up (i) stimulation and (ii) non-stimulation periods was calculated. Independent Samples T-Test has shown, that infants unfamiliar with prenatal stimulation (CG) had higher mean HR (p = 0.004) and lower parasympathetic activity (mean highfrequency power of HRV; p = 0.001) during stimulus presentation times at week 2. Furthermore, despite active (“REM”) sleep was prominent at both recordings, infants unfamiliar with prenatal stimulation (CG) have shown higher amount of wake states during stimulation periods (42% vs. 20%) at week 2. Conclusions: Our findings suggest no signs of perinatal memory for more complex prenatal stimulation material like nursery rhymes. Nevertheless, newborns familiar with prenatal stimulation appear less stressed and less disturbed in their sleep behavior during re-stimulation after birth, indicating prenatal habituation to auditory stimulation.

Although fathers in many countries accomplish their role differently than they used to, it is known that men also suffer from sleep difficulties around the time of birth although not as frequently as women. The goal of this study is to evaluate male sleep difficulties and experiences of stress around the time of birth. Methods: 69 fathers-to be were included in the study. In a longitudinal study (T1 in the last trimester of pregnancy and T2 3 month's postpartum) sleep difficulties based on PSQI and sleep diaries were assessed. Beyond that the perceived stress scale (PSS) was calculated. In addition to that other factors as age, parity, parental leave, participation in prenatal classes, their baby's frequency of night waking, and cognitions of their baby's sleeping habits were inquired. Results: A paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare fathers in parental leave (A) (n = 36) with fathers without parental leave (B) for all relevant variables. A significant difference for PSQI(A) and (B); t(67) = -1.98, p = 0.05, in frequency of night waking(A), (B); t(67) = -3.64, p = 0.001 and in how recovered fathers feel after sleeping (A), (B); t(67) = -2.69, p = 0.009. Furthermore 26 fathers rate the sleeping habits of the baby as a problem. Beyond, significant higher stress scores according to the PSS was measured for first time fathers; t(67) = 3.93, p = 0.000. Conclusions: With constantly changing division of tasks between partners and new expectations concerning fathers, men should be prepared during pregnancy for the changes which occur postpartum, particularly relating to sleep habits and coping with stress. Since the study hints at potential insomnia among fathers on parental leave, a case that is often only discussed in regard to mothers on parental leave, men planning to go on parental leave should take this step cautiously. Routine check-ups for sleep difficulties during pregnancy and the time after could avoid health issues and provide a functioning transition into parenthood.

N2  - Objectives/Introduction: There are cross-sectional populationbased studies and meta-analysis indicating that sleep difficulties are associated with cognitive and behavioral problems. It is not well studied, however, how the early sleep in infancy is related to later development. The aim of this study was to identify whether parent reported short sleep duration, night awakenings and sleeping difficulties during the first years are associated with ADHD-related symptoms at age 5. Methods: The study is based on a longitudinal CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort comprising altogether >1,600 families from the Pirkanmaa area, Finland, with several measurement points. For this study, we used the information regarding maternal questionnaires during pregnancy and two sleep questionnaires, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and the Infant Sleep Questionnaire (ISQ) filled out by the parents when the child aged 3, 8, 24 months and 5 years. ADHD-related symptoms at age 5 were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Five-to-Fifteen (Viivi) questionnaires. The final sample included 605 children with measurements at all time points. Results: In order to examine the effects of sleep problems on ADHD-related symptoms, logistic regression analysis was conducted. Infant's age, gender, mother's educational level and number of children were included as covariates. Our main results showed that short sleep at 3 months of age predicted inattentiveness at age 5 (p < 0.01). Further, short sleep and sleep difficulties at age of 24 months increased the risk for having inattentive symptoms at age 5 (p < 0.05; and p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, 5-year-old children with current sleep difficulties had increased risk for hyperactivity (p < 0.001) and inattentiveness (p < 0.001). Number of night awakenings were also associated with hyperactivity (p < 0.01) and inattentiveness (p < 0.01) at that age. Conclusions: Sleep problems at early childhood were associated with later occurring ADHD-related problems. More specifically, short sleep at age 3 months was associated with inattentiveness at 5 years old. Short sleep and sleep difficulties at 24 months increased the risk for having inattentive symptoms at age 5 years. Our findings indicated that altered developmental pathway of sleep quality occurs early in infancy among the children who would later have ADHDrelated difficulties.

N2  - Changes in sleep are ubiquitous in the perinatal period and it is important to be able to determine when these changes are significant enough to indicate sleep deficiency associated with increased risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes. Guidelines for identifying sleep deficiency include insomnia symptoms, excessively shortened sleep duration, and perception of insufficient or nonrestful sleep. Causes and complicating factors related to such sleep problems have been well-documented and are used to tailor behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for women who are pregnant or in the early postpartum period.

N2  - Objectives/Instruction: The objective of the current study was to observe in the offspring of rats, treated with diet representing different concentrations of iron, alterations caused in sleep, locomotor activity, dopaminergic system and iron metabolism. In addition, the impact of physical exercise on these variables analyzed in the offspring was evaluated. Methods: For this, Wistar rats were distributed in groups that received control, supplementation and iron restriction diets during the pregnancy. After weaning, the offspring of each group were divided into two groups: physical exercise and sedentary (n = 8/ group). Sleep assessments (Polysomnography), behavior (Open Field) and gene expression (PCR) of the dopaminergic system (D2, DAT, TH, MAP2K5-ERK5) and hepicidina were performed after 8 weeks of physical exercise (swimming). Results: The offspring results showed that physical exercise and iron supplementation of the mothers had an influence on the behavior after the 8 weeks of intervention. In the Open Field test, the offspring from the mothers supplementation group showed a significant increase in the Freezing when compared to all other groups most of the time (Repeated measures ANOVA p < 0.05). Through polysomnography, during the light period, the sedentary and physical exercise offspring from the mothers supplementation showed a higher % of Total Sleep Time and Slow Wave Sleep in relation to mothers iron restriction offspring; and reduced awakening in relation to the other groups (Factorial ANOVA p < 0.05). In the analysis of gene expression, the offspring groups showed no differences in the hepcidin, DAT and TH gene after 8 weeks of intervention. The sedentary group receiving iron supplementation from the mothers showed a greater expression of the D2 gene in relation to the control and the mothers iron restriction offspring with sedentary and physical exercise (Factorial ANOVA p < 0.05). Conclusions: In this context, we can suggest that iron diet during pregnancy and physical exercise performed by offspring in adulthood may present some changes in the behavior, sleep and gene expression in the offspring evaluated. However, the results suggest that the presence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is not a predisposing factor for the offspring to present movement disorders in adult life. FAPESP (2014-19212-0).

N2  - Objectives/Instruction: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the peri-partum period and may have negative consequences on mothers and newborns. Changes in sleep quality and especially insomnia are also typical throughout pregnancy and have been associated with adverse outcomes including peri-partum psychopathology. On this basis reasoning that identifying women at high risk of developing insomnia may have important clinical implications on maternal-fetal outcomes, we aimed to study stress-related sleep reactivity, as a risk factor to developing insomnia, and its association with peri-partum psychopathology in pregnant women. Methods: Sixty-two pregnant women (mean age 33.6±3 years, 20.6±0.6 weeks of pregnancy) were evaluated during their routine visit at the Gynecological Unit of the University of Pisa, Italy, using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia symptoms, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test for sleep-reactivity (FIRST), the Perceived Stress scale (PPS) for perceived stress, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for peri-partum depressive symptoms, Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety symptoms.Item number 10 of the EPDS was used to evaluate sucidality. T test was used to calculate differences in means between women with insomnia symptoms vs non insomnia symtpoms. Unilinear/multiple and logistic regressions have been performed to study correlations between variables. Results: Pregnant women with insomnia symptoms were the 27.8% and insomnia symptoms were correlated with greater perceives stress and stress related sleep reactivity (respectively PSS: r=0.47, p < 0.001, FIRST r = 0.38, p = 0.002), greater depressive, anxiety symptoms and suicidality (respectively EPDS: r=0.31, p=0.01, SAS r=0.30 p=0.01, item 10 EPDS r: 0.2, p=0.03). Conclusions: Pregnant women with greater insomnia symptoms may suffer from greater psychopathology such as anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidality. They may also suffer from dysregulation in perception and reactivity to stress. It should be of importance to evaluate insomnia symptoms during pregnancy to prevent and treat insomnia, psychopathology and their negative consequences on maternal-fetal outcomes.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea is an explemar of a complex, chronic disease that displays sexual dimorphisms in regards to symptom presentation, polysomnographic attributes, associated co-morbidity, and clinical impact. Women tend to report a higher frequency of insomnia symptoms, have shorter hypopneas, and have a higher prevalence of REM-predominant sleep apnea. While early data suggested that women may be at lower risk of cardiovascular complications, more recent data with longer term follow-up show that older women with sleep apnea may be at greater risk for experiencing cardiac dysfunction, heart failure or death, compared to men with sleep apnea. Emerging data also indicate that the association between physiological endotypes as well as genetic variants with sleep apnea vary in men and women. These data indicate that women have a higher loop gain, lower arousal threshold and less airway collapsibility compared to men. Differences in presentation and polysomnographic findings likely have contributed to under-recognition of sleep apnea in women compared to men. Sleep apnea also varies in prevalence across the lifespan, increasing both during pregnancy and after menopause. This talk will review the key features that distinguish sleep apnea in men and women with the goals of improving recognition and treatment of sleep apnea in women, and advancing the scientific understanding of this complex disorder.

N2  - Objective: To characterize sleep patterns among pregnant women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization. Study design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization after 20 weeks’ gestation. Women were recruited to wear an Actigraph, complete a sleep log for 7 consecutive days, and complete a sleep survey at the end of the study period. Actigraphy was used to determine rest and sleep intervals, sleep onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset. Results: A total of 40 participants were recruited, and 28 had ≥ 5 nights of data for a total of 177 nights of antepartum sleep data. Mean gestational age was 30 weeks. Median sleep duration was 7.05 h ± 1.71 h. In all, 43.5% of women had an average sleep duration of <7 h per night. In all, 28.2% of the study nights had a bedtime between midnight and 5 am. Going to bed between midnight and 5 am was significantly associated with sleep durations of <7 h (70.7 vs. 32.5%, p <.001). Participants reported an average of 2.4 awakenings per night due to hospital-related events. Conclusions: Prolonged antepartum hospitalization has a negative impact on sleep duration and quality.

N2  - Background: Ptyalism gravidarum (PG) is a condition of hypersalivation that affects pregnant women early in gestation. Symptoms include massive saliva volumes (up to 2 liters per day), swollen salivary glands, sleep deprivation, significant emotional distress, and social difficulties. Objectives: To examine maternal and fetal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of patients with PG. Methods: Patients diagnosed with PG in our clinic during the years 2001–2016 were identified and contacted. Demographic data were extracted from patient charts and clinical and outcome data was collected via telephone interviews. Results: The incidence of PG was 1/963 (0.09%) in our sample. Eleven out of 22 women (40%) with PG were also diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. Fetal gender did not increase the risk. Of the mothers presenting with PG, 37% had a positive family history for this condition. There was no associated increase in the rate of fetal or maternal complications. Two women reported a resolution of the symptoms immediately following hypnosis with acupuncture treatment. Conclusions: Although PG represents an unpleasant mental and physical condition, it does not pose any specific risk to the health of the mother or increase adverse perinatal outcomes for the fetus. Alternative medicine could play a role in the treatment of PG.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder accompanied by sleep disturbances leading to cardiovascular diseases, gestational hypertension, depression and increased rate of maternal and fetal mortality. Different prevalence rates have been reported for RLS. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed with aim to evaluate the prevalence of RLS among pregnant women in Asia. Methods: In this review study, the national and international databases, including SID, MagIran, Google Scholar, IranMedex, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus were searched and 16 observational studies with full texts published from 2003 to January 2018 were extracted. The meta-analysis was conducted using the Random effect model, and the I2 index was used to assess the heterogeneity between studies. Data were analyzed using STATA software (version 12). Results: Across the 16 reviewed articles with a total sample size of 49342, the prevalence of RLS among Asian pregnant women was around 18.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.75%-23.38%). The prevalence of RLS based on interview and questionnaire was 14.04% (95% CI: 12.02%-16.05%) and 22.75% (95% CI: 13.49%-32.01%), respectively. No significant relationship was found between prevalence of RLS and year of publication (p=0.939), sample size (p=0.161), and mean age of participants (p=0.105). Conclusion: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is highly prevalent among Asian pregnant women. Considering the maternal and fetal outcomes of RLS, it seems necessary to examine the precise causes of its prevalence among this high-risk population.

N2  - We report here a novel approach to measure circulating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) non-invasively as a potential way to diagnose and monitor endothelial dysfunction and peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a life-threatening condition caused by arterial constriction and obstruction of blood flow leading to limb ischemia. Current methods to diagnose and monitor PAD lack sensitivity, are expensive, and technically difficult. Recent studies indicate that decreased H2S production is an underlying cause of PAD. Also, reduced plasma H2S correlates with endothelial dysfunction in individuals with untreated hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea and other cardiovascular diseases. The TAGS device was designed to measure transdermal H2S to test the hypothesis that the diffusion rate (and therefore gas phase concentration) of H2S is directly proportional to dermal blood flow. Healthy volunteers between the ages of 21-65 were recruited. Exclusion criteria included subjects currently treated for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Smokers and pregnant women were also excluded. We demonstrate that H2S can be detected in healthy volunteers (n=11) at 10.8 part per billion (ppb). Interestingly, there is a positive correlation between age and TAGS readings in male volunteers (r=0.614; n= 6) and a negative correlation in female volunteers (r=0.482, n=5). The TAGS device has the potential, therefore, to serve as a more sensitive, economical, and easy to use diagnostic tool to detect H2S and predict dermal blood flow.

N2  - Objectives To measure the internal and external light exposure of incubators and open cots in an Australian single-room configured neonatal unit and compare findings to current recommendations. Methods Light meters were placed in the internal and external environment of incubators and open cots within occupied single rooms in a tertiary-level neonatal unit between 15 September and 28 October 2015. Data were recorded in one-second increments over a minimum of 48 hours per room. Results Internal median light in incubators and open cots predominantly fell below 50 lux, with low amplitude diurnal cycling. Incubator covers substantially reduced external light exposure, contributing to very low light conditions (<10 lux). Periodically, light inside incubators peaked six times greater than the maximum recommendation of 600 lux. Overall, internal incubator and open cot lighting in the neonatal unit met American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for 65.1% of the time during the day and 25.6% overnight. Australasian Health Infrastructure Alliance recommendations were met for 6.7% of the time during the day and 2.4% overnight. Conclusions Overall, light levels fell predominantly below 50 lux with peak periods of extreme light exposure. Low amplitude cyclic light was evident, but it remains unknown if this is sufficient to produce an effect on circadian entrainment, especially in preterm neonates. Current guidelines do not stipulate optimal cyclic light levels in neonatal units to promote circadian rhythms in the newborn population. Further research to determine well-defined lighting parameters for neonates of different gestations is paramount.

N2  - The average adult produces approximately 2.4 million new red blood cells (RBC) every second. The RBC membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and provides properties essential for physiological cell function, as deformability and stability while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network. Mature RBCs lack the nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin (Hb).There are precise homeostatic mechanisms to ensure sufficient, but not excess, RBCs production. Any imbalance in the homeostatic mechanisms can lead anemia or to excess of RBCs production, known as erythrocytosis. Erythrocytosis corresponds to an increase in the RBC count, Hb concentration and hematocrit (Hct) above the reference range (adjusted to age, sex and living altitude), due to the expansion of the erythrocyte compartment in the peripheral blood. Absolute erythrocytosis occurs when the RBC mass is greater than 125% of that predicted or when a raised Hb and Hct (Hb >18.5 g/dl or a Hct > 0.52% in a male and a Hb > 16.5 g/dl or Hct > 0.48% in the female) is observed in at least two separate blood counts performed at different time points. Absolute erythrocytosis is distinct from Relative erythrocytosis, which is caused by a severe plasma volume reduction (e.g., due to diuretics or severe diarrhea) and distinct from Apparent erythrocytosis, caused by arterial hypoxemia (e.g., cigarette smoking, carbon monoxide poisoning or sleep apnea). Based on pathophysiology, absolute erythrocytosis can be classified either as Primary or Secondary erythrocytosis, which can be of either congenital or acquired origin. Congenital Erythrocytosis (CE) represents a rare and heterogeneous clinical entity. The only known form of primary CE is caused by mutations in the receptor of erythropoietin gene (EPOR). Secondary CE can be a consequence of tissue hypoxia, being caused by congenital defects such as Hb variants with increased oxygen affinity, due to mutations in the α-or β-globin genes (HBB, HBA2, HBA1), or due to mutations in the BPGM gene. Secondary CE can also result from defects in the components of the oxygen-sensing pathway (PHD2, HIF2α and VHL), due to mutations in the corresponding genes: EGLN1, EPAS1 and VHL. Depending on the affected gene, CE can be inherited either in a dominant or recessive mode. Despite recent important discoveries in the molecular pathogenesis of CE, in about 70% of the patients the genetic causes remain to be identified and are designated Idiopathic Erythrocytosis. The number and phenotypic variability of patients that remain without an identified etiology suggest that other genes have to be implicated. The lack of a diagnosis can have considerable adverse effects for patients and their families, including failure to identify potential treatments, failure to recognize the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies, and failure to provide anticipatory guidance and prognosis. We hope that the use of high-throughput technology as WGS, WES and targeted sequencing panels will be a useful tool in the identification of novel variants and candidate genes associated with the development of congenital erythrocytosis.

N2  - Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., 'couvade syndrome') on men's body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

N2  - Background: It is well known that excessive caffeine intake is bad for health. Some infants can be sensitive to caffeine and display increased irritability and sleep disturbances when exposed to caffeine in breast milk. The half-life of caffeine in infants is longer than that of adults, thus, it stays in the body much longer before excretion. Information about the adverse effects of caffeine in infants is available, making some mothers nervous. The main contributors of caffeine intake are Japanese tea and coffee. Most of the Japanese breastfeeding mothers avoid caffeine to an unnecessary extent. So far, there have been few studies about the concentration of breast milk caffeine of mothers who regularly take Japanese tea and coffee while breastfeeding their infants. Objective: To reveal the concentration of breast milk caffeine of Japanese breastfeeding mothers. Methods: Breast milk was collected from Japanese breastfeeding mothers who visited Kagawa University Hospital for the 1-month postpartum checkup of their infants. Caffeine intake was assessed using a dietary questionnaire and the concentration of breast milk caffeine was measured by HPLC. Results: 13 breastfeeding mothers were recruited. Most of the mothers (11/13, 85%) restricted caffeine, and more than half of them never consumed caffeine during pregnancy. 9 mothers out of 13 mothers (69%) showed undetectable breast milk caffeine concentrations and for the detectable ones, the values were between 0.24∗1.70 mg/ml. Conclusions: In most mothers, caffeine in breast milk was not detected. Most of them also avoided caffeine intake. The concentration of caffeine breast milk was very low in the mothers who took caffeine regularly.

N2  - Objective: Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is characterized by cyclic episodes of hypoxia of short duration followed by normoxia. IH occurs in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as athlete, pregnancy, asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. Hypoxic stress is one such process during which autophagy often serves as an important mediator. Furthermore, autophagy is also activated in desmin-related cardiomyopathy and is an adaptive response to protein aggregates in this proteotoxic form of heart disease. Previous studies suggest that autophagy can protect cells by avoiding accumulation of misfolded proteins, which are generated in response to I/R injury. The objective of this study is to determine whether IH-induced autophagy can attenuate endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used H9c2 underwent IH in an incubator with an oscillating O2 concentration between 4% and 20% every 60 minutes for 1-4 days. Treatments with thapsigargin(TG, 1 μM), curcumin(Cur, 35 μM), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 100 μM) to induce ER stress. The autophagy and ER stress-related proteins (LC3B, GRP78, CHOP, p-eIF2, ATF4, cleaved ATF6, p-IRE1) level were detected by western blotting assay. The cell survival was detected by MTT assay. Results: Our results showed that autophagy-related protein expression increased in 1-3 day but ER stress-related protein decreased in the second day after IH condition. Moreover, we used thapsigargin, curcumin, H2O2 to induce ER stress. After 24 hours treatment, ER stress-related proteins level increased. However, the ER stress-related proteins level decreased and cell survival was recovered in IH condition. Conclusions: Acute IH induced autophagy as an adaptive response against ER stress, it promotes cells survival to limit ER stress-caused injury.

N2  - Study Objectives: To test whether a customized positional therapy device, PrenaBelt, would reduce time spent sleeping supine and evaluate any change in maternal or fetal parameters, in a group of healthy pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Participants underwent an in-home, overnight sleep study during late pregnancy (32–38 weeks). Participants were observed over 2 nights: 1 night when the PrenaBelt was not worn (nonintervention or control) and 1 night when it was (intervention). The intervention night was randomly allocated, and the study nights were consecutive. On the control night, participants were filmed using a night-capable (infrared) video camera, maternal sleep was measured by the Watch-PAT200, and the fetus was continuously monitored using the Monica AN24. On the intervention night, video, maternal, and fetal monitoring were repeated with the addition of the mother wearing the PrenaBelt. Results: A total of 25 healthy pregnant women were studied. Four had missing data for the Watch-PAT or Monica, and eight had missing or disrupted video data. Video-determined time in bed was not significantly different during intervention and control nights (P = .196, r = −.23). Median time spent supine during the intervention night was reduced from 48.3 minutes, to 28.5 minutes during the control night (P = .064, r = −.33). The difference in the proportion of time spent supine was significant (P = .039). There was no significant difference in objectively estimated sleep time (P = .651, r = −.07). Improvement was observed in both maternal and fetal parameters during the intervention night with an increase in median minimum maternal oxygen saturations (control = 91.6%, intervention = 92.4%, P = .006, r = −.42), fewer maternal oxygen desaturations (control = 7.1, intervention = 5.9, P = .095, r = −.26), and fewer fetal heart rate decelerations (control = 14.0, intervention = 10.4, P = .045, r = −.31) compared to the control night. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary evidence that an intervention to reduce supine sleep in late pregnancy may provide maternal and fetal health benefits, with minimal effect on maternal perception of sleep quality and objectively estimated sleep time. Further research to explore relationships between objectively determined maternal sleep position, maternal respiratory indices, and fetal well-being is warranted.

N2  - "Music of the Brain" is based on musical or music-like stimulation organized in close accordance with the biopotentials of a subject's brain. Initial studies of the "Music of the Brain" approach were analyzed and limitations were noted. To enhance the efficiency and usability of the approach, several combinations of music therapy with a neurofeedback technique - musical neurofeedback - were developed. Enhanced efficiency of the approach has been shown for the correction of functional disturbances during pregnancy and for elimination of stress-induced states in high technology specialists. The use and advantages of musical neurofeedback technology for increasing human cognitive activity, correcting sleep disturbances, and treatment of disorders of attention were verified. After further development and testing the approach may be suited for a wide range of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures in the public health arena.

N2  - Purpose: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet few studies are currently available regarding the determinants of sleep quality among pregnant women in China. This study aimed to: (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality in pregnant women. Materials and methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Five hundred pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. Five selfreport questionnaires were used for gathering data, including information of sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)). Results: A total of 454 pregnant women participated in the study between September 2016 and April 2017. Eighty-seven percent pregnant women experienced sleep disorder (PSQI score >5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The significant contributors to sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal depression, maternal age, and gestational age. Conclusions: Sleep disorder is very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased maternal age, and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. These determinants can assist healthcare professionals in preventative intervention.

N2  - Objective Data: Sleep-disordered breathing is an increasingly common condition in nonobstetric populations and is associated with significant morbidity. The incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy is unknown, and it is likely that many cases go undiagnosed. Study: A systematic review and metaanalysis was undertaken to determine whether pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing are more likely to have adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes compared with control subjects. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl databases were searched for full-text publications in English of sleep-disordered breathing and human pregnancy up to June 2017. Only studies that reported on sleep-disordered breathing in relation to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, preterm birth, mode of delivery, cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium at delivery, or wound complications were included. Results: A total of 1576 results were identified; 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Women with sleep-disordered breathing were older (mean difference, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–2.28) and had a higher body mass index (mean difference, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–4.32) than those who did not. Maternal sleep-disordered breathing was associated significantly with preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation; odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50–2.31) and low birthweight (<2500 g; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–2.78). These women were also less likely to have a vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.78) and to be at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.21) or a cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.55–2.11). The risk of both elective (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 - 1.76) and emergency cesarean (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–5.29) was increased. In addition, women with sleep-disordered breathing were at a higher risk of having an infant with a 5-minute Apgar score <7 (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–3.71), stillbirth or perinatal death (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–3.28), and neonatal nursery admission (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–2.61). Conclusion: Maternal sleep-disordered breathing is associated with increased risks of adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes.

N2  - Pregnant women experience more sleep disturbances and greater systemic inflammation than non-pregnant women. However, the few studies that have examined the links between sleep and inflammation in pregnant women have been in clinical samples. We examined whether sleep duration is associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation, in pregnant and non-pregnant women in a population-based sample of US women. Participants were 2865 women of reproductive age (aged 20–44 years) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of Americans. Sleeping <5 h on weeknights or workdays was significantly associated with increased CRP levels among both pregnant and non-pregnant women in unadjusted analyses; however, after adjustment for demographic, and health-related variables (depressive symptoms, self-rated health status, body mass index (BMI), diabetes), sleeping <5 h was no longer significantly related to CRP levels. Pregnant women had significantly higher CRP levels, after adjusting for sleep duration, demographic, and health-related variables. Our findings suggest that pregnancy is associated with increased peripheral CRP, after adjustment for sleep duration, demographic, and health factors. Further, in both pregnant and non-pregnant U.S. women of reproductive age, short sleep duration is associated with higher CRP levels, but this link is explained by self-rated health, BMI, and diabetes. Further studies are needed to investigate links of other sleep parameters (e.g., sleep fragmentation) with CRP in these populations.

N2  - METHODS: Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. The sample consisted of women aged 18-44 years. All variables were self-reported. Sleep duration was dichotomized as insufficient (< 7 h/night) or adequate (≥ 7 h/night). A composite score of sleep quality was used and dichotomized as poor none/little of the time or some/most/all of the time. Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index. Associations between sleep and OW/OB were assessed using logistic regression analyses with survey weights. Three models were computed for sleep duration/quality: model without covariates, model adjusted for demographics (age, ethnicity, level of education, household income, marital status, employment, parity, region, and season), and model adjusted for demographics and variables associated with OW/OB (mood disorder, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol).
RESULTS: Total sample consisted of 9749 women of childbearing age. Thirty-eight percent had insufficient sleep duration. Sleep duration was significantly associated with OW/OB in the model with no covariates and discriminated 52.8% of women of childbearing age, but this association was no longer significant in the models adjusted for covariates. Sleep quality was not significantly linked to OW/OB in any of the models.
CONCLUSION: Targeting sleep alone would likely not contribute to lower risk of OW/OB among Canadian women of childbearing age. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones, are needed to confirm these findings.
OBJECTIVES: Tests of the relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity (OW/OB) among women have been inconsistent. Few studies reporting such associations have focused on women of childbearing age. This paper investigates this association among Canadian women of childbearing age.

N2  - Objective To evaluate whether the percentage of time spent supine during sleep in the third trimester of pregnancy could be reduced using a positional therapy device (PrenaBelt) compared with a sham device. Design A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over pilot trial. Setting Conducted between March 2016 and January 2017, at a single, tertiary-level centre in Canada. Participants 23 participants entered the study. 20 participants completed the study. Participants were low-risk, singleton, third-trimester pregnant women aged 18 years and older with body mass index <35 kg/m 2 at the first antenatal appointment for the index pregnancy and without known fetal abnormalities, pregnancy complications or medical conditions complicating sleep. Interventions A two-night, polysomnography study in a sleep laboratory. Participants were randomised by computer-generated, one-to-one, simple randomisation to receive either a PrenaBelt or a sham-PrenaBelt on the first night and were crossed over to the alternate device on the second night. Allocation concealment was by unmarked, security-tinted, sealed envelopes. Participants, the recruiter and personnel involved in setting up, conducting, scoring and interpreting the polysomnogram were blinded to allocation. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent supine during sleep. Secondary outcomes included maternal sleep architecture, respiration, self-reported sleep position and feedback. Results The median percentage of sleep time supine was reduced from 16.4% on the sham night to 3.5% on the PrenaBelt night (pseudomedian=5.8, p=0.03). We were unable to demonstrate differences in sleep architecture or respiration. Participants underestimated the time they spent sleeping supine by 7.0%, and six (30%) participants indicated they would make changes to the PrenaBelt. There were no harms in this study. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the percentage of sleep time supine during late pregnancy can be significantly reduced via positional therapy. Trial registration number NCT02377817; Results.

N2  - Objective: To review the evidence and provide recommendations for the counselling and management of obese parturients. Outcomes: Outcomes evaluated include the impact of maternal obesity on the provision of antenatal and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Evidence: Literature was retrieved through searches of Statistics Canada, Medline, and The Cochrane Library on the impact of obesity in pregnancy on antepartum and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, obstetrical anaesthesia, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to April 2009. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. Values: The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Practice Obstetric Committees of the SOGC under the leadership of the principal authors, and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Benefits, Harms, and Costs: Implementation of the recommendations in this guideline should increase recognition of the issues clinicians need to be aware of when managing obese women in pregnancy, improve communication and consultation amongst the obstetrical care team, and encourage federal and provincial agencies to educate Canadians about the values of entering pregnancy with as healthy a weight as possible. Recommendations: 1. Periodic health examinations and other appointments for gynaecologic care prior to pregnancy offer ideal opportunities to raise the issue of weight loss before conception. Women should be encouraged to enter pregnancy with a BMI < 30 kg/m2, and ideally < 25 kg/m2 (III-B).2. BMI should be calculated from pre-pregnancy height and weight. Those with a pre-pregnancy BMI > 30 kg/m2 are considered obese. This information can be helpful in counselling women about pregnancy risks associated with obesity (II-2B).3. Obese pregnant women should receive counselling about weight gain, nutrition, and food choices (II-2B).4. Obese women should be advised that they are at risk for medical complications such as cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Regular exercise during pregnancy may help to reduce some of these risks (II-2B).5. Obese women should be advised that their fetus is at an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, and appropriate screening should be done (II-2B).6. Obstetric care providers should take BMI into consideration when arranging for fetal anatomic assessment in the second trimester. Anatomic assessment at 20 to 22 weeks may be a better choice for the obese pregnant patient (II-2B).7. Obese pregnant women have an increased risk of Caesarean section, and the success of vaginal birth after Caesarean section is decreased (II-2B).8. Antenatal consultation with an anaesthesiologist should be considered to review analgesic options and to ensure a plan is in place should a regional anaesthetic be chosen (III-B).9. The risk of venous thromboembolism for each obese woman should be evaluated. In some clinical situations, consideration for thromboprophylaxis should be individualized (III-B).

N2  - Short sleep duration has been linked to maternal hyperglycemia. Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and hyperglycemia in pregnancy or gestational diabetes (GDM). MEDLINE and Scopus were searched until July 2017. Studies that assessed sleep duration and had objective measurements of hyperglycemia during pregnancy were eligible. Aggregate data were available from eight studies, n = 17,308 (seven with self-reported and one with objectively measured sleep duration). Meta-analysis was applied for pooling aggregate data using a random-effects model. Identified authors provided individual patient data (IPD) from four studies with objectively measured sleep duration, n = 287. A one-stage approach with a hierarchical mixed-effect logit model was applied to pool IPD across studies. Aggregate data analysis revealed that women with short sleep duration (<6–7 h) were more likely to have GDM than women without short sleep duration, odds ratio 1.70 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.33). IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to sleeping >6.25 h, women who slept ≤6.25 h had higher 1-h glucose levels after 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing by 0.65 mmol/L (0.18, 1.13) and an increased risk of GDM, adjusted odds ratio 2.84 (1.25, 6.44). In conclusion, short sleep duration in pregnancy, both self-reported and objectively measured, is associated with hyperglycemia and an increased GDM risk.

N2  - Objective Blood pressure (BP) shows circadian rhythm similar to Cosine curve by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM ) . BP is higher in the afternoon and lower at midnight. Hypertension shows blunt nocturnal BP fall and reversed circadian BP rhythm due to disturbance in sympathetic system. We investigated the characteristic changes of circadian rhythm in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy(HDP), especially preeclampsia (PE) by ABPM. Methods In 106 pregnant women showed hypertension by clinic BP, 24 hour ABPM diagnosed with HDP (n=79), including PE (n=43) and gestational hypertension (GH, n = 36) , and white coat hypertension (WCH, n = 27 ) . Circadian rhythm was investigated for 1 ) fall of nighttime as dipper, non-dipper or riser, 2 ) and percent rhythm (PR ; multiple regression)and acrophase(maximal BP time ) by Cosinor method. This study was approved by ethics of local committee. Results Mean systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in PE and GH was higher than in WCH. The riser in SBP was seen in 21in PE, 15 in GH and 0 in WCH. The PR of both BPs in three groups was similar, while, the PR of pulse was lower in PE (0.24±0.18 for PE vs 0.33±0.17 for GH and 0.33±0.21). In PR more than0.16, the acrophase of SBP in 57% of PE, 40% of GH and 0% of WCH were shifted to evening or night. Conclusion Characteristic changes in PE was reduction of PR in BP as well as pulse and shifted acrophase. The pathogenesis of PE might be involved in not only vascular dysfunction but also sympathetic disorders.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of relaxation exercises on subjective sleep quality of in third-trimester pregnant women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pretest posttest randomized controlled trial recruited 84 pregnant women in the third trimester. Following random assignment of subjects, the treatment group (n = 46) performed relaxation exercises for four weeks and the control group (n = 46) received standart cares. At baseline and after the intervention sleep quality was assessed. Data obtained were analyzed in SPSS.
RESULTS: The mean score of the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was 7.12 ± 3.66. It was determined that relaxation exercises improved some sleep quality subscales including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction and global sleep quality. The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A four -week compact disc guide relaxation exercises program can be effective in improving sleep quality.

N2  - Objective Pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are multifactorial diseases caused by complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, analyses of both factors are important to develop methods of early detection and prevention of such diseases. However, most of the previous researches have used self-report questionnaires to collect information on environmental factors, and had limitations in the frequency of data acquisition and the objectivity of the information. Methods We are conducting a prospective cohort study Maternity Log Study of pregnant women. By using a smart phone and monitoring devices, participants (n=302) upload daily life-logs including biometric information on more than 20 items such as household blood pressure, as well as lifestyle information on more than 10 items such as hours of sleep. Furthermore, we collected specimens such as blood, saliva, and urine of participants for multi-omics analyses. In this presentation, we report differences in life-logs between an HDP (n=17) and control (n=124) groups. Results We found significant differences in several items of life-logs between the two groups. For example, the HDP group experienced larger numbers of days with palpitation after the 28th-week of gestation. Next, we established prediction models using several lifelogs. A leave-one-out cross-validation demonstrated the specificity of 0.82, and the sensitivity of 0.88 at the 24th week. Conclusion By the analyses of daily life-logs during pregnancy, we identified candidate life-log markers for HDP. On the presentation, it will be also reported whether the predictive performance is further improved by combining maternal omics data with life-logs.

N2  - Objective We reported the quantitative/qualitative sleep change during pregnancy in mice at the annual congress last year. Based on these results, we further investigate the effect of EEG changes and sleep/wakefulness behaviors on acute and sever hypertension during late pregnancy using PAH(Pregnancy- Associated Hypertensive)mice, Renin-Angiotensin transgenic mice. Methods Human angiotensinogen expressing female mice and C57BL/6 female mice are the subjects. At the age of 9-12 weeks, EEG/EMG recording electrodes were implanted to the skull and neck muscle. After the recovery and acclimation periods, we recorded the basal sleep state. Next, we mated the human angiotensinogen expressing female mice and wild type female mice with human renin expressing male mice and wild type male mice, respectively. The recordings were restarted after the confirmation of vaginal plug. We evaluated 4 days for early, mid, late pregnancy and 2 days for postpartum. Furthermore, we injected Evans blue to the tail vein and removed the brains in late pregnancy to investigate the BBB permeability. Results PAH mice exhibited markedly abnormal vigilance states with a generalized slowing of EEG and a drastic decrease in REM sleep during late pregnancy, making it impossible to determine wakefulness and NREMS. Half of the PAH mice shows convulsive seizure conceived as eclampsia. These changes are returned to normal immediately after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple leakages of Evans blue. Conclusion PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG accompanied with BBB disruption. This study also suggest the PAH mice as an animal model for eclampsia.

N2  - Objective: To investigate whether maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with changes in fetal growth trajectory. Study design: Retrospective review of pregnant women who underwent overnight polysomnography. Fetal growth was estimated using sonographic biometric measurements obtained during routine prenatal care. Customized estimated fetal weight and birth weight centiles were calculated and impaired fetal growth was defined as birth weight <10th centile or a slowing of fetal growth by >33% during the last trimester. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between maternal OSA and altered fetal growth after adjusting for potential covariates. Results: There were 48 women without and 31 women with OSA. There were no differences in the proportion of infants with birth weight <10th centile between women with and without OSA (23 vs. 25%, p = 1.0), However, the presence of maternal OSA was predictive of impaired fetal growth (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2–12.6). Logistic regression models were repeated using only a slowing of fetal growth in the 3rd trimester (excluding birth weight <10th centile) and OSA predicted a slowing in fetal growth across the 3rd trimester (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4–9.4). Fourteen additional women were treated with positive airway pressure during pregnancy; fetal growth was not significantly different in these women compared to controls. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with altered fetal growth, which appears to be ameliorated with use of positive airway pressure.

N2  - Objective Pleural effusion or pulmonary edema caused by preeclampsia could be an indication for termination of preg-nancy. Taking the mortality and morbidity of neonates into ac-count, however, the decision of early preterm delivery is a clini-cal dilemma for obstetricians. Although non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) has been widely used in patients with respiratory failure, there has been limited data and evi-dence regarding NPPV during pregnancy thus far. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of NPPV management for respiratory distress in pregnancy due to preeclampsia. Methods The medical record of cases managed with NPPV during pregnancy in our institution was reviewed, and patients' characteristics, background, pregnancy outcome, and complications of NPPV were analyzed retrospectively. Re-sults NPPV was employed in four pregnant women between 2011 and 2016 in our hospital, and all cases were diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. In three cases, pleural effusion was de- tected and the other case was complicated with sleep apnea syndrome. NPPV was initiated at 20, 23, 24, and 30 weeks of gestation, respectively. In all cases NPPV alleviated respiratory distress, and succeeded in delaying the termination of pregnancy for 17 days on average. Maternal outcome was uneventful and no intubation was required. No complication such as aspiration caused by NPPV was observed. Conclusion NPPV might contribute to prolongation of pregnancy in patients with poor oxygenation due to preeclampsia.

N2  - Objective: Although afternoon napping is very common, particularly in China, there are limited data regarding the potential health effects of afternoon napping during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight (LBW). Methods: A total of 10,111 women aged 15–50 years were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012–2014. Information on sleep habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Compared with women who reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI 0.58–1.18) and 0.61 (0.44–0.83) for those who reported ≤1 h and >1 h of napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association between LBW and napping 5–7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50–0.92). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW.

N2  - Study Objectives: Cortical activity patterns develop rapidly over the equivalent of the last trimester of gestation, in parallel with the establishment of sleep architecture. However, the emergence of mature cortical activity in wakefulness compared with sleep states in healthy preterm infants is poorly understood. Methods: To investigate whether the cortical activity has a different developmental profile in each sleep-wake state, we recorded 11-channels electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and respiratory movement for 1 hr from 115 infants 34 to 43 weeks-corrected age, with 0.5-17 days of postnatal age. We characterized the trajectory of d, ?, and a-ß oscillations in wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep by calculating the power spectrum of the EEG, averaged across artifact-free epochs. Results: d-Oscillations in wakefulness and REM sleep decrease with corrected age, particularly in the temporal region, but not in non-REM sleep. ?-Oscillations increase with corrected age in sleep, especially non-REM sleep, but not in wakefulness. On the other hand, a-ß oscillations decrease predominantly with postnatal age, independently of sleep-wake state, particularly in the occipital region. Conclusions: The developmental trajectory of d and ? rhythms is state-dependent and results in changed cortical activity patterns between states with corrected age, which suggests that these frequency bands may have particular functional roles in each state. Interestingly, postnatal age is associated with a decrease in a-ß oscillations overlying primary visual cortex in every sleep-wake state, suggesting that postnatal experience (including the first visual input through open eyes during periods of wakefulness) is associated with resting-state visual cortical activity changes.

N2  - Objective Pregnancy related disorders, including preterm birth (PTB), are caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors such as lifestyle and living environment. We have designed a prospective cohort study named'Maternity Log Study' to investigate unrevealed mechanisms of those disorders from both genetic and environmental aspects. Methods 302 participants were recruited by written informed consent. We collected daily lifelogs of physiological data (body weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, physical activity, body temperature, and hours of sleep ) and symptoms(morning sickness, abdominal pain, uterine contraction, and bowel movement)as well as blood and urine samples at several points throughout pregnancy. We analyzed the association between the course of lifelogs and PTB. Results Several lifelog features showed differences between a spontaneous PTB ( SPTB ) group ( n=14 ) and a control group (n=130). Especially, daily caloric expenditure of the SPTB group measured by a wearable activity monitor was significantly lower than controls after 20 weeks of gestation(1,577± 180 vs 1,915±291 kcal, p < 0 . 0003 ) . Interestingly, morning body temperatures of the control group decreased gradually according to the gestational age(36.55>36.35°C from 16 to 30 weeks of gestation), while those of the SPTB group did not as much (36.62 >36.53°C during the same period as the control). ASPTB prediction model using lifelogs before 26 weeks of gestation demonstrated sensitivity higher than 0.95 and specificity higher than 0.90. Conclusion Combinations of daily lifelogs could be predictive markers for SPTB. Further combinations with genome, transcriptome, and metabolome data may improve our prediction model and reveal underlying mechanisms of SPTB .

N2  - Background: Inspiratory flow limitation is a breathing pattern during sleep caused by upper airway (UA) narrowing that occurs during snoring and various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Clinical examination of flow limitation relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological support. Methods: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical parameters. Results: We found that three features were correlated with the anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = −0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = −0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. ΔNC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = −0.54, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Temporal features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children.

N2  - Maternal psychological stress, depression, and anxiety during pregnancy (prenatal stress; PNS) are thought to impact fetal development with long-term effects on offspring outcome. These effects would include physical and mental health, including psychopathology. Maternal sleep, diet, and exercise during pregnancy are lifestyle behaviors that are understudied and often solely included in PNS studies as confounders. However, there are indications that these lifestyle behaviors may actually constitute essential mediators between PNS and fetal programming processes. The goal of this theoretical review was to investigate this idea by looking at the evidence for associations between PNS and sleep, diet, and exercise, and by piecing together the information on potential underlying mechanisms and causal pathways through which these factors may affect the offspring. The analysis of the literature led to the conclusion that sleep, diet, and exercise during pregnancy, may have fundamental roles as mediators between PNS and maternal pregnancy physiology. By integrating these lifestyle behaviors into models of prenatal programming of development, a qualitatively higher and more comprehensive understanding of the prenatal origins of psychopathology can be obtained. The review finalizes by discussing some of the present challenges facing the field of PNS and offspring programming, and offering solutions for future research.

N2  - Background: Preterm infants are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with term born infants and the risk is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birthweight. Parents of these infants should have adequate knowledge and practise the recommended SIDS risk reduction measures. Methods: A survey was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017 at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. Parents of preterm infants ≤36 weeks’ gestation were invited to answer a self-administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge and practise regarding SIDS risk reduction. Results: Forty-nine (61.33%) of the 80 parents had heard of SIDS prior to the interview, with social media being the commonest source of information (67.3%). Only 35 (43.7%) correctly answered at least five of nine questions on knowledge of SIDS risk reduction (“good knowledge”). When compared with the group of parents who answered less than five questions correctly (“poor knowledge”), there was no significant difference in the demographic and infant characteristics between the groups. The majority (68.8%) of parents practised bed sharing with their infants, and this was significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.01). Household smoking was also significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.048). Conclusion: Knowledge on SIDS risk reduction measures was generally poor among parents of preterm infants in this study. Cigarette smoking, bed sharing and non-supine sleep positions, which are associated with increased risk of SIDS, were common practise among the present subjects.

N2  - Background: Becoming the parent of a new baby comes with a range of challenges including difficulties with emotional adjustment, couple relationship issues and difficulty managing common infant behaviors, such as crying and sleep problems. This time can be especially challenging for couples who experience a range of risk factors. Previous parenting interventions for parents of babies have shown mixed results. This protocol paper describes a randomized controlled trial of a group-based parenting intervention for high-risk parents expecting their first baby. Methods/design: Participants will be randomized to either Group Baby Triple P or Care as Usual (CAU). Group Baby Triple P involves 4 × 2 h group sessions delivered during pregnancy and 4 individual telephone sessions of 30 min each in the early postnatal period. Outcomes will be assessed via parent self-report questionnaire, home observations and a baby diary 10 weeks and 6 months post-birth. Primary outcomes will be parental confidence and perceived competence. Secondary outcomes will include parental responsiveness and bonding with the baby, relationship happiness, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and stress, and infant crying and sleep. Analyses will involve a series of rANOVA and rMANOVAs, t-tests and a multilevel modeling approach. Discussion: A brief summary, strengths and potential implications are discussed.
