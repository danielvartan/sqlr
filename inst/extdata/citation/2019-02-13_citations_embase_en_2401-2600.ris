N2  - Purpose: Approximately 5% of all pregnancies are complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Gestational diabetes mellitus is accepted as longstanding metabolic dysfunction of postpregnancy prolonged insulin resistance and associated with elevated risk of gestational hypertension. Since GDM is a state of temporary insulin resistance, in this context we therefore aimed to test our hypothesis that day time circadian blood pressure variation is impaired even in normotensive women with GDM. We sought to determine this hypothesis by comparing the normotensive women complicated with GDM with normal pregnant women in terms of holter monitoring derived dipper and non-dipper circadian variation of blood pressure profile. Methods: Forty-two women with GDM and 33 normal uncomplicated preagnant subjects were screened and diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, according to the criteria of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Twenty four-hour non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring by using a portable compact digital recorder automatic device was carried out on a weekday. In order to obtain diurnal an nocturnal values, diurnal readings at 20-min intervals and nocturnal readings at 30-min intervals were recorded. Nocturnal blood pressure dipping was calculated as follows: (Awake BP - Sleep BP) x100/Awake BP. Patients with a nocturnal reduction in average daytime systolic BP and diastolic BP of less than 10% were classified as nondippers, while those with nighttime reduction of 10% or more were classified as dippers. All patients underwent echocardiographic examination to determine left ventricle mass index and diastolic dysfunction. Results: Left ventricle mass index was significantly higher in GDM group (179.91±42 g/m2 vs 155.90±26 g/m2, p=0.004). Diastolic dysfunction parameters including mitral E and velocities, deceleration time, isovolumetric relaxation time were in favor to diastolic dysfunction in GDM group (p=0.019, p=0.03, p=0.04, p<0.001, respectively). Night phase systolic blood pressure and night phase diastolic blood pressure were higher in GDM group (111.16±10.8 vs 102.36±7.5; p<0.001 and 69.61±9.4 vs61.60±5.1; p<0.001, respectively). Nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure dipping were diminished in GDM group (-4.06±3.7 vs -8.92±3.6; p<0.001 and -6.95±5.1 vs -8.92±3.6; p<0.001). Conclusion: Day time circadian blood pressure variation is impaired and left ventricle mass index is increased in normotensive GDM which deserve further studies in this topic.

N2  - Background: Antiepileptic drug (AED) use has been increasing in the general population. Yet, little is known about the extent to which AEDs are used in pregnancy, particularly for newer agents. Objectives: To assess whether AED use has increased among pregnant women in the U.S., 2001-2007. Methods: We analyzed data from MEPREP, a collaborative effort between the U.S. FDA and 11 U.S. health plan-affliated research institutions. We identified live-born deliveries (1/1/2001-12/31/2007) among health plan members aged 15-45 years on delivery date. Pregnancy exposure to AEDs was determined through outpatient pharmacy dispensing files. First-generation AEDs included those available for clinical use before 1993; other agents were considered second-generation AEDs. Information on sociodemographic and medical/reproductive factors was obtained from linked birth certificate files. Maternal diagnoses were identified based on ICD-9 codes, and were classified into five groups (any epilepsy, psychiatric disorder, pain disorder, neuromuscular disorder, and sleep disorder). Prevalence was defined as the number of AED-exposed deliveries per 1,000 qualifying deliveries. Results: Among 585,615 deliveries, 11,611 (∼2%) included at least one AED prescription during pregnancy. The prevalence of AED use increased between 2001 (15.7 per 1,000 deliveries) and 2007 (21.9 per 1,000 deliveries), driven primarily by increased use of second-generation AEDs (1.6 per 1,000 deliveries in 2001 to 8.9 per 1,000 deliveries in 2007). The use of first-generation drugs remained relatively unchanged during the study period (range 14.6 to 16.2 per 1,000 deliveries). Psychiatric, epileptic, and pain disorders were the most prevalent diagnoses among AED users. Approximately 13% of AEDexposed deliveries involved the use of AED combinations primarily concomitant use of first- and second-generation drugs. Conclusions: Between 2001 and 2007, there was a fivefold increase in the use of second-generation AEDs. Nearly one in eight AED-exposed deliveries involved concomitant AED use. Additional investigations of the reproductive safety of newer AEDs may be needed.

N2  - Objectives: Screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) remains poor in the general population, despite evidence for association with adverse outcomes and improvement of certain outcomes with therapy. Data from the past decade have suggested an association between snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders. However, it is unclear how often SDB is screened for in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether, and how, symptoms of SDB are assessed during prenatal care. Methods: This study was designed as a survey-based observational study. Within 48 hours of delivery, English-speaking patients were surveyed regarding prenatal conversations with obstetric providers about symptoms of SDB. During a similar time period, obstetric providers completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding how often they discussed the same symptoms during prenatal visits. Results: A total of 776 patients and 80 providers performing the majority of deliveries at the same hospital answered the survey. Nurse providers asked about sleep quality significantly more often than physician providers; however, responses to questions about snoring were similar in both groups. Resident physicians were the least likely to ask about sleep quality. Less than 3% of providers reported asking about snoring, closely matching patient responses. A total of 44% of patients surveyed were overweight and 21.7% were obese. Although 32% of patients snored, only 5% were asked about snoring during a prenatal visit. Obese women and women with a history of gestational hypertensive disorders were more likely to report being asked about snoring. Conclusions: Based on patient and obstetric provider recollections of discussions, the issue of SDB is poorly assessed during routine prenatal care, despite an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the pregnant population.

N2  - Epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition found in pregnancy. As such, all neurologists, internists, and obstetricians should know how to counsel women with epilepsy as they are considering pregnancy. While all of the usual recommendations for women of childbearing potential apply, including preconceptual and ongoing use of folic acid, calcium, and vitamin D, additional consideration must be given to the need for adjustment or change of anticonvulsant therapy. Monotherapy with the lowest dose of medication needed to control seizures should be prescribed prior to conception. Most anticonvulsants have a favorable profile when used in pregnancy; older anticonvulsants such as valproate and carbamazepine should be avoided, as they are associated with higher rates of fetal malformation, and in the case of valproate, with proven cognitive deficits in children exposed to this medication in utero. With use of any anticonvulsant medication, dosing throughout pregnancy will need to be adjusted to maintain an appropriate serum concentration. Dosing of anticonvulsants needs to be decreased after delivery to avoid medication-related toxicity, although sleep deprivation and hormonal fluctuation can increase the risk of seizures in postpartum women. With proper management, the majority of women with epilepsy can have uneventful pregnancies and healthy babies. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

N2  - Rationale: Continuous Spike Wave in Sleep Syndrome (CSWS) is a rare but potentially treatable epilepsy syndrome of childhood. It is defined by developmental regression and electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES). The pathophysiology of CSWS is still unknown. The objective is to present 3 cases of CSWS preceded by neonatal hydrocephalus. Methods: We retrospectively identified 16 patients seen between 2007 and 2009 with ESES. Of these, 3 patients with CSWS had a history of neonatal hydrocephalus with ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt placement. We then reviewed the charts of these patients to determine the clinical features, treatment and responsiveness of the CSWS. Results: Case 1 (PD) presented at age 3 days with grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) following an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, requiring placement of a VP shunt. She was developmentally delayed and began to have complex partial seizures at age 4 years. Her development regressed shortly afterward. She was treated for CSWS with many different anti-epileptic medications including diazepam, prednisone, and IVIG, but did not achieve remission. Case 2 (AB) had a large neonatal bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage extending into the basal ganglia and thalamus following a difficult term delivery, requiring VP shunt placement. She was developmentally delayed and had a right hemiparesis. She developed complex partial seizures at age 21 months and was hospitalized several times for status epilepticus. She began to regress developmentally at age 4.5 years. She was treated with diazepam, valproate, prednisone, zonisamide, ethosuxamide, IVIG, sulthiame and deep brain stimulation, but did not achieve remission of CSWS. Case 3 (CS) underwent placement of VP shunt for hydrocephalus at age 4 days following a difficult term delivery. He was developmentally delayed and developed generalized and complex partial seizures at age 4 years. Developmental regression began at age 6. He was diagnosed at age 8 with cerebral folate deficiency and was treated with leucovorin. His CSWS was treated successfully with diazepam and has been maintained in remission on zonisamide. Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of a history of neonatal hydrocephalus in this cohort of children with CSWS (3/16), neonatal hydrocephalus may be a risk factor for ESES and CSWS. Children with seizures and developmental regression should be screened for ESES, as regression is potentially reversible with treatment. However, ESES associated with neonatal hemorrhage is particularly refractory to treatment.

N2  - The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women (mean age046.6 years, range 34.3- 67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objective: To describe 2 contrasting surgical approaches in the treatment of patients with a lingual thyroid. Method: Case series from 2006 to 2008. Condition studied: lingual thyroid. Subjects and setting: Patients requiring surgery for lingual thyroid in a community hospital. Outcome measurements: recurrence, complications. Results: A 33-year-old woman had a small lingual thyroid. Although she had no symptoms she was planning to become pregnant and it was felt that the lingual thyroid would increase in size with pregnancy and could result in airway obstruction. She therefore underwent transoral laser resection of the entire lingual thyroid. A 36-year-old woman had a large combined lingual and sublingual thyroid. She was unable to sleep lying down. She had previously undergone transoral debulking. She underwent a transcervical transhyoid partial pharyngectomy with resection of the entire lingual and sublingual thyroid. Both patients had no recurrence with mean follow-up of 9 months. There were no complications. Conclusion: The treatment of lingual thyroid needs to be tailored to the clinical presentation. Surgery can be performed either through a transoral or transcervical approach depending on the extent of disease.

N2  - The aim of this research was to analyze the relation between coping strategies and somatic symptomatology in pregnant Spanish women and the influence of a previous miscarriage on these variables. We used a correlational retrospective design, which included 207 expectant mothers (44with a previous miscarriage). The instruments included a questionnaire on coping with stress and questions about first-trimester symptoms. Regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between sleep disturbances and overt emotional expression coping, between tiredness/fatigue and avoidance coping, and between nausea and religious coping. The influence of coping strategies on somatic symptomatology did not differ significantly between women who had had or had not had a previous miscarriage, although women with a previous miscarriage scored higher on the use of religious coping and positive reappraisal and reported more nausea. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences. Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.

N2  - RATIONALE: Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH) is different between genders, being double in men as compared to childbearing age women, while similar as compared to menopausal women. To further clarify the reasons for such difference, we investigated the role of upper airway (UA) dimensions and hormonal profile on the UA collapsibility. METHODS: 18 healthy subjects with a neck circumference (NC) less than 38 cm were studied: 7 men (M; age, 28±2 yr BMI 22±1 Kg/m2), 4 postmenopausal females (F,post; age, 59±3 yr; BMI 25±1 Kg/m2), 7 premenopausal females (F,pre; age, 19±2yr; BMI 22±1 Kg/m2) in both follicular and luteal phase of menstrual cycle. None of the women had hormonal medication. Subjects in supine position underwent measurement of mean pharyngeal area (AP,mean) by acoustic pharyngometry, and assessment of volume exhaled in the first 0.5 seconds after the application at the mouth of -5cmH2O at onset of tidal expiration (V,NEP0.5) and active critic pressure (P,crit) during wakefulness. RESULTS: Males had greater NC (36.1±1.2 cm) than two other groups (F,pre 30.9±1.2 cm, F,post 37.2±0.7 cm, p<0.05), but no significantly greater AP,mean (M 2.9±0.6 cm2; F,pre 2.3±0.8 cm2 -follicular phase; F,pre 2.1±0.9 cm2 -luteal phase; F,post 2.8±2.2 cm2). There was not difference in V,NEP0.5 (M 108±19 %pred.; F,pre 116±26 %pred. -follicular phase; F,pre 108±16 %pred. -luteal phase; F,post 95±12 %pred.). No correlations were found between NC, AP,mean and V,NEP0.5 %pred. Median AP,mean value was 2.63 cm2. Although subjects (n=9, 2 males) with AP,mean <2.63 cm2 showed greater V,NEP0.5 (115±24 %pred.) than subjects (n=9, 5 males) with AP,mean ≥2.63 cm2 (V,NEP0.5 102±16 %pred.) the difference was not significant. P,crit in luteal phase was more negative than in follicular phase in F,pre, and in F,post and in males (-16.1±3.7 cmH2O vs -6.7±4.3 cmH2O, and -8.6±3.5 cmH2O and -6.9±3.9 cmH2O, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of UA dimensions in determining differences in UA collapsibility between genders is still unclear. The more negative P,crit during luteal phase in F,pre shows a lower UA collapsibility (less active UA compliance) in this period of menstrual cycle. This effect may result from the progesterone stimulus on neuromuscular drive to UA dilating muscles. Hormonal influence might partly protect premenopausal women from OSAH, making their UA less collapsible.

N2  - Background: The antihistamine alimemazine is frequently used among infants and toddlers in Norway to alleviate sleeping problems in spite that the effect and safety of this practice has been disputed. Objectives: To study the association between the parent's hypnotic use 1 year prior to pregnancy and the use of alimemazine in children 0-3 years of age. Methods: An observational longitudinal study using data from two nationwide; the Norwegian Prescription Database and the Norwegian Medical Birth Registry. Setting: All children born in Norway in 2006 were eligible. Only the first child born this year of every mother and/or father was included (N = 56,511). Exposures: Prescriptions of benzodiazepine hypnotics and z- hypnotics (ATC-code N05CD and N05CF) filled by the mother or the father or both in the 1 year period prior to pregnancy. Main outcome measures: Prescriptions for alimemazine (ATC-code R06AD01) to children 0-3 years of age. Statistical analysis: Logistic regression. We adjusted for the prescriptions of antidepressants to the mother, infant's gender, gestational age, prescriptions for antibiotics, respiratory agents and dermatological steroids, parent's age, number of children and regions of the country. Results: Of 1,578 children (2.8%) received a prescription for alimemazine. Use of hypnotics both among fathers (adjusted odds ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.3), mothers (1.8; 1.4-2.3) or both (2.9; 1.5-5.4) increased the risk of the child receiving alimemazine. The mother's use of antidepressants, infant male gender, being born preterm, having received prescriptions for antibiotics, dermatological steroids or for drugs for obstructive respiratory diseases all increased the chance of receiving alimemazine. Conclusions: Use of hypnotics by the parents increased the risk of an alimemazine prescription for the child. The association with parent hypnotic use may indicate that sleep problems themselves or the tolerance for insomnia may to some degree be inherited.

N2  - Introduction: We present a case of compression of the left main bronchus (LMB) that led to left upper lobe (LUL) hyperinflation and resulted in “dying spells” with resolution only after lobectomy. Case Report: This is a female, born at 34 weeks gestation, that needed early respiratory support leading to the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia and a dilated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Initially a pulmonary-aortic shunt was placed and the PDA ligated. Chest CT at 2 months revealed chronic lung disease (CLD), LMB compression and diaphragmatic eventration. She was weaned and discharged on supplemental oxygen. At 4 months, she presented with a diaphragmatic hernia that was plicated and at 7 months TOF was repaired with an unremarkable course. However, shortly thereafter she presented with “dying spells”. Episodes would start in anticipation of crying; proceed with cyanosis and bradycardia requiring resuscitation. Repeat CT scan revealed persistent obstruction of the LMB, CLD and LUL hyperinflation. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy ascertained a patent but compressed LMB. Investigations into etiology of the episodes failed to demonstrate a cause. Polysomnography (PSG) demonstrated obstructive sleep apnea and desaturation. She was started on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oxygen supplementation. At 10 months she presented with a more severe episode; required intubation and ventilation, high pressures and FiO2. Influenza B was recovered. A tracheostomy was placed due to failed extubation but the episodes, that persisted, could only be managed by paralysis. At this point, it was decided to perform a LUL lobectomy. The LUL was found extremely hyperinflated, volume reduction by 60-70% and thoracic aortopexy were performed. Recovery from this procedure was quick, and episodes did not recur. PSG suggested only residual hypopnea. She remains stable 3 months after the operation. Discussion: There have been several case reports of vascular compression of the trachea leading to apneic episodes or “dying spells”. Similarly, dynamic hyperinflation has been described as a cause of gas trapping in patients with airflow obstruction, during ventilation, leading to hemodynamic instability. We present this case in which such spells were a result of compression of the LMB leading to LUL hyperexpansion. We hypothesize that the hyperinflation by way of stimulation of lung C-Fibers/stretch receptors led to apneic episodes. We believe that the total resolution of episodes following volume-reduction of LUL and aortopexy corroborate this.

N2  - Hypothesis/aims of study Urinary incontinence (UI) is not a life-threatening disease, but it can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). UI is the same symptom in men and women but it is not associated with the same diseases, so we can suppose that it affects QoL differently in both genders. Our objective was to analyze the associations between UI and QoL related to health among men and women over 50 years, and to compare these associations between genders. Study design, materials and methods Cross-sectional study within the framework of the GAZEL cohort (www.gazel.inserm.fr), set up in 1989 by the INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) in cooperation with several departments of the French national power company Electricité de France-Gaz de France (EDF-GDF). In 2006, 14,500 participants, including 10,723 men (57-67 years) and 3777 women (52-67 years) answered to the annual questionnaire of the GAZEL cohort, which included this year a health-related QoL questionnaire, the Nottingham Health Profile, composed of six dimensions: “tonus/energy”, “pain,” “emotional reactions”, “social isolation”, “physical mobility” and “sleep”. For each dimension scores were transformed into binary variables: good QoL and altered QoL. The definition of UI was based on the question about health problems in the past 12 months, with a list of possible 66 health problems, divided by headings. In the heading “Urinary and genital problems” we used the item “involuntary loss of urine” (yes or no). Other reported chronic diseases were also taken into account in final analysis. The logistic regression models estimating the association between altered QoL and self-reported UI were carried out by controlling for age and socio-demographic and professional characteristics and other self-reported chronic diseases. To compare associations between genders tests of interaction were performed with likelihood ratio tests. Results Among all 14500 respondents, 817 reported an “involuntary loss of urine” in the past 12 months with 292 (2.72%) men and 525 (13.90%) women, respectively: women were more likely than men to report UI (OR: 6.82; 95%CI: 5.79 to 8.03). Concerning other chronic conditions women were more likely than men to report a higher number of diseases, but a higher proportion of chronic conditions in women was reported for chronic disorder of intestinal transit, depression and stress, while in men reporting chronic diseases, angina, stroke and diabetes were those more often cited. Women were more likely than men to report altered QoL in the whole sample and in separate analyses of continent and incontinent participants. UI was associated with altered quality of life mainly in the dimensions of “tonus/energy”, “social isolation”, and “physical mobility” (Table). These associations remained statistically significant after taking into account characteristics of the participants associated with QoL (alcohol and tobacco consumption, Body Mass Index, occupation, retirement, diploma, major life events, number of children, income and marital status) and chronic conditions. The strength of these associations varied by dimension, with higher ORs between QoL and IU in “tonus/energy”, “social isolation” and “physical mobility”, in both genders. We observed higher ORs for the associations between altered QoL and UI in men than in women, except for the dimension “physical mobility”, but the only significant difference in ORs between genders was found for the dimension “tonus/energy”. The association between IU and altered QoL was significantly stronger in men (OR=3.17; 95%CI 2.49-4.04) than in women (2.11; 1.75-2.54) (test of interaction, p = 0.005). Trends for significant interactions were observed in the dimensions “emotional reactions” (p = 0.19) and “social isolation”(p = 0.097). Interpretation of results Women were more likely than men to report UI, a result relevant with other studies. Concerning other chronic conditions men were more likely than women to report more severe diseases. Furthermore all women, those continent and those incontinent, compared with men, continent and incontinent, were more likely than men to declare altered QoL, a result also reported in other studies on quality of life (1). UI remained associated with an altered QoL, in both genders, even after taking into account many characteristics, including chronic diseases, which could also alter QoL. One of our main results is that the association between QoL and UI was stronger in men than in women in some dimensions, statistically significant in the dimension “tonus/energy” and with trends for significance in the dimensions “emotional reactions” and “social isolation”. One way to interpret this result is as follows: one might think that UI in women is often linked in her mind to pregnancy, and therefore it would be, even if that incontinence causes discomfort, such a sign of “positive” femininity (2). Conversely, IU for men attacks their manhood or the image they have about (3). There is a place for qualitative studies among men and women to explore their representations of UI and confirm this hypothesis. Our work was based on a cross-sectional study, so causality between UI and QoL impairment cannot be stated, but many other authors found that UI had a negative impact on QoL. Healthy worker effect and autodeclaration bias should also be taken into account while discussing our results. Concluding message UI is negatively associated with QoL of men and women over 50 years. Incontinent women are more likely than incontinent men to report altered QoL, but in some dimensions of QoL, men seem more affected than women by UI. This paradoxical result needs further studies to understand. (Table presented).

N2  - Rationale: Laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) in the preterm lamb are often characterized by severe apneas and bradycardias, triggering potential life threatening events in some of these animals (St-Hilaire M, 2007). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) and/or caffeine are among the most frequent therapeutic approaches used in the treatment of apneas of prematurity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nCPAP and/or caffeine treatment on the cardiorespiratory components of LCR in the preterm lamb. Methods: Seven preterm lambs were born vaginally on gestational day 133 (normal gestation: 147 days), after intramuscular injections of betamethasone (12 mg, 24h apart) and mifepristone (RU 486, a progesterone receptor antagonist, 8mg/kg). Five days after birth, a chronic surgical instrumentation was performed in order to collect states of alertness, electrocardiography (ECG), arterial pressure and electromyographic (EMG) recordings of laryngeal constrictor muscle. In addition, a supraglottal catheter was inserted transcutaneously to induce LCR (injection of HCl) in quiet sleep during 4 randomized experimental conditions: 1) without nCPAP and without caffeine (control condition); 2) nCPAP (5 cm H2O) and without caffeine (nCPAP); 3) without nCPAP and caffeine (10mg/kg IV on 30 minutes; caffeine); 4) nCPAP and caffeine. Thoracic and abdominal respiratory movements were monitored via respiratory inductance plethysmography, and saturation was collected using pulse oximetry (SpO2). Results: Overall, results revealed that nCPAP improved the cardiorespiratory components of LCR elicited by HCl, contrarily to caffeine which had no positive effect. Control nCPAP Caffeine nCPAP/Caffeine Total duration apnea (s) 10 2 (0.004) 9 (>0.1) 5 (0.08) Total duration bradycardia (s) 12 2 (0.007) 12 (>0.1) 8 % decrease in oxygen saturation 9 4 (0.07) 9 (>0.1) 5 (0.1) Values are expressed as means (P-values). P-values indicated were compared with control. Conclusion: In conclusion, nCPAP improves the cardiorespiratory components of LCR in preterm lambs, contrarily to caffeine, which confirms the relevance of using nCPAP in the treatment of apneas of prematurity.

N2  - Due to the progress in fetal surgery, it is important to acquire data about fetal pain. Material and methods: We performed a Medline research from 1995, matching the following key words: "pain" and "fetus", with the following: "subplate", "thalamocortical", "myelination", "analgesia", "anesthesia", "brain", "behavioral states", "substance p". We focused on: (a) fetal development of nociceptive pathways; (b) fetal electrophysiological, endocrinological and behavioral reactions to stimuli and pain. Results: We retrieved 217 papers of which 157 were highly informative; some reported similar data or were only case-reports, and were not quoted. Most endocrinological, behavioral and electrophysiological studies of fetal pain are performed in the third trimester, and they seem to agree that the fetus in the 3rd trimester can experience pain. But the presence of fetal pain in the 2nd trimester is less evident. In favor of a 2nd trimester perception of pain is the early development of spino-thalamic pathways (approximately from the 20th week), and the connections of the thalamus with the subplate (approximately from the 23rd week). Against this possibility, some authors report the immaturity of the cortex with the consequent lack of awareness, and the almost continuous state of sleep of the fetus. Conclusions: Most studies disclose the possibility of fetal pain in the third trimester of gestation. This evidence becomes weaker before this date, though we cannot exclude its increasing presence since the beginning of the second half of the gestation. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: To compare obstetric outcomes between patients with positive and negative Berlin Questionnaire results. Methods: An observational study comparing outcome between these two groups was carried out in seven hospitals, representing seven different regions of Turkey. In each center, pregnant women who were admitted for normal pregnancy follow-up or labor, were consecutively recruited in the study. Each participant completed a sleep apnea questionnaire from the Berlin Questionnaire. This questionnaire tests snoring and daytime sleepiness. Fetal outcome and pregnancy outcome are recorded from patient files. Results: A total of 465 consecutive patients who completed the Berlin Questionnaire were analyzed. Patients with a positive questionnaire had a higher BMI, pre-pregnancy medical disorder rate and cesarean rate (68% vs 51%) than the negative group. Preeclampsia and gestational diabetes were more prevalent in the positive questionnaire group than the negative questionnaire group [19 (28%) vs 18 (5%) for preeclampsia, 8 (12) vs 13 (3%) for gestational diabetes, respectively]. At logistic regression analysis, gravidity, gestational age at birth and a positive questionnaire were independent predictors for preeclampsia. BMI and history of maternal medical disorders were independent predictors of gestational diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea may be related to preeclampsia.

N2  - Introduction: Naps can improve alertness and mood in non-pregnant adults. In individuals with insomnia, however, naps can disrupt nighttime sleep. Pregnant women experience disturbed sleep, and napping is a common phenomenon during pregnancy. The purpose of this analysis was to examine associations between napping, daily ratings of mood and sleepiness, and objectively estimated nighttime sleep in pregnant women. Methods: 14 pregnant women (ages 23-37, mean±SD=29.5±5.1 years) with a history of depression or bipolar disorder (but not in a current mood episode) wore wrist actigraphs and completed daily sleep diaries for one week during third trimester. Diary reported naps were veriied by actigraphy. Naps observed on actigraphy but not reported on diaries were identiied by interviews at the end of monitoring. Women also completed nightly mood and sleepiness scales. Nighttime sleep period (SPT), total nighttime sleep (TST), and nighttime sleep eficiencies (SLEFF) were estimated from actigraphy data using the Sadeh algorithm (1994) in Action-W software (AMI, Ardsley, NY). We used generalized estimating equations to compare sleep and mood measures on days participants did and did not nap. One participant's data was excluded due to movement artifact when she napped on the train. Results: Data were available for a total of 88 days (mean=6.8 days/ participant). Three diary-reported naps could not be veriied by actigraphy; 8 actigraphy-identiied naps not reported on diaries were conirmed by interview. A total of 28 naps were scored [mean±SD=3.3±2.6 naps per person, range=1-8 naps]. Average daily nap length was 50±40 mins (range=6-144 mins). We observed a marginally-signiicant difference in SPT on nights after naps compared to nights with no naps [F(1,9)=5.38, p=0.0455]. The mean SPT (95%CI) was 500 mins (95%CI 474-528 minutes) on no-nap days versus 459 mins (95%CI 421-502 minutes) on days with ≥ 1 nap. Napping was not related signiicantly to sleepiness or mood ratings, TST, or SLEFF. Conclusion: In this small sample, we did not observe signiicant relationships between napping and TST, SLEFF, subjective sleepiness, or depressed mood. Women tended to spend less time in bed the night following a daytime nap, perhaps relecting a partial dissipation of sleep homeostatic drive during the day. Future analyses will examine associations among naps, sleepiness, and mood in a larger sample and include the postpartum period.

N2  - The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods, but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery. Demographic and obstetric information was collected via questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24hours, however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors. Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week, although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon, while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods during immediate postpartum, and this redistribution raises questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after giving birth. © 2012 Sleep and Biological Rhythms © 2012 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

N2  - Introduction: Studies have indicated that short sleep duration may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to investigate the impact of short sleep duration independent of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on pregnancy outcome among obese pregnant women. Methods: Participants in an observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI >30 kg/m2) underwent overnight sleep studies for OSA at 8-20 weeks of gestation using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA). Subjects completed standardized sleep questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Fatigue Severity Score (FSS) and self reported sleep duration during early pregnancy. Short sleep duration (SSD) was deined as the 1st quartile of sleep duration (< 5 hrs/night). Data were analyzed utilizing ANOVA, trend analysis, and chi square. Results: Of the 170 participants, 24 (14%) had an apnea hypopnea index ≥5 and were excluded. Sleep duration quartiles were: 1st :< 5h, 2nd: 5-6.5h, 3rd:6.5-8h and 4th :> 8h. Women with SSD were older than other participants (29 vs. 27, 25 and 22 years, p<0.001) but had similar BMI (39 vs. 38, 38 and 37 kg/m2, p=0.29) and gestational weight gain (6 vs. 9, 10 and 9 kg, p=0.3). Women with SSD when compared to the other quartiles had a higher ESS score (10 vs. 9, 7, and 6; p=0.001) and FSS (37 vs. 30, 30, 26; p=0.02) and more frequent preterm birth (17 vs. 6, 8 and 5%, p=0.06) and lower birthweight (2937 vs. 3294, 3237, 3364 grams, p=0.08) but similar preeclampsia rates (10 vs. 15, 17, 17, p=0.8). Conclusion: Shorter sleep duration was associated with increased sleepiness, and fatigue, with a trend for higher rates of preterm birth and lower birthweight. The high prevalence of short sleep among obese pregnant women supports the need for further research on the role of sleep on maternal and fetal outcomes.

Responses to these questions typically correlate moderately with objectively measured sleep durations in non-pregnant individuals, but little is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. As pregnancy is a time period associated with increased sleepiness and fatigue, women may be prone to misreport actual time spent sleeping. However, direction of bias and factors associated with bias are unknown. Methods: We analyzed data from 87 mothers enrolled in Project MOMMIES, a longitudinal study of urban pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in mid-pregnancy (mean 21 weeks' gestation) and included 7-days of wrist actigraphy along with a standard survey question about usual sleep duration (“During the past month, how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night?”). Paired t-tests and linear regression assessed agreement between subjective and objective measures of nocturnal gestational sleep duration. Results: The majority of participants were Black (84%), high school graduates (67%), low-income (100% Medicaid), and < 25 years old (74%). Average measured nocturnal sleep duration was 6.9 hours (standard deviation [SD] 0.9), while subjective reports averaged 7.3 hours (SD 2.1; 0.4 hours longer than measured sleep). Mothers who slept < 6 hours per night were more likely to over-report average sleep time than those who slept 7 or more hours. Bias did not signiicantly vary by age, race, body mass index, parity, education, or sleepiness. Overall, there was a correlation of -0.01 (95% conidence interval -0.22, 0.20) between subjective and objective measures of sleep duration in pregnancy, indicating the ranking of individuals was not well preserved. Conclusion: Self-reports of usual sleep hours do not relect objectively measured sleep time in urban pregnant women. Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration for this population.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertensive disorders, including preeclampsia. The exact mechanism underlying these adverse outcomes has not been elucidated. Maternal serum markers used routinely in prenatal screening for Down syndrome, in particular inhibin A (inhA) and pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) have been associated with the development of preeclampsia. Placental inhA is secreted in response to a hypoxc environment and low PAPP-A levels are associated with impaired trophoblastic invasion (a precursor of preeclampsia). Given the suggested association of sleep disordered breathing and preeclampsia, we hypothesized that Inhibin A and PAPP-A may be abnormal in women with sleep disordered breathing pointing toward a potential mechanism for this association. Methods: Records of pregnant women diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing were identiied by ICD-9 codes and then reviewed for conirmation of the diagnosis, demographic information and pregnancy outcomes. Records were also reviewed for prenatal Down syndrome screening tests. First trimester PAPP-A levels and second trimester inhA levels had been determined at the time of sample receipt using automated 2-site chemiluminescence immunometric assays on the DXI (Beckman Coulter Inc., Chaska, MN). Marker levels are expressed as multiples of median (MoM), after correction for gestation-speciic normative data and maternal weight. Results: A total of 35 pregnant women with a diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing have been identiied by ICD-9 code and record review. Median age was 29 + 5.5 years and median BMI was 44.65 + 9.4. Median gestational age at delivery was 38.9 + 4.4 weeks. A total of 14.2% of patients were diagnosed with preeclampsia in this group. Fourteen patients had available inhibin A levels and 18 had PAPP-A levels. Median levels of Inhibin A (1.06 MoM) were not altered in women with sleep disorderd breathing. However, median levels of PAPP-A were signiicantly reduced at 0.55 MoM and remain low (0.55 MoM) even after excluding patients who later developed preeclampsia . Conclusion: PAPP-A, a irst trimester marker that has been suggested for screening for preeclampsia, is signiicantly reduced in pregnant women diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing.

N2  - Introduction: Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are common among pregnant women, and several studies have linked SDB symptoms with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. However, few prospective studies or studies objectively measuring SDB during pregnancy have been performed. We performed a prospective cohort study in which we examined the relationship between objectively measured SDB and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension and/or preeclampsia). Methods: 105 pregnant women from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania obstetrics practices completed irst and third trimester overnight polysomnography studies. After delivery, charts were abstracted for data on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other maternal- fetal outcomes. We performed logistic regression analyses using baseline and third trimester SDB variables in continuous and dichotomized form as predictors to examine the relationship between SDB and gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Results: Mean subject age was 26.7 (SD 7.2) years. 75% of all subjects were African-American. Mean irst trimester BMI was 33.4 (SD 6.4) kg/m2. Women delivered at a median of 39.1 (SD 2.0) weeks gestation. 10.5% of women had OSA (AHI>=5 events/hour) in the irst trimester. By the third trimester, 26.7% of women had OSA. Twenty subjects developed a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, n=9; preeclampsia, n=10; both, n=1), including 1 with chronic hypertension who developed preeclampsia. In unadjusted analyses restricted to subjects without chronic hypertension (n=100), there were no signiicant associations between irst or third trimester AHI, irst or third trimester OSA, or change in AHI and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. There was a signiicant association between nulliparity (a known risk factor for preeclampsia) and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (p=0.04). Conclusion: OSA, whether assessed either early or late in pregnancy, was not associated in this prospective study with the development of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

N2  - Introduction: While we and others have reported that short maternal sleep duration during early pregnancy are predictive of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, potential mechanisms for these associations are unknown. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived peptide involved in regulating food intake and energy expenditure, may play a role in these observed associations. Given inconsistent reports of associations between short sleep duration, and leptin, and that prior studies did not include pregnant women; we examined the association of maternal sleep duration with plasma leptin concentrations in early pregnancy. We also examined the extent to which, if at all, this association differs by maternal pre-pregnancy lean or overweight/obesity status. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 830 pregnant women who reported early pregnancy sleep duration during in-person interviews. Plasma leptin, measured in samples collected <16 weeks gestation, were determined using enzyme immunoassays. Sleep duration was categorized as: ≤5, 6, 7-8, and ≥9 hours. Differences in leptin concentrations across categories were estimated using linear regression. Analyses were completed for lean and overweight/obese women (pre-pregnancy BMI <25 and ≥25 kg/m2), respectively. Results: There was no association of leptin with sleep duration among lean women. Among overweight/obese women, a reverse J-shaped relation between leptin and sleep duration was observed. Mean early pregnancy leptin was greatly elevated (β=24.99 ng/ml, P<0.001) among women reporting ≤5 hour of sleep compared with controls who reported 7-8 hours of sleep. Compared with the same control group, women reporting ≥9 hours of sleep also had elevated leptin (β=4.61 ng/ml, P=0.11). Conclusion: Early pregnancy sleep duration was not related with leptin in lean women. However, short sleep duration, and to a lesser extent long sleep duration, were associated with elevated leptin among overweight/ obese women. Further studies are needed to understand the consequences of sleep duration on altered leptin synthesis and release in lean and overweight/obese pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant women with psychiatric disorders. Methods: A cohort of 1,332 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' psychiatric diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% conidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of mood or anxiety disorder. Analyses accounted for possible effect modiication by pre-pregnancy lean or overweight/obesity (BMI <25 vs. ≥25 kg/m2) status. Results: Approximately 5.1% of the cohort (n=68) reported having a diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder before pregnancy. Compared with women without a psychiatric diagnosis, the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) for short sleep duration in early pregnancy (≤6 hours) were 1.95 (1.03-3.69). The corresponding OR (95%CI) for long sleep duration (≥9 hours) during pregnancy was 1.13 (0.63-2.03). A modest, insigniicant association between psychiatric disorder and EDS was noted (OR=1.32; 95%CI 0.61-2.86). Women with psychiatric disorders had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR=2.41; 95%CI 1.46-4.00) and elevated perceived stress (OR=3.33; 95%CI 1.89-5.88). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight/obese women. Compared with lean women who had no psychiatric diagnoses, the odds of short sleep duration (OR=2.88; 95%CI 1.14-7.32) and perceived stress (5.58; 95% CI 2.40-12.96) were greatly elevated for overweight/obese women with a psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusion: These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep disorders and complaints among women with psychiatric disorders; and extends the literature to include pregnant women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent mood/anxiety-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring is a common symptom of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), a condition that is present in 4% of the general population. SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke and heart attack.The general risk factors associated with severe preeclampsia significantly overlap with those reported to increase the risk of SDB syndromes. Further risk factors that need consideration include: multiple pregnancy, diabetes and chronic hypertension treatment. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of SDB in the pregnant population in a metropolitan hospital and to examine self-reported snoring against actual snoring as determined by Sonomat ® studies and report fetal outcomes of those who snored compared to those who did not snore. Methods: A questionnaire containing The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Berlin Questionnaire (which examines snoring and tiredness) was administered to 3000 pregnancies over a period of two years. Women were additionally recruited for detailed sleep studies, which entailed continuous night time blood pressure monitoring, encephalogram for sleep staging and continuous night time cardiotocographic monitoring. Results: To date, 2206 surveys have been completed. Sleep studies have been undertaken by 280 women, of which half have continuous blood pressure readings. The detailed data provided through these studies is currently being examined and will be completed by June 2012. Conclusion: This study is unique and unprecedented in the scope of detailed data obtained through the variety of parameters measured. Coupled with pregnancy progression and comprehensive maternal and neonatal outcomes, it is anticipated that this multi-faceted study will provide a wealth of knowledge on sleep patterns, SDB and its effect on pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbance is considered a ubiquitous complaint of pregnancy. Yet the preponderance of evidence comes from women who are in late gestation. We have hypothesized that disturbed sleep in early gestation may establish an environment in which the risk for pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm birth, is increased. The extent to which parity inluences sleep disturbance in early pregnancy and outcomes is also unknown. Data are presented to further the understanding of early gestational sleep, how it changes across time, and the role of parity. Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep were collected from pregnant women (N = 158) 10-12 weeks (T1), 14-16 weeks (T2), and 18-20 weeks (T3). Regression analyses with Bonferroni corrections tested main effects and interactions for time and parity. Results: Signiicant effects for time were observed. Diary-assessed (D) average and variability of sleep onset latency (SOL), and average wake after sleep onset (WASO) signiicantly decreased from T1to T3 (p's < .01). Actigraphy-assessed (A) average and variability in WASO decreased from T1 to T3 (p's < .01). Average sleep eficiency (from D and A) signiicantly increased across time (p < .001). The sleep fragmentation index decreased from T1 to T3 (p = < .01). Actigraphy-assessed sleep duration (p < .001), and average and variability in percent time spent awake (p's < .01) also decreased across time. Multiparous women showed an indication of poorer sleep as depicted by greater SOL (average and variability), greater average WASO, and lower sleep eficiency (uncorrected p's < .02). There were no signiicant interactions. Conclusion: Sleep in early gestation is inconsistent at best with rapid improvement in the second trimester. While there is signiicant variability, the impact of sleep in early gestation on morbidity is unclear. Therefore, further evaluation of the role of disturbed sleep on maternal and fetal outcomes is warranted.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring has been associated with adverse outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, higher rates of cesarean deliveries as well as preterm labor. Data on outcomes of polysomnographically diagnosed sleep disordered breathing are scarce. The goal of this study was to compare outcomes of polysomnographically diagnosed sleep disordered breathing to those of pregnant women at low risk for the disorder. Methods: A retrospective review of records of pregnant women diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing identiied by ICD-9 codes was performed ( Sample 1). Demographic information and outcomes were collected. Another cross sectional study systematically recruited women at the time of delivery and surveyed them for the presence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms using the multivariable apnea prediction index questions (Sample 2). Pregnancy outcomes of this sample were also collected. Two groups of controls were identiied from Sample 2. Control group 1 had BMI <30 and no symptoms of sleep disordered breathing (no apnea, snoring or gasping). Control group 2 had BMI >30 and no symptoms of sleep disordered breathing. Results: A total of 35 women with a conirmed diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing were identiied (Sample 1). Out of Sample 2, 268 women were identiied as control group 1 and 45 as control group 2. Median age in the case group was 29 + 5.5; 28.0 + 6.1 in Control group 1; 25 + 5.0 in Control group 2. Median BMI was 44.6+ 9.4 in the case group; 22.5 + 3.0 in control group 1; 34.8 + 4.04 in control group 2. There was a signiicantly higher likelihood of gestational diabetes in the case group compared to control group 1 (31.4% and 5.9% respectively, p=0.003) and to control group 2 (31.4% and 6.6% respectively, p=0.007). There was also a higher likelihood of gestational hypertensive disorders in the case group when compared to control group 1 (22.8% and 5.2%, p=0.02) and control group 2 (22.8% and 6.6%, p=0.05). There were no signiicant differences when control group 1 was compared to control group 2 for either gestational diabetes or gestational hypertensive disorders. Conclusion: Pregnant women with sleep disordered breathing are more likely to have gestational hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes than lean and obese pregnant women without symptoms of sleep disordered breathing.

N2  - Introduction: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) are a common complication of pregnancy. It is widely believed that this is a more common complication of adolescent pregnancies. Adolescent pregnancies are generally primiparous and result in earlier delivery, and these factors put them at a greater risk of preeclampsia. However, the generally lower blood pressure of the group should act as a protective measure against this. Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to compare the adolescent age group (maternal age <20 years at time of recruitment) to those in the 20-34 years age group in terms of their change in blood pressure and diagnosis of HDP and preeclampsia. Immediate obstetric outcomes (gestation at delivery, birthweight and mode of delivery) were also compared. Methods: Questionnaires were administered to pregnant women at Campbelltown and Liverpool hospitals as part of a much broader study looking at sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy. Data collected included demographic information, pregnancy blood pressure readings, pregnancy complications, delivery type and neonatal outcomes. Adolescents (Group 1 age <20 years) were compared to older women (Group 2 aged 20-34 years) utilizing Student's t-tests analysed with IBM SPSS v.19e. Results: Results were available on 2306 women, 108 in Group 1 and 2198 in Group 2. Adolescents had a lower booking systolic blood pressure (105 mmHg and 109 mmHg, p < 0.005) and diastolic blood pressure (63 mmHg and 65 mmHG, p < 0.002) than older women respectively. There was no statistical difference in the highest recorded systolic blood pressure antenatally (119 mmHg and 121 mmHg, p < 0.06) nor the highest recorded diastolic blood pressure readings between Groups 1 and 2 respectively (74 mmHg and 75 mmHg, p = 0.6). There was no difference in the rates of HDP between the groups (8.3% and 8.2%, p = 0.8) nor the rates of preeclampsia (2.8% and 2.9%, p = 1.0). Conclusion: Although adolescents have lower booking blood pressures than their older peers, their highest antenatal blood pressure readings are similar and they have the same incidence of HDP and preeclampsia.

N2  - Introduction: High blood pressure (BP) and increased BMI are linked to increased morbidity in both pregnant and non-pregnant individuals. Disturbed sleep during later pregnancy is associated with increased BP and BMI, and subsequent maternal and fetal morbidity. The association between early pregnancy aberrations in sleep parameters, such as sleep fragmentation, with blood pressure and BMI are not well established and warrant further investigation. Methods: Actigraphy-assessed sleep information was collected from pregnant women (N = 158) in early pregnancy: 10-12 weeks, 14-16 weeks and 18-20 weeks. Disturbed sleep was dichotomized as sleep duration < 7 hours, sleep eficiency (<75%), and a sleep fragmentation index > 35. Following each data collection period anthropomorphic measures, including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and BMI, were collected. Regression analyses were conducted to determine whether disturbed sleep was associated with increased blood pressure or increased BMI. Results: Women were approximately 29 years of age with an average BP = 107/67 and BMI = 26.5 at week 12. As expected BP and BMI signiicantly increased over time (p's < .05). Women with poor sleep eficiency from week 10-12 (<75%) had signiicantly elevated blood pressure at week 12 (p <.05). This difference disappeared at week 16 and 20 (p's > .05). Short sleep and sleep fragmentation via actigraphy were not associated with BP or BMI. Conclusion: Gestational hypertension and diabetes are common disorders of pregnancy which can lead to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Disturbed sleep in early pregnancy may play a role in the development of these harmful conditions via alterations in BP and weight gain. Sleep is a modiiable factor and quantifying its relation to these disorders may have important implications for clinical interventions. A more thorough evaluation of subjective and objective sleep indices and their associations with BP and BMI is needed to better understand these relationships.

N2  - Introduction: Ghana has an overwhelming maternal mortality ratio of 450 per 100,000 live births with 12% attributable to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. Research suggests that pregnant women who snore (a marker of sleep-disordered breathing) are at increased risk for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia as well as perinatal morbidity. However, this has not been previously studied in developing countries. Therefore, we hypothesized that snoring may contribute to the high prevalence of pre-eclampsia in Ghana. Methods: As a part of a larger study, Ghanaian women were recruited from maternity wards within 48-hours of delivery and interviewed about their sleep quality. Snoring was deined as a positive response to: “Did you snore loudly in the past week?”. Demographic data and pregnancy outcomes were obtained from medical records. Results: Among the 234 women approached, 232 (99%) agreed to participate. Twelve participants were excluded due to missing data in medical records, thus the inal sample size was 220. Mean age was 28.9±5.7 years, and mean parity was 1.35±1.38. Overall, 26 women (12%) had pre-eclampsia, and 53 women (24%) reported snoring. Women who snored, compared to those who did not, were signiicantly more likely to have pre-eclampsia (23% vs. 8%, p=0.005). We found no difference in gestational age at delivery (38.6±2.5 vs. 38.5±3.0 weeks; p n.s.) or birth weight (3083.27±629.56 vs. 3041.70±676.01 grams; p n.s.) of infants born to women with and without snoring. In a logistic regression, the presence of snoring was independently associated with preeclampsia, adjusted odds ratio 3.52 (95%CI 1.48-8.36, p=0.004). Conclusion: Findings are consistent with similar studies in Western countries, suggesting that snoring during pregnancy may confer a risk to maternal morbidity in Ghana. Screening for snoring may improve maternal health outcomes in developing countries where maternal morbidity rates are high.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring is a common symptom of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), a condition that is present in 4% of the general population. SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke and heart attack. There is not depth of knowledge examining the association between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. Objectives: To examine the prevalence of self reported snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between self reported snoring and the development of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) within a larger cohort from a prevalence of SDB in pregnancy study. Methods: Questionnaires were administered to pregnant women attending an outpatient's antenatal clinic. The self reported snoring is a component of the Epworth scale. Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and analyse by IBM SPSS v.20e utilising Chi-square analysis, Student T test and logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ (2009) diagnostic criteria. Results: Questionnaires were administered and outcomes collected on 2023 pregnancies. Snoring was reported by 49.2% of women. HDP affected 10.1% of the cohort, 3.3% of whom were preeclamptic. Of the pregnancies affected by HDP self reported snoring occurred in 57.7% in comparison to 43.3% who do not report snoring (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This would indicate that there is an association between self reported snoring and the development of HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential risk factors such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other co morbidities.

N2  - Introduction: Gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia affect approximately 10% of pregnancies in the United States. Emerging data suggest that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may play a role in hypertension during pregnancy. The goal of this study was to investigate the frequency of habitual snoring and objective evidence of SDB in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia were prospectively enrolled and completed self-report assessments of sleep. All women also underwent portable nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). Habitual snoring was deined as snoring at least 3 nights/ week. PSGs were scored according to AASM 2007 guidelines. Results: Thus far 29 women with gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia have enrolled. Mean gestational age at enrollment was 26.7±8.2 weeks, mean maternal age was 31.4±4.3 years, and mean BMI was 41.1±12.1kg/m2. In total 68% of the women reported habitual snoring. Mean values for key PSG variables were: apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) 15.1±20.0, respiratory disturbance index (RDI) 15.7±19.8, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 95.0±1.4%, and SpO2 nadir 88.5±4.3%. All women had an AHI≥1, 50% had an AHI≥5, 32% had AHI≥15, and 20% had an AHI≥30 (range 1.0-75.1). Compared to non-habitual snorers, women with habitual snoring had higher AHI (19.3±21.8 vs. 2.2±1.1, p=0.021) and RDI (19.6±21.8 vs. 3.7±2.0, p=0.028), lower mean SpO2 (94.6±1.1 vs. 96.0±1.4%, p=0.04), and lower SpO2 nadir (86.8±4.2% vs. 91.8±2.6%, p=0.01). Conclusion: Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are at high risk for SDB, and a signiicant proportion may have moderate-tosevere SDB. Habitual snoring among hypertensive pregnant women appears to be an excellent marker for more severe SDB. Further research, identiication of effective screening strategies, and targeted education for obstetric healthcare providers may well be warranted.

N2  - Introduction: Recent evidence has documented a relationship between short sleep duration and weight gain in adults and children. Few studies have investigated the effect of sleep during pregnancy on gestational weight gain. This study aimed to determine the association between sleep characteristics and rate of gestational weight gain. Methods: This study included 110 healthy nulliparous women at ≥ 29 weeks of gestational age recruited from a large university medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. Exclusion criteria included shift workers, current medical complications, diagnosis of sleep disorders or depression, family history of narcolepsy, or use of medications known to affect sleep. Participants wore wrist actigraphy monitors for seven continuous days to estimate sleep parameters. Sleep quality was derived from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Rate of gestational weight gain was calculated as total gestational weight gain divided by completed weeks of gestation. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the relation between sleep characteristics and rate of gestational weight gain. Results: Participants' mean age was 31.58 ± 4.40 years old with a mean gestation of 32.41 ± 2.61 weeks. Majority of participants were employed with an average of 8.58 ± 1.73 daily work hours. Sixty-three (57.27%) women experienced poor sleep quality, deined by a PSQI global score >5. Mean nocturnal sleep duration was 389.87 ± 51.54 minutes, with average sleep eficiency 80.62 ± 5.93%. Sleeping < 7 hours per 24 hours was signiicantly associated with greater rate of gestational weight gain (β=0.049; p=0.03) after controlling for maternal age, education years, daily working hours, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Conclusion: Findings from the present study suggest that short sleep duration in late pregnancy is associated with greater gestational weight gain. Prospective studies to examine the relationship between sleep duration and gestational weight gain and to understand the causal mechanisms are needed.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy has emerged as an important risk factor for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Growing evidence indicates an increased frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes as a result of gestational SDB. We hypothesize that maternal SDB during gestation will result in hypoxic/oxidative stress on fetal brains. Hypoxic status/ inlammation/oxidative response in fetal brains and newborn somatic growth were examined in maternal mouse models of SDB-associated intermittent hypoxia (IH). Methods: Timed pregnant C57BL/6 mice (between 8.5-18.5 day-postcoitus) were exposed to either IH (8% O2/20.9% O2/120s switch/12hrs during the light cycle), or intermittent air (IA) for 3 to 10 days. After gestational IA or IH exposures, pregnant mice were immediately terminated for embryo collection or transferred to room air conditions for delivery. The molecules relevant to hypoxia, inlammation, and oxidative stress were assessed by means of immunostaining, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blots. The statistical signiicance was considered as p<0.05. Results: SpO2 changed in a recurrent manner with the nadir hemoglobin oxygen saturations mainly ranging between 60% and 70%. The receptor of EPO, an indicator to augment oxygen delivery by increase of fetal erythropoiesis, was signiicantly up-regulated in fetal brain tissue experiencing maternal IH exposures. However, hypoxic cells in fetal cortex were still detectable with pimonidazole hydrochloride. Consistently, a signiicant increase of LDH A subunit but not B subunit suggested a lactate accumulation in hypoxic fetal brains. Furthermore, expressions of two pro-inlammatory genes TNF-α and COX-2, but not iNOS or nNOS, were enhanced in maternal IH-insulted fetal brains. CD68+ microglia were observed after maternal IH exposures, coinciding with increased endogenous apoptosis in multiple brain regions. More intriguingly, p67phox, the cytosolic component of NADPH oxidase, was signiicantly elevated in fetal brains subjected to maternal IH exposures. As clinical observation, somatic growth for maternal IH- exposed neonates was retarded after birth. Conclusion: The indings suggest that pro-inlammatory pathways and oxidative response may play an important role in the pathogenesis of adverse fetal outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Mounting evidence implicates habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, as an important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Little, however, is known about the determinants of habitual snoring among pregnant women. We sought to assess the prevalence of and to identify maternal characteristics associated with habitual snoring during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n=1,303) receiving prenatal care at participating clinics provided information about habitual snoring before and during pregnancy in in-person interviews completed in early pregnancy. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% conidence intervals (95% CI) from multivariable models designed to identify factors associated with snoring during pregnancy. Results: Approximately 7.3% of pregnant women reported habitual snoring during early pregnancy. The odds of habitual snoring during pregnancy was strongly related with maternal reports of habitual snoring prior to the index pregnancy (aOR=24.32; 95% CI 14.30-41.51). Advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years) (aOR=2.02; 95% CI 1.11-3.68), history of pre-gestational diabetes (aOR=3.61; 95% CI 1.07-12.2), history of mood and anxiety disorders (aOR=1.81; 95% CI 1.02-3.20), prepregnancy overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2) (aOR=2.31; 95% CI 1.41-3.77) and obesity (≥ 30 kg/m2) (aOR=2.81; 95% CI 1.44-5.48) status, as well as maternal smoking during pregnancy (aOR=2.70; 95% CI 1.17-6.26) were also statistically signiicant risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with snoring during pregnancy (aOR=2.70; 95% CI 1.17-6.26). Conclusion: We identiied several, potentially preventable, risk factors for habitual snoring during pregnancy. This may have important implications for developing strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing, promoting improved sleep hygiene, and improved pregnancy outcomes among reproductive age and pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: We sought to investigate the impact of gestational weight retention on postpartum symptoms of abnormal sleep and sleep duration among obese pregnant women. Methods: Participants in an observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI >30 kg/m2) were evaluated at two time points: at 8-20 weeks of gestation and 6-8 weeks postpartum. Evaluation for SDB included a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA), completed standardized sleep surveys: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and self-reported sleep duration. Electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Data were analyzed utilizing paired t-test and Spearman's correlation. Results: The sample consisted of 13 participants. On average these women were 27±7 years old, had a prepregnancy BMI of 36±5kg/m2. Thirty percent had chronic hypertension and 23% had pregestational diabetes. The median AHI was 0.15(range 0-2.69.), and overall the group reported a mean ESS of 9±4, FSS of 36±11 and 6.6±2 hours of sleep per night. Gestational weight gain was on average higher than the Institute of Medicine recommendations for this group (14±8kg). At the postpartum visit, three subjects had lost weight compared to their prepregnancy weight but the remaining women were heavier than their prepregnancy weight. The overall weight retention for the group was 9.6±16kg, p=0.05. During the postpartum period, there was no signiicant change in AHI (+.09±1.1, p=0.78) or ESS score (=+0.08±3, p=0.92) but there appeared to be a slight decrease in fatigue score (-6±12, p=0.06) despite a reported decrease in sleep duration (-1.3±2.3, p=0.07). Postpartum change in weight was correlated with change in sleep duration (r=0.55, p=0.04) but not the change in AHI (r=-0.1, p=.74). Conclusion: Obese pregnant women had high postpartum weight retention and decreased sleep sleep duration. Given other evidence implicating short sleep with obesity, these data suggest a potential utility for efforts to improve sleep during the post-partum period.

N2  - Introduction: Short sleep duration, a prevalent risk factor in modern society, is associated with maternal and offspring pregnancy complications (including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia). However, underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We examined the inluence of early pregnancy sleep duration on global gene expression proiles in placenta, a major source and site of action of neuroendocrine regulators that determine the course of pregnancy. Methods: Study participants (N=16) were normotensive women with uncomplicated pregnancies (i.e., not complicated by gestational diabetes or preeclampsia) sampled from a previously completed case-control study. Information on early pregnancy sleep duration was collected using in-person interviews. Global gene expression of placental samples, collected at delivery, was proiled. We used linear regression models and data mining tools to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes in relation to short sleep duration (≤6 hours). Using common sequences in promoter regions of DE genes, we identiied transcription factor (TF) binding sites and TFs that may account for co-expressions. Finally we investigated functions/functional relationships of DE genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results: A total of 112 genes (38 down- and 74 up-regulated) were DE in relation to shorter sleep duration (α=0.01). Correlation based data mining identiied additional genes (F2RL2, PDPK1, and CASP1) potentially important in relation to short sleep duration. Further, binding sites for TFs GABPA, ELK1, and MIZF were over represented in promoter regions of DE genes. DE genes participated in cardiovascular system development and function; lipid, carbohydrate, and, nucleic acid metabolism; cell-to-cell signaling; and cellular growth and proliferation. Conclusion: Short sleep duration in early pregnancy is associated with placental expression of novel (e.g. AKAP10) and previously reported candidate (e.g. GABA receptor) genes, potentially related to pregnancy complications. Similar larger studies have the potential to promote understanding of the impact of short sleep duration on pregnancy and parturition.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing and its symptoms have been associated with a multitude of fetal and maternal complications including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and possibly pre-term labour and other markers of alterations in fetal wellbeing. The disease remains underdiagnosed in the general population but likely also in pregnancy, mostly because providers do not appropriately screen for the disorder. Sleep disordered breathing may manifest differently in women, since women report more fatigue and less snoring than men do. This paper discusses typical presentations of sleep disordered breathing but also reports some less obvious presentations to help providers recognise those manifestations and screen for the disorder when warranted. Our case series describes patients with diagnoses such as chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal asthma and panic attacks, who were diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing and offered treatment with CPAP during pregnancy. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Preeclampsia is recognised as the leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Interest has been increasing recently as to the possible impact of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on the mechanisms of preeclampsia, possibly by augmenting placental hypoxia during sleep. A biomarker of preeclampsia, sFlt-1, has also come to prominence in recent years and is postulated to be a good predictor of preeclampsia as well as a strong indicator of the severity of the disease. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CPAP treatment for SDB on sFlt-1 concentrations during pregnancy. Methods: Patients were recruited from the outpatients' clinic in Campbelltown Hospital, Campbelltown, NSW in the first half of 2011. The levels of sFlt-1 in four pregnant women, with or without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and with or without SDB were measured using ELISA. Results: Women with SDB and chronic hypertension or preeclampsia had higher levels of sFlt-1 and a greater percentage increase of this marker, and CPAP treatment appeared to attenuate the rise of sFlt-1 as shown in the table below. (Table presented) Conclusion: Elevated sFlt-1 was associated with untreated SDB in those with chronic hypertension. This study provides feasibility for a larger scale study to occur, to further examine the validity of the hypothesis that CPAP treatment has a beneficial effect on sFLt-1 levels and therefore, may lower the risk and severity of preeclampsia.

N2  - Introduction: Recent data demonstrate that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common during pregnancy, particularly in pre-eclampsia, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the standard treatment for SDB although its use in pregnancy has not been well described. We examined the use and acceptability of PAP in pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women with hypertension were prospectively enrolled and underwent full home-based polysomnography (PSG), attended auto-titrating PAP trials, and home PAP therapy. Participants received intensive support from the study team to maximize PAP use. PAP compliance was deined as ≥4hrs/night for at least 3 nights/week on web-based patient compliance software. Results: Mean gestational age at enrollment for n=21 participants was 25.4±8.8 weeks, mean maternal age was 31.7±3.8 years, and mean BMI was 40.4±12.6kg/m2. Eleven (52%) women were compliant with PAP. No demographic or baseline PSG differences existed between compliant and non-compliant subjects. Mean PAP use for compliant vs. noncomplaint subjects was 67.9±49.5 vs. 30.1±38.5 days, respectively (p=0.06), and mean time between enrollment and delivery was 67.9±9 vs. 60.5±60.8 days (p=0.76). Among 10 non-compliant women, 3 discontinued therapy within 1 week. Reasons for non-compliance were: anxiety using mask (n=2); claustrophobia (n=3); face feeling hot and sticky/sweaty (n=2); too much to deal with when pregnant (n=2); air leak (n=1); multiple small children at home and chaotic schedules (n=1); and stopped use when had dizziness and struggled to re-start (n=1). Two of the 10 subjects denied being non-compliant, and one avoided all interactions with the study team. Conclusion: Treatment with PAP is challenging in pregnant women with hypertension. Even with intensive interactions with study staff, almost half of the participants discontinued therapy despite the presence of SDB. Understanding barriers to compliance in this population may improve PAP use.

N2  - Introduction: Nutritional state during pregnancy and/or lactation period in mother affects fetal growth and infant development. It is reported that extreme calorie restriction (CR) during pregnancy induce low birth weight (LBW) in newborn infant. LBW accompanied by accelerated post-natal or catch-up growth (CUG) in infant is known to increase a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, little is known about whether the LBW would affect higher brain function including sleep, anxiety and/or depression. In the present study, we investigated the effect of LBW on sleep, anxiety and/or depression in offspring mice. Methods: We irst developed a mouse LBW model by CR against pregnant female mice. Pregnancy was dated with vaginal plugs (day 0.5), then pregnant female mice were performed CR (0% for control or 50%) from day 12.5 to 18.5. After the parturition, dams were assigned to ad libitum chow. In their adulthood (8-9 weeks of old), we carried out the sleep recording and behavioral tests to evaluate the anxiety and depression level. Furthermore, we measured the monoamine concentration and mRNA level related to monoamine metabolites pathway using by microdialysis and real time RT-PCR in several brain regions respectively. Results: We found that CR mice showed LBW accompanied by CUG and a marked increase in anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared with control mice in their adulthood. Furthermore, the EEG delta/ theta ratio during NREM sleep in the CR mice was signiicantly augmented compared with the control mice over 24 hours. CR mice also showed an enhancement of rebound after 6-hour sleep deprivation. Spontaneous activity was signiicantly decreased in the irst half of the dark period in CR mice. In addition, we observed, in CR mice, an increase in 5-HIAA, a metabolite of serotonin, and a decrease in mRNA expression of Slc6a4, a serotonin transporter, after the forced swim test. Conclusion: Malnutrition during pregnancy causes LBW and affects the sleep homeostasis in adult offspring mice. An impairment of monoamine dynamics caused by alternation of metabolic state during fetal or CUG period may induce an abnormality of neurobehavioral functions in adulthood.

N2  - Objective. To study development of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during and after pregnancy, and whether RLS is related to snoring or other pregnancy-related symptoms. Design. Prospective study. Setting. Antenatal care clinics in the catchment area of Linköping university hospital, Sweden. Population. Five hundred consecutively recruited pregnant women. Methods. Sleep disturbances, including symptoms of RLS and snoring, were assessed with questionnaires in each trimester. A complementary questionnaire was sent three years after delivery to women experiencing symptoms of RLS during pregnancy. Main outcome measures. Symptoms of RLS in relation to snoring in each trimester. Results. Symptoms of RLS were reported by 17.0% of the women in the first trimester, by 27.1% in the second trimester and by 29.6% in the third trimester. Snoring in the first trimester was correlated to increased prevalence of RLS in all three trimesters (p = 0.003, 0.017 and 0.044 in the first, second and third trimester, respectively). No correlation was found between RLS and anemia, parity or body mass index. Among the women who experienced RLS, 31% still had symptoms three years after delivery. Fifty-eight per cent of those whose symptoms had disappeared stated that this happened within one month after delivery. Conclusions. Symptoms of RLS progressedmost between the first and second trimester. Women who snored in the first or second trimester of pregnancy had a higher prevalence of RLS in the third trimester, which indicates that snoring in early pregnancy might predict RLS later. Symptoms of RLS disappear quite soon after delivery, but about one-third of women with RLS during pregnancy may still have symptoms three years after childbirth. © 2012 The Authors.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by collapse of the upper airway in sleep. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) is used to quantify OSA severity. Affecting 11% of premenopausal women, OSA may alter menstrual cycles, estradiol, progesterone and 17-hydoxyprogesterone and consequently, could affect fertility. Miscarriage, the abrupt spontaneous loss of a pregnancy, is estimated to occur in 12-24% of pregnancies. Obesity is a risk factor, though frequently no etiology is found. The aim of this study was to assess whether OSA would increase the risk of having a miscarriage. Methods: 92 female patients (22-52 years) with ≥ 1 pregnancy referred to the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center Sleep Disorders Clinic were assessed with a retrospective chart review. Demographic information and miscarriage history was obtained. All included women completed a Level I polysomnogram. Using logistic regression, data were analyzed to determine if RDI and body mass index (BMI) were associated with miscarriages. Results: Given the binary nature of the variable “history of miscarriage” (i.e., “some” or “none”), this variable was coded “0” and “1” and set as the dependent variable in a multivariate logistic regression model. The two continuous independent variables were each categorized into 3 levels in order to be entered into the logistic model: 1) RDI, categorized as 0-9.99, 10-29.99, and >30, and 2.) BMI, categorized as <29.99, 30- -39.99, and >40 The results showed a signiicant prediction of miscarriage by RDI (p = 0.029) but not by BMI (p = 0.550). Conclusion: The study suggests that OSA may be strongly associated with miscarriages. Although correlated to RDI, BMI is not independently associated with miscarriages, suggesting that OSA may be the key factor in mediating miscarriage risk. The small sample size and the retrospective nature of the research, however, limit the generalizability of these indings.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalent rate of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) among Chinese pregnant women. Methods: A total of 200 pregnant women (Age 29.52 ± 5.14 years old) in hospital were interviewed before delivery (pregnant duration 35.99 ± 4.37 weeks). RLS was diagnosed by the presence of four essential RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International RLS Study Group (2003). Subjective sleep was also assessed by a questionnaire concerning whether there is dificulty falling asleep and increased number of awakening. Results: The prevalent rate of RLS was 17% (34 for RLS) among interviewed 200 pregnant women. Between the groups with RLS and with no RLS, no differences were obtained in age, pregnant weeks, and primiparous/ multiparous. But, RLS group had signiicantly lower hemoglobin level (108.71±18.97 g/L vs. 116.64±12.16 g/L, p<0.05) and an increased rate in nocturnal awakening (35.3% vs. 19.3%, p< 0.05), compared to those with no RLS. Conclusion: The prevalent rate of RLS in Chinese pregnant women appear to be relative lower (17%), compared to its prevalent rate in white race (20-34%). The individuals with RLS in pregnancy are possibly associated with potential iron deiciency and RLS may impact subjective sleep quality.

N2  - Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n. - 3) is highly important during pregnancy for optimal development and functioning of fetal neural tissue. Infant ability to organize sleep and wake states following parturition is highly associated with later developmental outcomes. The impact of maternal DHA intake on sleep organization has not been previously investigated. Aims: To examine the effect of a DHA-containing functional food consumed during pregnancy on early neurobehavioral development as assessed by infant sleep patterning in the first 48 postnatal hours. Study design: A longitudinal, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design was used. Subjects: Women (18-35. y) with no pregnancy complications consumed a cereal-based functional food (92. kcal) containing 300. mg DHA an average of 5. d/week or placebo bars (n = 27 DHA, n = 21 Placebo). The intervention began at 24. weeks gestation and continued until delivery (38-40. weeks). Outcome measures: Infant sleep/wake states were measured on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) using a pressure sensitive mattress recording respiration and body movements. Results: Using ANCOVA and controlling for ethnic variation, there were significant group differences in arousals in quiet sleep on D1 (P = 0.006) and D2 (P = 0.011) with fewer arousals in the DHA intervention group compared to the placebo group. Similarly, arousals in active sleep on D1 were significantly lower in the DHA-intervention group (P = 0.012) compared to the placebo group. Conclusions: We conclude that increased prenatal supply of dietary DHA has a beneficial impact on infant sleep organization. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Major sleep changes are common during the postpartum period. Women are also at serious risk for depression around the childbearing period. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in sleep in women at high and low risk for postpartum depression (PPD) during the postpartum period. Methods: Twenty-two women (33±4 years of age) at high (n=15) and low (n=7) risk for PPD completed 6-7 days of wrist actigraphy and a sleep diary at 2 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Women were classiied as high risk if they scored > 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or had a past history of depression based on SCID-IV. Low risk women had no family or personal history of depression. Actigraphy-derived sleep measures included time in bed, total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep eficiency, and sleep fragmentation. Results: T-tests indicated no differences between sleep measures in high and low risk women at 2 weeks postpartum. However, repeated measures ANOVA (p=.03) indicated that low risk women had a signiicantly greater increase in sleep eficiency between 2 weeks and 6 months postpartum (71%±1% to 85%±1%) relative to the high risk group (76%±1% to 81%±1%). A main effect for time was observed for sleep fragmentation; both groups experienced less fragmentation at 6 months relative to two weeks postpartum. Conclusion: Our data indicate that sleep patterns immediately postpartum are relatively similar for women at high and low risk for PPD. However, by six months postpartum, low risk women have made signiicant gains in their sleep consolidation, whereas the sleep eficiency of women improved only slightly. This suggests that vulnerability to PPD may manifest in impaired recovery of sleep consolidation. We are continuing to explore how sleep patterns in the infants of these women affect maternal sleep.

N2  - Introduction: Work demands and work stress have been associated with poor sleep quality. Our objective was to examine the association of work status and sleep in women during the third trimester of pregnancy (3tdT) and 16 weeks postpartum (16PP). Methods: As part of an ongoing study, women (n=14, ages 23-37, mean±SD=29.5±5.1 years) with a history of major depression or bipolar disorder (but not in a mood episode at 3rdT) wore wrist actigraphs and kept daily sleep diaries for one week at 3rdT and 16PP. Total sleep time (TST) and sleep eficiency (SLEFF) were estimated from actigraphy data using the Sadeh algorithm (1994) in Action-W software (AMI, NY). Full-time work was deined as working for pay at least 4 full days per week and part-time work was deined as work outside the home for pay < 4 full days. We used T-tests to compare mean TST and SLEFF between work status groups. Chi-square was used to determine whether workers were more likely to have lower sleep times than part-time or non-workers. Results: Data were available for 13 women at 3rdT and 8 women at 16PP. At 3rdT, 5 women worked full time, 3 women worked part-time, and 5 women did not work. 3rdT median TST was 412 minutes. At 3rdT, 80% of full-time workers had TST below the median TST, compared to 37.5% of part-time/non-working women (Chi-Square (df=1)=2.24, p=.14). Mean 3rdT TST and SLEFF were 392±42 minutes and 82.5±8.3% for full-time workers and 417±77 minutes and 85.1±7.6% for part-time/non-workers. Neither 3rdT TST (t=.669, p=ns), nor SLEFF (t=.580, p=ns) differed statistically as a function of work status. At 16PP, zero women worked full time, 3 worked part-time, and 5 did not work. 16PP median TST was 383 minutes. At 16PP, 100% of part-time workers had TST below the median TST, compared to 20% of non-working women (Chi-Square (df=1)=4.80, p=.03). Average 16PP TST and SLEFF were 377±7 minutes and 78.0±8.4% for part-time workers and 401±59 minutes and 80.6±6.7% for non-workers. Neither 16PP TST (t=.682, p=ns), nor SLEFF (t=.488, p=ns) differed statistically as a function of work status. Conclusion: Adequate sleep is key during the perinatal period because of the association of poor sleep with adverse health outcomes. We observed no statistically-signiicant differences in mean TST or SLEFF based on work status in this small sample. Future analyses will examine the association of work patterns and sleep in the perinatal period in a larger sample and will include other factors including parity, breastfeeding, and social support.

N2  - Introduction: Alterations in usual sleep are universal among peripartum women. Prospective mothers receive little information about realistic sleep patterns or strategies for coping. Further, minimal evidence-based information is available on coping with and promoting infant sleep in the early postpartum. The aim of this study was to trial a behaviouraleducational intervention to promote maternal and infant sleep in the irst three months. Results for maternal sleep at six weeks are reported. Methods: Forty primiparous women were assigned to either an intervention or control group. Intervention participants attended a 2-hour prenatal sleep education session, and received weekly postnatal support phone calls during weeks 1-6. Control participants attended a 1-hour prenatal general information session and received two contact-only phone calls in weeks 1-6. All mothers and babies completed 48-hours of actigraphy, sleep diaries and questionnaires at 6 and 12-weeks postpartum. Questionnaires pertaining to sleep, health, mood and psychosocial factors were completed at 35-37 weeks gestation and 12-weeks postpartum. Intervention group mothers received a comprehensive information booklet. Results: At 6-weeks postpartum there was a trend for mothers in the intervention group for less total sleep time in 24-hours than control group mothers by 17 minutes (p = .26). However, intervention group mothers' mean longest sleep episodes were 16 minutes greater (p = .26). Using the General Sleep Disturbance Scale, 37% of control mothers were classiied as poor sleepers compared to 16% of intervention mothers. The impact of sleepiness on daytime function was also greater in control mothers (30% compared to 20% in intervention group). Intervention group mothers reported higher levels of conidence in understanding and managing infant sleep, especially in relation to recognising infant cues and tired signs (t(32)=-2.29, p<.03). Conclusion: Although most differences did not reach statistical signiicance, mothers in the intervention group had longer episodes of sleep and were more conident in managing their infants sleep. These strategies warrant further investigation in a larger sample.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal maternal depression is associated with less optimal sleep development. Antidepressant medications decrease REM sleep and may also affect infant sleep state. This study examined the effects of prenatal exposure to depression and antidepressants on newborn sleep state development. Methods: As part of a larger study examining the effects of maternal depression and antidepressant exposure on infant development, maternal depression and medication use was measured prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (N=136) were categorized into four groups: controls (CON), depression/no medications (DEP), medications/remitted depression (AD/noDEP), and medications with current depression (AD+DEP). Direct observation of newborn sleep-wake states, coded in 10 second epochs, was conducted before (20 minutes) and after (40 minutes) completing a neurobehavioral examination on the 2nd and 30th days after delivery. Analyses were conducted using generalized linear models. Results: Signiicant main effects were found for age of observation and baseline to post-exam changes in active (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Signiicant interactions indicated that infants in the DEP groups had more AS in the baseline period on Day 2 (62.0%, 63.2%) than infants in the CON (48.3%) and AD/NoDEP (48.7%) groups (W=12.18, p<.007). In the post-exam period, both AD groups had higher amounts of AS (68.1%, 75.3%) compared to infants in the CON (52.8%) and DEP (41.8%) groups (W=15.18, p<.02). The amount of AS decreased over age for all groups (W=57.22, p<.001). In contrast, infants in both DEP groups had less AS at Day 30 compared to those in the CON and AD/ noMDD groups . Conclusion: Results indicate that prenatal exposure to depression may have an inluence on active sleep development in early infancy and that antidepressant treatment may alter this pattern, particularly in response to a mild stressor (handling). Results will be discussed in relation to other sleep and wake states measured and relationships to later sleep development.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy rhinitis manifests as nasal congestion, with resolution of symptoms after delivery. Eighteen to 30% of pregnant patients report symptoms of rhinitis. Pregnancy rhinitis may have an adverse effect on quality of life (QOL) and may cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which in turn may adversely affect the outcome of pregnancy. Previous examinations of the prevalence of pregnancy rhinitis during different stages of pregnancy have been inconclusive. This study aimed to determine rhinosinusitis-specific QOL during different stages of pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional observation study of patients in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) was conducted in the obstetric clinic at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada. Seventy-six low- risk pregnant patients were included in the study. Thirty-two patients were in the second trimester of pregnancy and 44 patients were in the third trimester. Results: Average item scores for the entire questionnaire were significantly higher (p = 0.041), indicating more severe impairment of QOL, in the third trimester in comparison with the second trimester. A comparison between women with and without preexisting allergic rhinitis, in both the second and the third trimesters, shows significantly higher SNOT-22 scores for the allergic group (p = 0.007). QOL was lower in the third trimester than in nonrhinosinusitis patients (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Rhinosinusitis-specific QOL is lower in the third trimester of pregnancy in comparison with the second trimester and also in comparison with nonrhinosinusitis patients. Increased awareness may enhance the QOL of pregnant patients, prevent OSA, and thereby positively influence the outcome of pregnancy. Copyright © 2012, OceanSide Publications, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: The visual scoring of active sleep in healthy newborn infants culminated in the formation of a Pediatric Task Force in 2007. We evaluated active sleep phasic eye and body movements in symptomatic neurologically compromised newborns. Methods: We reviewed simultaneous 21 channel routine scalp diurnal sleep EEG recordings (average duration 30 minutes) and prolonged nocturnal video EEG telemetry monitoring studies (average duration 60 minutes after 20:00) of all symptomatic neurologically compromised newborns admitted to the ICU from 2008-2011. Results: 26 newborns (15 males, 11 females) range 35-43 weeks gestation were studied. Chief complaints in 88% were active clinical seizures and/or CNS depression. EEG abnormalities included 54% with interictal spikes and/or electrographic seizures and 27% with nonepileptiform attentuation of amplitude. 54% of infants demonstrated MRI brain evidence of hypoxic ischemic injury, cerebral infarcts, focal hemorrhage and/or intraventricular bleeding. Only 8% of infants demonstrated phasic eye and/or body movements during either diurnal or nocturnal sleep EEG recording. Conclusion: In contrast to sleep indings in healthy newborns, the marked diminution in phasic motor activity in our group of newborn infants may be related to the presence of marked CNS compromise and not due to circadian rhythm effect.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of IL-18 in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)-induced preeclampsia (PE), by comparison of the changes of serum IL-18 levels among different groups as well as before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in pregnant women with both OSAS and PE.
METHODS: In control group there were 18 normal pregnant women with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) < 5. In simple PE group 18 pregnant PE patients with an AHI < 5 were recruited. In PE plus OSAS group 16 PE patients with coexisting OSAS were collected. CPAP treatment was performed for 1 week in 6 patients with AHI > 15 from PE plus OSAS group.Serum IL-18 levels were measured with ELISA.
RESULT: There was a significant difference in serum IL-18 levels among control group [(261 ± 95) ng/L], simple PE group [(382 ± 121) ng/L], and PE plus OSAS group [(601 ± 89) ng/L, all P < 0.001]. Following CPAP treatment, there was a significant decrease in AHI, systolic blood pressures, and serum IL-18 levels, but a significant increase in minimal SpO₂ (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that serum IL-18 levels in PE patients with OSAS were significantly elevated, which suggested that OSAS might increase the incidence of PE by enhancing inflammatory response, while CPAP treatment could effectively improve the pathological process.

N2  - Introduction: It has not been clarified whether home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) during pregnancy is useful to detect high risk pregnant women with later onset of gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). Objectives: We thought to determine the preceding features of blood pressure (BP) in HBPM before the onset of GH and PE. We especially focused on the existence of the inflection point, its level, when it occurs, and the increased speed of BP after the inflection point. We compared these features in normal pregnant women (NP), women with GH, and women with PE. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 361 singleton pregnant women, among them 100 women recruited due to high risk for GH/PH in the second trimester, participated in a couple of tertiary perinatal centers between 2008 and 2010. HBPM were measured with the validated OMRON HEM-5001(R) automated digital oscillometric sphygmomanometer (OMRON Healthcare Japan). The device was programmed to take three consecutive readings at 15-second interval. HBPM was measured twice a day, at the time of awakening and sleep, through the first to third trimester, and the average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of each gestational week (almost 42 times a week) were calculated. We defined the data of HBPM which started before 28 gestational weeks and continued until 2 weeks before the onset of GH/PE or delivery are eligible. The increased speed of systolic or diastolic BP after the inflection point was defined as (''BP at the onset in GH/PE or at delivery in NP'' - ''BP at the inflection point'') / (''Gestational weeks at the onset in GH/PE or at delivery in NP'' - ''Gestational weeks at the inflection point''). If there was no inflection point in HBPM, the increased speed of BP was defined as zero. The comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison. Data were shown as mean ± SE. Results: A total of 17 (4.7%) women developed PE, and 12 (3.3%) GH.The systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels at the inflection point in NP, GH and PE was 102.4 ± 1.3, 118.7 ± 2.9 and 117.4 ± 2.2 mm Hg, respectively (Significant pairs: NP < GH, PE); the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels at the inflection point was 59.2 ± 1.0, 74.5 ±2.0 and 73.1 ± 2.0 mm Hg, respectively (NP < GH, PE). The inflection point in NP, GH and PE occurred at 31.3 ± 0.9, 28.4 ± 1.5 and 22.3 ± 1.4 weeks, respectively (PE < GH, NP). The increased speed of SBP in NP, GH and PE was 1.2 ± 0.1, 3.0 ± 0.4 and 4.7 ± 0.7 mm Hg/wk, respectively (NP < GH, PE); the increased speed of DBP was1.1 ± 0.1, 2.1 ± 0.3 and 2.8 ± 0.4 mm Hg/wk, respectively (NP < GH, PE). Conclusion: In women with later onset of GH/PE, the BP level at the inflection points was higher than in NP. The (Figure presented) average inflection point in PE was earlier gestational weeks than in GH and NP. The average increased speed of blood pressure after the inflection point in GH/PE was faster than in NP. The preceding features of BP in HBPM may be clinically useful to detect high risk women with later onset of GH/PE.

N2  - Background: The physiological changes in peripartum may affect symptoms of depression and impact diagnostic judgments in the peripartum. The sharp fall in cortisol and CRH after childbirth suggests that the HPA axis characteristics of postpartum depression are different from melancholic depression, the latter being characterized by high cortisol levels. Methods: A modified version of the SCID was used to assess symptoms of depression and melancholic and atypical subtypes in pregnancy and the postpartum period. Secondly, we investigated the diurnal output of saliva cortisol in women with and without symptoms of depression at 7.5 weeks postpartum, and non perinatal controls.. Results: The antenatal symptom pattern (n=892 women) was different from the postnatal. The sensitivity of the symptoms ranged from 0.7% to 51.6%, and specificity from 61.3% to 99.1%. The best discriminating symptoms were motor retardation/agitation and concentration antenatally, and motor retardation/agitation, concentration and fatigue postnatally. In a subgroup of this sample (n=449) 17% of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depression at least once in pregnancy: melancholic depression (2.4%), atypical depression (4.4%), and non specified depression (10.2%). Mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern discriminated between the two groups. There was no increase in cortisol over the day, however a significant difference in diurnal pattern of cortisol between postnatally depressed and non-depressed women. Discussion: These findings suggest that perinatal depression has different associated symptoms from depression at other times. The cortisol pattern in the postnatally depressed women is similar to that reported for PTSD and atypical depression.

N2  - Introduction: Arousal from sleep during infancy is thought to be a mechanism of protection against harmful stimuli. An excessive proclivity to arouse, however, can be associated with irregular development. Although fetal sleep states have been observed by 36 weeks gestational age (GA), the concept of fetal arousal has not been fully examined. The objective of this study was to examine the emergent properties of fetal state and arousal and their relations to early infant development. Methods: The participants in this study (N=150) were part of a larger study investigating the effects of maternal depression and antidepressant use during pregnancy. Fetal ultrasound video was recorded for ifty minutes at 26-31 and 32-38 weeks GA. The recordings were coded for fetal behaviors in 10-second epochs. Factor analysis procedures revealed seven factors, accounting for 65.76% of the variance with four emerging behavioral patterns: isolated, complex, and stress-related. Complex movement patterns (CMPs) comprise arousal behaviors seen in the infant (stretch, yawn, head rotation, etc.) and were therefore examined for their relationship to later infant neurobehavioral development. Results: The frequency of CMPs was positively correlated from early to later gestation (rho=.34, p<.001). More fetal CMPs were related to more optimal standardized infant neurobehavioral scores on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) for infant self regulation (rho=.21, p<.018), attention (rho=.21, p<.02), state (rho= -.29, p<.001), and arousal (rho= -.28, p<.001). More CMPs were also related to a higher percentage of active sleep during direct observation (rho=.22, p<.03). These relationships were conirmed with generalized linear models using covariates of gestational age at birth, maternal age, race, ethnicity, and maternal depression status. Conclusion: Results suggest CMPs might indicate fetal behavioral arousals and predict infant neurobehavioral development. Future work will utilize simultaneous measures of fetal heart rate patterns and CMPs to examine relationships to 24-hour infant behavioral state.

N2  - In a preliminary study we investigated the possible association between maternal (n: 63) baby representations, anxiety and attachment pattern in prenatal period (26-34th week of pregnancy) and depression and infant self-regulation problems postnatally. The baby representations were assessed with an instrument (“representational baby expectation form” [RBEF]) developed by the authors. The instrument revealed four subscores including “positive expectations”, “negative expectations”, “clear expectations”, and “disorganized expectations”. The participants were revaluated 12-24 weeks after delivery. The RBEF negative expectation scores were positively correlated with prenatal depression, anxiety, somatic problems, and insecure attachment scores and postnatal depression scores of the mother (all measures P < 0.001). On the other hand, in RBEF where mothers reported that the baby does not resemble the baby in her dreams, RBEF negative expectations, insecure attachment and prenatal and postnatal depression scores were significantly higher. In addition, mothers of the off springs with sleep problems and/or colic reported higher prenatal negative expectation scores.

N2  - Introduction: MACS selection of apoptotic sperm render better results regarding pregnancy achievement, mainly in intrauterine insemination, as our group has previously demonstrated (F&St,2010). Sperm DNA fragmentation involvement in male infertility has also been widely analyzed, and different groups consider that only sperm samples exhibiting elevated levels of DNA fragmentation can be benefited from these sperm selection techniques in assisted reproduction (AR). To confirm this hypothesis, our aim was to describe the DNA fragmentation levels in ejaculates, swim-up (SU) and MACS for apoptotic sperm resulting fractions, to determine if the MACS improvements on ART results are linked to sperm DNA fragmentation. Material and Methods: Sperm samples (n = 41) from normozoospermic infertile males seeking for ART were prepared by SU, incubated with AnnexinV-conjugated MicroBeads, and passed through a magnetic field to retrieve unbound cells to be employed (non apoptotic, NAP), while the remaining (phosphatidilserine positive) are retained in the column (apoptotic, AP). DNA fragmentation was measured by the improved SCD test, using the Halosperm® kit. SDF was determined on samples before and after SU preparation and after MACS, in NAP and AP fractions. Results: Statistically significant differences were confirmed between AP and raw, NAP and raw and SU and raw, but not between AP, NAP and after SU, being raw 37.01% (95% CI29.38-44.65), after SU 17.90% (95% CI11.45-24.36), RF 10.87% (95% CI6.62-15.13) and UF 12.23% (95% CI7.83-16-64).Seventeen SS achieved pregnancy, and when compared, DNA fragmentation levels were comparable with those that failed, in raw 41.83% (95% CI25.62-58.04) vs.34.09% (95% CI 25.78-42.39), after SU 21.54% (95% CI9.16-33.92) vs. 15.48% (95% CI7.90-23.07), AP 10.72% (95% CI4.30-17.15) vs.10.98% (95% CI4.90-17.06) and NAP 10.90% (95% CI4.09-17.70) vs.13.18% (95% CI6.99-19.36), respectively. Conclusions: The improvement of ART results via MACS depletion of apoptotic sperm is not related to sperm DNA fragmentation, possibly by the different appearance timing of fosfatidilserine residues and fragmented DNA (a latter event), as well as other causes of DNA fragmentation different from apoptosis. MACS selection of apoptotic sperm should be recommended regardless the absence of DNA fragmentation symptoms.

N2  - Physiological rhythms entrained by the circadian clock are present in virtually all organs including those of the reproductive system. In mammals, circadian timing is driven by a 'master clock' in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that influences peripheral tissue clocks via endocrine, autonomic and behavioral cues. The molecular clock machinery comprises a network of 'clock' genes, namely Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2. These clock genes generate endogenous oscillations that drive rhythmic expression of downstream genes and thus physiological and behavioral processes. Importantly, disturbances in clock gene expression are implicated in a range of pathologies including cancer and obesity. The recent recognition that clock genes are expressed in the placenta, together with observations linking circadian disruption with compromised placental function, suggests that circadian variation may be an important component of the normal placental phenotype. In this review we consider this possibility in the context of maternal circadian physiology in pregnancy. While there is good evidence for rhythmic expression of several genes in the rodent placenta, the conventional transcriptional-translational feedback loops of the clock machinery appear less robust and coordinated. Further study is needed to elucidate the function of the placental clock genes across gestation and among different species, particularly those in which greater circadian development occurs in utero. Such studies will likely provide important insights into placental physiology and pathology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Differentiating fatigue from sleepiness is a dificult and essential component of the sleep evaluation. Sleepiness is generally associated with primary sleep disorders and sleep deprivation. However, fatigue is frequently considered multidimensional and can be associated with physical and mental exertion, chronic illness or disease, temporary conditions like pregnancy, medications, primary sleep disorders and psychological conditions. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is used to quantify daytime sleepiness but negative indings do not provide information related to the patient's perception of poor daytime functioning. Assessing anxiety, depression and fatigue may help predict whether the patient is describing a primary sleep disorder or other processes at work. We investigated whether fatigue, anxiety and depression would predict a longer mean sleep onset latency and that depression and anxiety would predict fatigue. Methods: Archival data from 67 individuals presenting with a complaint of daytime sleepiness who completed a polysomnogram and MSLT was examined. Each patient had completed a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Fatigue Assessment Scale following a nocturnal polysomnogram and prior to an MSLT. Linear and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between questionnaire data and mean sleep onset latency. Correlations were performed as part of the regression analysis. Results: Subjective questionnaire data was unable to predict objective mean sleep latency determine by the MSLT. Anxiety was the only signiicant predictor of fatigue (R square 0.351). Depression, anxiety and fatigue were all signiicantly correlated (p<0.05). Conclusion: Neither depression, anxiety, nor fatigue predicted sleepiness although they were highly related to one another. Assessing anxiety, depression and fatigue in clinic is likely to help explain negative MSLT results and help clarify the nature of fatigue for patients.

N2  - Introduction: Expiratory apneas during wakefulness are largely considered voluntary breath holding. We present 4 cases with expiratory apneas during sleep with central apnea component. Catathrenia is considered a REM parasomnia. There is no conclusive evidence published that catathrenia results from sleep apnea. Adults presenting with prolonged expiratory apneas with or without catathrenia might have implications for control of breathing. Methods: Case series and review of literature. Results: We observed 4 patients with expiratory apneas during wakefulness and sleep including one with a diagnosis of catathrenia. Expiratory apneas were noted to mostly occur between 3-5 AM, lasting 5 to 15 seconds during mid-exhalation, then a sudden exhalation followed by few deep breaths or an arousal. There were no signiicant oxygen desaturations. Two of our patients had both obstructive and central events. One of the patients underwent modiied uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, radiofrequency partial glossectomy, septoplasty and turbinoplasty and reported improvement but continued to have central apneas on a postoperative polysomnogram. Another patient also had a history of catathrenia. He had central apneas associated with expiratory pauses with and without catathrenia on polysomnogram. One of the patients had obstructive events with expiratory apneas. The last patient had these symptoms during her third trimester of pregnancy. This raises the question if prolonged expiratory apneas were a result of a central breathing disorder versus obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusion: Apneas are generally considered an inspiratory phenomenon. A combination of inspiratory and expiratory muscles and their sensory feedback is known to play an important role in rate of breathing. Although some degree of irregular breathing is normal, prolonged expiratory apneas are possibly due to failure of central control of breathing. Further studies need to be done to evaluate the association between expiratory apneas and central control of breathing. Also, further studies need to investigate catathrenia being a disorder of central breathing.

N2  - Introduction: Disrupted sleep and motor hyperactivity are common in patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Hypothalamic cells synthesizing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) contribute to the regulation of sleep and are responsive to alcohol exposure (AE). We found previously that systemic antagonism of orexin 1 receptor (ORX1R) alleviates motor hyperactivity and cognitive deicits in juvenile rats following early postnatal AE. Since MCH and ORX cells likely interact with each other, we now investigated whether the MCH system is altered following AE with or without antagonism of ORX1R. Methods: Male rats received 2.625 g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group; n=27). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group; n=17). On PD12-14, rats received daily injections of either the ORX1R antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. On PD18-19, some rats were perfused, posterior hypothalami cut into 30 μm sections and immunohistochemically processed for MCH and c-Fos. Cells were counted in 2-3 sections per animal within a deined region anchored at the fornix. ORX1R and MCH mRNAs were quantiied in the posterior hypothalami of other rats using RT-PCR. Results: Treatment with SB did not alter mRNA levels, the number of MCH cells or the percentage of MCH cells that were c-Fos-positive in the AE group. The AE rats, with or without SB, had signiicantly higher number of MCH cells per section (719±16 vs. 628±47 in S rats; p<0.04), whereas the percentage of c-Fos-positive MCH cells was not signiicantly changed. MCH mRNA levels were nearly 3-fold lower in AE than S rats, with or without SB (p<0.05), whereas ORX1R mRNA levels were not altered. Conclusion: The increased number of MCH-immunopositive cells following AE with or without antagonism of ORX1R suggests increased synthesis or retention of the peptide which, in turn, may lead to a reduced MCH mRNA expression via a negative feedback. Since MCH cells are active during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), a decreased MCH utilization is consistent with REMS deicits observed in this model of FASD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression affects 10-15% of new mothers, and can impair both self-care and infant care. Identifying women at increased risk for postpartum depression may help guide prevention efforts. Little is known about predictors for postpartum depression among women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM).We sought to identify factors associated with symptoms of postpartum depression at 6 weeks postpartum among women with recent GDM. METHODS: We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or chart diagnosis). An EPDS score 蠇9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured weight and height, measured thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data as well as information about breastfeeding and sleep. We obtained pre-pregnancy weight by self-report, and calculated pre-pregnancy BMI using measured height (BMI categorized as <25, 25-30, >30). We performed a chart review to obtain data about medical history, including insulin use during pregnancy. We used backward selection to fit multivariable logistic regression models to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Our study included 74 women (mean age 33 years ±5; 51% Caucasian, 32% African-American, 12% Asian, 5% Other; 20% Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m2±6). Measured weight at 6 weeks postpartum was 184 lbs ±40. Fifty-four percent reported annual household incomes>$75,000, while 25% reported incomes of<$25,000 annually. No cases of hypothyroidism were identified. Thirty-five percent of women studied had depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. When controlling for income level, higher pre-pregnancy BMI category (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2- 6.0) was associated with depressive symptoms. Use of insulin during pregnancy, perceived lack of sleep, breastfeeding status, and race/ethnicity were not retained in the model. Among those women with weights recorded within 5 days of delivery (N=63), gestational weight gain was 28 lbs ±16. In this group, gestational weight gain was also associated with depressive symptoms (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6 per 5 lb increment of weight gain). CONCLUSIONS: Higher pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM in this study. Gestational weight gain may also be associated with depressive symptoms in this population. If confirmed in larger studies, pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain may identify women with GDM at increased risk for postpartum depression.

N2  - We present a first child of non-consanguineous parents. During pregnancy, fetal facial dysmorphism was suspected and amniocentesis was performed. A normal female karyotype was found. The girl was born small for gestational age and presented marked nasal hypoplasia. She was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and discharged at the age of 4 weeks. The girl was readmitted to the hospital at the age of 3 months with failure to thrive. All growth parameters were below the third centile. Dysmorphic features, including depressed nasal bridge, nasal hypoplasia, asymmetric eyes and overriding toes, were observed. Diagnostic work-up revealed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, hypoplasia of the maxilla, laryngomalacia and stenosis of the left pulmonary artery. Subtle skeletal anomalies were found on the Xrays. CGH-array was performed with the 44k Agilent array. The results showed deletion of the region for a well-known microdeletion syndrome, which was clinically not suspected. With time, the girl developped mild developmental delay and the values of some laboratory markers are in accordance with what is seen in the microdeletion syndrome. However, a second monogenic condition is also present and the sum of these two syndromes gives rise to a particular phenotype.

N2  - In recent years the number of functional neuroimaging studies on adolescence has exploded. These studies have led to important new insights about the relation between functional brain development and behavior. However, special consideration is warranted when working with adolescents. In this review, we review variables, including pubertal stage, sleep patterns and pregnancy, which are particularly relevant for developmental cognitive neuroscience studies involving adolescents. Consideration of the unique challenges associated with adolescence will help the growing field of developmental neuroimaging standardize procedures and will eventually facilitate interpretation across studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - As pregnancy period progresses in the minds of candidate parents, fantasies, dreams, concerns, ideals about the baby emerge. We investigated the possible association between maternal (n: 63) baby representations, anxiety and attachment pattern in prenatal period (26-34th week of pregnancy) and depression and infant self-regulation problems postnatally. The baby representations were assessed with an instrument (“representational baby expectation form” [RBEF]) developed by the authors. The instrument revealed four subscores including “positive expactations”, “negative expactations”, “clear expactations”, and “dysorganized expectations”. The participants were re-evaluated 12-24 weeks after delivery. In addition to maternal depression instruments and infantile regulation assessments, the mothers completed a “representational baby accordance form” [RBAF] which includes similar questions with the RBEF. The RBEF negative expactation scores were positively correlated with prenatal depression, anxiety, somatic problems, and insecure attachment scores and postnatal depression scores of the mother (all measures P < 0.001). In addition, mothers of the offsprings with sleep problems and/or colic reported higher prenatal negative expactation scores. These results reveal that two months before the childbirth, higher scores of negative expactations in terms of baby representations may indicate a higher risk of postpartum depression and infantile self-regulation problems.

N2  - A high percentage of the division's doctors and employees work at night to guarantee urgent assistance and diagnostic services to patients. Night work is not recommended for persons with rather serious case histories due to the disruption of circadian rhythms or the increased workload required of certain operators during nighttime hours. All of the evaluations of health operators with a limited capacity to work on the night shift in our hospital were analysed, except for female workers restricted from night work during pregnancy or Puerperium, as provisioned by the regulation that protects working mothers. Forty-two cases were considered (six physicians and 36 operators in the division) out of a total of 2676 employees assigned to night work and the conditions that led to the formulation of the decision are divided as follows: 16 Mental disturbances currently subject to treatment (depression, post-traumatic anxiety disorder, primary insomnia⋯), 8 Tumours (breast, colon, Ewing Sarcoma), 7 Neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, myasthenia), 6 Cardiovascular disease (previous IMA; arrhythmias, arterial hypertension not controlled by theraphy) and 5 others patologies (total 45) The cases will be analysed in detail with an analysis of the characteristics of the exempt group of workers and with reference to the temporary or indefinite nature of the exemption. © PI-ME, Pavia 2012.

It is a well-known fact that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used during pregnancy increase the rate of congenital malformations. However, there is not enough information about the electrophysiological effects of AEDs. In this study, 127 children whose mothers have epilepsyand 33 children whose mothers are healthy, were included. Twenty nine mothers did not use AEDs whereas 98 patients used AEDs during their pregnancy. Demographic features of both mothers and children, as well as epilepsy characteristics of mothers are recorded. The EEG examinations were done awake and/or during sleep. The children whose mothers have epilepsy had higher rate of EEG abnormalities and the ratio was statistically significant. EEG abnormalities were higher in the children whose mothers had polytherapy (%50) than in the group with monotherapy (%31,7). EEG abnormalities were mostly seen (%47) in children whose mothers used VPA. Children born of patients with epilepsy who did not use folic acid with AEDs had a higher rate of EEG abnormalities and this ratio was statistically significant. It was also observed that children, whose mothers have generalized EEG abnormalities, have generalized EEG abnormalities more frequently. It is necessary to examine patients who used AEDs during pregnancy not only in terms of congenital malformations but also electrophysiological effects and to advise taking folic acid. Examining children who are born under the effect of AEDs electrophysiologically in the years following their birth may provide predictions about whether the effects of AEDs.

N2  - The association between light exposure at night and sex hormone levels in utero has scarcely reported. We assessed the associations between sleep duration or being awake in the late evening hours, which can be as indicator of light exposure at night, and the maternal and umbilical blood hormone levels during pregnancy and at delivery among Japanese women. The data for 236 women and their newborns who visited a maternal clinic in Gifu, Japan, between May 2000 and October 2001 were analyzed. Maternal blood samples were obtained at approximately the 10th weeks, 29th weeks of gestation, and at delivery. Umbilical cord artery blood was immediately drawn after birth. Information for sleep during pregnancy was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. The levels of estradiol and testosterone were measured using radioimmunoassay. Maternal serum testosterone level in the 10th week was higher among those who were awake at or after 1:00 a.m. than among those who were asleep at that time (P = 0.032). Maternal estradiol level in the 29th week was inversely associated with sleep duration on weekends (P = 0.043). Umbilical testosterone level at delivery inversely correlated with sleep duration on weekdays (P = 0.030). These associations were somewhat stronger among mothers with female offspring than those with male offspring. These results suggested that exposure to light at night might increase sex hormone levels during pregnancy. © The Japan Endocrine Society.

N2  - Objective: Mounting evidence implicate short and long sleep duration as risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Little is known about the determinants of short and long sleep duration. We sought to identify maternal characteristics associated with early pregnancy short and long sleep duration. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 1,329) receiving prenatal care at participating clinics provided information about sleep duration before and during pregnancy during in-person interviews that were completed in early pregnancy. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from multivariable models designed to identify factors associated with short (≤6 h) and long sleep (≥9 h) duration, respectively. Results: Approximately 18.9% of pregnant women reported sleeping ≤6 h, and 25.3% of women reported sleeping ≥9 h/night during early pregnancy. Maternal Non-Hispanic African-American race/ethnicity (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.2-13.0), history of migraines (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3), elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1-2.6), and pre-pregnancy obesity (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1) were associated with short sleep duration. Factors associated with long sleep duration included maternal age <25 years (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.2-8.4), Medicaid payment status (OR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.1-10.2), nulliparity (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2), and physical inactivity during pregnancy (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.0). Conclusions: Several maternal characteristics were associated with short and long sleep duration during early pregnancy. Our results have important implications for developing strategies aimed at promoting improved sleep hygiene, health and pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disorders have been associated with cardiovascular complications and preterm birth (PTB). Causal mechanisms underlying these associations have yet to be elucidated, though evidence suggest that insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations known to contribute to placental abruption (PA), an important determinant of PTB. We examined associations of PA with sleep duration and complaint of vital exhaustion among Peruvian women. Methods: The study included 164 PA cases and 160 controls. Information about habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (≤6, 7-8 and ≥9 h); and frequency of feeling exhausted (never, monthly, weekly, and daily). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased odds of PA. The ORs for PA in relation to short (≤6 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration were 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1-3.7) and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.1), compared with normal sleep duration (7-8 h). Complaints of vital exhaustion were positively associated with PA (Ptrend = 0.001). Positive associations of PA risk with short and long sleep durations were evident regardless of the presence or absence of vital exhaustion complaints. Conclusion: Our findings support recent calls for expanded efforts to study and address sleep habits and disorders among pregnant women.

N2  - It has recently been reported that a short duration of sleep in late pregnancy was associated with increased risk of stillbirth and preterm birth, but this literature may be subject to publication bias and the findings needs confirmation. We used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort to examine if sleep duration and frequency of sleep disruptions in late pregnancy were associated with stillbirth and preterm delivery. Participants were 79,339 singletons pregnancies enrolled in 1996-2002. Data was analyzed using Cox regression and we performed a subjective Bayesian analysis with two informative priors: A “skeptical prior” reflecting publication bias, and an “associational prior” reflecting the published associations. In the Danish National Birth Cohort the hazard ratio of stillbirth was 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.99) for sleeping 6-7 hours compared to sleeping 8-9 hours. The hazard ratio for preterm birth was 1.26 (0.99-1.59) for sleeping less than 6 hours a day and 1.13 (1.03-1.23) for sleeping 10+ hours a day, again compared to sleeping 8-9 hours. Experiencing sleep disruptions several times a week was associated with a lower rate of stillbirth, but was not associated with preterm birth. Both posterior estimates suggested lower rate of stillbirth among women with frequent disruptions of sleep and higher rate of preterm birth among women sleeping less than 6 or more than 9 hours a day. From these findings we cannot tell whether sleep disruptions and short/long sleep duration is a risk factor or a risk marker for these outcomes.

N2  - Objective: While prospective cohort studies have consistently shown associations of short and long sleep duration with pregnancy complications and outcomes, little is known about the relationship between sleep duration and total pregnancy weight gain (PWG). We evaluated relationships of maternal sleep duration during early pregnancy with total pregnancy weight gain (PWG) and the rate of PWG during 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Methods: We collected information about sleep duration from 3,402 women interviewed during early pregnancy, and abstracted height and weight measures from medical records. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), total PWG, and the rate of PWG in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters were categorized based on Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for inadequate and excessive PWG in relation to sleep duration were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Overall, 56.1% of the cohort had excessive total PWG. The risk of excessive PWG was increased among women who reported sleeping ≤5 h/night compared with those reporting 9 h/night of sleep during early pregnancy (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.07-2.82). Women who reported sleeping ≥10 h/night, compared with the referent group (9 h/ night) were also more likely to have inadequate PWG (OR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.01-1.74). Short (≤5 h/night) sleep durations was associated with inadequate (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.06-6.97) and excessive (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.25-4.09) rates of PWG during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Conclusions: Further work is needed to explore mechanisms by which sleep habits influence maternal energy balance during pregnancy.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, women in their third trimester of pregnancy underwent full overnight home PSG using the 22-channel MediPalm system and the Watch-PAT 200 device. PSGs were scored by a blinded, experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software. Results: A total of 31 pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 ± 7.1 years; mean gestational age was 33.4 ± 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 ± 8.1 kg/m2; 39% of women were nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001); respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for AHI ≥ 5 and RDI ≥ 10 were 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity increased. Conclusions: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea, defined as AHI ≥ 5 on full PSG. Watch-PAT may overestimate RDI somewhat, especially at high RDI values.

N2  - Accumulating evidence suggests that disrupted sleep is significantly associated with poor quality of life and faster progression to mortality among cancer patients. However, studies on sleep related issues in cancer survivors are sparse. Therefore, we conducted this analysis to address this gap using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008. Our analytical population was participants who provided sleep duration data at the time of survey. After the exclusion of those who were pregnant, less than 20 years old, or taking sleep medication, we identified 439 individuals with cancer and 7,518 cancer free individuals. Cases were self-reported diagnosis by their physicians or other health professionals. We limited cancer survivors to those who had been diagnosed with cancer more than 3 years prior to the survey. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to compare sleep duration of cancer survivors with comparison group. After adjusting for potential confounding variables (age,race/ethnicity, physical activity, body mass index,and survey time) cancer survivors had similar sleep duration as individuals without cancers. However, prostate cancer survivors were more likely to sleep less than 7 hours than cancer free individuals (Odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.56 (0.93, 2.56)), although the association was marginally significant. Post-hoc analyses including cancer survivors diagnosed within 3 years of the survey did not change the results appreciably. The new findings that prostate cancer survivors experience shorter sleep duration should be confirmed by other studies.

N2  - The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006), intrauterine growth retardation (p <0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01), pregnancy discomforts (p = 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p < 0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable exercise option. Copyright © 2012 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Statement of problem: Few studies have examined the influence of physical activity on sleep among pregnant women. To examine the potential sleep-enhancing benefits of physical activity among pregnant women and to therefore see if physical activity may serve as a non-pharmacological treatment for sleep disturbances during pregnancy, this study's purpose was to examine the association between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep among a nationally representative sample of U.S. pregnant women. Methods: Data from the National Health and Examination Survey 2005-2006 was used for the present study. 138 pregnant women who had worn an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer on the right hip for at least 4 days for a minimum of 10 h per day were identified. Questions on sleep were asked during the household interview. Results: Of the 22 sleeping-related parameters assessed, physical activity was only associated with two. After controlling for depression, gestation, income and parity, for every 1-min increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, pregnant women were 17% less likely to have difficulty finishing a meal because of being tired or sleepy (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.98-1.38, p = 0.06). Conclusion: Our data suggests a weak relationship between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep. Additional research using a larger sample of pregnant women, as well as experimental studies, are needed to determine the extent to which physical activity may assist in improving sleeping-related parameters among pregnant women. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant and postpartum women, to estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing, the international restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0. Six hundred eighty-nine women completed sleep surveys. The overall percentage of women with very poor sleep quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 80.7%, 50.5%, 34.0% and 29.5%, respectively, and all of three parameters became increased as pregnancy progressed and after delivery (p 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were 25.4% and 19.4%. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean pregnant and postpartum women, and increase significantly as pregnancy progresses and after delivery. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Objective: The present study was designed to investigate restless legs syndrome (RLS) frequency and severity during pregnancy and to determine RLS outcomes in pregnant women. Background: Restless legs syndrome can be secondary to pregnancy and it is more common in pregnant women than the general population. However, its outcome during pregnancy and at the time of delivery is not well known. Methods: Four hundred forty-three consecutive pregnant women who admitted for delivery in two teaching hospitals were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. All patients underwent a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire including medical history within 2 days after parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established based upon the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. The severity of the RLS was investigated through the self-administered International RLS Rating Scale. Results: Seventy-nine subjects (17.8%) (mean age 26.9 ± 5.1 years) met the RLS diagnostic criteria and most of them (74.7%) had moderate severity of RLS. Mean RLS duration was 5.0 ± 7.6 months and 10 cases (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Insomnia, early awaking, and daytime sleepiness were significantly more common among RLS+ women (P=0.0001). The rate of cesarean section was significantly higher in women with RLS than others (58.2% Vs 44.5%, P=0.027). In RLS+ group, pregnancy duration was longer and neonatal weight was higher than RLS negative women (P=0.003 and P=0.016, respectively). There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of age, pregnancy numbers, Folate and Iron therapy during pregnancy, and hemoglobin level before delivery. Conclusions: RLS with moderate severity is a common finding during pregnancy and it is associated with sleep disturbances and increased risk of cesarean section among pregnant women.

N2  - Background: Data shows sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases in pregnancy and is related to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Simple assessments can identify those at high risk of SDB, yet their usefulness in identifying risk for adverse outcomes in pregnancy is unknown. We examined the associations between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and non-invasive markers of SDB. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of all admissions to the obstetric suite at an academic, tertiary referral center from September 2005 to December 2010. Demographic variables, diagnosis codes for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, BMI, MMP (Modified Mallampatti) scores, and Neck Circumference (NC) were extracted from medical records. Women were at risk of SDB if they had a MMP III/ IV and/or NC≥40cm. Logistic regression models determined which airway variables were independent predictors for the outcomes (gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia). The C-statistic was used to measure the area under the curve of a receiver operator characteristic curve. This allows determination of the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen disease-positive subject higher than a disease negative subject. Results: 17,083 medical records were identified. Complete airway data was available in 10,973 subjects (64%). of the sample. Women with MMP III/IV were more likely to report snoring than women with MMP I/II (25.8% vs. 16.9%; p< 0.001); similarly those with NC ≥40 cm were more likely to report snoring than those without (46.3% vs. 17.4%; p< 0.001). Women with MMP III/IV, compared to those without, were more likely to have pre-eclampsia (10.3% vs. 5.2%, p< 0.001). Women with NC ≥40cm, compared to those without, were more likely to have gestational hypertension (4.8% vs. 2.1%, p< 0.001) and pre-clampsia (10.9% vs. 4.4%, p< 0.001). Using the C-statistic, for the total sample (n=10,973), the model for gestational hypertension, including the independently associated variables of obesity, and thick/obese neck was 0.62; for pre-eclampsia, the independent variables were thick/obese neck, MMP score III/IV, and obesity, C statistic of 0.61. In the subgroup of women with neck circumference measures (n=2733), the above models were repeated with minimal change. Conclusion: Non-invasive markers of SDB are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Simple non-invasive airway assessments may have clinical utility in the obstetric setting.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia and sleep fragmentation. Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to treatment. This review discusses OSA and summarizes the current literature linking OSA with adverse perinatal outcomes. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The impact of ovarian hormones on hamster ultradian rhythms (URs) is unknown. We concurrently monitored URs and circadian rhythms (CRs) of home cage locomotor activity during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation of Syrian hamsters. URs with a mean period of 4-5 h were evident during the dark phase in more than 90% of females on days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle but were significantly less prevalent on cycle days 3 and 4. The period of the UR did not vary as a function of estrous cycle stage, but at all stages, the UR period was longer in the dark than the light phase. The UR acrophase occurred significantly earlier on cycle day 4 than on days 1 and 2, and UR robustness and amplitude were reduced on days 3 and 4. Robustness, mesor, and amplitude of CRs were greater during cycle days 3 and 4; timing of the CR acrophase was delayed on day 4 relative to all other cycle days. Effects of the estrous cycle on URs were evident only during the dark phase. The proportion of hamsters displaying dark phase URs increased significantly during early and late gestation and decreased during lactation. Pregnancy significantly increased UR complexity, robustness, and amplitude. The emergence of URs over gestation was paralleled by decrements in the robustness and amplitude of CRs, which also were absent in a significant proportion of dams during lactation but re-emerged at weaning of litters. The changing endocrine profile of the estrous cycle, hormonal dynamics of pregnancy and lactation, and nursing demands placed on dams are each associated with alterations in the expression of ultradian and circadian locomotor rhythms. Diminution of CRs and augmentation of URs may afford greater behavioral flexibility during life stages when interactions with mates and offspring are less predictable. © 2012 The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare clinical features and associated factors of idiopathic and secondary restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnant women. Background: RLS is a common movement disorder which can be classified based on the presence of associated conditions as idiopathic or secondary. RLS can be secondary to pregnancy, although idiopathic forms are seen in pregnant women. However, there are limited comparative data about these two forms of RLS during pregnancy. Methods: Over a period of three months, 443 women who admitted for delivery were screened for RLS using four diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. 79 subjects with RLS were consecutively enrolled in the present study. All of them were interviewed for medical history and complaints during pregnancy and responded to self-administered International RLS Rating Scale. Results: 10 subjects (12.9%) out of 79 pregnant women with RLS had idiopathic form and their mean age was significantly higher than patients with secondary RLS (30.6 ± 7.3 years Vs 26.4 ± 4.6 years, P=0.026). Women with secondary RLS showed statistically significant (P=0.004) lower levels of hemoglobin (12.2 ± 1.4 mg/dl) than idiopathic RLS subjects (12.4 ± 0.4 mg/dl). Compared to women with secondary RLS, Sleep duration in pregnancy and birth weight of neonates were significantly decreased in idiopathic RLS group (P=0.006 and P=0.039, respectively), while RLS severity score was similar in both groups. No significant differences were observed between the two groups on the positive family history of RLS, parity, duration of pregnancy, or rate of cesarean section. Conclusions: The data suggest that Idiopathic RLS has more negative impact on sleep during pregnancy and neonatal birth weight compare to secondary RLS. Careful screening and effective treatment of idiopathic RLS before pregnancy is recommended to limit these disturbances.

N2  - We report the management of a patient who suffers from narcolepsy and cataplexy who presented to the clinic at 14 weeks of gestation. Her symptoms were resistant to Modafonil but controlled with clomipramine and amphetamine. The mode of delivery for these patients is scarce in the literature. We discuss some issues surrounding the antenatal management and counselling regarding mode of delivery and postpartum care. Case Report: A 44 year old G3 Para1 (Previous normal vaginal delivery at term) with a past history of Narcolepsy and Cataplexy was referred to the combined medical/obstetrics antenatal clinic at 14 weeks gestation. Narcolepsy and cataplexy was diagnosed in January 2005 with tissue typing and she was managed by a neurologist. Patient had developed day time sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hallucination on going to sleep. Cataplexy was controlled with clomipramine and amphetamine (Dexamphetamine) was started in Nov 2010 when her symptoms worsened. Symptoms were resistant to Modafonil. Patient was managed in conjunction with the Neurologist and referral was made to the anaesthetist and paediatric alert was made in view of amphetamine use in early pregnancy. Patient continued to make progress and dose of dexamphetamine reduced in the course of the pregnancy and eventually discontinued at 24 weeks of gestation. She was reviewed by the anaesthetist at about 36 weeks of gestation who had concerns regarding option of analgesia and mode of delivery if she presents in labour. Patient was seen by the Consultant Obstetrician and after weighing the benefits and risks and with the patient's agreement opted for delivery by an elective caesarean section. The caesarean section was uneventful and was done under spinal analgesia. A female baby weighing 2.84 kg was delivered with Apgar's score 7, 10, 10 at 1, 5 and 10th min of life. Cord gases were pH (A) 7.361 BE-6.1, pH (V) 7.383 BE-2.8. Baby cried spontaneously after birth needing little resuscitation. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) scoring was not required for baby. The postnatal recovery was uneventful.

N2  - Fetal movement is one index of fetal well-being. We designed and built a new recorder based on fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM). The FMAM recorder has a newly developed, capacitive acceleration sensor that can detect the oscillations of the maternal abdominal wall caused by fetal movements. In this study, the recorder was examined for its suitability for long-term home monitoring of fetal movement by pregnant women themselves. Experiment I: Fourteen pregnant women underwent 45 examinations in the laboratory at gestational 20-39 weeks. We simultaneously recorded fetal movement as detected by the recorder, ultrasonography, and maternal perception, and then calculated agreement among the three methods. We evaluated agreement using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Agreement for gross fetal movement as detected by FMAM and ultrasonography was substantial or almost perfect, while agreement between maternal perception and ultrasonography was moderate or substantial. Experiment II: Six pregnant women undertook 53 experiments at home by themselves. Fetal movement during maternal nocturnal sleep was successfully recorded 50 out of 53 times at home. In conclusion, there was high agreement for gross fetal movement between FMAM and ultrasonography. The recorder is promising for objective, accurate, and long-term home monitoring of gross fetal movement by pregnant women themselves. © 2011 IPEM.

N2  - Objective: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) needs lifelong anti-epileptic drug treatment. Of various drugs, valproate effectively treats all types of seizures seen in JME. A teratogenic effect, specifically increased risk of neural tube defects (NTD), is a deterring factor for valproate use in the childbearing years. In addition, there is concern regarding the effects of valproate on male fertility. Clonazepam controls only the myoclonic jerks, leaving patients still susceptible to generalized seizures, which mostly occur in the morning after sleep deprivation. Design: Non-randomised control trial. Method: Between January 2003 and April 2008, 15 newly diagnosed JME patients (nine girls, six boys) were given clonazepam (1.0-4.0mg) at bedtime, and were compared to 16 patients on valproate treatment. All were advised to avoid sleep deprivation. Their seizure frequency was then compared. Results: This study showed that 100% of patients in the clonazepam group had full control of their myoclonic jerks. Four patients (26.6%) had generalized seizures, provoked by sleep deprivation. The remaining 11 patients (73.4%) were free of myoclonic and generalized seizures. In the control group, two (12.5%), had episodes of breakthrough, sleep-deprived, generalized seizures and the remaining 14 patients (87.5%) were in remission. There was no significant difference in seizure control between both groups. Clonazepam side effects were limited to mild to moderate drowsiness in the morning, eliminated by giving the dose earlier at night. Conclusion: The study suggests that if JME patients avoid sleep deprivation, they can be treated with clonazepam alone in preference to valproate.

N2  - Sleep disruption has been suggested to contribute to postpartum mood, but few studies have explored differences in this relationship between nulliparous and multiparous mothers. This study compared the interaction of sleep and mood as a function of parity. Thirty-five nulliparous and 34 multiparous mothers completed questionnaires on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within 2 weeks postpartum. Mood and objective sleep were better in multiparas than in nulliparas after delivery. However, other than a stronger association between subjective sleep and stress in nulliparous mothers, the relationship between sleep and mood did not differ significantly between the two groups. This suggests that parity might play only a limited role in the interaction between sleep and mood during the immediate postpartum period. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Objective: To explore the factors relating to parenting stress at night among the mothers of preterm infants. Design: Prospective cohort study. Method: The participants were 24 preterm and 33 full-term infants with a mean gestational age of 29 (SD 4) weeks (range: 22-36wks) and 39 (SD 1) weeks (range: 37-41wks), respectively.The infant'smean corrected age was 13months 21days (SD 4mo 15d). The degree of parenting stress at night was measured by a self-reported questionnaire (high score=high stress level). Infant's sleep measures were obtained through actigraphs (Micro-mini RC, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York, USA). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the factors affecting parenting stress at night in relation to infants' sleep status. Results: The mean scores of parenting stress at night were 2.46 (SD 1.0) in preterm and 1.81 (SD 0.9) in full-term infants, with significantly higher score in the preterm group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between infant sleep measures in the two groups. The significant factors identified were gestational weeks, wake after sleep onset and maternal nocturnal sleep time (accounted for 29% of maternal parenting stress at night). Conclusion: The sleep measures did not show a significant difference between the two groups, as the inclusion criteria of preterm infants was up to 36weeks gestation. Nevertheless, the most important factor relating to parenting stress at night was preterm birth. Intervention aiming to better nocturnal sleep of infant could be helpful for maternal parenting stress at night.

N2  - Aim. To study pre- and postsurgical neuro-cognitive functions and epileptic outcome in a child with a refractory epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves during sleep (CSWS), secondary to post-haemorrhagic three-ventricular dilatation and glyotic thalamic lesion, successfully treated by hemispherotomy. Case report.We present a 6-year-old child with a family history negative for seizures or neurological disease. At 34 gestation weeks (GWs), cerebral ventriculomegalywas detected. Delivery occurred at 37.5 GWs, without perinatal distress. NeonatalMRshowed bilateral ventriculomegaly (right>left), an extensive brain periventricular parenchymal loss involving right parietal and frontal lobes and including homolateral basal ganglia and thalamus. During the first months of life, neurological examination revealed asymmetric spontaneous motility with best performances on the right side. After 6 months of life, a motor developmental delay with a reduction of motor abilities of the left limb was observed. A definite left hemiparesis was diagnosed at 18 months. Sequential developmental assessment with the Griffiths Scales performed at 15, 19, and 33 months showed values in the normal range for all the subscales except that of locomotor. The first febrile focal seizure with secondary generalisation occurred at 25 months. From the age of 3 years and 6 months, the child presented with rare left motor seizures and daily atypical absences, while the EEG study showed the onset and a progressive increase of paroxysmal activity leading to a CSWS pattern, involving 85% of slow sleep. Despite antiepileptic drugs, as monotherapy and in different combinations, seizures and CSWS persisted, associated with a progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. At 6 years, neurological examination showed mild left hypertonia and hyper-reflexia with asymmetric strength (right>left), more evident on the upper limb, left hand mirror movements, which did not prevent the functional use of both hands, left hypohaestesia, and homonymous hemianopia. Cognitive evaluation showed mild mental retardation (IQ: 60) and behavioural disorders with dramatic effects on school activities and family life. A presurgical sensory-motor functional study was performed specifically in order to ascertain the side of functional motor control and evaluate the potential damage of hemispherectomy. A non-invasive neurofunctional study consisted of motor evoked potentials and motor area mapping, and passive functional MRI in order to evaluate sensory-motor functional connectivity, as well as cortical-spinal tractography. The results of the study suggested an ipsilateral motor control of the left arm. At the age of 6 years, right peri-insular hemispherotomia was performed without surgical complications. After surgery, a full control of seizures and an immediate disappearance of CSWSoccurred, withoutworsening of motor function. Neuropsychological evaluationshowedalso a progressive improvement of cognitive functions (attention, memory, and visuo-perceptive functions). Conclusion. In our case, the indication of hemispherotomy to treat the epileptic disorder was not straightforward due to the presence of bilateral lesion, prevalent on the right side, with good function of the affected left hand. The results of an extensive noninvasive sensory-motor functional study, suggesting bilateral control of motor function by the healthy hemisphere, have helped us to choose the surgical option, the effectiveness and safety of which appear to be confirmed by postsurgical follow-up.

N2  - Background: Studies of children who undergo major non-cardiac surgery in the neonatal period are needed so that subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment can be better understood. Objective:It was the aim of our study to describe the influence of analgesic and sedative medication on the predominant background pattern and the development of sleep-wake cycling (SWC), as measured on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), in newborn infants born ≥32 weeks' gestation after major non-cardiac surgery. Methods:This prospective study included infants ≥32+0 weeks' gestation admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne who were undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. Data on morphine and midazolam given after surgery were recorded and the BrainZ Monitor was applied post-operatively. The maximum levels of morphine and midazolam were assessed as predictors of time to aEEG outcomes using linear regression. Results: Forty-seven eligible infants were included. Emergence of SWC was observed at a mean of 13 h after surgery. The maximum dose of morphine or midazolam was not predictive of time to either any or developed SWC. Conclusions: Despite high doses of morphine and midazolam, SWC was observed on aEEG in neonates ≥32 weeks' gestational age soon after major non-cardiac surgery. The aEEG background pattern was not affected by the maximum dose of either morphine or midazolam. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG.

N2  - A population-based questionnaire study of 2,816 women was conducted in week 32 of pregnancy to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for insomnia and depressive symptoms. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms. The prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9%, and mean BIS score 17.5 (SD = 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 10) was 14.6%. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with sleep durations <5 or >10 hours, sleep efficiency <75%, daytime impairment, and long sleep onset latency. Pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain was associated with insomnia, but not with depressive symptoms. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The aim of this study report is to present nose deformation and thumb atrophy case that results from thumb sucking habit which has not been published previously in the literature. R.?. a 21 years old patient was admitted to the hospital with anxiety symptoms. He was diagnosed to have adaptive disorder and antisocial personality disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. His mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia while in pregnancy period. R.?. didn't take breastfeeding because of the adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs. He has been sucking his thumb after 2 years old and this behavior has continued during the adult ages. Thumb sucking was related with emotional deprivation especially in increasing anxiety, fear, worry and stressful life events. It could reveal during the sleep latency and in the evening time, sometimes he indicates that he sleeps with thumb sucking. While hospitalized, he was consulted with ear-nose-throat and dental treatment departments. At paranasal sinus CT, the right side of frontal sinus, mucous membrane of the ethmoid cells were seen to become thick and nasal septum was seen as deviated to left side. After that, the patient was referred to Dentistry Department for breaking his habit. There was also a significant thumb atrophy at his left hand and palatal dome (0.8 cm). Finger sucking can result in deformities of the fingers as well as the deformities well-known in orthodontics. Besides skin changes resulting from chronic irritation, more serious deformities in position or function of fingers may occur. In our case, we also indicated the left hand thumb deformities, palatal doming, nasal septal deformities.

N2  - Lateral meningocele Syndrome is a rare disorder, described by Lehamn et al. and subsequently reported in less than ten patients. These patients present some distinctive craniofacial features and skeletal abnormalities in addition to the multiple lateral meningoceles, suggesting a connective tissue disorder. Autosomal dominant inheritance was suggested in one single family. We present a case of a 5 year old male, born from healthy parents. The pregnancy was complicated by a cystic hygroma diagnosed at 12 weeks of gestation. He was delivered at full term by elective cesarean section, and Apgar scores were 8 at the first minute and 10 at the fifth minute. Anthropometric measures were adequate for gestational age. He was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for presenting general hypotonia and feeding difficulties. Additionally he had bilateral ptosis, microretrognathia, low-set hears and an empty scrotum. Cardiologic observation showed a bicuspid aortic valve. At two years of age he was diagnosed with severe upper airway obstruction, sleep apnea and conductive hearing loss due to adenoid and tonsil hypertrophy. He underwent adenoidectomy as well as surgical correction of retrognathia. Ophthalmologic observation showed a bilateral restriction in upward gaze. At the age of five, he had several dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, telecanthus, downslanting palpebral fissures and bilateral ptosis, low-set hears, micrognathia with a high and narrow palate and dental crowding. Skin keloid scarring from surgical interventions and joint laxity were also apparent. The patient height was 107.5cm (P25) and weight was 20.8 kg (P50). He had a mild mental retardation and a history of gross motor delay. He had no features of neurofibromatosis, Marfan or Hajdu-Cheney syndromes. Cerebral and spine magnetic resonance showed scalopping of vertebrae and multiple thoracic, lumbar and sacral bilateral meningoceles. No hypoplasia of C1 or any pathological cerebral anomalies were observed. Abdominal and renal ultrasound exams showed no abnormalities. Electromyography and muscle biopsy were normal. Routine chromosome analyses were performed and had normal results. The findings of a bicuspid aortic valve in association with joint laxity and keloid scarring support the hypothesis of a connective tissue basis for this disorder and further expand the phenotype.

N2  - Background: Infants of diabetic mother often show postnatal anomalies of the neurodevelopment. However there are no neurophysiologic studies regarding the immediate neonatal period of life. These studies may help to generalise the early diagnose of the toxic impact of the diabetes in the newborn and to make possible the creation of early attention programs oriented to improve results. Objectives: To evaluate the influence of pre-gestational diabetes on the EEG tracing during the immediate neonatal period of newborn infants of diabetic mother. Patients: 25 full term newborn were selected, infants of diabetic mothers with pre-gestational diabetes, and also 25 healthy full term newborns to be used as controls. All of them were >37 weeks gestational age, single pregnancy, Apgar test >7 after 5 min, without malformations nor chromosomopathies, and from mothers without toxic habits. Methods: A video-EEG record was made to every infant before discharge of the neonatal care unit. The analysis included (i) Measurement of the percentage of active, quiet and indeterminate sleep; (ii) Background analysis (percentage of quiet sleep with tracé alternant, discontinuous activity, asynchrony and asymmetry); and (iii) The presence of ontogenic EEG specific patterns (Delta brushes, frontal sharp transients and frontal preencoches, and rolandic α-theta activity). Statistical analysis was made with a design of two independent groups and the help of the StatXact 5.0.3 (Cytel, MA, USA) software. Results: Significant statistical differences (p < 0.05) were found, higher percent of tracé alternant and quiet sleep, greater number of frontal sharp transients and frontal pre-encoches, and more rolandic α-theta activity in healthy full term newborns with respect to infants of diabetic mothers. No other statistical differences were found. Conclusions: The significant decrease or absence of these ontogenic EEG patterns might be an indication of brain injury if full term newborn infants of diabetic mother.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Non-invasive prenatal diagnostic tests may be based on fetal cells in maternal blood, and we have established a robust method to identify and isolate extravillious throphoblasts in maternal blood (EVTs). A major challenge for the implementation is that we need at least five cells for effective prenatal screening, a number we haven't achieved thus far for all pregnant women. We therefore conducted this study, where we investigated a possible change in the number of EVTs after overnight sleep. Furthermore, we investigated if exercise affects the number of EVTs. METHOD: Ten pregnant women carrying a male fetus were included in gestational weeks 11-14. Fetal gender was obtained through analyses of free fetal DNA. Participants stayed overnight at the hospital and performed strenuous exercise (cycling at a pulse of 150 beats per minute for 30 minutes) early the next morning. The number of EVTs was assessed in 30 ml blood at 8:00 pm, the next morning at 7:00 am before exercise and finally at 7:45 am, which was immediately after exercise. The blood samples were processed immediately by initial isolation of EVTs by magnetic cell sorting followed by staining with a cocktail of fetal cell-specific antibodies, identification and counting. RESULTS: A significantly higher number of EVTs were found in the morning compared to the evening (median: 1.5 vs. 3.5; p=0.03). Exercise resulted in a further increase in the number of EVTs when compared to samples taken immediately prior to exercise (median: 3.5 vs. 6; p=0.06). Using this protocol significantly increased the number of EVTs (median: 1.5 vs 6; p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The number of EVTs is significantly increased overnight as well as after 30 minutes of strenuous exercise. In fact, taking the blood sample in the morning after exercise made it possible to achieve effective prenatal screening with only one blood sample in up to 60% of the participants. These findings should be taken into account when planning the collection of fetal cells in connection with prenatal diagnosis.

N2  - Introduction In Burundi, it is estimated that 80% of Burundi's population is at risk of contracting malaria while 50% of patients in health facilities suffer from malaria. Mosquito nets do help but people continue to be bitten by malaria mosquitoes when they wake up early in the morning and in the evening, before they go to sleep. They need protection during that time. Methods In that context, the Ethics Advisory Agency for International Cooperation (ACECI) in collaboration with Montreal's É cole Polytechnique (Canada) together with the Government of Burundi found a new solution in an herb called Catnip (Nepeta cataria). A steam distilled oil added to hydrogen becomes a malaria mosquito repellent applicable on the skin. It will be introduced soon in Burundi. Results A trial phase for the catnip oil product was started. Seeds have been distributed to vulnerable local people (Batwas) for planting and harvesting in Nyabiraba and Bubanza areas. Thereafter, more plantations were set up in Bujumbura. Catnip oil is relatively easy to produce and safer to use. It reduces the number of bites from mosquitoes by 9%. Findings prove that a 15% concentrate is non-toxic on touch. It is a cost-effective product that can be used even on children and pregnant women. Conclusion Making the catnip oil available will increase the protection against malaria. The implication for stakeholders and decision makers is clear. This new anti-malaria strategy should be implemented in Burundi.

N2  - Background: Gynaecologists working long on call shifts often have to perform emergency operations at the end of their shifts. Previous studies have shown impaired technical skills among surgeons after a night on call assessed by Virtual Reality (VR) simulator. Because it is unethical to run a clinical trial involving sleep-deprived surgeons, simulation studies have becomean accepted substitute for real-life surgery in this field of research. However, surgery consists of proper judgement as well as technical skills.We are therefore conducting a study where both cognitive functions and laparoscopic skills among gynaecologists are tested directly after 17.5 hours on site call. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 28 gynaecologists trained to proficiency on the SimSurgery VR laparoscopic simulator. Directly after 17.5 hours on call the participants are asked to repeat 3 procedures of the ectopic pregnancy module on theVR simulator (SimSurgery). The cognitive test consists of a standardized cognitive test-battery (CANTAB) performed on a touch screen PC (http://www.camcog.com/). Rested baselines for both tests have been gathered before post call testing is conducted. Construct validation of the Ectopic Pregnancymodule on the SimSurgery VR simulator has been done as part of this trial. Outcomemeasures are laparoscopic psychomotor skills and cognitive performance. The participants' age, sex, former surgical experience, hours of sleep, caffeine-intake and subjective feeling of tiredness, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) (range 1.9), are being recorded. Results: Baseline performances on cognitive functions and laparoscopic skills of 28 gynaecologists working on call shifts at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Haukeland University Hospital have been collected. The post call testing will be completed by the end of April 2012. The results will be analyzed and presented on the 38th Nordic congress of obstetrics and gynaecology in Bergen, June 2012.

N2  - Introduction: The electroencephalography (EEG) patterns in normal newborns have been described from studies done within the first weeks of life. The existing early EEG studies are restricted to critical or neurologically abnormal newborns, hypothermia carried out with EHI within <6 h. The traumatism involved with labour, the hemodynamical changes during the birth and the adaptation to the new ambient conditions might significantly influence the EEG tracing. Objectives: To describe video EEG patterns within the first 6 h and after three days of life, using visual analysis and EEG coherence. Patients and methods: Twenty-five neonates >38 gestation age weeks non-instrumental delivery, without general anaesthesia and with Apgar >7 after 1 and 5 min. A polygraph video-EEG was recorded for >90 min. Visual analysis included the percentage of quiet and undetermined sleep, the percentage of discontinuous EEG tracing, the maximum interburst interval duration, the percentage of asynchrony and asymmetry of the bursts, and the percentage of the delta brushes within the bursts. The quantitative analysis was carried out by measuring the EEG coherence using principal component analysis (PCA), using the laplacian montage. The statistical analysis was done with the Wicolxom non-parametric test. Results: Visual analysis shows significant differences (p < 0.05) in (i) greater percentage of undetermined sleep and delta burts within the first 6 h of life; (ii) greater percentage of discontinuous tracing, of well organised quiet sleep with wakefulness cycles, with bursts with greater amplitude in the second and third days of life; (iii) no differences in asynchrony and asymmetry were found. Quantitative analysis showed significant differences (p < 0.05) within the PCA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 15 in all cerebral cortex areas, except the occipital ones. Conclusions: The video-EEG record in the first 6 h of life shows significant changes in the visual analysis of the background EEG trace and also in the spectral analysis which were not described previously, not showing EEGs patterns understood to imply moderate or severe seriousness used in hypothermic therapy.

N2  - Introduction: Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) 4 with suppression-burst is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1), which can be associated with other neurological phenotypes. We describe two Portuguese patients with EIEE and ''de novo'' heterozygous mutations in the STXBP1 gene, not previously reported in the literature. Case report: Patient 1 is a 8 years old male, born after a normal pregnancy. At 6 weeks of age he started to have partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, followed, at 3 months old, by tonic spasms, with poor control. The EEG showed suppression-burst and brain MRI was normal. At 5 months of age, when there was a transition to West syndrome, he started vigabatrin and remained seizure free from the age of 6 months. Sequencing of the STXBP1 disclosed a ''de novo'' mutation c.1462-2A >T, a splice-site mutation of intron 16 probably resulting in a non-functional STXBP1 protein. Presently the neurological examination shows absent language, communication limited to elementary emotions, spastic diplegia, generalized ataxia, tremor and dystonic movements of the upper limbs. He remains seizure free, without antiepileptic therapy from the age of 6 years. Patient 2 is a 18 month old male, born after an uneventful pregnancy, as well. At 2 weeks of age he started to have tonic spasms, partial and myoclonic seizures followed by flexion spasms, all refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs, until the age of 10 months when deflazacort was added. The EEG showed suppressionburst during sleep and brain MRI was normal. Sequencing of the STXBP1 revealed a ''de novo'' mutation c.444delC, p.D148DfsX17 (het.) that is predicted to truncate the domain-3 region of the STXBP1 protein leading to haploinsufficiency. Currently he is seizure free, but showing severe hypotonia and no language or ocular contact. Conclusion: We present these 2 cases for its relevance in the growing knowledge of clinical manifestations of STXBP1 gene mutations, since less than 30 cases have been reported so far. We also emphasize that although there are currently no targeted treatment for EIEE in general, molecular genetic testing must be included in the workup diagnosis of EEIE since it may establish a precise etiology, eliminating the need for further diagnostic tests and providing the possibility of genetic counselling.

N2  - Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) continuously replenish the blood with immune and blood cells with a finite life span, from the bone marrow (BM) reservoir of immature and maturing leukocytes. Regulation of HSC migration and development is essential for their function and blood cell production. These diverse and multiple states require a tight regulation to efficiently address host defense and repair requirements. Numerous recent studies disclose a central role for bone related cells in regulation of HSC and hematopoiesis. During ontogeny HSC home and seed the fetal BM in the last gestation period when the bone is already ossified. Ossification involves bone forming osteoblast- and bone degrading osteoclast activity and is considered essential for the formation of BM cavities and hematopoiesis. This synchronized association implies the need for active bone cells and bone turnover for HSC regulation. Osteoblastic cells and SDF-1+/nestin+ reticular adventitial and CAR cells are crucial for regulation of HSC lodgment, self-renewal and function. Bone resorbing osteoclasts regulate bone turnover and progenitor cell detachment and release from the BM. Sympathetic signals from the nervous system activated by circadian rhythms or stress conditions control both bone turnover and HSC migration and development. In this review we discuss pathways and mechanisms involved in this orchestrated regulatory network. A special focus is made on the pivotal role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis as a determinant of HSC fate. Inflammation, DNA damage, cytokine mobilization, microgravity and aging are discussed as specific physiologic and pathologic events entailing dysregulation of the tightly balanced Bone-Brain-Blood triad. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring's neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use. Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38). Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

N2  - Aims and objectives. To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background. Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design. Cross-sectional study design. Methods. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results. The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Background: The circadian clock has been linked to reproduction at many levels in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have reported increased rates of reproductive abnormalities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although whether the cause is circadian disruption or another factor associated with shift work is unknown. Here we test whether environmental disruption of circadian rhythms, using repeated shifts of the light:dark (LD) cycle, adversely affects reproductive success in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings: Young adult female C57BL/6J (B6) mice were paired with B6 males until copulation was verified by visual identification of vaginal plug formation. Females were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, phase-delay or phase-advance. Controls remained on a constant 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle, whereas phase-delayed and phase-advanced mice were subjected to 6-hr delays or advances in the LD cycle every 5-6 days, respectively. The number of copulations resulting in term pregnancies was determined. Control females had a full-term pregnancy success rate of 90% (11/12), which fell to 50% (9/18; p<0.1) in the phase-delay group and 22% (4/18; p<0.01) in the phase-advance group. Conclusions/Significance: Repeated shifting of the LD cycle, which disrupts endogenous circadian timekeeping, dramatically reduces pregnancy success in mice. Advances of the LD cycle have a greater negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and, in non-pregnant female mice, require longer for circadian re-entrainment, suggesting that the magnitude or duration of circadian misalignment may be related to the severity of the adverse impact on pregnancy. These results explicitly link disruptions of circadian entrainment to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mammals, which may have important implications for the reproductive health of female shift workers, women with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and/or women with disturbed circadian rhythms for other reasons. © 2012 Summa et al.

N2  - Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up. Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs -5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15± times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS. Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future. Copyright © 2012 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sleep duration and its quality on labor and fetal outcome. Method: In a cross sectional study, primigravida women with singleton pregnancy (gestational age > 37 weeks) were recruited. Women with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or those who needed emergency cesarean section were excluded. Data regarding the type and length of delivery, the quality of sleep as well as the neonates' weight and Apgar scores were recorded. Results: Totally, 457 participants were recruited. There was a significant correlation between the sleep duration and length of delivery stages. In most participants with more than 8 hours sleep, the first stage of delivery lasted between 6 and 10 hours. They had normal vaginal delivery with induction, and their neonates' Apgar score was > 9 (p = 0.029, p = 0.018, and p = 0.001, respectively). Most mothers with refreshing sleep had normal vaginal delivery with induction, their neonates weighted ≥ 2500 g and with Apgar score > 9 (p = 0.010, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005 respectively). Conclusion: Sleep duration and quality of sleep can affect the type of delivery, length of labor stages, as well as neonates' Apgar score and birth weight. Such predictors of labor and fetal outcome should be assessed during prenatal evaluations. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Incidence of cancer in children has increased in recent decades, and known risk factors can account for only a small minority of cases. Gestation and early childhood are particularly vulnerable periods in human development and an important aspect of development is in circadian rhythmicity. Emerging evidence implicates the molecular circadian mechanism in a vast array of other physiologic functions including metabolism, DNA damage response and cell-cycle regulation. Electric light exposure at night can disrupt circadian rhythms and, thereby, many other physiologic processes that are under circadian control. On this basis, it is proposed that ill-timed electric light exposure to pregnant women, to neonates, infants, and small children may increase cancer risk in those children. There are practical implications and interventions that accrue from this idea should it later be confirmed to be true. ©2012 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%-16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

N2  - Background: Preterm neonates in NICU are exposed to an acoustic environment that is far different than the one they should have been wrapped in mother's womb should pregnancy be continued. The absence of acoustic stimuli may detrimentally affect the neurobehavioural development of this delicate population of newborns. In the past years many attempts to deliver acoustic sounds to newborns have been conducted, but no substantial results have been obtained. Thus, the A.A.P. Committee on Environmental Health in 1997, dissuaded the researchers to perform additional studies. However, progress in a number of technologies have actually occurred since the last years of the past century, and now we have the tools to deliver our newborns some “biological” sounds directly in incubators, thus recreating the intrauterine acoustic environment. The present abstract describes the protocol of a forthcoming pilot study to assess the outcomes of preterm neonates delivered “biologicallike” acoustic sounds in NICU using newly developed incubator-friendly techniques. Methods and Objectives: The pilot study will be performed at the Division of Neonatology and NICU at S. Anna Hospital in Torino, Italy. Newborns eligible for enrolment will be inborn, with G.A. 34+0 - 36+6 weeks, without any major ongoing disease other than prematurity, and with the prevision of remaining in incubator for at least 48 hrs since enrolment. This group of late preterm newborns will be exposed to the recorded sound of their mother's heartbeat (frequency 60 bpm) that will be directly delivered to them in incubator through a new device that for the first time enables reproducing in “HiFi” a wide range of low frequencies and to deliver them to the incubator through air transmission without any need of static speakers or cables. The newborn sleep spindles will be analysed with aEEG. Standard monitoring of vital signs will provide additional information on the patients' well-being. Thanks to this new engineering device developed to analyse, manage and reproduce the intrauterine sounds in incubators, the authors are going: 1. To check out the effect of maternal heart rate on preterm infants. Our hypothesis is that newborns exposed to a slow pace rhythm that simulates their mother's heartbeat during the hours of rest will show an increase in time of deep sleep. 2. To obtain pilot data enabling our group to create a model that allows the implementation of a cohort study to assess the short and long term effects produced by different sounds on premature infants (such as effects of the maternal voice on the well-being in the cradle, and on language acquisition in the first year of life). Conclusion: The availability of this new and original technologies enables researchers to safely assess the effects of sound stimulation applied to premature newborn populations and provides a reproducible method to verify the potential benefits arising from artificial sound reproduction delivered to premature babies who would otherwise suffer from acoustic deprivations.

N2  - Introduction: Research suggests that children's entering their parents' bed after nightly awakenings is associated with short sleep duration and sleep fragmentation. Obesity has moreover been found to be associated with low sleep quality and quantity. We examined if entering parents' bed during night was associated with an increased risk of child overweight.Methods:The Sund Start study included 645 children aged 2-6 years predisposed to overweight due to high birth weight, maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or maternal low socioeconomic status. Of these, 497 children had complete information on BMI, whether the child enters the parents' bed during night, and if so, how often. International cut-offs for overweight according to age and gender was applied. Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were estimated from logistic regression analyses.Results:Children entering parents' bed during night had OR = 0.5 (95% CI 0.28-0.95) of being overweight, compared to children not entering parents' bed during night. Children entering parents' bed every night had OR = 0.3 (95% CI 0.09-0.88) compared to children never entering parents' bed during night. All analyses were adjusted for factors such as gender, child's age and parental educational level.Conclusion:Those children never entering parents' bed during night had a more than 3-fold higher risk of obesity than those entering every night, suggesting that elements of parental social support or other types of positive psychosocial responses if being allowed to enter parent's bed during night may protect against obesity.

N2  - Objective. To study the variation of protein excretion in short-interval day-and-night collections in hospitalized preeclamptic patients on continuous bed rest. Methods. We prospectively studied 50 patients admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Urine volumes in 2-, 4-, 12-, and 24-h durations were recorded. Protein concentrations in different volumes of urine were measured. Paired t-test was used to compare the volumes, concentrations, and the total amounts of protein in these samples of different durations. Results. There was no significant difference in the volume of urine and the concentration of proteinuria in the day when compared to night (12-h samples) (p > 0.05). The total amount of protein excreted was comparable for the two durations of samples. For shorter-duration collections (4- and 2-h), the difference in proteinuria between day and night samples remained blunted. Conclusion. This study concludes that there is blunting of variation in protein excretion as observed in short-interval urine collections at different times of the day in hypertensive pregnant patients on continuous bed rest. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Aims With one in four children starting school overweight, prevention needs to start in the preschool years. BERTIE (Babies and Early-years Risk: Trying to Implement the Evidence) aims to help health professionals identify babies at risk of obesity to provide appropriate guidance. Methods Systematic review of the effect of selected perinatal factors associated with later obesity. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method was used to evaluate and synthesise the evidence and rate the quality of evidence for recommendations. A consensus meeting of experts debated the findings and their suitability. Results The consensus meeting identified maternal obesity, infant weight centile, infant weight gain, and smoking in pregnancy as the factors that would be most helpful in identifying infants at the greatest risk of later obesity. Socioeconomic status and ethnicity merited further exploration, though it was recognised that usefully measuring these factors would present challenges. Evidence relating to the other factors (birth weight, diabetes in pregnancy, infant sleep pattern, breastfeeding and weight gain in pregnancy) was not considered strong enough to suggest they would be useful perinatal predictors of later obesity risk. Conclusion These findings provide guidance for how families might be targeted for obesity prevention. Given the importance of parental obesity, training health professionals to sensitively engage with families is needed to ensure those at high risk receive the intervention required.

N2  - We have discovered types of incremental lines in which periodicity differ in the dentin of both animal and human tooth dentin. The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between the periodicity of incremental lines in dentin of teeth and the role of melatonin. The variation in the amount of melatonin in teeth embryo at daytime and night time was investigated through the use of Sprague- Dawley rats. The histological research was performed on a decalcified section of teeth embryo and dentin. The oral administration of melatonin was performed on the pregnant rats at a low concentration (20 μg) and a high concentration (100 μg). On 5 days after birth, tooth germs of rats were extracted during day time and night time. The specimens were observed and analyzed using a light microscopy, a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-2380N, Hitachi and JSM-6340, JEOL), a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 100CX, JEOL), a laser Raman microprobe spectrometry (Labspec, Horiba), and an electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JXA-8200, JEOL) to investigate the chemical composition and crystal constitution of incremental lines of dentin. It was clear that the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 were present in the teeth embryos. The level of melatonin concentration during night time was higher than that of daytime. The dark-staining layer of hematoxylin was observed at the calcification front of dentin formed during the night time. It is considered that calcification advances during night periods, when the dark-staining layer of hematoxylin is formed, while the light-staining layer is formed during the daytime. As a result, the combination of dark-staining and light-staining layers is responsible for the creation of incremental lines. The interval of the incremental lines was 15.50± 1.15 μm on average. This matches the interval of the incremental lines of the circadian rhythm observed by Schour and Massler (1967). By TEM observation, the difference between the layers was due to the degree of density of collagen fibers in the incremental lines. In the case of melatonin administration, only the dark-staining layer of hematoxylin was observed in the dentin, whereas the light-staining layer was not. Melatonin caused a consistent rise in the mineralization of dentin. It is suggested that melatonin may participate in the periodicity of the incremental lines of dentin.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of wheezing and its associated risk factors in infants in the first year of life in the province of Salamanca, Spain. Methods: A multicentre, cross-sectional, descriptive epidemiological study was designed to evaluate a representative sample of 750 infants in the first year of life, born in the province of Salamanca between 1 June 2008 and 30 September 2009.The study was based on a previously validated and standardised written questionnaire administered among the parents of those children seen for control at 12 months of age in any of the Primary Care centres in the province of Salamanca. Results: The recorded wheezing rate was 32.3%. Feeding and sleep were seen to be affected in 46.3% and 80.9% of the wheezing children, respectively, and parent activity was also altered in 39.3% of the cases.A relationship was found between wheezing and nursery attendance (OR: 1.66, 95% confidence interval [1.19-2.31]); weight at birth >3500. g (OR: 1.45 [1.02-2.06]); the presence of eczema at this age (OR: 2.72 [1.75-4.24]); exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.33 [0.98-1.81]); and maternal smoking during the last three months of pregnancy (OR: 1.60 [0.96-2.68]).The prevalence of recurrent wheezing (defined as three or more episodes) was 11.9%. Significant differences were observed with respect to nursery attendance (OR: 1.71 [1.08-2.72]), the presence of eczema at this age (OR: 2.55 [1.48-4.42]), a history of maternal asthma (OR: 2.19 [1.08-4.44]) and exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.53 [0.98-2.38]). Conclusions: In the province of Salamanca, one third of the infants studied suffered wheezing in the first year of life. Infants exclusively breastfed for less than three months; attending a nursery; having suffered eczema; or with an asthmatic mother showed significantly more wheezing than the rest. Wheezing proved recurrent in 11.9% of the cases. © 2011 SEICAP.

N2  - Aims Infants of mothers who smoked during pregnancy have an increased risk of sudden infant death; a possible explanation is that such infants have neurodevelopmental abnormalities of ventilatory control. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that infants of mothers who had smoked antenatally compared to infants of non-smoking mothers would have a poorer ventilatory response to hypoxia. Methods Infants were recruited before maternity unit discharge and assigned to one of two groups based on maternal smoking history. A pneumotachograph and face mask were placed over the infant's mouth and nose. During quiet sleep, the infants were switched from breathing room air to 15% oxygen (hypoxic challenge), which was maintained for five minutes unless the oxygen saturation level fell below 85%. Changes in oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal and minute volume and end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) were assessed. Results Ten infants of smoking mothers (median gestational age of 39 (36-41) weeks) and 10 infants of non smoking mothers (39 (37-42) weeks) were studied. The median birth weight of the infants of the smoking mothers was lower than that of infants of the non-smoking mothers (2450 (1924-3790) grams versus 3299 (2560-4320) grams, p=0.04). The infants were studied at similar postnatal ages (median 30 (10-120) versus 32 (10-100) hours), p=0.7. The two groups had comparable baseline tidal breathing, oxygen saturation, heart rate and ETCO2 levels. In response to the hypoxic challenge, the two groups had similar falls in their oxygen saturation and increases in heart rate. There was a biphasic response in minute ventilation to the hypoxic challenge. There was no significant differences in the initial percentage increase in minute ventilation between the two groups (median 29% (range 17-40) versus 23% (2-35), p=0.23, but the subsequent percentage decrease in minute volume in the infants of the smoking mothers was greater than that of the infants of the non-smoking mothers (median 32 % (range 0-99) versus 0%(-20-32)), p=0.03. Conclusion These results suggest intrauterine exposure to tobacco smoking may result in impairment of the infant peripheral chemoreceptor response.

N2  - Introduction: Longitudinal studies that examine The developmental paths leading to overweight in childhood as well as their associated early risk factors are needed to improve early obesity prevention efforts.Methods: Data was drawn from The Quc Longitudinal Study of Child Development (1998-2010), a population-based birth cohort study in The province of Quc, Canada. Children's height and weight were measured yearly, and mothers reported on child, mother and family characteristics. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Group-based trajectories of The probability of being overweight according to international criteria during middle childhood (6-12 years) were identified with a semiparametric modeling method (n= 1678). Bivariate analyses were used to examine how early risk factors were distributed across trajectory groups. Multinomial logistic regression analyses will follow to establish The relative contribution of each predictor and potential interaction effects.Results: Three trajectories of overweight were identified: “low-stable” (71.4%), “increasing” (17.4%) and “high-stable” (11.2%). The high-stable group was composed of children who were overweight throughout The assessment period, whereas The BMI of The “increasing” group began to rise at approximately age 7. Preliminary analyses suggest that child birthweight, past overweight, mental health symptoms, sleep duration, television viewing hours, maternal BMI and smoking during pregnancy, and family socioeconomic status distinguish trajectory group membership. Conclusion: The development of overweight in childhood seems to follow an early or late-onset pathway, with distinct risk factors for each. Identifying these will aid in The development of more effective early preventive interventions.

N2  - Background: Patients with ANCA Associated Vasculitis(AAV) consider fatigue to be the greatest burden of their disease, even when in remission. Escalation of drug therapy commonly fails to improve fatigue levels and so alternative interventions require investigation. In other auto-immune conditions, exercise and behavioural therapy, delivered by multi-disciplinary(MD) teams, have proven to be effective. Such non-pharmacological interventions have yet to be tested in AAV. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a MD programme in the relief of fatigue experienced by patients with AAV. Methods: Clinically stable patients with AAV (Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score=0 for>3months) who reported fatigue for >3 months were invited to attend a 7 week fatigue management programme (FMP). Weekly 2 hr sessions integrated: 1)A graduated aerobic exercise regime based on a circuit training program of 6 activities (step ups, wall squats, timed walk, marching, sit to stand, knee bends) 2)Behavioural therapy, incorporating education on pacing, diet, sleep hygiene, relaxation and coping strategies. The FMP was delivered, in both group and individual settings, by specialists in nursing physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics and psychology. Participants returned for follow up after 3 months. Quality of life and fatigue measures were collected at weeks 0(baseline), 7(end of FMP) and 19(follow-up). At the same time points, circuit training activity performance was quantified (number of repetitions in a minute). Patients received regular clinical assessments during the period as per standard care. Results: Participants (n=5) reported clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue, with benefits maintained at week 19(see table). Large improvements in physical health were reported. This was consistent with the observed progress in circuit training performance which increased from 32% (sit to stand) to 159% (wall squats) between weeks 0 and 19. Although no disease relapses occurred, at week 19, 3 of 5 patients were experiencing ill health (2 acute infections, 1 pregnancy). Participants were unanimously positive about the programme, some even regarding it as 'life changing'. Conclusions: Despite extraneous causes of fluctuating health status, the FMP appeared to be acceptable and effective in improving symptoms of fatigue in patients with AAV. Exercise appears key to this improvement. Further investigation with larger sample sizes is warranted to determine if there is a case to conduct a formal evaluation through a randomized controlled trial. (Table presented).

N2  - Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury at birth is associated with 1-3/1000 cases of moderate to severe encephalopathy. Previously, we have shown that connexin 43 hemichannel blockade, with a specific mimetic peptide, reduced the occurrence of seizures, improved recovery of EEG power and sleep state cycling, and improved cell survival following global cerebral ischaemia. In the present study, we examined the dose response for intracerebroventricular mimetic peptide infusion (50 μmol/kg/h for 1 h, followed by 50 μmol/kg/24 h (low dose) or 50 μmol/kg/h for 25 h (high dose) or vehicle only (control group), starting 90 min after the end of ischaemia), following global cerebral ischaemia, induced by 30 min bilateral carotid artery occlusion, in near-term fetal sheep (128 ± 1 days gestation). Both peptide infusion groups were associated with a transient significant increase in EEG power between 2-12 h after ischaemia. The ischaemia-low dose group showed a significant recovery of EEG power from day five compared to the ischaemia-vehicle and -high dose groups. In contrast, the high dose infusion was associated with greater secondary increase in impedance (brain cell swelling), as well as a trend towards a greater increase in lactate concentration and mortality. These data suggest that higher doses of connexin mimetic peptide are not beneficial and may be associated with adverse outcomes, most likely attributable to uncoupling of connexin 43 gap junctions leading to dysfunction of the astrocytic syncytium. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and arterial hypertension (AH) are common and underrecognized medical disorders. OSA is a potential risk factor for the development of AH and/or may act as a factor complicating AH management. The symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are considered essential for the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which is a first line treatment of OSA. The medical literature and practice is controversial about the treatment of people with asymptomatic OSA. Thus, OSA patients without EDS may be left at increased cardiovascular risk. Case presentation: The report presents a case of 42 year old Asian woman with symptoms of heart failure and angina like chest pain upon admission. She didn't experience symptoms of EDS, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was seven points. Snoring was reported on direct questioning. The patient had prior medical history of three unsuccessful pregnancies complicated by gestational AH and preeclampsia with C-section during the last pregnancy. The admission blood pressure (BP) was 200/120 mm Hg. The patient's treatment regimen consisted of five hypotensive medications including diuretic. However, a target BP wasn't achieved in about one and half month. The patient was offered to undergo a polysomnography (PSG) study, which she rejected. One month after discharge the PSG study was done, and this showed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 46 events per hour. CPAP therapy was initiated with a pressure of 11 H20 cm. After 2 months of compliant CPAP use, adherence to pharmacologic regimen and lifestyle modifications the patient's BP decreased to 134/82 mm Hg. Conclusions: OSA and AH are common and often underdiagnosed medical disorders independently imposing excessive cardiovascular risk on a diseased subject. When two conditions coexist the cardiovascular risk is likely much greater. This case highlights a possible clinical phenotype of OSA without EDS and its association with resistant AH. Most importantly a good hypotensive response to medical treatment in tandem with CPAP therapy was achieved in this patient. Thus, it is reasonable to include OSA in the differential list of resistant AH, even if EDS is not clinically obvious.

N2  - Introduction: Assessment of loneliness, quality of sleep and affecting factors in elders. Materials and Method: A total of 428 elders were included in the research. The research data were collected using the loneliness scale (UCLA-LS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). One-way analysis of variance, t test and Pearson analysis of correlation were used to evaluate the data. Results: The average loneliness score was 41.87±8.43. The average loneliness score of those living in the nursing home was higher than that of those living in the home environment. The relationship between the average loneliness score and age, educational background, childbearing, and the number of visitors were significant (p<0.05). The average sleep quality score was 6.21±3.33. Educational background, income status, childbearing, having a chronic disease, number of visitors, and duration of residence in the nursing home were found to affect the quality of sleep (p<0.05). A slightly positive relationship (r=0.298; p=0.001) was observed between the average loneliness score and the quality of sleep score. Conclusion: Loneliness and sleep problems are common among elders. In order to improve their quality of life and health status, health care providers should recognize and take necessary actions to alleviate these problems.

N2  - Objective: The aims of this study were to show the change of sleep pattern and sleep complaints over 1st to third trimester in pregnant women comparing to before pregnancy and the relationship between pregnancy outcome and habitual snoring or apnea. Background Pregnant women commonly have sleep problems related to profound physical and physiologic changes of their bodies. Sleep problems might affect pregnancy outcome including low birth weight or serious maternal complication such as pre-eclampsia as well as inducing daytime dysfunction. Design/Methods: Pregnant women who visited obstetrics clinic in Dankook University Hospital or private clinics located in Cheonan for antenatal care were consecutively enrolled. The 1st to the 3rd trimester and immediate postpartum women were included. During antenatal visit, they were asked to fill out sleep questionnaire which includes questions regarding sleep duration and presence of sleep complaints before pregnancy and at the moment during pregnancy such as snoring, apnea, daytime sleepiness and insomnia. Medical history was checked as well as blood pressure at the visit and results of laboratory finding. In addition, birth weights and Apgar scores of babies were investigated. Results: 161 pregnant women(mean age,31.4±3.6yr) were enrolled. They reported significantly more frequent habitual snoring(8.9% vs. 1.3%), choking sensation during night(16.3% vs. 0.6%), frequent insomnia(29.8% vs. 10.8%), feeling of non-refreshing sleep and daytime sleepiness than before pregnancy. Sleep latency and sleep duration were longer than before pregnancy. Pregnant women with habitual snoring had higher systolic blood pressure and higher incidences of proteinuria than those without snoring. However, there were no differences of birth weight or Apgar scores of babies between two groups. Conclusions: This study shows pregnant women suffer from very prevalent sleep problems as expected. They develop symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea which does not exist before pregnancy, which seems to have health consequences. Due to small numbers, pregnancy outcome was inconclusive.

N2  - Background: Normal pregnancy is accompanied by biological rhythm disruptions such as changes in sleep quality, eating patterns and social activities. Severity of these disruptions and sleep quality in particular are correlated with changes in mood. No study to date has investigated the relationship between sleep quality, biological rhythm disruption and symptoms of depression during pregnancy. Methods: Twenty medication-free women (30-37 weeks gestation) were investigated. Circadian rhythm was assessed using the Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and depression using the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: Correlations were strong between PSQI and BRIAN (rP=0.76, p<0.001), BRAIN and EPDS (rP=0.83; p<0.001) and PSQI and EPDS (rP=0.64; p=0.003). To control for overlapping sleep items, all sleep sub-scores were removed from the EPDS and BRIAN. This manipulation slightly reduced the correlation between PSQI and BRIAN (rP=0.65; p=0.002), but did not alter the any other association. Subsequent multiple regression analysis modelling the effect of the PSQI and BRIAN on EPDS scores revealed a significant interaction between the PSQI and BRIAN (t=2.57; p=0.02). Conclusions: The severity of depressive symptoms in late pregnancy appears to be highly correlated with circadian rhythm and sleep disturbances. The observed interaction between these factors suggests that their combination, rather than either alone, modulate depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Depression during pregnancy is a strong predictor of subsequent postpartum depression. Investigating factors which modulate the biological clock could aid in the development of new treatment and prevention strategies.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has a distinctive pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment compared with that of older children and adults. Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction andgas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chestwall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associatedwith failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction formicrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

N2  - In nonpregnant populations, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Few studies have examined the relationship between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). The objective of this study was to examine the association between SDB and APO. Women who had a delivery as well as an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) were identified. Demographics, PSG results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Absence of SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of <5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of ≥ 15. The primary outcome was a composite measure of APO: pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth ≤34 weeks. We identified 143 women who had undergone a PSG and a delivery. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk of the composite APO: AHI <5, 18.1%; AHI 5 to 14.9, 23.5%; AHI ≥ 15, 38.5% (p = 0.038). Obese women (body mass index ≥30) with moderate to severe SDB had the highest rate of APO, 41.7%. SDB, especially moderate to severe disease, may be associated with APO. However, it is unclear if SDB is a risk factor for APO independent of obesity. © 2012 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Regular sleep is an important behavior for health maintenance during pregnancy, yet it is frequently disturbed. Emerging data indicate an association between disturbed sleep in pregnancy and adverse health outcomes, such as depression, gestational diabetes and preterm birth. An unresolved question persists regarding the significance of selfreported versus objectively collected sleep data, and the degree to which one may be more important than the other as they relate to health outcomes among pregnant women. Given the importance of efficient sleep during pregnancy, we sought to examine whether there are differential relationships between self-reported (SR) or actigraphyassessed (AC) sleep and patient reported outcomes. Sleep data were collected with sleep diaries and actigraphy in 71 women for three 2- week periods between 10-20 weeks gestation. Women also completed the Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (IDS) and Pregnancy Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ) at 20 weeks gestation which were used as patient reported outcome measures. Pearson correlations evaluated whether sleep was correlated with outcomes. As expected, values for sleep duration and continuity differed between collection methods. Sleep duration: SR= 488.3 ± 67.6 min vs. AC = 375.8±77.7 min; wake after sleep onset (WASO): SR = 25.7 ± 19.3 min vs. AC = 104.6 ± 65.0 min; and sleep efficiency (SE): SR = 91.3 ± 6.05% vs. AC = 72.9 ± 13.6%. There were also differential associations between collection method and outcome. Greater depressive symptomatology at 20 weeks was only associated with WASO and SE at 18-20 weeks from selfreport only (r = .20, p = .04; r = -.26, p = .007). Whereas, greater pregnancy distress at 20 weeks was associated with shorter sleep duration from both SR and AC at 14-16 weeks, and AC at 18-20 weeks was associated (r = -.27, p = .009; r =-.28, p = .01; r = -.35, p =.001). These findings indicate that there is utility in using both self-report and actigraphy to collect sleep information from pregnant women, as they appear to provide unique, yet complimentary estimations of sleep. Using a multi-modal approach will likely provide a more comprehensive understanding of how sleep impact health outcomes.

N2  - Introduction This case illustrates obstetric, logistical and financial aspects of antenatal and intrapartum management of pregnant women with BMI>80. Case Summary A 29 year-old multiparous woman with BMI of 70.2 was booked for Consultant-led antenatal care. Her booking weight was 197kg, increasing to 242kg at term (BMI:80) despite specialist dietary input. Given her extreme obesity, with co-morbidities including obstructive sleep apnoea, lymphoedema and heavy smoking, joint antenatal care was co-ordinated. Multidisciplinary meetings involving maternal and fetal medicine, anaesthetics and haematology identified key steps to minimise maternal and fetal complications. Manual handling assessments were made, bariatric equipment was sourced and team members underwent moving and handling training. Conclusions Despite the rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity, our Unit's experience managing this patient has highlighted the lack of robust evidence regarding antenatal and intrapartum care of patients with super morbid obesity, let alone at such extreme levels (BMI>80). RCOG guidelines mainly apply to women with BMI>30 and do not include active management of weight gain during the index pregnancy.1 Our literature search found only one obstetric case study for a patient with BMI>70, which principally looked at anaesthetic issues.2 UKOSS conducted cohort studies that looked at outcomes of pregnancy3 and delivery4 in women with extreme obesity but no firm management guidelines were made. This lack of literature suggests cases such as this require an individualised approach to obstetric care. Early involvement of the multidisciplinary team, Moving and Handling Team and Estates Department is important with an awareness of increased financial implications.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the body composition of offspring. SUBJECTS: Grade 4 elementary school children (n=1366; boys/girls, 724/642; 9-10 years old) were enrolled in this study. All parents answered a lifestyle questionnaire, and children underwent passive smoking tests. Urinary cotinine measurement and lifestyle screening test parameters (that is, body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI), obesity index (OI), blood tests for liver function and lipid profile and questions regarding maternal smoking and lifestyle) were evaluated in terms of their relationship with maternal smoking. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration was measured in 80 randomly selected children to assess its relationship with oxidative stress. RESULTS: Both BMI and OI were significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy than in those whose mothers never smoked (BMI: 17.2±2.7 vs 16.9±2.5 kg m-2, P=0.016; OI: 2.7±14.3% vs 0.4±14.0%, P=0.003). The degree of elevation was positively correlated with the duration of maternal smoking. The increases in BMI and OI resulted from increased body weight and reduced height. The confounding factors - 'breakfast with family', 'watching television at dinner', 'eating and drinking before sleep', 'watching television for >2 h', 'sleep duration <8 h' and 'playing sports' - were statistically significant. BMI and OI were significantly high in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy in these six confounders. On the other hand, urinary 8-OHdG concentration was negatively correlated with BMI in children who had >1.3 ng ml-1 urinary cotinine, suggesting that it may be related to basal metabolism due to oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking is a risk factor for higher BMI and OI in 9- to 10-year-old children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy and may be independent of other confounding factors. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - 'Stress' is defined as the disturbance in the 'dynamic balance' or 'homeostasis' of a complex system, such as the human organism or society, 'stressors' as the forces that produce this disturbance, and 'adaptive response' as the forces from within the complex system that strive to return homeostasis to normal. In the case of the human organism, the adaptive response is subserved by a specialized system in our brain and body, the 'Stress System', which is activated to help us deal with stress when a stressor of any kind exceeds a certain threshold. In itself, stress that is dealt with efficiently by the adaptive response of a system is neutral or even potentially beneficial to that system, be that an organism or a society. In contrast, the chronic dynamic state in which the adaptive response fails to fully reestablish homeostasis during stress, which I call 'dyshomeostasis' or, more correctly, 'cacostasis', may have detrimental effects on the system. In human beings, the crucial beneficial hormones that are activated to reestablish homeostasis, the 'homeostatic or stress mediators', including adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol and the inflammatory mediator interleukin- 6, are also, paradoxically, responsible to a great extent for the damage the organism sustains when in cacostasis. These mediators may impair the physiology of our cells, disturb their metabolic activity, increase their inflammatory response and stimulate their oxidative functions, all potentially damaging changes, ultimately accelerating aging, causing obesity, metabolic problems and osteoporosis, promoting atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and increasing the chance of the organism to be infected or get cancer. The pre-Socratic philosophers Pythagoras and Alcmaeon, respectively, used the terms 'harmony' and 'isonomia' to express the dynamic balance or homeostasis of life, while the Hippocratics equated this harmony with health and disharmony with disease. Both the Stoics and the Epicurians, philosophic schools that concentrated on the study of stress and its management, considered the attainment of 'ataraxia', or imperturbability of the mind to stressors, as the ultimate goal of life, while Epicurus himself spoke of 'eustatheia' -or 'eustasis', if we extrapolate from homeostasis-, the serene emotional state of a harmonious balance in a human being. The not uncommon Greek first name 'Eustathios' is a remnant of that era. Based on these ancient seminal ideas, we suggested that appropriate responsiveness of the human stress system to stressors is a crucial prerequisite for a sense of wellbeing, adequate performance of tasks, and positive social interactions, and hence for the survival of the self and the species. By contrast, inappropriate, over- or under-responsiveness of the stress system through its hormonal and inflammatory mediators may impair growth and development, and may account for the many chronic behavioral, endocrine, metabolic, and allergic/ autoimmune disorders that plague contemporary humanity. The development and severity of these conditions primarily depend on the genetic vulnerability of the individual, the exposure to adverse environmental- including psychosocial and economic- factors and the timing and duration of the stressful event(s). Our first model disorders of stress system over- and underresponsiveness were, respectively, melancholic depression, which we showed to be a disease characterized by chronic hyperactivation of the stress system, explaining its behavioral and somatic manifestations, and its mirror image, atypical depression, characterized by chronically decreased activation of this system, also explaining its clinical manifestations through a similar but alternative pathway. This realization allowed us to extrapolate our thoughts to the larger nosology of the human population, identifying many other such states. Starting from animal models, and with some surprise, we realized that hyporesponsivity of the stress system to inflammatory signals and resistance of immune tissues to cortisol characterize several inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and septic shock, phenomena that we elucidated at the molecular level. Similarly, we identified other human states characterized by hypoactivity of the stress response, including seasonal depression, the chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia syndromes, postpartum blues/depression and the late luteal phase dysphoric syndrome disorder. We suggested that the genetic vulnerabilities of our species leading to the contemporary 'chronic non-communicable diseases', which include obesity, the chronic pain and fatigue syndromes, depression, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases, resulted from selective pressures of evolutionary stressors upon our genome during our evolution to modern human beings. To these genetic vulnerability changes, stress in prenatal and early life adds the so-called epigenetic ones. Prenatal life, infancy, childhood and adolescence are critical periods characterized by great plasticity and, hence, increased vulnerability to stressors. During these critical periods of life, stress mediators exert major organizational effects on the neural circuits of the brain and epigenetic effects throughout the brain and body, that is, effects that are prolonged or permanent and include chemical changes in our DNA and chromatin. Such epigenetic changes are environmentally acquired, and as such, are fully preventable. Well beyond depression, currently affecting approximately 20% of the adult population and predicted by the World Health Organization to soon be the number 2 morbidity factor in the world, we suggested that chronic common, every day stress and the resultant cacostasis are also a major factor for all cause morbidity and mortality in today's societies, encompassing all the chronic non-communicable diseases and, to a lesser extent, certain infections and cancer. At this time, and despite the stupendous advances in hygiene and medicine that have prolonged our lives, we believe that over 50% of the human disease burden is due to chronic socioeconomic distress, a result - to a great extent - of the ever increasing complexity and alienation in the modern world. We should note that the effects of prolonged distress go well beyond the causation of the chronic non-communicable diseases. Prolonged human cacostasis disturbs normal growth and development in children, causes emotional deprivation, upsets sleep, destroys family and social life, increases criminal behavior, multiplies violent accidents, and stimulates the abuse of and dependence on substances. Chronic distress also accelerates aging, reflected in decreasing chromosomal telomere length, and increases frailty, curtailing healthy life expectancy. Finally, the health care related costs of prolonged distress are enormous, probably accounting for a significant proportion of the total expenditures. The dysphoria that most frequently accompanies cacostasis and the 'happiness' of equanimity and sense of wellbeing are mutually inhibitory of each other. We now understand the neurochemical mechanisms of this crucial relation and can employ this knowledge in our quest for happiness and good health. We actually can, with the power of our will, lead ourselves to a dynamic state of homeostasis that is at a level higher than what would have been expected from our genetic and epigenetic constitution and our environment, a condition that I call 'hyperstasis'. The latter state allows the full experience and appreciation of the gift of life, extends its duration and influences propitiously those around us. This state gives materialism its true proportions and promotes virtue, spirituality and a better Society. Through our work, we established the common biological pathways connecting a large array of ostensibly disparate psychological and somatic disorders, including depression, anxiety, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, allergic and autoimmune inflammatory disorders, sleep disturbances, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, hypofertility, and osteoporosis. We contributed to the understanding of how stress through its mediators, including components of the inflammatory reaction, causes premature aging, and promotes cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. A common pathophysiology suggests that prevention and curative means have common bases. Today, the presence of stress and cacostasis in an individual can be evaluated and graded. There are rational and proven methods to prevent and ameliorate distress that start from changes in lifestyle (healthy diet, exercise, stable daily timing, adequate sleep), to cognitive and behavioral therapies, to the use of appropriate medications. Indeed, the currently available medications that control risk factors and prolong life function primarily by blocking the stress system and inflammatory mediators. The key issue is that nature is not destiny and wellbeing and hyperstasis are attainable. Granted that chronic distress in early life augments the risk of developing chronic behavioral and non-communicative disorders, preventing distress in pregnancy and the first 5 years of life or interrupting the vicious cycle of distress during this period is imperative and, in the long run, the most cost-effective approach. Interventions beyond the age of 5 may be quite useful, but one should note that major stress-related brain organizational and epigenetic damage has already occurred. At this point I should mention what L. Tolstoy had intuitively said: 'From the child of five to myself is but a step. But from the newborn baby to the child of five is an appalling distance'.

N2  - Some infants show a free-running rhythm in their rest-activity. We do not know why, nor do we know exactly what the entrainment factors are for the development of the normal 24-h rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphic recordings on 10 primiparae during late pregnancy and these mothers and their infants during the 2nd, 6th, and 12th wks after birth were made over 35 continuous days to investigate maternal and infant entrainment. One infant showed a free-running rest-activity circadian rhythm. In late pregnancy, the period in the autocorrelogram of the mother with the free-running infant was longer than the significant period of the mean autocorrelogram of the mothers with non-free-running infants. The finding of this study indicates the free-running rhythm of infant is not reset by maternal entrainment factors. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs, developing at rest, that compel the person to move. Symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7-11% of the population in western countries, and is increasingly common in older people. Primary RLS is familial in up to two-thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions, including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, to neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay between systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. Dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment for those requiring pharmacotherapy; however, correction of underlying problems, in particular iron deficiency, is also important. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Aims: Following normal pregnancy and birth a 1.5-year-old male patient experienced relapsing hemiplegy with clonic jerks of the right part of the body. Headaches or unconciousness were never observed. In between the hemiplegic episodes the child did not show any neurologic abnormalities and developed normally. Methods: An EEG performed during alertness and sleep as well as a lumbar puncture showed normal findings. A cMRI revealed moderate dilatation of the frontotemporal outer cerebrospinal fluid space. A therapy with benzodiazepines was only partly successful, the hemiplegic periods lasted in part for several hours. Continuous treatment with valproate, levitiracetam and oxcarbazepine was also not successful and the hemiplegic symptoms occurred two to six times in a month. A further diagnostic evaluation using angiographic cMRI and spectroscopy did not show any evidence of vascular events or metabolic disorder. Results: A repeated cMRI with a contrast agent showed a progressive left-sided hemiatrophy with leptomeningeal angiomatosis at the age of 3.5 years. This radiographic finding was accompanied by a mild and continuous right-sided hemiparesis with symmetrical reflexes. At the age of 3 years, the child presented with sudden and short right-sided drop attacks which were not associated with unconciousness or any abnormalities in EEG. Conclusion: Despite the lack of classical skin and ocular manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome, the patient's radiologic findings are well compatible with this disorder. Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) can also be considered in the differential diagnosis as the aunt of the patient was reported to suffer from FHM-like symptoms. A molecular genetic testing of the family for the three typical FHM genes was however unremarkable.

N2  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

N2  - The transition from pregnancy to lactation is the most stressful period in the life of a cow. During this transition, homeorhetic adaptations are coordinated across almost every organ and are marked by changes in hormones and metabolism to accommodate the increased energetic demands of lactation. Recent data from our laboratory showed that changes in circadian clocks occur in multiple tissues during the transition period in rats and indicate that the circadian system coordinates changes in the physiology of the dam needed to support lactation. Circadian rhythms coordinate the timing of physiological processes and synchronize these processes with the environment of the animal. Circadian rhythms are generated by molecular circadian clocks located in the hypothalamus (the master clock) and peripherally in every organ of the body. The master clock receives environmental and physiological cues and, in turn, synchronizes internal physiology by coordinating endocrine rhythms and metabolism through peripheral clocks. The effect of the circadian clock on lactation may be inferred by the photoperiod effect on milk production, which is accompanied by coordinated changes in the endocrine system and metabolic capacity of the dam to respond to changes in day length. We have shown that bovine mammary epithelial cells possess a functional clock that can be synchronized by external stimuli, and the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like gene, a positive limb of the core clock, is responsive to prolactin in bovine mammary explants. Others showed that 7% of genes expressed in breasts of lactating women had circadian patterns of expression, and we report that the diurnal variation of composition of bovine milk is associated with changes in expression of mammary core clock genes. Together these studies indicate that the circadian system coordinates the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation, and we believe that the capacity of the dam to produce milk and cope with metabolic stresses in early lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms during the transition period. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

N2  - Objectives: We wished to prospectively assess how successful we were at asking about and accurately recording data relating to three important aspects of ongoing diabetes: neuropathy symptoms such as erectile dysfunction (in men), pregnancy plans (in women of childbearing age) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in all patients. Methods: We collected anonymised information about the content of the diabetes review consultation through two main processes: first, a post-consultation screening questionnaire which was given to patients in the manner of an exit poll; second, data from the diabetes database DIABETA 3 was mined to reveal whether young females had their pregnancy intentions discussed. Results: With regard to neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, OSA symptoms and pregnancy we discovered that patients with diabetes attending the annual review clinic were infrequently asked about the above and overall that diabetologists fared poorly in enquiring about these different issues.With regard to pregnancy in tentions and arranging follow-up pre-conception planning, only 23 per cent of female patients (of child-bearing age, 16-45 years) were asked about this. Discussion: It would appear that the diabetes review clinic is suboptimal in its ability to explore and screen for signs and symptoms of OSA in all patients, neuropathy, such as erectile dysfunction in men, and crucially finding out about pregnancy plans in young females.We shall explore ways of improving such an important aspect of ongoing diabetes care.

N2  - Environmental variables such as photoperiod, heat, stress, nutrition and other external factors have profound effects on quality and quantity of a dairy cow's milk. The way in which the environment interacts with genotype to impact milk production is unknown; however, evidence from our laboratory suggests that circadian clocks play a role. Daily and seasonal endocrine rhythms are coordinated in mammals by the master circadian clock in the hypothalamus. Peripheral clocks are distributed in every organ and coordinated by signals from the master clock. We and others have shown that there is a circadian clock in the mammary gland. Approximately 7% of the genes expressed during lactation had circadian patterns including core clock and metabolic genes. Amplitude changes occurred in the core mammary clock genes during the transition from pregnancy to lactation and were coordinated with changes in molecular clocks among multiple tissues. In vitro studies using a bovine mammary cell line showed that external stimulation synchronized mammary clocks, and expression of the core clock gene, BMAL1, was induced by lactogens. Female clock/clock mutant mice, which have disrupted circadian rhythms, have impaired mammary development and their offspring failed to thrive suggesting that the dam's milk production was not adequate enough to nourish their young. We envision that, in mammals, during the transition from pregnancy to lactation the master clock is modified by environmental and physiological cues that it receives, including photoperiod length. In turn, the master clock coordinates changes in endocrine milieu that signals peripheral tissues. In dairy cows, it is clear that changes in photoperiod during the dry period and/or during lactation influences milk production. We believe that the photoperiod effect on milk production is mediated, in part by the 'setting' of the master clock with light, which modifies peripheral circadian clocks including the mammary core clock and subsequently impacts milk yield and may impact milk composition. © Copyright The Animal Consortium 2011.

N2  - Fetal sleep states emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve multiple interconnected neuronal networks. We examined whether fetal sleep characteristics predict child and adolescent self-regulation in a non-clinical sample (study group, n=25; reference group, n=48). Combined recordings of three sleep variables (fetal heart rate, body movements and rapid eye movements) were made for 2. h at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Fetuses showing synchronous change of sleep variables (i.e. within 3. min) at transition from quiet into active sleep reached a higher level of effortful control, both at 8-9 and 14-15 years, than fetuses not making synchronous transitions and compared with the reference group. Results are discussed from a Developmental Origins of Behavior, Health and Disease (DOBHaD) point of view. It is concluded that studying sleep ontogeny offers the possibility to gain insight into brain maturational processes and/or environmental adaptive processes that may have long term behavioral developmental consequences. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: The incidence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is rising, paralleling the increase in obesity. There is scant data on the impact of OSA on fetal outcome. We hypothesised that OSA may impact on fetal well being in late pregnancy, as evidenced (chronically) by impaired fetal growth and (acutely) by abnormal CTG findings during polysomnography (PSG) among women with OSA. Methods: We undertook a prospective cohort study, recruiting 41 women following administration of screening questionnaires regarding sleep disordered breathing in the midtrimester. Fetal biometry to estimate fetal weight was performed at 32 weeks. Customised GROW charts were used to determine fetal growth trajectory between 32 weeks and delivery. Synchronous CTG and PSG were performed at 37 weeks. Cord blood to measure endocrine markers of fetal growth was taken at delivery. Results: Among women with OSA, 5/10 (50%) had IUGR or displayed slowing growth through the 3rd trimester (>30% fall in customised centile) compared to 6/31 (19%) of controls (P = 0.07). Consistent with this, the cord blood of women with OSA had lower levels of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (P < 0.05), and a corresponding rise in IGFBP2 and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). Only one fetus demonstrated a pathological deceleration in association with oxygen desaturation overnight; this fetus was confirmed to be growth restricted at delivery. Conclusion: Women with OSA have a trend towards slowed fetal growth in the third trimester, with corresponding alterations in endocrine regulators of fetal growth. Fetuses with underlying uteroplacental insufficiency may tolerate the repeated maternal desaturations of OSA poorly. OSA may be an important contributor to adverse fetal outcomes observed among obese women.

N2  - Introduction: Antenatal depression predicts a range of adverse child outcomes, including disturbed infant sleep [1]. Recent gene-environment interaction studies, using this specific polymorphism, suggest that the polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene area (5-HTTLPR) may moderate the effect of negative early life events on a number of phenotypic outcomes. Only one study has looked at antenatal mental health, more specifically, antenatal anxiety and infant temperament; infants with the short allele scored significantly higher on negative emotionality if their mothers had reported higher levels of antenatal anxiety [2]. Reactive temperament has also been shown to be a moderator of the effects of a range of negative life events on developmental outcomes. Infant sleep is identified as an important marker of early bio-behavioural development and a predictor of cognitive development. Serotonin has been extensively linked to the study of sleep and there is now evidence to suggest that it is implicated in both sleep and wake promoting processes. This study examined two moderators, a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene area and infant reactive temperament. Methods: We examined whether the association of antenatal depression at 32 weeks gestation (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and infant sleep at 6 months (measured as total sleep time and number of awakenings) would be moderated (a) by the polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter gene area 5HTTLPR and (b) by mother-rated reactive temperament, in a large population cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children, n = 5,402). We hypothesized that a. the association between maternal mood disturbance and infant sleep would be stronger in those infants with low activity alleles of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) compared to those with high activity alleles b. the association between maternal mood disturbance and infant sleep would be stronger in infants with reactive temperament. Infants with more reactive temperament would be more susceptible to the effects of antenatal depression and would exhibit less total sleep time and a higher number of awakenings. Results: Depression was not found to predict sleep at 6 months. Regression models did however reveal a significant gene×environment interaction for total sleep time (b = 0.05, p = 0.01) and number of awakenings (b = 0.042, p = 0.03), supporting the idea of differential vulnerability. Results were not in the expected direction with infants carrying the low activity alleles who had been exposed to antenatal depression exhibiting more total sleep time and a lower number of awakenings. Conclusion: This study reports a significant gene×environment interaction effect. These findings suggest different developmental trajectories for individuals carrying different alleles. They further support that certain alleles are associated with differential vulnerability to negative life events, such as antenatal maternal depression, even during very early development.

N2  - Anyplans for pregnancy must be discussed in detail withwomenwith bipolar disorders. They must be informed about the risks related to it and the need for some precautions. Because of the risk of relapse during pregnancy, the risk/benefit ratio of maintaining or starting prophylactic treatment should be assessed, taking into account family history and frequency of recurrences. Lithium may be used during pregnancy under close monitoring. Most anticonvulsants are contraindicated because of their teratogenicity. During the postpartum period, prophylaxis is required in most cases because of the high risk of relapse. If no prophylaxis was given during pregnancy, it must be started quickly after delivery to be effective when the risk is at its highest, i.e., during the first two weeks after delivery. Women with bipolar disorders should be advised against breast-feeding to avoid exposure of the infant to psychotropic medication. Because breastfeeding can be stressful and causes sleep deprivation, it may increase the risk of relapse. Second-generation antipsychotic agents should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding because inadequate information is currently available about their safety.

N2  - Objective. To describe the background characteristics of women who gave birth to their first child at an advanced and very advanced maternal age, including their sociodemographic background, social relationships, health behavior, physical and mental health, and reproductive history. Design. Cross-sectional data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Setting. Norway. Sample. 41 236 Norwegian-speaking nulliparous women. Methods. Data were collected by the first questionnaire distributed in week 17 of pregnancy during the recruitment period 1999-2008. The distribution of descriptive variables in relation to age was investigated, by means of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Main outcome measures. Advanced (33-37 years) and very advanced (≥38 years) maternal age. Results. Women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age differed from the younger women with regard to a wide range of background characteristics, and this difference was most pronounced for the very advanced group. Problems related to physical aging were more common (infertility, physical health problems, sleep problems, depression and fatigue). Of the sociodemographic factors; high annual income and low level of education were most strongly correlated with high maternal age, followed by single status, unemployment, unsatisfactory relationship with partner and unplanned pregnancy. Conclusions. Besides having more age-related reproductive and physical health problems, women who had their first baby at an advanced or very advanced age constituted a heterogeneous group characterized by either socioeconomic prosperity or vulnerability. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione in a patient with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency. Background: SSADH deficiency is a disorder of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) degradation caused by mutations in ALDH5A1. Clinical manifestations are variable and include intellectual disability, expressive language deficit, epilepsy, hypotonia, ataxia, and sleep disorders. There is no effective treatment. Therapeutic interventions used in humans or murine models include vigabatrin, phenobarbital, other antiepileptics, and taurine. The pathophysiology of SSADH deficiency is not well understood, and it is unclear whether elevated GABA, high GHB, deficiency of TCA cycle intermediates, or some other mechanism contributes to the clinical phenotype. Mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and decreased glutathione levels may contribute to the pathophysiology of SSADH deficiency based on in vitro studies and experimental model results. Methods and Results: We describe a patient who presented at 4 months of age with hypotonia, head lag, exaggerated startle response and episodes of stiffening. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Brain MRI at age 4 months was normal. EEG showed bursts of paroxysmal sharp brain activity. She was diagnosed with SSADH deficiency based on grossly elevated 4-hydroxybutyric acid in urine as well as two heterozygous mutations in ALDH5A1: c.610-612A>G (IVS3-2A>G) in intron 3 and c.1333A>C (p.M445L) in exon 9. She has been treated with vigabatrin and taurine with some albeit little efficacy. To further the understanding of pathophysiology of SSADH deficiency and to evaluate whether signs of oxidative stress suggested by murine models can be demonstrated humans, we measured levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in our patient by tandem mass spectrometry. The level of GSH as well as GSH/GSSG ratio was more than 2 SD below age-matched control values and the level of GSSG more than 2SD above control values (Table). (Table presented) Conclusions: We report on a patient with early-onset SSADH deficiency for which we demonstrate low GSH and high GSSG levels suggesting mitochondrial redox imbalance. This is the first report in humans showing biochemical evidence of oxidative stress in SSADH deficiency. Targeting the oxidative stress axis, e.g. by supplementing with N-acetylcysteine or other antioxidants, may be a treatment modality worth considering in SSADH deficiency if our initial findings are confirmed in other patients.

N2  - A wide variety of psychiatric disorders occur in the puerperium, but childbirth is a particularly potent trigger for mood episodes in bipolar disorder. Women with bipolar disorder are also at a high risk for postpartum psychosis, with episodes closely following 25- 50% of deliveries. The rate increases to approximately 60% among women who have both bipolar disorder and a personal or family history of puerperal psychosis. The puerperium is also a vulnerable period for a diagnostic switch from major depressive disorder to bipolar disorder, and in some women an episode of postpartum depression may herald bipolar disorder. The proximity of mood and psychotic episodes to the time of delivery, and the brief duration of the high-risk period (approximately two weeks) pose treatment challenges. Misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as major depressive disorder is not uncommon and can be associated with serious consequences. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic studies on the preventative and acute treatment of postpartum mood and psychotic episodes. Currently there are no treatment strategies for primary prevention of postpartum-onset bipolar disorder in women who are at-risk for onset of bipolar disorder. The close temporal association of childbirth and bipolar disorder should provide a window of opportunity to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes via interventions aimed at early detection and diagnosis of bipolar disorder, prevention of mood and psychotic episodes, and prompt recognition and treatment of emerging psychopathology. Given the rapid onset of puerperal psychosis and bipolar mood episodes, universal screening during pregnancy is critical for early identification of women who are at high risk for bipolar disorder and puerperal psychosis. Women with postpartum depression should also be routinely assessed for bipolar disorder. It is important to address modifiable risk factors (such as sleep deprivation) that might increase the risk of postpartum mood instability. An understanding of how biological and psychosocial factors interact to increase the risk for onset or exacerbation of bipolar mood episodes should stimulate a search for new strategies in the prevention and treatment of bipolar disorder in the postpartum period.

N2  - Objectives: To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors. Design: A prospective, follow-up study. Setting: A teaching medical center in central Taiwan. Participants: A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women. Methods: Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality. Results: The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period. © 2012 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

N2  - Background: The use of digital thermometers to record axillary temperatures is standard practice in neonatal care. These measurements are invasive and may disturb infants sleep and developmental care routine. Infrared thermometers are able to measure heat radiating from an arterial blood supply under the skin, at a distance of 1-2 cm from the source. The aim of this study was to compare measurements obtained from three infrared devices: No Touch, Thermofocus and ExergenScanner, with our standard digital axillary thermometer and to examine changes in neonatal behaviour that temperature monitoring may cause. Method: Preterm infants weighing ≤1500 g were eligible. Infants were observed for pre-measurement behaviour-state using a 5-point Wolff and Prechtl neonatal behaviour scale. One infrared temperature was taken from each of the devices, followed by an axillary measurement. Further behaviour-state observations were recorded following infrared and axillary measurements. Statistical analysis included Bland and Altman comparative analysis and t-test. Results: 100 measurements were collected from each infrared device among our cohort of infants (mean gestation 28.4 weeks, weight 1045 g). No Touch showed greatest agreement with bias -0.071 (95% limits agreement -0.68-0.54). Thermofocus (bias -1.34; 95% limits agreement -2.62- 0.5) and ExergenScanner (bias -0.56; 95% limits agreement -1.38-0.25) demonstrated less agreement. Neonatal behaviour scores increased by mean of 1.44 points between infrared and axillary measurements (95% confidence interval 1.21-1.67, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Temperature measurements taken with No Touch thermometer showed greatest agreement with axillary measurements and demonstrated less disruption to infants' behaviour-state.

N2  - Background: OTCD is the most common of the urea cycle disorders, occurring in approximately 1:70,000. OTCD is inherited in an X-linked pattern; while affected males often present with critical hyperammonemia in the neonatal period, heterozygous females may present in a variety of manners ranging from severe effects to no symptoms at all. While headaches are reported to be a symptom of hyperammonemia, there is no data on the prevalence and characterization of headaches among OTCD carriers. Objective: To investigate the prevalence, severity, and characteristics of headaches in OTCD carriers and to determine whether these are different than in the general population. Design/methods: An anonymous survey was distributed to 16-65 year old women, both OTCD carriers and controls, and completed either on paper at the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation (NUCDF) Family Conference or electronically via a secure website. Thirty carriers of the OTCD mutation and 15 controls completed the survey. Results: The carriers and controls were not statistically different in age, BMI, hours of sleep per night, annual income, education, marital status, or depression incidence. There was no statistical difference in diet, caffeine intake, or in the prevalence of headaches between the two groups. A larger percentage of carriers than controls had ever been pregnant (Table 1). Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that headaches are more severe and of longer duration in OTCD carriers than in controls. This study suggests that migraine-like headaches may be more common in the carrier group. However, OTCD carriers do not seek medical help for their headaches more often than controls. We recommend that all clinicians caring for OTCD carriers screen their patients for headaches and offer treatment. Further study is needed to investigate whether OTCD carriers that suffer from headaches have a low-level chronic hyperammonemia that contributes to their symptomatology.

N2  - The cellular circadian clock and systemic cues drive rhythmicity in the transcriptome of adult peripheral tissues. However, the oscillating status of the circadian clocks in fetal tissues, and their response to maternal cues, are less clear. Most clock genes do not cycle in fetal livers from mice and rats, although tissue level rhythms rapidly emerge when fetal mouse liver explants are cultured in vitro. Thus, in the fetal mouse liver, the circadian clock does not oscillate at the cellular level (but is induced to oscillate in culture). To gain a comprehensive overview of the clock status in the fetal liver during late gestation, we performed microarray analyses on fetal liver tissues. In the fetal liver we did not observe circadian rhythms of clock gene expression or many other transcripts known to be rhythmically expressed in the adult liver. Nevertheless, JTK_CYCLE analysis identified some transcripts in the fetal liver that were rhythmically expressed, albeit at low amplitudes. Upon data filtering by coefficient of variation, the expression levels for transcripts related to pancreatic exocrine enzymes and zymogen secretion were found to undergo synchronized daily fluctuations at high amplitudes. These results suggest that maternal cues influence the fetal liver, despite the fact that we did not detect circadian rhythms of canonical clock gene expression in the fetal liver. These results raise important questions on the role of the circadian clock, or lack thereof, during ontogeny. © 2012 Li et al.

N2  - Arterial blood pressure is subject to a circadian rhythm that results in a fall of blood pressure during the night. In patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, left-ventricular hypertrophy, sleep apnea, hypertension of pregnancy, and different forms of secondary hypertension a nocturnal fall of blood pressure is even abandoned or reverted. Diagnosis is made using 24-h blood pressure measurement, which is however used not frequently enough for a clinical assessment or adjustment of therapy. An adaption of the selection or the time of administration of antihypertensive drugs with respect to the circadian rhythm is beneficial to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular morbidity. This is particularly true for patients with an a non- or inverted dipping blood pressure pattern, in which the bedtime dosing may result in a normalization of blood pressure and restoration of a normal circadian rhythm. The present manuscript reviews the chronopharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension and grant practical recommendations for their translation into clinical practice. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG • Stuttgart New York.

N2  - Night work involving disruption of circadian rhythm was suggested as a possible cause of breast cancer. We examined the role of night work in a large population-based case-control study carried out in France between 2005 and 2008. Lifetime occupational history including work schedules of each night work period was elicited in 1,232 cases of breast cancer and 1,317 population controls. Thirteen percent of the cases and 11% of the controls had ever worked on night shifts (OR = 1.27 [95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.64]). Odds ratios were 1.35 [1.01-1.80] in women who worked on overnight shifts, 1.40 [1.01-1.92] in women who had worked at night for 4.5 or more years, and 1.43 [1.01-2.03] in those who worked less than three nights per week on average. The odds ratio was 1.95 [1.13-3.35] in women employed in night work for >4 years before their first full-term pregnancy, a period where mammary gland cells are incompletely differentiated and possibly more susceptible to circadian disruption effects. Our results support the hypothesis that night work plays a role in breast cancer, particularly in women who started working at night before first full-term pregnancy. Copyright © 2012 UICC.

N2  - Background: Infant crying and sleep problems (e.g. frequent night waking, difficulties settling to sleep) each affect up to 30% of infants and often co-exist. They are costly to manage and associated with adverse outcomes including postnatal depression symptoms, early weaning from breast milk, and later child behaviour problems. Preventing such problems could improve these adverse outcomes and reduce costs to families and the health care system. Anticipatory guidance - i.e. providing parents with information about normal infant sleep and cry patterns, ways to encourage self-settling in infants, and ways to develop feeding and settling routines before the onset of problems - could prevent such problems. This paper outlines the protocol for our study which aims to test an anticipatory guidance approach. Methods: 750 families from four Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia have been randomised to receive the Baby Business program (intervention group) or usual care (control group) offered by health services. The Baby Business program provides parents with information about infant sleep and crying via a DVD and booklet (mailed soon after birth), telephone consultation (at infant age 6-8 weeks) and parent group session (at infant age 12 weeks). All English speaking parents of healthy newborn infants born at >32 weeks gestation and referred by their maternal and child health nurse at their first post partum home visit (day 7-10 postpartum), are eligible. The primary outcome is parent report of infant night time sleep as a problem at four months of age and secondary outcomes include parent report of infant daytime sleep or crying as a problem, mean duration of infant sleep and crying/24 hours, parental depression symptoms, parent sleep quality and quantity and health service use. Data will be collected at two weeks (baseline), four months and six months of age. An economic evaluation using a cost-consequences approach will, from a societal perspective, compare costs and health outcomes between the intervention and control groups. Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial of a program which aims to prevent both infant sleeping and crying problems and associated postnatal depression symptoms. If effective, it could offer an important public health prevention approach to these common, distressing problems.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN63834603.

N2  - Throughout gestation, the close relationship between mothers and their progeny ensures adequate development and a successful transition to postnatal life. By living inside the maternal compartment, the fetus is inevitably exposed to rhythms of the maternal internal milieu such as temperature; rhythms originated by maternal food intake and maternal melatonin, one of the few maternal hormones that cross the placenta unaltered. The fetus, immature by adult standards, is however perfectly fit to accomplish the dual functions of living in the uterine environment and developing the necessary tools to " mature" for the next step, i.e. to be a competent newborn. In the fetal physiological context, organ function differs from the same organ's function in the newborn and adult. This may also extend to the developing circadian system. The information reviewed here suggests that the fetal circadian system is organized differently from that of the adult. Moreover, the fetal circadian rhythm is not just present simply as the initial immature expression of a mechanism that has function in the postnatal animal only. We propose that the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and fetal organs are peripheral maternal circadian oscillators, entrained by different maternal signals. Conceptually, the arrangement produces internal temporal order during fetal life, inside the maternal compartment. Following birth, it will allow for postnatal integration of the scattered fetal circadian clocks into an adult-like circadian system commanded by the SCN. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Circadian rhythms impact on a wide range of physiological systems and this impact extends to fertility, such that disruptions to timing systems can impact upon reproductive capacity. This is highlighted most obviously in mutant mouse models whereby deletion or mutation of single genes results not only in disrupted circadian rhythmicity, but also compromised male and female reproductive function. In this review, we discuss the presence of circadian clocks in female and male reproductive tissues and the role these clocks play in the generation of oestrus cycles, ovulation, sperm generation, implantation and the maintenance of pregnancy. Given the increased incidence of shiftwork and international travel which disrupt circadian rhythmicity, and the increasing prevalence of reproductive technologies whereby early embryo development occurs without external time cues, it is important for us to consider the role of circadian rhythms in fertility. © 2011.

N2  - The identification of circadian clocks in endocrine tissues has added considerable depth and complexity to our understanding of their physiology. A growing body of research reveals circadian clock gene expression in the uterus of non-pregnant and pregnant rodents. This review will focus on the mammalian uterus and its rhythmicity, particularly as it pertains to the circadian timing of parturition. This key event in the reproductive axis shows dramatic species-specific differences in its circadian phase. It is proposed here that these differences in the phasing of mammalian parturition are likely a function of opposite uterine cell responses to humoral cues. The argument will be made that melatonin fulfills many of the criteria to serve as a circadian signal in the initiation of human parturition, including specific actions on uterine smooth muscle cells that are consistent with a role for this hormone in the circadian timing of parturition. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women. Design: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital and participants' home environments. Participants: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%) napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. Conclusions: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

N2  - Objective: We examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), cesarean section (CS), low Apgar score (at 5 minutes after delivery), and preeclampsia in pregnant women with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study Design: Our subjects included 791 women with OSA and 3955 randomly selected women without OSA. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without OSA. Results: Compared with women without OSA, adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia in women with OSA were 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.282.40), 2.31 (95% CI, 1.773.01), 1.34 (95% CI, 1.091.66), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.482.04), and 1.60 (95% CI, 2.1611.26), respectively. Conclusion: Pregnant women with OSA are at increased risk for having LBW, preterm, and SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia, compared with pregnant women without OSA. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Aim To evaluate self-reported satisfaction and barriers to initiating real-time continuous glucose monitoring in early pregnancy among women with pregestational diabetes. Methods Fifty-four women with Type 1 diabetes and 14 women with Type 2 diabetes were offered continuous glucose monitoring for 6days at median 9 (range 6-14) gestational weeks and were asked to answer a semi-structured questionnaire on patient satisfaction. Results Median HbA1c was 49 (range 34-86) mmol/mol) [6.6 (5.3-10.0) %] and duration of diabetes was 12 (0.5-37) years. Continuous glucose monitoring was used for 6 (0.5-7) days, with 43 (65%) women using continuous glucose monitoring for at least 5days. The women experienced 2.7 (0-12) alarms per 24h, of which approximately one third was technical alarms and one third disturbed their sleep. Sixteen women (24%) reported discomfort with continuous glucose monitoring during daytime and twelve (18%) during sleep. Many women reported improved diabetes understanding (52%) and would recommend continuous glucose monitoring to others (83%). Twenty-four patients (36%) had continuous glucose monitoring removed earlier than planned ( before the intended 6days of initial monitoring). Ten women (15%) did not wish to use continuous glucose monitoring again in pregnancy. Main causes behind early removal of continuous glucose monitoring were self-reported skin irritation, technical problems and continuous glucose monitoring inaccuracy. No differences were found in continuous glucose monitoring use, inconvenience or compliance with respect to diabetes type. Conclusions The majority of pregnant women with diabetes found real-time continuous glucose monitoring useful and the intervention was equally tolerated regardless of diabetes type. Nevertheless, continuous glucose monitoring was frequently removed earlier than planned, primarily because of skin irritation, technical problems and inaccuracy. © 2012 The Authors.

N2  - The cardiovascular structure is temporally organized in both health and disease. The link between obesity and hypertension is elevated sympathetic nervous system activity and hormonal activity which present a clear rhythmicity, with the pineal, corticosteroid and leptin systems being those most implicated. Also, genetic mutations or deletions have implicated peripheral clock genes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, which are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. As hypertension and obesity are related, and the treatments of these disorders are well established but sometimes ineffective, this review focuses on chronobiological contributions to decrease the burden of hypertension and obesity in low- and middle-income groups of individuals. MEDLINE, Pubmed and SUMSearch sites (2001-2011) were used in the search strategy, together with the keywords: "antihypertensive drugs"; "arterial hypertension"; "circadian rhythms"; "obesity"; and "sleep quality". Eighty-six articles were found and 50 articles from these were selected. A link between the circadian clock and hypertension has recently been described in animal models, using Clock-mutant mice that display metabolic syndrome. Experimental evidence clearly implicates circadian rhythms in the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Most clinical studies of BP focus on some pathological situation, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes or pregnancy with blood biomarker alterations. However, epidemiological evidence for the role of circadian rhythms in hypertension has been lacking until recently. In Brazil, in an epidemiological, cross-sectional study, changed sleep quality and an earlier phase of mid-sleep were found in those using antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, some pharmacological studies support a circadian- and dose-dependent relationship in the use of antihypertensive drugs for the 24-h control of BP. In low- and middle-income areas, cost-effectiveness of any intervention is fundamental to the implementation of any kind of public-health policy. Therefore, improvements in diagnosis, effectiveness and implementing prevention measures to control the risk of disease are all necessary, and there is evidence that chronobiology has an important role to play. Consequently, it is important to provide guidelines to monitor BP to reduce cardiovascular risk that include chronobiological aspects of the problem. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background: Scheduled infliximab infusions are effective inducing and maintaining remission in IBD. Compliance with the schedule is important to avoid infusional reactions and loss of response. The aim of this report is to assess the compliance to this treatment in our Unit. Methods: All infliximab infusions received in the IBD Day Care Centre of our hospital since its opening in March 2007 were recorded. Treatment schedule consists in an induction phase 0, 2, 6 weeks and maintenance every 8 weeks. Treatment intensification was prescribed following medical criteria. Infusion delay was defined when the interval between two maintenance doses exceeded 63 days (9 weeks) or when infusion was delayed more than 5 days from calculated date in the induction phase. Intervals when treatment was stopped due to pregnancy, “drug holidays” by medical criteria, etc were excluded. We define “non-adherent patient” when at least three doses and ≥ 25% of the total are delayed. Results: 128 patients received 1508 infliximab infusions in our hospital from March 2007 to October 2011. Mean number of infusions was 11.78 (SD 8.9). 60 patients (46.9%) were male and 68 (53.1%) female. The indication was Crohn's disease in 98 patients (76.5%) and ulcerative colitis in 30 (23.4%). Age at start of the therapy was 39 years (SD 14.6 range 15 77). 74 patients (57.81%) had some dose delayed, being 1.73 the mean number of infusion delayed (SD 2.4). Mean delay was 11.97 days (SD 16.4 median 7 days). Only 19 (14.84%) patients had at least one interval between doses greater than 12 weeks. 13 patients were defined as non-adherent (10,15%) 8 male (53.3%) and 5 female. The type of disease was Crohn in 9 cases (69.2%) and ulcerative colitis in 4 (30.8%). Differences between adherent (AP) and non-adherent patients (NAP) were analyzed: there is no difference in gender or type of disease. Statistically significant differences were found in mean age at start of the therapy (39.44 SD 14.6 AP vs 25.67 SD 5.6 NAP, p < 0.001), number of doses received 11.78 SD 8.9 AP vs 19.15 SD 7.9, NAP p < 0.001), and time on therapy (202.25 SD 9.6 AP vs 99.3 SD 94.9 NAP, p < 0.001). There is no difference in treatment intensification need between both groups; 24 of 115 patients (20.8%) in adherent vs 3 of 13 (23%) in non-adherent (p = NS). Conclusions: Our patients have a good scheduled doses compliance on infliximab therapy in our Unit, even after years of treatment. Risk factors for poor compliance are young patients and need of prolonged therapy.

N2  - Aim: After in utero exposure to tricyclic antidepressants, neonatal withdrawal symptoms have been reported with an estimated incidence between 20 and 50%; however, few data are available for clomipramine. This could also be the case for neonatal pharmacokinetic clomipramine parameters and so this study was set up. Methods: Babies exposed to clomipramine in utero were included in an observational study, approved by the local ethics committee, after written informed consent. Withdrawal symptoms were scored at 12, 24 and 48h after birth using the Finnegan score. Plasma concentrations were determined using an in-house-developed, validated liquid chromatography with mass detection (LC-MSMS) method at 0, 12, 24 and 48h after birth. Results: We found that three of 11 pregnancies were complicated with pre-eclampsia. Ten neonates were observed for clomipramine withdrawal symptoms. The observed withdrawal symptoms were too short a period of sleep after feeding (6), poor feeding (3), mild to severe tremors (6), hyperactive Moro reflex (3) and respiratory rate >60 breaths min-1. Serious withdrawal reactions, such as tachycardia and cyanosis, were seen. We calculated a half-life value of 42 ± 16h for clomipramine in neonates. Only a weak correlation was found between withdrawal reactions and clomipramine plasma concentration or desmethylclomipramine plasma concentration. Conclusions: In neonates, clomipramine is eliminated with a half-life value of 42h, compared with 20h in adults. In two of 10 neonates, tachycardia and cyanosis were seen as serious withdrawal symptoms after maternal use of clomipramine. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Background: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relation between sleeping arrangements and infant cortisol reactivity to stressors in the first two post-natal months. Co-sleeping, as compared to solitary sleeping, is hypothesized to provide more parental external stress regulation by night, thus reducing general stress sensitivity. We therefore expected lower cortisol reactivity to stress in infants who co-slept more regularly. Methods: Participants were 163 mothers and infants from uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. Mothers completed daily diaries on sleeping arrangements in the first 7 weeks of life. Co-sleeping was defined as sleeping in the parents' bedroom (i.e. own or parents' bed). Cortisol reactivity was measured twice: to a mild physical stressor (bathing session) at 5 weeks of age and to a mild pain stressor (vaccination) at 2 months of age. Results: Infants with a solitary sleeping arrangement in their first month of life showed a heightened cortisol response to the bathing session at 5 weeks compared to infants that co-slept regularly. This effect was not explained by breastfeeding practices, maternal caregiving behavior, or infants' night waking and sleep duration. No effects were found of co-sleeping on the cortisol response to the vaccination at 2 months. Conclusions: The results suggest that solitary sleeping in the first month of life is associated with heightened sensitivity of the HPA-axis to a mild stressor, possibly due to less nocturnal parental availability as external stress regulator. Whether this effect continues in later life, remains to be investigated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Over the past two decades, research has identified extrasynaptic GABAA receptor populations that enable neurons to sense the low ambient GABA concentrations present in the extracellular space in order to generate a form of tonic inhibition not previously considered in studies of neuronal excitability. The importance of this tonic inhibition in regulating states of consciousness is highlighted by the fact that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are believed to be key targets for anesthetics, sleep-promoting drugs, neurosteroids, and alcohol. The neurosteroid sensitivity of these extrasynaptic GABAARs may explain their importance in stress-, ovarian cycle-, and pregnancy-related mood disorders. Moreover, disruptions in network dynamics associated with schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease may well involve alterations in the tonic GABAAR-mediated conductance. Extrasynaptic GABAARs may therefore present a therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases, with the potential to enhance cognition and aid poststroke functional recovery. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Circadian rhythms are observed in a wide range of physiological processes. Circadian genes have been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic derangements in both animal and human studies. Our objective was to use a candidate gene approach to determine if common genetic variants in circadian clock genes are associated with maternal glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN: Genotyping was performed on the Illumina 610 quad and 1M platforms as part of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study. We examined 997 genotyped or imputed SNPs within 50 kb of circadian clock genes CLOCK, BMAL, CRY1, CRY2, PER1 and PER2 for their relationship with maternal glucose tolerance as assessed by a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 28 weeks gestation in 1392 Northern European (NE), 841 Mexican Americans (MA) and 1148 Afro-Carib (AC) mothers from the HAPO cohort. We assessed the association between clock gene polymorphisms and maternal glucose using linear regression under an additive model, adjusting for field center, ancestry, maternal age, height, BMI and blood pressure, parity, gestational age at OGTT and neonatal gender. RESULTS: Several polymorphisms in CRY2 were associated with maternal 1-hr plasma glucose (1hPG) in NE mothers. The A allele of rs11605924 was associated with a higher 1hPG of 0.16 mg/dL per A-allele (s.e. 0.047; p=8.0 x 10-5). In MA mothers, several SNPs in CRY1 were associated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. Each copy of the T allele of rs10778528 was associated with lower FPG levels of 0.14 mg/dL (se 0.046; p=1.6 x 10-4). Data for the SNPs for all three ethnic-racial groups, as well as a mega-analysis (joint analysis of all three of the populations), are shown in the Table. CONCLUSION: Common genetic variants in circadian clock genes may be associated with maternal glycemia in pregnancy. The different associations in the three populations may result from an interaction with unknown factors which differ between populations. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy affects on women's sleep physiologically and psychologically. Poor sleep quality in late pregnancy seems to be a predictive of depressive symptoms at first few weeks of post birth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between quality of sleep in late pregnancy and postpartum depressive symptoms. Methods: This prospective longitudinal study was performed on 156 women with gestational age of 28-30 weeks from 10 prenatal care clinics of Qom, Iran. Subjects completed a questionnaire including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Childbirth Attitudes Questionnaire (CAQ) at 28 and again at 38 weeks of gestation. Three months after delivery, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Data was analyzed by Chi-square test, Mantel Haenszel and logistic regression and Two-Way ANOVA Analysis of Variance using SPSS softwareversion16. Results: Significant relationship was found between quality sleep scores at 28 and 38 weeks of gestation and postpartum depressive symptoms (p>0.05). Inappropriate sleep quality at 28 weeks (OR=3.9) and 38 weeks (OR=3.4) increases the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms nearly four times (p=0.03). Conclusion: Quality of sleep is a predisposing factor of postpartum depression. Therefore, assessing the sleep quality of pregnant women and providing proper interventions during pregnancy is suggested to reduce the rate of postpartum depression.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate the correlations between untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), maternal, and neonatal morbidity in a cohort of obese pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to identify risk factors and outcomes of OSA among obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) pregnant women. Subjects underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA) that recorded nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movements. All studies were manually scored by a central masked Sleep Reading Center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index (AHI)≥5 was considered to be diagnostic of OSA, [Mild (AHI: 5-15), Moderate (AHI: 15-30) and Severe (AHI:>30]. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA (p5 days, and readmission. Evaluated neonatal outcomes were: NICU admission, RDS, transient tachypnea (TTN), sepsis, and death. RESULTS: Among 170 evaluated obese women, the prevalence of OSA was 12.4% (12 mild, 7 moderate, 2 severe). Women with OSA had a mean AHI of 20+/-6 events per hour of sleep and spent 6.5+/-2.5% of the night with an SpO2 <90%. Compared with controls, the OSA group had higher BMIs (49+/-11 vs. 39+/-6 k/m2, p<0.001) but similar rates of chronic hypertension (58 vs. 33%, p=0.07) and pregestational diabetes (15 vs. 20%, p=0.76). Severe maternal complications included: Maternal death (N=1, amniotic fluid embolus, control group) and cardiac arrest (N=1, intraoperative at cesarean delivery,OSAgroup). One previable birth and 2 stillbirths occurred in the control group. Among livebirths, OSA was associated with more frequent PET, NICU admission and TTN. (Table). After controlling for BMI, OSA was not associated with PET [OR .4(.11-1.4, p=0.15). After controlling for diabetes, gestational age and cesarean, neonates of women with OSA were more likely to have TTN (OR 4.7 (1.1-19.1, p=0.02) CONCLUSION: Untreated OSA among obese women in pregnancy is associated with more frequent neonatal respiratory complications (Table Presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although the hormonal and physiologic changes of pregnancy may increase the risk of sleep apnea (SA), it remains unknown to what extent women who do not have SA develop it as pregnancy progresses. The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence of and risk factors for new-onset SA during pregnancy among a population at risk. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a history of preeclampsia were recruited to undergo a sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), an ambulatory device designed to diagnose SA. Participants wore the device in early pregnancy (6-20 weeks) and again in the third trimester (≥28 weeks). SA was defined as an apnea-hyponea index (AHI) of ≥5. Early-persistent SA was defined as AHI of ≥ 5 in early and late pregnancy. New-onset SA was defined as an AHI of ≥ 5 in early pregnancy, but ≥ 5 on re-test in the third trimester. Characteristics of women early- persistent SA and those with and without newonset SA were compared using ANOVA, and ≥ square tests as appropriate. RESULTS: 78 women had valid early and third trimester WP100 studies. 19 women (34%) had early-persistent SA. Only 2 women who had SA in early pregnancy tested negative in the third trimester. Of the 57 women who tested negative for SA in early pregnancy, 13 (23%) developed new-onset SA. Characteristics ofwomenwith early-persistent SA and those with and without new-onset SA are presented in the Table.Womenwith early-persistent SA had a higher BMI and a higher incidence of chronic hypertension. Demographic and clinical characteristics of women with new onset SA were similar to those who never developed SA. CONCLUSION: New-onset SA occurs in over 20% of high-risk women who initially test negative for SA in early pregnancy however, these women appear to have different characteristics than women with early- persistent SA. The clinical significance of new-onset SA in pregnancy is yet to be determined. Larger studies are needed to better understand the epidemiology of new-onset SA associated with pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances among Korean pregnant and postpartum women. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, cohort study of Korean pregnant and postpartum women, who completed a sleep survey. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Disordered Breathing, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the International restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Theχ2 test, t-test and one-way ANOVA test were used to assess the univariate relationships between the parameters of sleep disturbance and the baseline characteristics. A logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors on sleep disturbances. RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-four women completed sleep surveys. The mean gestational age were 28.9 (+/-8.9) weeks. The overall percentage of women with poor sleep quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 85.9%, 50.1%, 33.7%, and 29.7%, respectively. The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were 25.3% and 19.5%, respectively. The positive rates in Berlin Questionnaire increased significantly as pre-pregnancy BMI increased (p=0.032). The percentage of women with poor sleep quality, clinically significant insomnia, short sleep duration became significantly increased as pregnancy progressed and after delivery (P=0.001, 0.002, and 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean pregnant and postpartum women, and increase as pregnancy progresses and after delivery.

N2  - Introduction: Restless-leg Syndrome is a movement-disorder which is characterized by intense desire of moving legs during the rest. Patients often experience brief involuntary muscle jerks leading to sleep disturbance. The present study has been implemented to investigate the relationship between restless-leg syndromes and sleep disturbance in pregnant women. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study with accessible sampling was performed on 110 pregnant women who referred to office of Saqqez gynecologists in 2011. A questionnaire was used for data collection; the first part of which was about demographic information. Restless Legs Syndrome screening questionnaire and Athens Insomnia Scale for assessment of sleep quality, Epworth Sleepiness Scale for assessment of drowsiness during the day were used, as well. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (Version16), t-test, and chi-square.P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed that 22.7 percent of pregnant women suffered from restless-leg syndrome. There was a significant association between restless-leg syndrome and sleep quality disturbance (p<0.01) and excessive day-sleepiness (p<0.04). Conclusion: Results of the study indicated a significant association between restless-leg syndrome and sleep quality disorder during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To investigate whether sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 160 pregnant women at various stages of gestation. Participants were interviewed about their sleep length per night, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), snoring habits, and symptoms of restless legs syndrome during the previous few weeks. Cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state was quantified by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) from short-term electrocardiogram monitoring. The relationship of HRV to diverse covariates was studied by multiple regression analysis. Results: No significant influences were observed of short sleep duration (< 7 hours per night), poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5), or restless legs syndrome on HRV measures. Participants with excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score > 9) and habitual snorers had a significantly elevated low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio and LF power in normalized units (LF norm). In multiple regression analyses, habitual snoring was strongly and positively associated with LF/HF ratio (P < 0.001) and LF norm (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Resting cardiac autonomic modulation was found to shift toward a sympathetic predominant state among pregnant women who are habitual snorers. © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

N2  - The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods, but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery. Demographic and obstetric information was collected via questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24 hours, however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors. Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week, although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon, while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods during immediate post-partum, and this redistribution raises questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after giving birth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in pregnancy using the validated Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study of healthy women with normal gestations initiating care Jan, 2010 - Jan, 2011. Sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed in the early 2nd and 3rd trimesters (TM). The PSQI is a 10-question survey that assesses sleep hygiene, impediments to sleep, hypnotic use, daytime dysfunction, sleep partner and subjective sleep quality. Scores range from 0 to a maximum of 21, and scores <5 indicate poor sleep quality. The ESS grades the likelihood of dozing in 8 daily scenarios; scores range from 0 to 24, and <10 indicates significant daytime sleepiness. RESULTS: Of 495 consenting women, the mean age was 23 y, 53% were multiparous, and 81% were African American. They underwent initial evaluation at a mean (SD) gestational age (GA) of 15.7 (4.3) wks, and 458 (93%) had follow-up at a mean GA of 30.0 (1.0) wks. At the 2nd TM PSQI assessment, 201/495 (41%) of women had poor sleep quality, increasing to 216/458 (47%) in the 3rd TM. The mean PSQI also showed a small, but statistically significant, 0.5 unit increase (5.5 to 6.0) from the 2nd to the 3rd TM (p=0.01). Although the ESS score was not significantly different between the 2nd and 3rd TM (p=0.1), significant daytime sleepiness was observed in 27% at both assessments. Overall, 14% of women reported hypnotic use during either evaluation. Use of hypnotics was associated with a significantly worse sleep quality score (+2 points on PSQI; p<0.0001) but had no effect on daytime sleepiness (p=0.6). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are common in the 2nd and 3rd TM in an unselected obstetric population. Hypnotic use, reported in 14%, was associated with worsened sleep quality, but did not affect daytime sleepiness.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep apnea (SA) is known to be associated with glucose intolerance in the non-pregnant population, but it is not known whether women who are pregnant and have sleep apnea are also at increased risk of developing gestational glucose intolerance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between objectively assessed mild and moderate sleep apnea (SA) and maternal glucose tolerance in a cohort of high-risk pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: High-risk women (women with chronic hypertension, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) were recruited at 6-20 weeks gestation to participate in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100, a wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SA. Women with pre-gestational diabetes were excluded. Mild to moderate SA was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 and <30. The relationship between AHI and maternal glucose tolerance, represented by the results of the one-hour (50g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), was explored using univariable analysis and multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: AHI and OGTT results were available for 38 women, 25 (66 %) had a normal AHI and 13 (35%) had mild or moderate SA. Those with SA had higher pre- pregnancy BMIs (38.9 8.3 vs. 30. 5 8.6, p=.007) and were more likely to have chronic hypertension (69% vs. 20%, p=.005), but were otherwise demographically similar. There was a significant correlation (Figure) between AHI and maternal OGTT values (r = 0.33, P=.04, Pearson correlation). After controlling for BMI and the presence of CHTN in a multivariable regression, SA, whether represented by a continuous variable (the AHI level, Beta 4.5, p=.01), or a dichotomous variable (the presence of mild or moderate SA, Beta 33.9, p=.04) remained independently and positively associated with OGTT values. CONCLUSION: In this study, SA during pregnancy was an independent risk factor for maternal glucose intolerance. More research is needed to define the epidemiology of sleep apnea in pregnancy and its impact on maternal and neonatal health. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Anxiety and fear of childbirth in the last trimester of pregnancy, possibly is associated with complications of obstetrics, negative experiences and increased cesarean delivery. This study was aimed to study about relationship between anxiety, fear of childbirth and quality of sleep in the third trimester of pregnancy and length of labor, induction of labor and method of delivery. Methods: In this prospective longitudinal study, 156 pregnant women (23-30 weeks) 2010 who referred to ten health centers in the Qom-Iran were included with simple random method. The predictor variables were the anxiety, fear of childbirth and quality sleep scores measured using the spielbrger's trait anxiety inventory, childbirth attitudes questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The outcome variables were four obstetric complications: induced labor; prolonged labor; emergency cesarean section and method of delivery. Data were analyzed through chi-square test; logistic regression and Pearson correlation using SPSS softwareversion 16 was performed. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Relation between trait anxiety in late pregnancy with induced labor and elective caesarean section significant (p=0.04), (p=0.001). Women who anxious had an increased risk for elective cesarean section and induced labor (OR=10.3; CI=1.2-85), (OR=2.1; CI=1.1-4.5), but not for; prolonged labor; emergency cesarean section (p>0.1). Between scores of fear of childbirth and sleep quality with induced labor, prolonged labor, emergency and elective caesarean section had not significant relationship (p>0.1). Conclusions: Trait anxiety had significant relation with elective cesarean section and induced labor and high prevalence of caesarean.

N2  - The vast majority of females affected by hemochromatosis are asymptomatic during childbearing years. We were able to provide effective obstetric anesthesia care to a 35-year-old woman with severe hemochromatosis. She had systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, severe pulmonary hypertension, mitral insufficiency, a history of ventricular tachycardia, cirrhosis, obstructive sleep apnea, gestational diabetes, and severe scoliosis. A multidisciplinary approach was used to stabilize her heart failure and prepare her for childbirth. An arterial line and epidural analgesic were placed before induction of labor. Vaginal delivery was accomplished with passive decent of the fetus and forceps assistance. We discuss hemochromatosis and its implications for the parturient. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Preeclampsia affects 5-7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and foetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. Aim: We sought to determine whether sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced foetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and if so whether treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. Methods: In the first part of our study, 20 pregnant women with preeclampsia and 20 pregnant controls had detailed overnight sleep studies with foetal monitoring. Subsequently, in view of the strong observed association between preeclampsia, sleep disordered breathing and reduced foetal activity, 10 mothers with preeclampsia were studied on consecutive nights without and with continuous positive airway pressure treatment for sleep disordered breathing. Results: Womenwith preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during rapid eye movement sleep. Furthermore, preeclampsia was associated with reduced total foetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32] versus controls 689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in foetal movement patterns. With continuous positive airway pressure treatment, the number of foetal movements increased significantly (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Preeclampsia is frequently complicated by sleep disordered breathing and significantly reduced foetal activity during sleep. The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving foetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced foetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

N2  - Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Pregnant women (n=217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB. Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: There are little data on the fetal outcomes of polysommographoically confirmed obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy. Our hypothesis was that OSA may be associated with; (i) acute fetal compromise, as evidenced by fetal heart decelerations on continuous fetal cardiotocography during periods of maternal hypoxia, hypercapnia and sympathetic activation. (ii) chronic fetal compromise, as evidenced by a fall in fetal growth trajectory on serial third trimester ultrasound examinations, and altered cord blood levels of fetal growth regulators. STUDY DESIGN: Preliminary questionnaires identified women as potential OSA cases and controls. The fetal growth trajectory across the third trimester was determined by performing serial ultrasound examinations, and a fall of -30% of the customised fetal weight centile from 32 weeks to birth was considered significant . At 37 weeks gestation, polysommography with synchronised fetal heart rate monitoring was performed, and cord blood collected at delivery. RESULTS: 36 women have completed the study, 10 of whom had confirmed OSA. Acute Compromise: one case of an abnormal CTG occurred in a woman withOSAand a growth restricted fetus. There were no other fetal heart rate abnormalities detected, despite moderate OSA associated with significant maternal oxygen desaturation. Chronic compromise: women with OSA were more likely to demonstrate an impaired growth trajectory during the third trimester than women without OSA (33% vs 4%, p >0.05). In addition, insulin growth factor-II (IGF-2) was significantly lower in the cord blood of infants whose mothers had OSA compared with BMI-matched controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: We have confirmed that OSA may be associated with acute and chronic fetal compromise. Given the established link between obesity and stillbirth, it is intriguing to consider whether OSA may be an important intermediary. That there is therapy for OSA available in the form of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), is particularly exciting, but further study with larger numbers is needed to confirm these results.

N2  - Short sleep duration is associated with multiple adverse child outcomes. We examined associations of the built environment with infant sleep duration among 1226 participants in a pre-birth cohort. From residential addresses, we used a geographic information system to determine urbanicity, population density, and closeness to major roadways. The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8 categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1 year was 12.8 (1.6). h/day. In multivariable adjusted analyses, children living in the highest quintile of urbanicity slept -19.2. min/day (95% CI:-37.0, -1.50) less than those living in the lowest quintile. Neither population density nor closeness to major roadways was associated with infant sleep duration after multivariable adjustment. Our findings suggest that living in more urban environments may be associated with reduced infant sleep. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate SDB in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (TM) using the validated Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and assess maternal characteristics potentially predictive of SDB. STUDY DESIGN: Healthy women with normal pregnancies, entering obstetric care Jan, 2010 - Jan, 2011 were recruited to undergo SDB risk assessment. The BQ has 3 sections: (1) snoring severity, (2) fatigue severity and (3) chronic hypertension or a BMI>30 kg/m2. High risk for SDB is present if at least 2 of 3 sections are scored abnormal. Assessments were made in the early 2nd and 3rd TMs. Potential predictors for SDB, included age, parity, race/ethnicity, neck circumference, BMI, weight gain, gestational diabetes, Mallampati tongue position score (0-4) and Friedman tonsil size score (1-4). RESULTS: Of 499 consenting women the mean age was 23 y, 53% were multiparous, 81% were African American, and the mean BMI was 29 kg/m2. Their initial evaluation was at a mean (SD) gestational age (GA) of 15.7 (4.3) wks, and 463 (93%) returned at a mean GA of 30.0 (1.0) wks. Initial neck circumference (mean=13.4), tonsil size score (mean=1.25) and Mallampati score (mean=2.57) did not change significantly between the 2nd and 3rd TMs. The overall prevalence of high risk for SDB in the 2nd TM was 34%, which increased to 40% in the 3rd TM. In univariate analyses, multiparity, BMI, age, and neck circumference were all significant predictors of 2ndTMhigh-risk BQ; multiparity, BMI, age, neck circumference, tonsil size and Mallampati score were significant predictors of 3rdTMhigh-risk BQ. However, in multivariable analyses, only BMI (p<0.0001) and multiparity (p=0.03) significantly predicted the 2ndTMhigh-risk BQ, while BMI (p<0.0001) was the sole independent predictor of the 3rd TM highrisk BQ. CONCLUSION: High-risk for SDB is common in an obstetric population with a mean BMI of 29 kg/m2 and increases over gestation. Of the predictors assessed, BMI had by the far the strongest association. In multivariable analyses, controlling for BMI, and parity, other predictors for SDB, were not significantly associated with a high-risk BQ.

N2  - Background & objectives: Sleep restriction is a common feature of modern lifestyle and its effects can be extended to pregnancy. Several neurobehavioural consequences of sleep restriction during pregnancy have been reported, among which stand out perinatal depression and maternal fatigue, however, its effects over mother-infant relationship warrant further investigation. Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy over maternal behaviour and maternal aggression through animal models. Methods: Eighteen 90-day-old female Wistar rats were distributed in two groups: (i) Control - not submitted to any manipulation during pregnancy, and (ii) Sleep restriction - submitted to sleep restriction during the entire pregnancy (21 days) through the multiple platforms technique. In the postpartum day 5, resident-intruder paradigm and the latencies test were performed to assess both maternal behaviour and maternal aggression. Results: The sleep-restricted females displayed grooming in less frequency and duration, and with higher latency when compared to normal animals, while maternal aggression and maternal behaviour parameters remained equivalent between groups. Interpretation & conclusions: Considering the maintenance of maternal behavioural parameters, the inhibition of grooming seems to exert an adaptive mechanism, enabling sleep-restricted rats to display maternal behaviour properly.

N2  - Premenstrual Syndrome is described as a collection of predictable physical, cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms that occur cyclically during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve quickly at or within a few days of the onset of menstruation. Severe form of premenstrual syndrome is called Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. The typical symptoms of premenstrual syndrome normally involves the symptoms related to mood (mood swings, anxiety, and irritability) and physical conditions - like headache, fatigue, bloating, sleep disturbances, nausea, and breast tenderness. 90% of the women all over the world including Pakistan, experience these symptoms during their child bearing age. Several factors such as hormonal change, diet and lifestyle may cause premenstrual syndrome. PMS affects the daily life of menstruating women of any age; race; and part of world. A large population of Pakistani women is also a victim of PMS. Prescribed medications as oral contraceptives and antidepressants, some over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen, paracetamol and home remedies are taken as a treatment by the women in Pakistan. Hence Changing lifestyle, modifying diet, exercises, stress reduction and provision of services by health providers, such as counseling by pharmacist can optimize Quality of life and overall health of women suffering from PMS not only in Pakistan but also in the rest of the world.

N2  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Previous work demonstrated that neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) prevent developmental delay and glial deficit in Ts65Dn mouse model for DS. This study is to evaluate if prenatal treatment with these peptides prevent the learning deficit in the Ts65Dn mice. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant Ts65Dn females were randomly assigned to peptides (NAP+SAL) or placebo (normal saline) and were treated from gestational day 8 to 12. Learning was assessed in the offspring using the Morris Watermaze, which measures the latency (time in seconds) to find the hidden platform in the watermaze (decrease in latency denotes learning). The investigators were blinded to the prenatal treatment and genotype. Pups were genotyped as trisomic (DS) or euploid (control) after completion of all tests. Statistical analysis: two-way ANOVA followed by Neuman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons, P < 0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. RESULTS: Trisomic mice who prenatally received placebo (DS-placebo; n=11) did not demonstrate learning over the five day period. DS mice that were prenatally exposed to peptides (DS-peptides; n=10) learned significantly better than DS-placebo (Figure, p<0.01), and similar to control-placebo (n=33) and control-peptide (n=30). CONCLUSION: Prenatal treatment with the peptides (NAP+SAL) prevented learning deficits in a DS model. These findings highlight a possibility for the prevention of sequelae in DS and suggest a potential pregnancy intervention that may improve outcome. Supported by NICHD DIR.(Figure persented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine the association between nocturnal hypoxemia and neonatal adiposity in obese pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to identify risk factors and outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) pregnant women. Participants underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA) that recorded nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movements. Sleep studies were manually scored by an independent masked Sleep Reading Center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. Any SpO2<90% was considered an episode of hypoxemia. Maternal and neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography (BodPod, PeaPod). Neonatal morphometry was evaluated using a standardized protocol within 72 hours of birth. The primary outcome was neonatal lean body composition (%lean body mass, NLBM %). This analysis was restricted to neonates delivered ≥ 37 weeks. RESULTS: The cohort included 78 maternal/neonatal pairs. On average women were screened forOSAat mean [S.D.] gestational age of 22 [5] weeks, were age 27 [6] years,BMI40.1 [8] kg/m2,%body fat (MBF %) 44 [6] %. And delivered at 38.6[1.3] weeks. Chronic hypertension (33%), pregestational (18%) and gestational diabetes (14%) were common. Eleven percent of these mothers had OSA who spent 2.5[1.1] % of the total sleep time with hypoxemia, and had a mean lowest SpO2 of 85 [5] %. Mean birth weight for the cohort was 3284 [507] gm, and NLBM% 86 [4] %. NLBM% was associated with maternal BMI (r=-0.23, p=0.04), but not MBF% (-.15, p=0.06), degree of nocturnal hypoxemia (r=-.07, p=0.58) or lowest SpO2 (r=.266, p=0.1). Neonates of OSA mothers were similar to neonates of non-OSA mothers regarding ponderal index (2.8 vs. 2.9, p=0.45) and NLBM% (85.1 vs. 87.7%, p=0.05). CONCLUSION: In obese pregnant women, using standardized methodology and criteria, neither prospectively diagnosed maternal OSA nor nocturnal hypoxia were associated with increased neonatal adiposity.

N2  - Objective: To describe the development of the integrative capacity of the fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) according to gestational age and emerging behavioral states, assuming that developing integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability markers. Methods: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40 weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep) was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests. Results: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN. Conclusions: Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether maternal genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis in genome-wide association studies are associated with infant birth weight. STUDY DESIGN: We genotyped 866 self-identified Caucasian women and 397 self-identified African-American women in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Studies cohorts for 37 ancestry-informative markers and for 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with glucose homeostasis in European populations. We used linear regression to model the effect of genotype on birth weight z-score, adjusting for pregravid BMI, maternal age and probability of Yoruban ancestry. P values of<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean birth weight among study participants was 3278g (SD 650, mean sex-adjusted z-score 0.00) for Caucasian and 2956g (SD 728, mean sex-adjusted z-score-0.46) for African-American infants. Among Caucasian participants, we found an inverse association between carriage of the rs11605924 risk allele and birth weight (perallele change -0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.01, p=0.03). This SNP is located in the intron region of CRY2, a gene implicated in circadian rhythm regulation. We found a direct association between rs2237892 risk allele carriage and birth weight z-score (per-allele change 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.53, p=0.01). This SNP is located in the intron region of KCNQ1, a gene on chromosome 11 that is abnormally imprinted in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We further found a direct association between rs4607517 and z-score (per allele change 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.52, p=0.01). This SNP is located in an intergenic region adjacent to GCK. Mutations in GCK are associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemia of infancy. We found no associations between genotyped SNPs and zscores among African-American participants in our cohort. CONCLUSION: We found that three SNPs associated with glucose homeostasis are also associated with birth weight z-scores. These loci may play a role in associations between maternal hyperglycemia and birth weight..

N2  - Background: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder resulting from a microdeletion on chromosome 15q11-q13, causing multiple physical symptoms. Cognitive studies indicate intellectual abilities ranging from average to severe mental retardation, with impairments in executive functioning, short-term memory, expressive language, and auditory processing. Visual-spatial abilities and receptive language are more likely to be less impaired. The role of weight, behavioral problems, and sleep disorders has been examined. The importance of psychosocial factors has not been reported. The current case examines a complex case of a child with PWS whose father is in the military. Case History: The patient is a 7-year-old girl diagnosed with PWS, who is the result of a pregnancy complicated by a maternal fall, with possible injury to her mother's abdomen. Delivered at 32 weeks by emergency caesarean section, she had a lengthy and complicated hospitalization. She has a medical history of sleep apnea, asthma, strabismus, frequent ear infections, and allergies. There has been inconsistency in her treatment, given her father's military background and multiple family moves. A thorough neuropsychological evaluation was conducted, and she demonstrated significant delays in motor coordination, language, and memory, with moderate mental retardation. These results will be presented. Conclusions: Consideration of the combination of language, cognitive abilities, and medical comorbidities is important as it relates to treatment recommendations. This case highlights the impact of complicating factors such as psychosocial stressors and lack of consistency of treatment on the clinical presentation of a child with PWS.

N2  - Objective: To describe the clinical presentation, investigations, and treatment of neonatal hypertonia. Method: Retrospective case-note and laboratory results analysis. Results: Following an uneventful pregnancy in all but one (where pregnancy was complicated with pre-eclampsia and tremulous foetal movements), six neonates, two males and four females, presented with severe hypertonia at birth. Arthrogryposis (4), visual impairment (5), reduction of tone in sleep (5), abnormal jerky breathing pattern (1), and unexplained apnoeic episodes needing ventilation (1) were presenting features. MRI brain, nerve conduction studies, neurometabolic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic tests (GLRA1 and tyrosine hydroxylase) and anti-GAD antibodies were normal. EMG was normal in 5 and showed near continuous activity (1). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitters were normal (3), elevated CSF HIAA (1) and low CSF HVA (1) and not done (1). PM (1) revealed minimal myelination in the anterior cord and pyramids and no myelination in the lateral columns. Levodopa showed no response (2), minimal response (1) or significant improvement (1). Baclofen showed no response (3), some improvement (2) or moderate improvement (1). Clonazepam (3) and dopamine agonist (1) treatment did not improve hypertonia. Mean follow-up period was 9.5 months with a range of 6 weeks to 18 months. Three children died; two at the age of 3 months and one at the age of 2 years of intercurrent illnesses. (Figure presented) Recurrent respiratory infections (2), feeding difficulties needing NGT feeds (3), gastroesophageal reflux disease (3), scoliosis (2), bilateral dislocated hips (1) severe global developmental delay (4), West syndrome (1), visual impairment (2) sensorineural hearing loss(1), pulmonary artery hypertension (1) and chronic lung disease (1) are associated co-morbidities. Conclusion: Neonatal hypertonia is a very rare heterogeneous group of disorders with common final expression. Management can be challenging. Better understanding of the underlying causes will lead to an approach to its diagnosis and management.

N2  - Infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight. These infants may experience symptoms of withdrawal. However, studies have suggested that babies exposed to amphetamine may have impaired growth, behavioral and learning difficulties sleep disturbances and feeding problems. Children exposed to methamphetamine before birth tend to have aggressive behavior, delays in mathematics and language learning, skill development, and difficulty with physical fitness activities. At ages 3 5, children who had been exposed to methamphetamine in the womb had greater emotional reactivity and higher levels of anxiety and depression than their unexposed peers. Also, at this age, exposure was associated with behavior problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Careful monitoring of the neonates of mothers who used amphetamines while pregnant is recommended. Comfort measures-especially touch, reduced stimulation (e.g., a quiet room with dim lighting)-are generally sufficient to care for these babies. Increasing awareness and improving understanding of drug abuse in the medical, legal and social aspects are needed to reduce these impacts. The ability to identify specific behavioral syndromes in children as early as preschool age could lead to the development of preventive intervention programs, and early intervention may prevent incidence of disease and disability. This article describes the assessment and treatment of infants and children who were exposed to Amphetamine based on scientific evidence and clinical consensus regarding diagnosis and effective treatment. Also, this study considers risk factors for exposed and related problems, side effects and co morbidity with other psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Case report: Baby CL presented with recurrent apnoeas since birth despite an uneventful pregnancy and normal term delivery. Severe apnoeas occurred during sleep but hypoventilation was present when awake, with no compensatory increase in respiratory rate in response to a rising pCO2. Sepsis, metabolic derangements, gastrooesophageal reflux, encephalopathy and cardiac abnormalities were excluded, and bronchoscopy and MRI brain were normal. Respiratory management was with BIPAP via a tracheostomy. The working diagnosis was congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) but genetic confirmation was outstanding. CL also had a right sided ptosis which had been present since birth; the combination of this and recurrent apnoeas led to the suspicion of an underlying neuromuscular disorder. However, there was no clear history of fatiguability and no maternal history of myasthenia gravis. Pupils were reactive, there was no strabismus and horizontal eye movements were full though upward gaze appeared limited. Tone, power and reflexes were normal. On bottle feeding a right Marcus Gunn jaw-winking phenomenon was observed, associated with a temporary left-sided ptosis. Electromyography including single-fibre EMG showed no evidence of defective neuromuscular transmission; acetylcholine receptor antibodies and choline acetyl transferase gene mutation analysis were also negative. She was subsequently found to be a heterozygote for a polyalanine expansion mutation in the PHOX2B gene consistent with CCHS. Discussion: CCHS is a rare neurocristopathy with absent autonomic control of respiration as the predominant feature although other associations include Hirschprung's disease and predisposition to tumours of neural crest cell origin. Ophthalmic abnormalities including strabismus, sluggish pupils and the Marcus Gunn phenomenon are also seen; however, we have only found one other report of alternating ptosis in CCHS.1 PHOX2B is expressed in the developing oculomotor nucleus2, paving the way for a complex dysinnervation syndrome including the rarely observed phenomenon of alternating ptosis.

N2  - Objective: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. Methods: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. Results: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from -13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to -9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short infusion and -5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia-long infusion (n = 6, p < 0.05). Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia, less frequent status epilepticus (p < 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state cycling (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and periventricular white matter (p < 0.05) and increased brain weight (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 ± 0.8 à- 106, in comparison to sham control (4.3 ± 0.9 à- 106) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 ± 0.4 à- 106; p < 0.05 vs sham control). Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

N2  - Introduction: Childbirth causes many long lasting changes in women's life, relations, work, social activities, and household responsibilities. These changes not only affect their mental and physical performance, but also their biological functions. Due to limited studies on postpartum maternal health problems in Iran and even in the whole world, the present study was held to determine the problems experienced by women during the first year after childbirth and its association with the kind of delivery. Methods: This descriptive study was carried out on 311 women who attended at Mahabad public health centers for prenatal care for 36 to 38 weeks of their pregnancy in Mahabad in year 2011. Three of the subjects were excluded from research and the initial questionnaire was completed by 308 women. They were interviewed at 7th day, 8th week, and 12th month postpartum about problems experienced during the past week. Collected data were analyzed by using SPSS statistical software version 18. Fisher test and ratio risk (95%CI) were used in order to determine the difference between women with vaginal delivery and cesarean. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: During the 7 days after delivery, 91.6% (n=289) in the first week, 90.3% (n=277) at 8th week and 82.5% (n=245) at 12th month experienced at least one problem. Problem reported by more than one third of the mothers during the first and eighth week were: backache (64% and 60%, respectively), tiredness (63%, 60%), headache (47%, 34%) and sleep disorders (32%, 46%), and during last week of the twelfth month were: tiredness (43%), sleep disorders (36%) and backache (35%). Frequency of problems such as backache, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection and sorrow during the first week postpartum were more commonly reported by the women with normal vaginal delivery than women with cesarean section. while sleep disorders at all three stages; constipation, fatigue, complications of anesthesia or anesthesia at both the eighth week and twelfth month; breastfeeding problems at the twelfth month were more common among women with cesarean section (p<0.05). Conclusion: Frequency of health problems increases in the postpartum period. Therefore, it is essential to pay more attention to mothers' problems during this period.

N2  - Eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care is a national priority, and obesity is a prime target. During the last 30 y in the United States, the prevalence of obesity among children has dramatically increased, sparing no age group. Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes and with other long-term adverse outcomes, including both physical and psychosocial consequences. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present, suggesting that disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. Several risk factors during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of offspring obesity, including excessive maternal gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, smoking during pregnancy, antenatal depression, and biological stress. During infancy and early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, infant feeding practices, sleep duration, child's diet, physical activity, and sedentary practices are associated with the development of obesity. Studies have found substantial racial/ethnic differences in many of these early life risk factors for childhood obesity. It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in early life risk factors for obesity might contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among minority preschool-age children and beyond. Understanding these differences may help inform the design of clinical and public health interventions and policies to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and eliminate disparities among racial/ethnic minority children.

N2  - The development of the EEG during childhood takes place in a typical, but individually variable way. The period of EEG maturation lasts from the 16th Week of gestation into early adulthood and undergoes, both during wakefulness and sleep, characteristic phases with typical EEG patterns, which differ to some extent from those of mature adult EEGs. This article will provide an overview of the maturation of EEG background activity and, as far as they are known, of their normal variants in the course of childhood. In the immature EEG of the preterm infant, the EEG-patterns of conventional EEG-recordings are compared to those of amplitude-integrated EEGs. In the EEG of later childhood, typical patterns of maturation are demonstrated and the main pathologic differential diagnoses of these signs of normal brain-development are mentioned. © 2012.

N2  - Based on the aversion has not played a major role in Traditional Chinese Medicine. One recently established indication for practicing acupuncture in neonates is the treatment of infantile colic. Laser acupuncture provides a non-invasive therapeutic approach, thus excluding the risk of infection caused by needle injuries. When applying laser acupuncture to premature babies and neonates, the degree of temperature increase to the skin has to be evaluated first in order to guarantee safe application. The subjects were formerly premature babies of the Division of Neonatology at Graz University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, who underwent tests in the sleep lab before being discharged from hospital. The laser needle used for acupuncture (Laserneedle©, Laserneedle EG GmbH, Germany) provides continuous laser light (wavelength 685 nm), and a performance of 10 mW per laser needle. Laser needle acupuncture was performed simultaneously on both hands at point Large Intestine (LI) 4 (= Hegu). The first stimulation lasted for 5 minutes. After an interval of 10 minutes, a second stimulation was carried out in the same way, this time lasting for 10 minutes. Before laser acupuncture application, as well as 1, 5, and 10 minutes after, respectively, thermographic pictures of both the left and right hand were taken by means of a thermal camera (Flir i5, Flir Systems Inc.©, Portland, USA). Subsequently, the warmest spot was identified and compared over the course of time. The study included 10 premature neonates (7 male/3 female). The measurings were carried out on the 33rd day of life (weight 2,030 g, gestational age 36 weeks +3 days of pregnancy). In comparison to the initial temperature (32.9 °C), after 5 minutes of stimulation (33.9 °C) (p = 0.025), and also after 10 minutes of stimulation (34.0 °C) (p = 0.01), there was a significant increase in the skin temperature. The highest skin temperature measured after stimulation amounted to 37.9 °C. However, compared to the local temperatures reached in trans-cutaneous blood gas measuring still used in the monitoring of premature babies and neonates, the warming of the skin after 5 and 10 minutes, respectively, induced by laser needle acupuncture using Laserneedle© (10 mW/685 nm), doesn't seem to carry any risks.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome, primary or secondary, is one of the most common movement disorders. The most frequent causes of secondary restless legs syndrome are uremia, anemia, pregnancy, etc. A case is presented of a 77-year-old male with very pronounced restlessness in the legs at night and positive heredity for restless legs syndrome, resulting in continuous insomnia, poor quality of life and depression with suicidal impulses. Examinations ordered by a neurologist verified distinct sideropenic anemia. Upon consultation with a hematologist, substitution therapy with intravenous iron preparation was introduced along with clonazepam, which resulted in complete regression of restless legs syndrome, with significant improvement in sleep quality and thus in the patient's quality of life. Although occurring at a high incidence, this syndrome often remains unrecognized and untreated. Continuous education about the features of this syndrome, its timely recognition, appropriate work-up algorithm and therapeutic guidelines are extremely important to improve the quality of life of patients with restless legs syndrome.

N2  - Educational objectives: At the end of this presentation, the participants will be able to describe the prospective relationships between depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and physical symptoms during pregnancy and outline the clinical implications of these findings for antenatal care. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine prospectively the relationships among depressive symptomatology, sleep quality, and physical symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: A total of 257 pregnant Australian women participated in this study, with an age range of 18-42 years (M=31.64 years, SD=4.56). Participants were 15-23 weeks' gestation (M=18.42 weeks, SD=1.22) at the time of completion of time 1 questionnaires and 26-39 weeks' gestation (M=34.71 weeks, SD=1.74) at time 2. At T1, women completed the questionnaire package, reporting on the previous 4-week period for sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and the previous 8-week period for physical symptoms (a questionnaire listing 29 frequent pregnancy-related physical complaints). For depressive symptoms (Beck's Depression Inventory, Short Form), women reported how they were feeling “today, that is right now.” Results: Pregnancy-related physical symptoms at T1 predicted, prospectively, increased depressive symptoms at T2 and poorer sleep quality, supporting the findings of previous cross-sectional research. When controlling for earlier pregnancy physical symptoms and later pregnancy sleep quality, earlier pregnancy sleep quality was not a significant predictor of later pregnancy depressive symptomatology. However, poorer sleep quality in late pregnancy was associated, concurrently, with increased depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These findings have implications for clinical practice in antenatal care, indicating the importance of screening for the possible impact of physical symptoms in earlier stages as well as for poor sleep quality at later stages of pregnancy to enable early treatment and even prevention of the development of antenatal and postpartum depression.

N2  - The sleep-wake cycle occurs because of the two independent but additive processes, homeostatic sleep and circadian processes. Circadian rhythms play a significant role in regulating daily behavioral rhythms, cortisol and melatonin secretions, body temperature, sleep/wake cycle, alertness and performance levels. Disrupted synchronization of circadian rhythms impairs cognition, behavior and mood with deterioration of sleep-wake cycle and social rhythms. Some clinical and neurobiological findings suggest circadian dysregulation in depressive patients. Diurnal variation of mood, early morning awakening, phase advance for body temperature, cortisol, latency of the first phase of REM sleep for several other hormones and monoamines or their metabolites and sleep disturbances are core features of depression that have linked depression with circadian rhythm function (1,2). Clinical and neurobiological findings have promoted the idea that the restoration of circadian rhythm could have an antidepressant effect. The term, chronotherapeutics, refers to biologically-based, non-pharmaceutical and clinical interventions that act on disrupted biological rhythms in order to achieve therapeutic effects in the treatment of psychiatric conditions (3). Delayed therapeutic effects, tolerability, side effects, and drug-drug interactions of pharmacotherapeutic agents, as well as pregnancy and the postpartum period, prevent antidepressant use and promote chronotherapeutic interventions. Chronotherapeutics are applied effectively in endogenous, reactive, unipolar, bipolar, schizoaffective depression, depression in the elderly, secondary depression, depression in pregnancy and postpartum depression. The target of chronotherapeutic interventions, as in antidepressant drug treatments, is to modulate the same neurotransmitter systems (5-HT, NA, DA), the same brain structures, and the same clinical symptoms and findings more rapidly and with fewer side effects. These interventions include wake therapy (the use of prolonged periods of wakefulness; partial or total sleep deprivation), shifting of sleep time (sleep phase advance therapy; stepwise shift forward of the sleep-wake cycle to the early evening); bright light therapy in correct time and sufficient dose, and dark or rest therapy for bipolar mania and rapid cycling patients. When the therapeutic effects are transient, different chronotherapeutic interventions can be combined to maximize antidepressant response and prevent relapse. Psychiatrists should consider chronotherapeutic interventions as strong and safe treatment approaches (3,4).
