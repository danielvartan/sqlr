AB  - Objective Data: Sleep-disordered breathing is an increasingly common condition in nonobstetric populations and is associated with significant morbidity. The incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy is unknown, and it is likely that many cases go undiagnosed.Study: A systematic review and metaanalysis was undertaken to determine whether pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing are more likely to have adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes compared with control subjects.Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl databases were searched for full-text publications in English of sleep-disordered breathing and human pregnancy up to June 2017. Only studies that reported on sleep-disordered breathing in relation to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, preterm birth, mode of delivery, cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium at delivery, or wound complications were included.Results: A total of 1576 results were identified; 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Women with sleep-disordered breathing were older (mean difference, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.28) and had a higher body mass index (mean difference, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-4.32) than those who did not. Maternal sleep-disordered breathing was associated significantly with preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation; odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.31) and low birthweight (<2500 g; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.78). These women were also less likely to have a vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) and to be at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.21) or a cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.11). The risk of both elective (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 - 1.76) and emergency cesarean (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.29) was increased. In addition, women with sleep-disordered breathing were at a higher risk of having an infant with a 5-minute Apgar score <7 (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.71), stillbirth or perinatal death (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.28), and neonatal nursery admission (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.61).Conclusion: Maternal sleep-disordered breathing is associated with increased risks of adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes.

AB  - The brainstem development of infants born between 33 and 38 weeks' gestation is less mature than that of a full-term infant. During late gestation, there are dramatic and nonlinear developmental changes in the brainstem. This translates into immaturity of upper airway and lung volume control, laryngeal reflexes, chemical control of breathing, and sleep mechanisms. Ten percent of late preterm infants have significant apnea of prematurity and they frequently have delays in establishing coordination of feeding and breathing. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of clinical, physiologic, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical data in this specific group of infants. Research focused on this group of infants will not only further our understanding of brainstem maturation during this high risk period, but will help develop focused plans for their management.

AB  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need-Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs ( p < 0.01) and total number of unmet needs ( p < 0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff.

AB  - Normally prenatal care is given thorough the parameters indicated in the biomedical model. This study is based on a clinical case report and shows a different perspective in the care provided during pregnancy using the V. Henderson nursing model. The study detected the following nursing diagnoses: ineffective sexual pattern, risk of nutritional imbalance caused by excessive intake, impaired sleep pattern, fearfulness, and constipation. Gestational diabetes was also addressed as a problem of collaboration. The nursing interventions successfully resolved the problems that had been detected.

AB  - Background There appears to be a chasm between idealised motherhood and reality, and for women who experience birth trauma this can be more extreme and impact on mental health. Australia is unique in providing residential parenting services to support women with parenting needs such as sleep or feeding difficulties. Women who attend residential parenting services have experienced higher rates of intervention in birth and poor perinatal mental health but it is unknown how birth trauma may impact on early parenting. Aims and objectives This study aims to explore the early parenting experiences of women who have accessed residential parenting services in Australia and consider their birth was traumatic. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women across Australia who had experienced birth trauma and accessed residential parenting services in the early parenting period. These interviews were conducted both face to face and over the telephone. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. Findings One overarching theme was identified: “The Perfect Storm of Trauma” which identified that the participants in this study who accessed residential parenting services were more likely to have entered pregnancy with pre-existing vulnerabilities, and experienced a culmination of traumatic events during labour, birth, and in the early parenting period. Four subthemes were identified: “Bringing Baggage to Birth”, “Trauma through a Thousand Cuts”, “Thrown into the Pressure Cooker”, and “Trying to work it all out”. Conclusion How women are cared for during their labour, birth and postnatal period impacts on how they manage early parenthood. Support is crucial for women, including practical parenting support, and emotional support by health professionals and peers.

AB  - Importance: Approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases.Objective: To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG).Process and Evidence Synthesis: The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.Recommendations: The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial.Conclusions and Relevance: The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.

AB  - Pain management for premature infants raises challenging questions for nurses. This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past, premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to selfregulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems. (c) 2000 by the American Society of Pain Management Nurses

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) the prevalence of hypertension during sleep in pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, and (b) whether women with hypertension during sleep have worse pregnancy outcomes than hypertensive pregnant women with controlled (normal) blood pressure (BP) during sleep. DESIGN: Prospective double-blind cohort study. SETTING: Inpatients and outpatients managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43% gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH). INTERVENTIONS: Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or > 123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined. RESULTS: Sleep hypertension was present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P < 0.0001. Sleep hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer BPs [137(10)/91(7) mmHg; mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/ 87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) BPs [137(8)/88(7) versus 127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P < 0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91 (10) beats per minute, bpm], P = 0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe hypertension (P < 0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715 (808) versus 3224(598) g, P < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension during sleep is a common finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension.

AB  - Background: The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum.Methods: This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors.Results: Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (β = 0.10 and β = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (β = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (β = 0.12, all p<.01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks.Limitations: Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health.Conclusions: Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems and long-term child development.

AB  - By identifying a change in fetal activity state, fetal movement counting may help to reduce the possibility of stillbirth. Concern has arisen that such a focus on fetal activity may cause undue maternal anxiety. A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or other deleterious psychological effects in low-risk primigravidas. A sample of 613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group. State and trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation. Participation rates were high (91.4%) across all groups. Most women (90%) assigned to count fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days). No significant changes in psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self-monitoring conditions. Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks. Internal locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and feelings of well-being decreased slightly for all women. It was concluded that women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does not cause deleterious psychological effects in low-risk pregnant women.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine this relation between maternal-fetal attachment and behavior in daily life of primigravid women. Methods The participants of this study were 1,024 primigravid women in their third trimester that had already undergone an antenatal examination. Anonymous questionnaire were distributed to 40 hospitals and maternity centers in Hokkaido and returned by mail. Contents of the questionnaire consisted of information concerning fundamental attributes, pregnancy-related variables, Japanese translations of the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and questions about participants' behavior in daily life during pregnancy (such as meal habits, sleeping and exercise). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and nonparametric test. Results Of the 575 questionnaires collected, 440 were relevant to the analysis (valid response rate=43.0%). The average age of the subjects was 29, they were between 28 and 39 weeks gestation at the time. Issues that showed significant differences during the height fluctuations of maternal-fetal attachment concerned hopes and plans for the pregnancy, feelings of the pregnancy, images of the feelings and experiences subjects would have concerning the infant's care (ages 0-6 years), high self-esteem, meal habits during pregnancy, consciousness of consuming foods with higher iron content, sleeping during the day and exercise habits. Conclusion It is clinically useful to consider the behavior in daily life such as meal regularity, consciousness of consuming foods with higher iron content, allotting time to sleep during the day, and exercise as an objective index. These are issues that improve the maternal-fetal attachment. Research findings to date indicate that the consciousness of the primigravid women which values fetal well-being and growth serves as intrinsic motivation of the behavior in daily life of health.

AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disease, characterized by exacerbations and remissions which predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Today there are an estimated one million people in the United States diagnosed with SLE, 85% of whom are women. Moderate to severe fatigue has been recognized as a major problem in 80% of cases both at the time of diagnosis and during the course of disease (Rothfield, 1985). Because of the dearth of information available in the literature which described the nature of fatigue in illness, the purpose of this study was to describe the relationship of fatigue with disease activity, depression, and sleep in women with SLE. Data were collected on 70 female subjects, diagnosed with SLE between the ages of 20 and 45 years. Each subject completed instruments designed to measure fatigue, depression, sleep, and the perception of disease activity. In addition, each subject was interviewed about disease activity and asked to briefly describe how fatigue had impacted on her life and ways she found effective to manage it. The findings revealed moderate but statistically significant correlations between fatigue with depression, disease activity, steroid dose, and perception of disease activity. Depressive symptomatology was present in 74% of the sample. Results of multiple regression analysis revealed that the most important predictor of fatigue was the patient's perception of her disease activity. Findings from this study described the presence and problematic nature of fatigue in SLE. It reinforced the need for nurses to carefully assess the presence of depression in chronic illness and to provide patients with realistic assessments of their situation and effective, realistic strategies to cope with them.

AB  - This paper reviews recent work investigating the influence of sleep disturbances on maternal hyperglycemia, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is cause for concern because GDM and even mild hyperglycemia are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing, and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are, however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore, interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep parameters can prevent/decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia. Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being.

AB  - Objective. We report on the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution in the first trimester and on the association between TCM constitution and maternal symptoms related to pregnancy. Methods. Participants were followed up until delivery to observe primary measures (gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus) and secondary measures (signs of miscarriage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, and sleepiness and defecation during pregnancy). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis were used in this study. Results. 61.8% of the participants had unbalanced constitutions. We did not find a significant association between the TCM constitution and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, signs of miscarriage, and defecation during pregnancy. And we found that women with unbalanced constitutions in early pregnancy had a greater likelihood of severe nausea and vomiting and poor sleep during pregnancy in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. These results have implications for female health care providers and policy makers. Identification of TCM constitution may be helpful for understanding nausea and vomiting and poor sleepiness during pregnancy, especially in the condition that can not be explained by modern medical science, and be helpful for making program to improve these uncomfortable symptoms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze relationships among general health, coping style, and perceived stress in healthy primigravida pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city, Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH model fit well; general health (β = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep disorders (β = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, and only planning-preparation was related to perceived stress through general health (β = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping styles. Further studies on the effect of coping style interventions on stress are warranted.

AB  - Background: Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) are serious conditions that affect approximately 10-15% of women after childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders.Methods: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included.Results: There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were weak.Limitations: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis.Conclusions: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area.

AB  - The article discusses a study which examined the association between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and persistent common mental disorder in postpartum in a population of pregnant women in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It hypothesizes that sleep disturbance is associated with increased risk of persistent common mental disorder (CMD) in the postpartum period. It suggests an association between the presence of sleep disturbance during pregnancy with persistent common mental disorder in postpartum period.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between fetal activity and wake and sleep cycles in the newborn. Four behavioral states were documented in the 36-38 week fetus that closely paralleled the six behavioral states of waking and sleeping in the neonate. The comparison of these states during late gestation and the early newborn period was the focus of the study. A time series, multiple case study approach was used to examine the relationship between fetal and newborn activity patterns. Eighteen subjects recorded fetal activity during the last month of pregnancy, and continued recording the newborn's activity during the first two weeks after birth. The NCAST Sleep/Activity Record, developed by Dr. Kathryn Barnard as part of the Nursing Child Assessment Project (1978) was used to record newborn activity. A researcher-modified version of the NCASA was used to record fetal activity. Daily Appointment Schedules were used to record maternal activity during the prenatal period. Interviews were conducted with each family to obtain demographic, lifestyle, and delivery information. Analysis of the data was completed on an individual case basis using a time series method called pattern matching. Graphs representing the patterns of fetal activity and newborn activity were matched to identify similarities and differences. Striking similarities were identified in fifteen of the eighteen subjects. Fifteen of the eighteen subjects had significant Pearson correlations at least at the p < .05 level when comparing fetal and newborn patterns of activity. Correlations with maternal activity were questionable or non-significant. This study supported the concept that fetal activity emerges as definable patterns of quiet and active periods during the last month of pregnancy. Regardless of maternal activity and the birth process, the patterns of fetal activity continued into the first few weeks of the newborn's life. Nursing implications. Pregnant women should be encouraged to monitor fetal activity during the last month of pregnancy in order to identify patterns of fetal and potentially newborn activity. Identification of rhythmicity in the newborn could enhance the adaptive behaviors of the mother and her family when the newborn baby comes into the home.

AB  - Documented studies have indicated that sleep loss occurs in women during the third trimester of pregnancy. This study quantified the third trimester and intrapartal sleep of 28 primigravid women to identify the relationship between sleep loss and the presence of anxiety, hostility, and depression on the first postpartum day. The study sample reported an increase in third-trimester sleep but significant intrapartal sleep loss. A computation of Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated no significant relationship between sleep loss and moods of anxiety, hostility, and depression.

AB  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a burdensome sleep disorder, has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and related disorders. However, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), a predictor of subsequent CVD, diabetes, and associated conditions, remains little explored. In this study, we investigated the relationship of RLS to history of PIH in a sample of primary care patients. Methods: Participants were women aged ≥40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia primary care patients. Data collected included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and reproductive/medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or unsure about their pregnancy status were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 498 participants in the final analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms ≥once/week, 11.9% with symptoms ≥3 times/week); 73 (16.5% of parous women) reported a history of PIH, defined as physician-diagnosed preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, obesity, reproductive history, health conditions, and other factors, those reporting a history of PIH were approximately twice as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 3.6). These associations increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS with symptoms ≥3 times/week = 3.8; CI 1.9, 7.6; p for trend = 0.003). Conclusions: History of PIH was strongly and positively related to current RLS in this study of primary care patients; these findings further support a possible role for metabolic dysregulation in RLS etiology.

AB  - Auditory perception and learning take place during the third trimester of gestation. Fetuses and newborns who lack typical auditory experience can go on to develop typical socioemotional attachment and language, given a supportive environment. For hospitalized preterm infants in developmentally sensitive neonatal intensive care units, detrimental effects of deviant early auditory experience may be remediated by later experience, but much is unknown about the causes of language deficits of prematurity. Prenatal auditory stimulation programs that incorporate audio speakers against the maternal belly should be discouraged because of possible overstimulation effects on the developing auditory system and sleep/wake state organization.

AB  - Background Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes. Mechanisms underlying the association between obstructive sleep apnea and gestational diabetes remain to be elucidated. Methods Twenty-three participants with gestational diabetes underwent home sleep apnea testing. Obstructive sleep apnea was defined as an apnea hypopnea index > 5. Fasting morning blood samples were measured using multianalyte profiling (xMAP) multiplexed bead array immunoassay for Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and Interleukin 8. Results Age, body mass index, and gestational age at enrollment were 31 + 4.4 years, 35.7 + 7.4 kg/m2, and 28 ± 4 weeks, respectively. Participants were 52% Caucasian and 16% had obstructive sleep apnea. We observed positive correlations between apnea hypopnea index and Interleukin 6 (r = 0.62, p = 0.005), Interleukin 8 (r = 0.56, p = .56), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = .58, p = .009). Women with obstructive sleep apnea had higher levels of Interleukin 6 (F = 5.01, p = .037) and Interleukin 8 (F = 6.33, p = .021) vs. women without obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusion These preliminary results indicate that in women with gestational diabetes, apnea hypopnea index is associated with an elevated inflammatory profile.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal, obstetric and post partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum, and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9 months.Methods: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children. Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form 12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications, obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers and fathers Results: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than fathers (p < 0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health status.Discussion: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders.

AB  - Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

AB  - Introduction: Women commonly use massage therapy during pregnancy for pregnancy-related health conditions such as lower back and neck pain; however, there is little to no research related evidence on the side effects or mother or child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period.Objectives: This study aims to report on the side effects and mother or child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period.Design: An observational study methodology.Setting and Time Frame: Two massage clinics, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne recruited participants from December 2016 to December 2017.Intervention: Massage.Main Outcome Measure: Side effects and mother or child physical harm from massage.Results: One hundred and one participants were recruited to the study. Two fifths of the participants (n = 32, 40%) experienced one of more post-massage side effects. There were no mother or child physical harm events. Low back pain was the most common condition women sought massage treatment for 34 (33.7.%). A significant benefit (p < 0.001) was seen pre-massage to post-massage and pre-massage to 1-week post massage in decreasing stress, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion and improving sleep DISCUSSION: Similar to previous research, low back pain was the most common condition that women sought massage treatment for followed by hip pain, shoulder pain, neck pain and to improve mental health. Ninety-seven percent of the cohort received a full body massage including the feet leading credence that 'massage on the feet during pregnancy is harmful' is mythic in nature.Conclusion: While our findings lead credence that massage on the feet during pregnancy is a myth the study was not powered to determine the safety of pregnancy massage and further research is needed. Massage was commonly sought for low back pain with promising benefits in decreased pain and improved range of movement and further research on the effectiveness of massage for low back pain in pregnancy.

AB  - Postpartum women sleep less during the early days following delivery. Long-term sleep disturbance and fatigue can have significant implications for physical and mental health, relationships, employment and parental competence. Most studies focus on the quality and quantity of maternal sleep between weeks one and six postpartum. We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery. Thirty first-time mothers completed a postnatal sleep questionnaire, detailing their total sleep time (TST), the reasons for being awake and their level of fatigue. The logs were completed in real time during the first 48 h postpartum, while they were still in a hospital environment. The data collected from the mothers in the study indicated that the mean TST in the first 48 h was 9.7 h. Of the factors explored only breastfeeding influenced the TST. Breastfeeding women slept on average 2.6 h longer than women who bottle-fed (p = .042). Impact statement What is already known on this subject: Childbearing affects women's sleep in many ways. Hormonal changes during pregnancy and postpartum as well as physiological and anatomical alterations, and the process of adaptation to the new parent's responsibilities contribute to changes in sleep architecture. Since first study of sleep and pregnancy published in 1968 there have been very few publications addressing maternal sleep postpartum. Most studies which have focussed on quality of maternal sleep in the first 6-months postpartum period describe the relationships between poor maternal sleep and postpartum depression and other mental health outcomes. What the results of this study add: We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery while they remained in the hospital environment. We found that environmental factors such as background noise, shared rooms, type of delivery, feeding and worrying about the neonate did not influence the total sleep time, however, the main outcome of our study is that breastfeeding promotes maternal sleep. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that this study would be of interest to many obstetricians, general practitioners, nurses and midwives as well as to the general public. Appropriate counselling of patients early in postnatal period can improve their sleep patterns and reduce the risk of depression and other abnormal physical, psychological and social outcomes.

AB  - Background: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs.Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies.Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life.

AB  - Prior research on sleep-wake patterns during transition to parenthood has focused on the mothers, or mother-baby dyads. However, little is known about fathers and their transition to parenthood. This study focused on the 24-hour rhythms of 101 Japanese couples at 32-36 weeks gestation and 4-5 weeks after birth.Repeated measures analysis of variance and time series methods were used to test for postpartum changes in sleep and rhythm for mothers and fathers having their first child. The strength of the sleep-wake rhythm over a 7-day period significantly decreased over time and was not different by gender. Chronotype shifted significantly from morning type toward more evening type; mothers were more morning chronotype than fathers at both time points. Mothers became less consistent in their social rhythms, whereas fathers became more consistent in their rhythms.After sleeping arrangement was controlled, changes in wake-sleep rhythm strength and chronotype did not appear. The interaction of gender and sleeping arrangement had a statistically significant effect on wake-sleep rhythm strength. If the father's sleep-wake rhythm strength was higher than mother at third trimester, the couple was more likely to sleep together with baby after birth; if his rhythm strength was lower than mother's, only the mother slept with baby, and the father slept elsewhere.Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine how much variance in mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks after birth could be explained by family synchronizers as predictor variables after other mother-related variables were controlled. As a result, 25% of the variance in mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks after birth was explained by three predictor variables: income, mother's chronotype at third trimester, and consistency of father's postpartum social rhythm. The results from this study challenge health care providers to focus on how they can help childbearing couples who are experiencing irregular daily patterns. Future research should be aimed at how the mother's rhythm strength and father's daily social rhythm affects maternal-infant attachment and coping with her new maternal role.

AB  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy-four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger-hostility, depression, tension-anxiety, fatigue-inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tensionanxiety, and increased levels of anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options.

AB  - Snoring is common in pregnancy, and snoring pregnant women have increased rates of pre-eclampsia. Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and nonpregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic women (p < 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than nonpregnant women (p < 0.02), but there was no difference when supine. Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p < 0.01) in the women with pre-eclampsia (mean +/- SD: 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2) than either nonpregnant (1.1 +/- 0.1 cm2) or pregnant women (1.3 +/- 0.1 cm2). Supine oropharyngeal junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant women (0.8 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 cm2; p = 0.01) but similar in women with pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2; p > 0.3). The study showed that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase their blood pressure.

AB  - Objective: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction of pregnant women. Design: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research network (PBRN). Setting/Locations: Individual chiropractic offices. Subjects: Pregnant women (age ≥18 years) attending chiropractic care. Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median = 28 weeks; range = 0-42 weeks) and parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median = 1; range = 0-6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9 measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures = −0.7322; p < 0.005). The median number of visits (i.e., visits attended) at baseline and comparative measures was 1.00 (standard deviation [SD] = 22.69) and 3.30 (SD = 22.71), respectively. Across outcomes, QoL improved from baseline to comparative measurement after holding constant for visit number and time lapse, trimester of pregnancy, and care provider type. There was a reduction in mean T scores associated with fatigue ( p < 0.05), pain interference ( p < 0.05), sleep disturbance ( p < 0.05), and an improvement in satisfaction with social roles ( p < 0.05). A significant decrease was also found with pain interference ( p < 0.05). No evidence was found that anxiety ( p = 0.1404) or depression ( p = 0.8785) changed. Conclusion: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores improving with care beyond chance.

AB  - Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., ‘couvade syndrome’) on men’s body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

AB  - Background: Repetitive episodes of hypoxia and reoxygenation during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) resemble an ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress occurs in pregnant women with OSAS. We also aimed to compare thiol/disulfide homeostasis with ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of ischemia-reperfusion injury in pregnant women with and without OSAS and healthy control.Methods: This study included 29 pregnant women with OSAS, 30 women without OSAS in the third trimester applying for periodic examinations, and 30 healthy women. Serum IMA and TAC (using the ferric reducing power of plasma method) were measured. Serum thiol/disulfide homeostasis was determined by a novel automated method.Results: The mean age of the pregnant women with OSAS was 31.0 ± 4.7 years with a mean gestational age of 36.5 ± 3.0 weeks. The mean age of pregnant women without OSAS was 29.8 ± 4.9 years with a mean gestational age of 36.9 ± 2.7 weeks. The mean age of the nonpregnant control group was 29.7 ± 6.4 years. Both native thiol (291 ± 29 μmol/L versus 314 ± 30 μmol/L; p = .018) and total thiol (325 ± 32 versus 350 ± 32, p = .025) levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to pregnant women without OSAS, respectively (p < .01).Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in pregnant women with OSAS. Native thiol and total thiol levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to those without OSAS. However, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis parameters cannot provide valuable information to discriminate OSAS in pregnant women.

AB  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at <28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9,18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants.

Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors. Design A prospective, follow-up study. Setting A teaching medical center in central Taiwan. Participants A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women. Methods Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality. Results The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period.

AB  - Background: Sleep problems are common during pregnancy and in the postnatal period, but there is still a lack of longitudinal population-based studies assessing the quantity and quality of sleep in these women. The aim of the current study was to examine the natural development and stability of insomnia and short sleep duration in women from pregnancy to two years postpartum.Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study (the Akershus Birth Cohort Study) of 1480 healthy women, who completed three comprehensive health surveys, at week 32 of pregnancy, week 8 postpartum and year 2 postpartum. The survey was composed of the following validated questionnaires: the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Differences in sleep characteristics between the three assessment points were compared using Analyses of Variance with repeated measures, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the stability of sleep variables.Results: One thousand four hundred and eighty women completed all three surveys, and the mean age at birth was 30.7 (+/-4.9). The prevalence of insomnia remained stable at 60 % at the first two time periods, and remained high at 41 % at year 2 postpartum. The mean sleep duration at the three time periods was 7 h 16 min, 6 h 31 min, and 6 h 52 min, respectively. Concurrent maternal depression could not explain the stability of sleep problems from during and immediately after pregnancy, to sleep problems 2 years postpartum.Conclusion: Both insomnia and short sleep duration were found to be very common both before and after pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0–4 years. Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11–17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0–4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories.Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period.Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

AB  - Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine women's preferences for research results and format, intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women's preferred information to nonstudy participants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. METHODS: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. RESULTS: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. CONCLUSION: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. INTERVENTION: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

AB  - Breastfeeding benefits both infant and mother, including reducing the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). To further reduce risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants sleep on their backs on a separate sleep surface. Our objective was to describe trends and factors associated with breastfeeding and infant sleep practices in Georgia. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2004-2013 data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Chi square tests for trends were utilized to determine whether there were significant linear trends in breastfeeding and infant sleep overtime and by survey phase. After exclusions, 4643 cases remained for analysis. From 2004 to 2013, there was a slight (insignificant) decrease in breastfeeding initiation, with the highest proportion in 2010 (79.9%) and the lowest in 2013 (66.9%). Rates of exclusive breastfeeding increased significantly from 2004 (31.3%) to 2013 (81.7%). During that time, the proportion of infants being placed back to sleep slightly decreased (though not significantly), from 59.7 to 48.9%. The proportion of mothers who reported never bed-sharing increased significantly from 26.7 to 45.1% over this period. The decreasing breastfeeding initiation rates in Georgia diverge from national upward trends, however, exclusive breastfeeding rates by survey phase were slightly higher than national trends. Our results suggest the need for targeted education and support for breastfeeding and safe sleep practices. State-level trends data on breastfeeding and infant sleep practices provide valuable information for state-level public health professionals and policy makers, health care providers, and breastfeeding and safe sleep advocates.

AB  - Background: Our goal is to study the triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery using a case-crossover design.Methods: In a pilot study, we enrolled 50 women with spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 2011 and 2012. To assess non-transient risk factors, we also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls). Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of interest during the 72 h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24 h before index time with that from 48 to 72 h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: Previously hypothesised chronic risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3], sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the subsequent 24 h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors evaluated, the OR was close to the null.Conclusion: Skipping meals and disturbed sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and motherhood are important in women’s lives, but they can generate physical and emotional changes making them vulnerable. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the presence of maternal sadness symptoms experienced by postpartum women and their associated factors. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, quantitative study of 278 women admitted to a Maternity Hospital in the Northwest of Paraná, Southern Brazil, between January and June 2015. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EPDS) and The Brazilian Humor Scale (BRAMS) for data collection. RESULTS: Scores ≥11 in the EPDS were statistically associated with low economic status, multiparity, unplanned pregnancy, history of depression and sleep disturbance. Regarding BRAMS, women with per capita income above R$ 300.00 reais showed feelings of vigor; however, feelings of anger, depression and fatigue were shown to be associated with multiparity, unplanned pregnancy, history of depression and sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of women who presented depressive symptoms justifies the importance and need of care for women’s mental health in the gestational and puerperal periods, since they are periods of vulnerability and transformation.
AB  - CONTEXTO: El embarazo y la maternidad son importantes en la vida de las mujeres, pero pueden causar cambios físicos y emocionales que los hace vulnerables. OBJETIVO: Analizar la presencia de síntomas de la depresión posparto experimentadas por las madres y sus factores asociados. MÉTODOS: Se trata de un estudio transversal, cuantitativo con 278 mujeres internadas en una maternidad en una ciudad del noroeste, Paraná, sur de Brasil, de enero a junio de 2015. Se utilizó la Escala de Depresión de Edimburgo (EPDS) y Escala brasileña del estado de ánimo (BRAMS) para la recogida de datos. RESULTADOS: Las puntuaciones ≥ 11 en la EPDS se han asociado estadísticamente con bajo nivel económico, la multiparidad, los embarazos no planificados, una historia de depresión y los trastornos del sueño. En cuanto a BRAMS, las mujeres con ingresos per cápita de hasta 300,00 reales tenían sentimientos de vigor; Sin embargo, los sentimientos de ira, la depresión y la fatiga se asociaron con la multiparidad, los embarazos no planificados, una historia de depresión y los trastornos del sueño. CONCLUSIONES: El alto porcentaje de las mujeres que tenían síntomas depresivos justifica la importancia y necesidad de preocuparse por la salud mental de las mujeres durante el embarazo y el puerperio, así como los períodos de vulnerabilidad y transformación.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of parameters of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in women who are already considered at risk for these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry. One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested by a series of receiver operator curves. RESULTS: Eight percent of usual risk and 45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour systolic blood pressure of >or=115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of >or=106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women, sleeping diastolic blood pressure of >or=62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial pressure of >or=79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for preeclampsia.

AB  - Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position.Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies.Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3±6.9weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%).Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position.Practice Implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.
