N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease is 3-fold more prevalent in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Symptoms are particularly strong and frequent during the third trimester of pregnancy and disappear around delivery. A preexisting form of RLS tends to worsen during pregnancy. Women who experience RLS during pregnancy have a higher risk of symptoms in further pregnancies and of developing a primary form of RLS later in life, than women free of symptoms during pregnancy. This article reviews the literature for pregnancy-related RLS, with particular attention to its epidemiology, course, possible mechanisms, management, and the impact of symptoms.

N2  - Various medications and behavioral treatments for sleep-related leg cramps have been tried, but the quality of the evidence is low. Quinine seems to be effective, but dangerous. β-Agonists may be one of the more common causes of secondary leg cramps. Statins may not be implicated in leg cramps as much as has been believed. Potassium-sparing diuretics may have a higher incidence of sleep-related leg cramps than potassium-depleting diuretics. Plantar flexion of the feet may elicit most sleep-related leg cramps. More research into behavioral treatments is needed. A standardized sleep-related leg cramp questionnaire would be useful to expand research.

N2  - Comments on an article Mood disorder history and personality assessment in premenstrual dysphoric disorder by S. K. Dørheim (2001). Pregnancy and the postpartum period are characterized by dramatic physical, mental, and hormonal changes. Sleep is disrupted particularly in the third trimester, when the majority of women report awakening at night, and sleep continues to be disrupted for the first few months postpartum in mothers, mainly due to meeting the needs of the newborn. The disruption to sleep is expected and considered a normal part of pregnancy and postpartum. However, for some women, clinically significant poor sleep quality can have negative consequences for maternal and fetal health. Disturbed sleep is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. An important question is: What factors determine whether a woman will experience more severe sleep disruption during her pregnancy or will be impacted to a greater extent by the typical sleep disruption?

N2  - Becoming pregnant and giving birth can lead to considerable psychological, behavioral, and cognitive transformation. The nature and scope of change vary a great deal from woman to woman. This chapter summarizes qualitative and quantitative research on normal psychological adaptation to pregnancy. Including recognition and acceptance of the pregnant state, experience of the boundary between self and fetus, and body image changes. It reviews research on internal representations of the fetus and fetal and neonatal attachment. Perinatal changes in stress reactivity and coping style are reviewed. The chapter explains the influence of women's prenatal expectations about labor and delivery on subsequent experiences and reactions and describes normative postpartum mood reactivity. Perinatal effects on sleep physical activity, sexual activity, and eating patterns are described. Controversies about the effects of pregnancy on cognition are examined. The chapter also covers topics related to the transition to motherhood, including influences on maternal self-esteem and self-efficacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Much research has focused on understanding why women are at increased risk of serious mental health symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum. Although psychosocial stressors play a major role in perinatal psychiatric disorders, not every woman who experiences adverse psychosocial circumstances develops a major psychiatric illness during this time. As such, attention has focused on exploring how biological factors might impact the development of perinatal psychopathology. This chapter reviews biological changes during pregnancy and the postpartum that may contribute to the onset and/or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in the perinatal period. It discusses heritability and genetics research suggesting that some women may have a biological predisposition to developing psychopathology in the perinatal period. Then, the chapter focuses on pregnancy- and childbirth-related biological changes in sex hormones; the neurotransmitter, endocrine, and immune systems; and sleep that may be contributing biological factors in perinatal psychopathology for women at risk.

N2  - Sleep quality in women has been linked to changes in hormone levels due to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum recovery, and menopause. Postpartum women are more likely to experience sleep disturbances than any non-postpartum women, with the most reporting exhaustion during the first 3 postpartum months. The most common reasons for sleep disturbances are related to newborn sleep and feeding patterns. A sudden drop in placental hormones following birth, as well as the unpredictable sleep patterns of the newborn, contributes to the postpartum woman's poor sleep and alteration of her circadian rhythm. Complaints about excessive sleepiness, fatigue and sleep loss should be evaluated by health care providers, considering the fact that they are potentially harmful to the newborn and relationship with postpartum depression. They should be treated with proper pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic ones to sleep disturbances should be viewed with caution during lactation because of the risk to infant development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Fever has been recognized as an important symptom of disease since ancient times. For many years, fever was treated as a putative life-threatening phenomenon. More recently, it has been recognized as an important part of the body’s defense mechanisms; indeed at times it has even been used as a therapeutic agent. The knowledge of the functional role of the central nervous system in the genesis of fever has greatly improved over the last decade. It is clear that the febrile process, which develops in the sick individual, is just one of many brain-controlled sickness symptoms. Not only will the sick individual appear "feverish" but they may also display a range of behavioral changes, such as anorexia, fatigue, loss of interest in usual daily activities, social withdrawal, listlessness or malaise, hyperalgesia, sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction, collectively termed “sickness behavior”. In this review we consider the issue of whether fever and sickness behaviors are friend or foe during: a critical illness, the common cold or influenza, in pregnancy and in the newborn. Deciding whether these sickness responses are beneficial or harmful will very much shape our approach to the use of antipyretics during illness.

N2  - Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was composed by 143 depressed (n = 77) and non-depressed (n = 66) pregnant women who completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep during the night and the entire 24 h period. Present findings point out the effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results: Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P5 vs. ≤5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.02–2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.08–1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR = 3.48; 95% CI 1.96–6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion: Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

N2  - Presents a case report of hot water epilepsy in a 7-month old Caucasian infant. The infant was admitted to the hospital after two episodes of unresponsiveness while bathing. His mother noticed that after immersing of the lower part of the infant’s body in water, he suddenly became activity arrested, confused, experienced glazed–eyed staring and had facial cyanosis for approximately 1 min. At the end of the attack, the child fell asleep for approximately half an hour. After awakening, he was alert and looked well. The infant was the only child in the family, and the mother had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. The child had attained normal developmental milestones. The family history was negative for epilepsy and febrile seizures. The child had normal neurological examination results, psychological status, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging analyses. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus rhythm with a normal QT interval. During sleep, the EEG showed normal sleep organization with intermittent sleep spindles. There were no abnormal discharges identified. A seizure episode was triggered by imitating the home bathing conditions. The child was diagnosed with hot water epilepsy. The boy experienced no seizures during a period of one year, and his psychomotor development was normal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep quality and unplanned Caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent unplanned Caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned Caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned Caesarean deliveries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of the present study was to explore whether early childhood factors influence executive function scores, as determined by objective neuropsychological tests and subjective parent and teacher ratings, in a diverse sample of school age children. Data was collected longitudinally over four different visits that corresponded to childhood development (7.76 months, 20 months, 38 months, and 7 years of age). The independent variables examined in the present study included environmental, sociodemographic, and neuropsychological data from the first three time points. At Time 1, the independent variables were SES at Time 1, infant birth weight, maternal body mass index, parental stress at Time 1, and the psychomotor development score at Time 1. At Time 2 and Time 3, the independent variables were SES, parental stress, the sleep problems composite, the DSM-IV ADHD composite, and the psychomotor development index score. Results indicated that overall, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, the psychomotor development score, and SES were the only significant predictors from the first three time points of variance in the Time 4 executive functions as measured by the neuropsychological assessments. The findings showed an inverse relationship between maternal BMI and neuropsychological executive functions. A positive relationship between family SES and neuropsychological EF was found, as expected. A positive relationship was found between psychomotor functions at Time 3 and executive functions at Time 4, which was also in the expected direction. An inverse relationship between parent stress and executive functions was found at all three initial time points, revealing that parents who experience more subjective stress also have children with lower executive functions. The longitudinal design of this study allowed for the confirmation of the hypothesis that there are significant variables in early childhood that are associated with executive functions later in life. This knowledge has important implications because the more that is understood about executive functioning in children, the more it will be possible to provide meaningful interventions that can maximize a child's development of this critical skill set.

N2  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named “mixed)”, and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

N2  - The perinatal period is a vulnerable time for women to develop both medical and psychiatric complications due to profound hormonal fluctuations, environmental stressors, and significant sleep disturbances. Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia are medical conditions unique to pregnancy that affect multiple organ systems and are associated with maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. In this report, the authors present a case of acute-onset delirium with prominent psychotic symptoms secondary to eclampsia, which has also been referred to as eclamptic psychosis.

N2  - Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women’s movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women’s health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women’s health and birthing practices, doctor–patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

N2  - Aim: To identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs during pregnancy. Methods: Retrospective review of neonatal postmortem examinations between 2004 and 2011. Results: A total of 138 autopsies were performed in infants up to 28 days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause of death remained unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11 days (range 1–28 days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was inconsistent with the findings in only one case. Conclusion: An unexpectedly high proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the ‘Safe Sleep’ message with these families at every contact with health professionals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers. Method: One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4–6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points. Results: Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure. Conclusion: Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4–6 months postpartum. It tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

N2  - Introduction: Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children. More recently antenatal depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and offspring development. Methods: We used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available for n = 14 in the CBT group and n = 11 in the TAU group. Results: No differences by treatment arm were evident. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was associated with easier temperament (β = −.45, p = .024) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration (β = −.58, p = .003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT group compared to the TAU group. Limitations: This was a pilot RCT and as such the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the baseline and postnatal assessment. Conclusion: Improvement in antenatal depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in the postnatal mother–infant relationship remains to be determined.

N2  - Background: Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD. Methods: Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months. Results: We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. Conclusions: These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.

N2  - This article presents an original research on the assessment of mentalization including two populations of mothers and their babies. Baby ages, gender, sibling order, social-professional categories of parents and primiparity were matched in the two groups. Physical and psychological experiences during pregnancy, birth and the arrival of the baby in the family all sollicit the mother during the first month, because she must deal with the immaturity of her baby. She must show an ability to exert some containing function. In this context, the mentalization capacities are actively mobilized. In the first group of mothers (i.e., “clinical group”), babies were aged between 1 and 4 months and presented somatic expressions in the areas of sleep, diet, digestion, respiration and skin. The second group of mothers (i.e., “control group”), counted 13 babies matched up, that are who developped normally, without any disorder. The Rorschach test was taken by mothers to assess their capacity for mentalization. Results show that, globally, mothers in the control group had better mentalization activities. An in-depth comparative analysis was applied to two contrasted cases: one case of low-level and one case of high-level of mentalization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The master circadian clock in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN). The SCN generates sustained 24 hour rhythms of molecular oscillation and electrical activity, entrains to light, and synchronizes peripheral tissues. The molecular mechanisms involved SCN cell type specific function, rhythm generation, and signaling to and from the periphery remain incompletely understood. To address basic SCN function, we profiled its RNA expression at 2-hour resolution over 48 hours using Affymetrix 1.0ST arrays. We found ~500 cycling transcripts. These data offer crucial insight into circadian regulation of neuronal connectivity, synaptic transmission, ion homeostasis, splicing factors and protein-folding chaperones. We studied the circadian clock's response to metabolic perturbations using control, low protein (LP), or high fat (HF) in utero diet during gestation and weaning. We also studied interaction of in utero and adult diet in mice given a control or LP in utero diet followed by a control or HF adult diet. Adult mice from all diet conditions were analyzed for circadian locomotor activity (tau) using running wheels. Adult HF diet had a greater effect than HF in utero diet of lengthening tau in both male and female mice. LP in utero diet lengthened tau in male mice, but did not affect female mice. Circadian CNS response to these in utero and adult diet conditions was measured using PER2::LUCIFERASE expression in the SCN and a neighboring hypothalamic nucleus regulating feeding and satiety, the arcuate nucleus. Period length of PER2::LUC was not affected by diet in the SCN, but both male and female mice exhibited trends of lowered baseline and amplitude of PER2::LUC in all dietary perturbation conditions compared with controls. In the arcuate, dietary perturbations showed trends of increasing baseline and amplitude of PER2::LUC in male mice, while the opposite effect was seen in females. Overall, our data show extensive circadian regulation of gene expression as well as response to metabolic conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a widespread public health problem that not only deteriorates the quality of life for victims and witnesses, but can also prove fatal. Homicide represents the number one cause of death during pregnancy and up to a year postpartum for women in the U.S. For over 300,000 women - or up to 20% of all those pregnant - each year, pregnancy is a time of abuse, violence, and threat of murder. This research aims to conceptualize how the individual, interpersonal, and societal factors that contribute to the ongoing perpetration of intimate partner violence affects the future generation despite not being directly victimized. The aims of this dissertation address the mechanisms by which intimate partner violence and partner-related stress affects the health of a newborn and inform the field of maternal and child health of abuse's indirect impacts. Methods: To evaluate the impact of the Violence Against Women Act since its enactment, a comparison of the reported prevalence rates of intimate partner violence for the years of 1994 and 1995 to 2010 will be conducted (Aim 1). A chi-square test and logistic regression will be used. Results from this aim will provide us with a preliminary analysis of the effect of the legislation. Aim 2 explores the risk factors for women who are victimized by violence as well as the risk factors that may predispose men to wage violence against their partners. Both individual factors as well as interpersonal strife are included. Binary logistic regression models will be used for both the model created for women as well as that of men. Aim 3 utilizes the models created in Aim 2 to evaluate if and how maternal behaviors that directly affect newborn health are impacted by IPV. Women exposed to IPV will be matched to women not exposed to IPV based on propensity scores created that integrate both individual and couple-level risk factors. The matched subjects' maternal behaviors will then be compared via McNemar's Chi-Square Tests. Results: Results from Aim 1 indicate that the prevalence of IPV amongst pregnant women in 1994 and 1995 compared to 2010 is statistically indistinguishable. Aim 2 demonstrated that couple-level factors are far more impactful on the occurrence of IPV than individual-level factors previously established in the literature. Aim 3 exhibits that IPV-exposed mothers are more likely to obtain adequate prenatal care, position infant for safe sleep, and bring newborns to a follow-up appointment. However, IPV exposed mothers are also less likely to ever breastfeed their newborns and far more likely to reports symptoms of postpartum depression. Conclusion: In addition to evaluating the impact of the Violence Against Women Act since its enactment, this dissertation research adds to the literature of violence and injury prevention. Not only does the study add to the research that accounts for risks for victimization, but it also makes a case for the need of a validated construct for interpersonal strife. By integrating interpersonal strife indicators, we are able to add to the holistic view of interpersonal strife and potential red flags for partner violence. As a culminating research objective, Aim 3 illuminates the impact of the experience of violence on maternal behaviors and newborn health. By externalizing the mechanisms by which the mother-infant relationship is compromised, public health professionals and clinicians alike will be able to better understand the impact of partner violence on maternal behaviors that directly affect newborn health, and therefore, design intervention and harm-reduction programs accordingly.

N2  - Objective: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother–infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum. Methods: The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants’ sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months. Conclusion: Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <32 weeks gestation spending a greater proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). Methods: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP postextubation had sleep and wake activity measured by actigraphy for 72 hours post-extubation. Activity diaries were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling. Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the analysis. Results: 28 infants with mean gestation of 28.3 weeks (SD 2) and birth weight 1074 g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those onNCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8) p = 0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean activity score than those on NCPAP (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion: Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

N2  - The secretion of the stress hormone cortisol follows a diurnal circadian rhythm. There are indications that this rhythm is affected by stress early in life. This paper addresses the development of the cortisol circadian rhythm between 1 and 6 years of age, and the role of maternal stress and anxiety early in the child’s life on this (developing) rhythm. Participants were 193 healthy mother-child dyads from a community sample. Self-reported maternal stress and anxiety and physiological stress (saliva cortisol), were assessed prenatally (gestational week 37). Postnatally, self-reported maternal stress and anxiety were measured at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 72 months. Saliva cortisol samples from the children were collected on two days (four times each day) at 12, 30, and 72 months of age. The total amount of cortisol during the day and the cortisol decline over the day were determined to indicate children’s cortisol circadian rhythm. Multilevel analyses showed that the total amount of cortisol decreased between 1 and 6 years. Furthermore, more maternal pregnancy-specific stress was related to higher total amounts of cortisol in the child. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal anxiety were associated with flatter cortisol declines in children. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal daily hassles were associated with steeper child cortisol declines over the day. These results indicated developmental change in children’s cortisol secretion from 1 to 6 years and associations between maternal stress and anxiety early in children’s lives and children’s cortisol circadian rhythm in early childhood.

N2  - Trauma, primarily in the form of intimate partner violence and automobile accidents, accounts for 6-8% of all pregnancy complications. Much less is known about cumulative trauma (CT) exposure especially in African-American women. Women exposed to several types of trauma including childhood abuse, discrimination, or witnessed family violence may develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress or have difficulty sleeping. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress, sleep, and perinatal outcomes. A sample of 150 essentially healthy African-American women who had given birth were recruited at Hutzel Women's Hospital and St. John Providence Hospital Southfield, and asked to complete the Cumulative Trauma Scale, Community Safety Questionnaire, Conflict Tactics Scale, Clinician-administered PTSD Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Depression Inventory, and Demographic Data Form. The prenatal and hospital medical records were reviewed for multiple maternal and neonatal outcomes. Regression analysis was used to determine if relationships between the variables exist, and the strength of those relationships. The findings of this study showed: 1) African- American women experience traumatic events. 2) cumulative trauma is associated with PTSD, depression, poor sleep quality, and neonatal outcomes; 3) nursing must go beyond the assessment of intimate partner violence, report active trauma, and record findings in the medical record; and 4) more research is needed to better understand mothers' use of over the counter and other medications to help them sleep. The relevance to maternal child health is that a better understanding of cumulative trauma exposure, PTSD, poor sleep, and the risk for poor perinatal outcomes among African-American women can lead to earlier identification and the development of nursing interventions.

N2  - Personality may influence sleep in perinatal women. A follow-up study was conducted among 3,752 pregnant, then postpartum women at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. The Big Five personality dimensions were measured by the Mini-International Personality Item Pool in week 17 of pregnancy. Insomnia was measured by the Bergen Insomnia Scale in pregnancy week 32 and 8 weeks postpartum, along with self-reported sleep times. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured anxiety. Adjusted for current anxiety, depression, and demographic variables, the personality traits Neuroticism and Agreeableness were associated with insomnia in pregnancy. No personality traits were associated with postpartum insomnia. Extraversion was associated with longer postpartum sleep duration and better sleep efficiency, and Agreeableness with shorter sleep duration.

N2  - Purpose of review: The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD. Recent findings: Symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can negatively impact the ability to mother effectively. Summary: The presence of insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy on maternal care and maternal aggression in a rodent model. Methods: Twenty-three female Wistar rats were assigned to one of two groups: control (n = 12) or sleep restriction (n = 11) during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth postpartum day, the animals were subjected to the resident-intruder paradigm and to the pup retrieval test. Results: Sleep restriction during pregnancy had no direct effects on maternal care. Regarding aggressive behavior, defensive aggression was increased by sleep loss, with a lower responsiveness threshold to hostile environmental stimuli. Sleep deprivation during gestation also reduced self-grooming behavior. Conclusion: Taking increased self-grooming as a behavioral correlate of anxiety in rodents, this study provides evidence that lactating dams were in a condition of reduced anxiety. From an adaptive perspective, this pattern of stress response may function to ensure proper maternal behavior, thereby guaranteeing the survival and viability of the litter. Under a translational perspective, the present article confronts the importance of biological and adaptive features to rodent maternal behavior with the relevance of sociocultural factors to the human mother-infant relationship and to the onset of postpartum depression.

N2  - Combining historical, juridical and ethnographic analysis, my dissertation traces a history of evidence of reproductive bodies and the not-yet born in the Maghrib over the course of the last century through a case study of a regional phenomenon known as the "sleeping baby in the mother's womb" ( al-raqid; l-raged; bu mergud). Women with sleeping babies experience pregnancies that can last for years beyond the standard nine months accepted in Western law and medicine. According to the belief in the sleeping baby, a sudden traumatic experience or the return of menstrual blood can arrest the development of a fetus in the womb. The fetus will then "sleep" in the womb---"neither living nor dead"---for an indefinite period of time until it is awoken by another traumatic shock, sexual intercourse, or spiritual and herbal treatments. As a legal doctrine in Islamic law, the sleeping baby admitted protracted pregnancies lasting up to five, and in some cases seven, years after conception. Prior to the codification of Islamic family law between 1957-9, which banished the sleeping baby from official law, the sleeping baby phenomenon and discourse addressed the intersection of the psycho-biological and socio-legal aspects of human reproduction. The biological aspects include false or "hysterical" pregnancies (i.e., pseudocyesis), abortion induced by the mother, ectopic pregnancies, and various kinds of miscarriages--both those that are expelled from the mother's uterus and those that are retained--as well as viable, full-term pregnancies in which women give birth to a living baby. The socio-legal aspects include claims to paternity, contestations of paternity, inheritance disputes, spousal and child maintenance claims, adultery, and the status of the children of slave mothers (um walad), and free mothers based on their marital situation. The discourse of the sleeping baby enabled women to express any of the various contingent combinations that could arise from these biological and social contingencies. The dissertation knits together detailed archival analysis of selected published and unpublished family and criminal law cases in French and Arabic from the colonial and postcolonial periods, with ethnographic data gathered from participant observation and extensive interviewing in courts and a public maternity hospital in urban Morocco. In my analysis, I track and examine the diverse forms of evidence in colonial Islamic law (1912-1959) and post-colonial state family law (1959-present) that have taken reproductive bodies and the not-yet born as objects of legal knowledge---a process I term "legal embodiment." By legal embodiment, I mean how human reproductive bodies and their bodily materials emerge in and from historical forms of law, as viable evidentiary objects carrying signifying force. Legal embodiments indicate how reproductive bodies interact with, emerge from and are given value by particular geo-historically circumscribed knowledge, authority and technologies. From women's testimony about their own bodies and midwives' sensory expertise in colonial Islamic courts, to visualizing biomedical technology and DNA testing in postcolonial state family law courts---the diverse set of bodily evidence reveals how diverse legalities that regulate women's reproduction intersect with knowledge, technologies and authority under colonial and post-colonial political-economic power. By tracing legal embodiments, I show how evidence and expertise in Moroccan law have transformed women with sleeping babies from legally-viable reproductive bodies to extra-legal unproductive bodies. Extra-legal embodiment indexes historically minor discourses and practices that law does not value as evidence, and which are deemed irrelevant in law's bodily valuations.

Tuna Burgut, Abdulbari Bener, Suheila Ghuloum and Javaid Sheikh (Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics & Gynecology, 2013[Jun], Vol 34[2], 90-97). In the original article, the authors omitted the following reference: Bener A, Burgut FT, Ghuloum S, Sheikh J. A study of postpartum depression in a fast developing country: prevalence and related factors. Int J Psychiat Med 2012;43:325–337. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-19649-006). Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

N2  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) are systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affect woman of child-bearing-age. Pregnancies in these patients are often complicated by prematurity, related to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Maternal aPL (IgG isotype) could theoretically reach fetal brain. Whether this can have an effect on brain, influencing neurodevelopment is still debated. Objectives: To evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in children born to mothers with SLE or APS in order to recognize potential risk factors. Methods: We included children born to mothers with SLE or APS with IgG anti-ß2GPI positivity during pregnancy. We investigated 40 children (median age 7,5 years-old). The evaluation was performed as follow: questionnaires regarding neuroedevelopmental history and behaviour, clinical and cognitive evaluation; when necessary instrumental and neuropsychological investigations were assessed. Results: We identified sleep disorders (30%), behavioural or mood problems (32%), specific learning disorders (12,5%) and epilepsy (10%). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Uncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis. Objective: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. Methods: This was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). Results: Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P P < .01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. Conclusion: Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications.

N2  - Preterm infants represent the largest child patient group in the European Union (EU), accounting for 5.5-11.4% of all births (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, 2011b). Preterm birth is defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation. Infants born late preterm (34-36 weeks) are considered more similar to early preterm (> 34 weeks) than to full-term infants, despite previously regarded as near-term (Raju Higgins, Stark, & Leveno, 2006). For preterm infants, sleeping functions are critical as they demonstrate the ability to adjust to biological and social rhythms and support emotional regulation, learning, and memory. Many studies have focused on sleep patterns of full-term infants; however, few have investigated preterm infants and none have compared early and late preterm infants with a population from the Republic of Ireland. The purpose of this study was to identify infant and parent characteristics that promote optimal sleep in preterm infants and to establish whether the parent-infant relationship mediates this association. A secondary purpose was to test the transactional model of sleep. Parent report of infant sleep was taken from a recent population-based dataset from the Republic of Ireland. A comparison of the day and nighttime sleep patterns of early and late preterm infants found no difference between groups. There was also no difference in infant temperament, breast-feeding, parental stress, depression, or sociodemographics. A difference was found between groups in infant development, weight at 9 months, and age infant began solid foods. This finding was not surprising as infants born early preterm are at greater at greater risk of developmental delay and disability. Results of this study suggest that the paternal-infant relationship has a mediating impact on the relationship between infant temperament and nighttime waking in the early preterm group only, while the maternal-infant relationship has a mediating role in both groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge on the transactional model of sleep, and are the first to identify infant temperament and the paternal-infant relationship as important factors. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the transactional model of sleep and recommendations for future research are presented.

N2  - Depression is common in pregnancy and associated with increased risk of adverse effects for the neonate. Treatment and prevention options include antidepressant therapy. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on safety of mirtazapine during pregnancy and lactation. In 31 papers a total of 390 cases of neonates exposed to mirtazapine during pregnancy or lactation have been described. There might be an association between mirtazapine and spontaneous abortion, however, this might be attributable to underlying psychiatric disease. An increased risk of major neonatal malformations associated with mirtazapine in pregnancy has not been reported. Although one study showed a nearly significant increase in occurrence of respiratory problems and hypoglycaemia, no indication of causality could be given. No other significant adverse effects on neonates were reported. Limited available data, four papers on 11 exposed neonates, suggest that use of mirtazapine during breastfeeding is safe due to a low relative infant dose. High plasma levels might be associated with increased body weight and sleep. However, the reported data are too scarce to come to a clear assessment of the risk of mirtazapine in lactation. No information is available on the use of mirtazapine in pregnancy and Poor Neonatal Adaptation Syndrome (PNAS) or neurobehavioral development at an age over one year. In conclusion, mirtazapine seems to be safe in pregnancy, especially regarding incidence of congenital malformations. There are not enough data available to come to a conclusion on the safety of mirtazapine during lactation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15–2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35–3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44–3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45–4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse. Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories. Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period. Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period. Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

N2  - Study Objectives: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing ~1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women. Design: Observational. Measurements: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review. Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs = −0.35, P = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs = −0.34, P = 0.002), sleep latency (rs = −0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs = −0.27, P = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate −0.029; 95% confidence interval −0.06, −0.002). Conclusions: The data provide novel evidence that African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Jay Rosenblatt effectively promoted research on rabbit maternal behavior through his interaction with colleagues in Mexico. Here we review the activities of pregnant and lactating rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), their neuro-hormonal regulation, and the synchronization of behavior between mother and kits. Changing concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin throughout gestation regulate nest-building (digging, straw-carrying, fur-pulling) and prime the mother's brain to respond to the newborn. Nursing is the only mother–young contact throughout lactation. It happens once/day, inside the nest, with ca. 24h periodicity, and lasts around 3min. Periodicity and duration of nursing depend on a threshold of suckling as procedures reducing the amount of nipple stimulation interfere with the temporal aspects of nursing, though not with the doe's maternal motivation. Synchronization between mother and kits, critical for nursing, relies on: a) the production of pheromonal cues which guide the young to the mother's nipples for suckling; b) an endogenous circadian rhythm of anticipatory activity in the young, present since birth. Milk intake entrains the kits' locomotor behavior, corticosterone secretion, and the activity of several brain structures. Sibling interactions within the huddle, largely determined by body mass at birth, are important for: a) maintaining body temperature; b) ensuring normal neuromotor and social development. Suckling maintains nursing behavior past the period of abundant milk production but abrupt and efficient weaning occurs in concurrently pregnant-lactating does by unknown factors. Conclusion: female rabbits have evolved a reproductive strategy largely dissociating maternal care from maternal presence, whose multifactorial regulation warrants future investigations.

N2  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy‐four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory‐II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger‐hostility, depression, tension‐anxiety, fatigue‐inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tension‐anxiety, and increased levels of anger‐hostility, fatigue‐inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Migraine is associated with sleep disturbances in men and non-pregnant women. However, relatively little is known about sleep disturbances among pregnant migraineurs. We investigated sleep disturbances among pregnant women with and without history of migraine. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy. Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Migraineurs were more likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.35–2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.12–2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20–2.42). Associations were generally similar for migraine with or without aura. The odds of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight migraineurs. Conclusion: Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common comorbid conditions among pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: A number of studies have established an association between antenatal maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts. Methods: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age. Results: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (β = .085, p p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (β = 2.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression. Conclusion: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zürich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano). Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels P P P < 0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to treatment. Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated “may be considered” when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15–35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting). Results: More than one in four women (28.4 %) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6 % reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0 % reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4–1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM. Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

N2  - In this chapter, we focus on the assessment of the integrity and activity of the fetal central nervous system (CNS). Therefore it is necessary to understand normal behavior and which variables can be used to assess that (e.g., eye and body movements). Furthermore, one needs to understand the (neuro)developmental pathway during gestation, as a “younger” fetus shows different behavior compared to the “older” fetus. Behavioral states or sleep states are present at the end of gestation, and even wakefulness occurs independent of birth. These states are defined on the basis of three state criteria: cardiotocographic pattern, presence or absence of body, and eye movements. As in neonatal life, we would like to “test” the CNS, rather than make observations of behavior alone, but we are limited. The intercostal-to-phrenic inhibitory reflex is explained as well as fetal habituation as a measure for fetal memory. We conclude that it still remains difficult to perform a prenatal neurologic examination. It is quite likely that no single, isolated aspect of behavior alone will evolve to conduct a fetal neurologic investigation, but rather a combination of (behavioral) tests.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether depressive symptoms predict anxiety and stress or whether anxiety and stress precede depressive symptoms in fathers during the antenatal period. Background: The findings of previous studies suggest that there is an association between paternal depression, anxiety and stress during the antenatal period. However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated. Method: Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks’ gestation. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner’s depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers. Conclusion: Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". Subjective changes in concentration and memory are commonly reported by women during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34–36 weeks of gestation (n = 28) with age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n = 26). All pregnant women were screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was evident only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast, pregnant women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or even significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences were observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)
