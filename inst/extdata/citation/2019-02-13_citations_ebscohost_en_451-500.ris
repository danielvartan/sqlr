AB  - Background: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Māori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device.Methods/design: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Māori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns.Discussion: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide.Trials Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000993099 Registered 16th November 2010.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and markers of microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes.Study Design: A total of 151 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited for repeat 24-h BP recordings thrice during pregnancy and once three months post partum. Fifty women without diabetes served as controls. The AASI and pulse pressure (PP) were computed from blood pressure recordings. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for comparison between groups during and after pregnancy. Linear regression analysis was performed with AASI and PP as dependent variables and albuminuria and retinopathy as independent variables.Main Outcome Measures: AASI during diabetic pregnancy and association with microvascular disease.Results: Micro- or macroalbuminuria was present in 23% of the women and 58% had either simplex or proliferative retinopathy. The AASI was inversely associated with the coefficient of determination, which means that the stiffer vascular wall the more random variability in BP.Conclusion: AASI showed a strong association with microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. Together with the flattened circadian rhythm this indicates a pregnancy-related functional change in the vascular bed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache. BACKGROUND: Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders. METHODS: Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P = .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P = .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64% vs. 80%, P = .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P = .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P = .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P = .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P = .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P = .003), life enjoyment (P = .001), mood (P = .02), and overall quality of life (P = .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P = .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P = .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P = .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P = .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P = .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P = .08) in the migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs.

AB  - Background: Recent research in major depressive disorder suggests that dysregulation of the circadian system may be a core pathophysiological component. In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester. Method: Our study was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression, and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester. Results: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Our findings point to a strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers, longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.

AB  - After childbirth, women in other countries have been reported to have elation and associated features of hypomania within the first 5 days postpartum. However, there has been no research on this phenomenon in Japan. The characteristics of postpartum mild hypomania in Japanese mothers are discussed here. The usefulness of the Japanese version of 'The Highs' self-rating scale is evaluated and the prevalence of mild hypomania phenomenon for 5 days postpartum is measured. One hundred and nineteen pregnant women in Mie, Japan, agreed to participate in this research. The Japanese women reported feeling elated, especially on the first postpartum day. They also reported feeling the need for less sleep. Many women felt that they could reduce their sleep during hospitalization. There was a relationship between the primipara and the multipara in the obstetric factors selected for study and the occurrence of mild hypomania after delivery. There were not clear correlations in 'The Highs' scores for the nursing actions. It is suggested that the after-effect of stress would be highly correlated to elation, and there is some biological mechanism triggered especially on the first day postpartum.

AB  - Background: Clinically significant psychological distress in pregnancy is common, with epidemiological research suggesting that between 15 and 25 % of pregnant women experience elevated symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Untreated psychological distress in pregnancy is associated with poor obstetrical outcomes, changes in maternal physiology, elevated incidence of child physical and psychological disorders, and is predictive of maternal postpartum mood disorders. Despite the wide-ranging impact of antenatal psychological distress on mothers and their children, there is a gap in our knowledge about the most effective treatments that are available for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy. Additionally, no trials have focused on potential physiological changes that may occur as a result of receiving mindfulness training in pregnancy. The proposed trial will determine the effectiveness of an 8-week modified Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention delivered during pregnancy.Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT to treat psychological distress in pregnancy. A sample of 60 consenting pregnant women aged 18 years and above will be enrolled and randomized to the experimental (MBCT) or control (treatment as usual) condition. Primary (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety), secondary (cortisol, blood pressure (BP), heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep) and other outcome data (e.g., psychological diagnoses) will be collected via a combination of laboratory visits and at-home assessments from both groups at baseline (T1), immediately following the intervention (T2), and at 3 months postpartum (T3). Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample characteristics. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Hierarchical linear models will be used to test intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes.Discussion: The trial is expected to improve knowledge about evidence-based treatments for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy and to evaluate the potential impact of mindfulness-based interventions on maternal physiology.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02214732 , registered on 7 August 2014.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a 'mindful-yoga' intervention for healthy pregnant women that blended elements of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Iyengar style prenatal yoga, on stress, anxiety, sleep, and pain; to estimate statistical power and sample size for a larger study; and to establish whether the treatment is effective for second or third trimester women. The effects of variables on mindful-yoga were studied over time, comparing baseline (Time1) and post-intervention (Time2) data in a single treatment group of 19 English-speaking nulliparous women with healthy pregnancies, 17 of whom adhered to the intervention that met for seven weekly sessions.Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, correlations, parametric and nonparametric paired comparisons, and effect sizes. Participants were well-educated, middleclass, and planning vaginal birth. Although no one was currently being treated for psychiatric disorders, nearly 30% had a history of depression or anxiety.The intervention resulted in higher scores for two facets of mindfulness (Observing and Nonreacting). From Time1 to Time2, third trimester participants demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. Second trimester women demonstrated improvements in pain and sleep. In contrast, the third trimester group experienced worse pain and sleep as pregnancy progressed. To control for gestation, Time1 data for the 8 women who began mindful-yoga in the third trimester (26.5 weeks +/-2.3) were compared with Time2 data for the 9 women who began mindful-yoga in the second trimester (27.1 weeks +/-4.1). Second trimester women at Time2 experienced improved sleep (fewer night awakenings and less wake time during the night) as measured by wrist actigraphy compared to third trimester group baseline data.This study demonstrated important clinical improvements in sleep and pain for women who began mindful-yoga in their second trimester. Mindful-yoga intervention merits further research for reducing perceived stress and anxiety and second trimester sleep enhancement and pain reduction. The mechanisms of mindful-yoga on stress appraisal, anxiety, sleep, and pain were not clearly linked to mindfulness, and further studies are required to develop theoretical linkages between mindful-yoga and symptom reduction during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are potential reproductive hazards for flight attendants.Methods: Flight attendants from 3 US airlines in 3 cities were interviewed for pregnancy histories and lifestyle, medical, and occupational covariates. We assessed cosmic radiation and circadian disruption from company records of 2 million individual flights. Using Cox regression models, we compared respondents (1) by levels of flight exposures and (2) to teachers from the same cities, to evaluate whether these exposures were associated with miscarriage.Results: Of 2654 women interviewed (2273 flight attendants and 381 teachers), 958 pregnancies among 764 women met study criteria. A hypothetical pregnant flight attendant with median first-trimester exposures flew 130 hours in 53 flight segments, crossed 34 time zones, and flew 15 hours during her home-base sleep hours (10 pm-8 am), incurring 0.13 mGy absorbed dose (0.36 mSv effective dose) of cosmic radiation. About 2% of flight attendant pregnancies were likely exposed to a solar particle event, but doses varied widely. Analyses suggested that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of miscarriage in weeks 9-13 (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.95-3.2]). Risk of a first-trimester miscarriage with 15 hours or more of flying during home-base sleep hours was increased (1.5 [1.1-2.2]), as was risk with high physical job demands (2.5 [1.5-4.2]). Miscarriage risk was not increased among flight attendants compared with teachers.Conclusions: Miscarriage was associated with flight attendant work during sleep hours and high physical job demands and may be associated with cosmic radiation exposure.

AB  - Background: Postnatal depression affects the well-being of women and families. While several studies have shown an association between mode of birth and symptoms of postnatal depression, others have found no relationship. Aims: To determine whether women who have instrumental or caesarean births report higher levels of poor coping, sleep or appetite disturbance, or relationship difficulties, than women who have vaginal births, at the time of Universal Postnatal Contact (7-10 days post-discharge). Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of term, singleton births from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2013 at a tertiary obstetric facility. Outcomes were compared for 1816 women having vaginal births versus 1205 women having instrumental or caesarean births. Results: When adjusted for confounders, no association could be demonstrated between mode of birth and reporting of any postnatal symptom of psychological morbidity. However, the model did demonstrate an association between reporting of symptoms and nulliparity (aOR 1.69 (1.08-2.63); P = 0.02), as well as having an unplanned pregnancy with a supportive partner (aOR 0.54 (0.29-0.97); P = 0.04). Conclusions: Mode of birth does not appear to be associated with the reporting of symptoms of psychological morbidity in the early postnatal period. However, these symptoms may be associated with nulliparity and in the context of an unplanned pregnancy, a lack of partner support. These findings highlight the ongoing need for antenatal screening with respect to pregnancy intention and the presence of a social support system, to facilitate the implementation of interventions for women at risk of postnatal depression.

AB  - Childbirth is a necessary stressor. It prepares the infant for extrauterine life, and prepares the mother for lactation and safe return to the non-pregnant state. However, added stressors can have repercussions. This study aims to describe added stressors (including prenatal maternal socio-demographic and psychological factors) affecting mode of delivery (MOD), and the effect of MOD on mother-infant health at one month postpartum.Approximately 150 first-time, English-speaking, expectant mothers, at least 18 years of age, recruited from San Francisco, California prenatal clinics, participated in a postpartum intervention sleep study. Women were excluded if they had a sleep or mood disorder, or worked nights. This is a secondary analysis of these data.Prenatal maternal socio-demographic and risk factors (depression, anxiety, attitudes/adjustment, perceived stress) were evaluated by MOD outcome using analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, Mann Whitney U, and Kruskall-Wallis. Labor induction/augmentation was evaluated by maternal report of non-reassuring fetal status (NRFS) with NRFS as the key outcome, analyzed by Chi-Square and logistic regression. Lastly, MOD was evaluated for effect on maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety, infant temperament rating, infant sleep, and breastfeeding continuation at one month using ANOVA and Chi-Square statistics.Prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms were not associated with MOD (normal vaginal, instrument vaginal, cesarean in labor, or scheduled cesarean). Mothers with a prenatal 'attitude toward baby' score that was more positive were more likely to have an unplanned cesarean birth. A scheduled cesarean birth was more likely in older women and those with higher pre-pregnancy BMI. Maternal reports of NRFS were associated with induction/augmentation. One month postpartum measures of maternal symptoms, maternal adjustment, infant temperament, and breastfeeding did not differ by MOD. However, according to maternal diary entries, cesarean-born infants slept an average of one hour more during the day than infants born vaginally.These findings provide preliminary indication that prenatal attitude toward baby plays a role in MOD, induction/augmentation is associated with increased NRFS, and cesarean birth is associated with increased infant sleep at one month. Nurses should develop and test interventions to minimize prenatal and labor factors that unnecessarily add to delivery stress.

AB  - Purpose This survey investigated late pregnancy maternal sleep practices and ability to modify sleep position in order to generate information on which to base future public health messages about optimal going-to-sleep position. Research Question What are the sleep practices of women in late pregnancy, and what are their views about changing going-to-sleep position if this was recommended? Significance Maternal sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for late stillbirth. A 2011 study from Auckland, New Zealand, was the first to demonstrate a 2-fold increased risk for women who did not go to sleep on their left side the night before the fetus was thought to have died, with the highest risk for women who settled to sleep supine. This association has since been confirmed by an Australian and Ghanaian study and a New Zealand multicentre study. Methods A random sample of ethnically-representative women (N = 377), between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation, were surveyed in 2014 in South Auckland, New Zealand, a multicultural and socioeconomically disadvantaged population with an increased risk of stillbirth. Factors independently associated with non-left side going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results Self-reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left (30%), right (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%), and other (6%). The majority (68%) had received advice about pregnancy sleep position. A non-left position was more likely to be reported by women of Maori (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.46-5.78) ethnicity, and those who did not sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.03-5.32). Most (87%) non-left sleepers reported that they would have minimal difficulty changing to going to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy if this was better for their fetus. Discussion The results from this survey suggest that going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy is likely to be readily modifiable. This suggests that a public health intervention, about the importance of optimal late pregnancy going-to-sleep position to optimise fetal well-being, is likely to be feasible in similar communities with an increased risk of stillbirth.

AB  - Problem/Condition: Certain modifiable maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy are associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother and her infant (e.g., physical abuse, insufficient folic acid consumption, smoking during pregnancy, and improper infant sleep position). Information about these behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends in maternal and infant health, enhance understanding of the relation between maternal behaviors and infant health outcomes, plan and evaluate maternal and infant health programs, direct policy decisions, and monitor progress toward achieving the national Healthy People 2010 [HP 2010] objectives (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy people 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2000).Reporting Period Covered: 2000--2003.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers; nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants. This report summarizes data for 2000--2003 from 19 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia) that measured progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives for eight perinatal indicators: 1) pregnancy intention, 2) multivitamin use, 3) physical abuse, 4) cigarette smoking during pregnancy, 5) cigarette smoking cessation, 6) drinking alcohol during pregnancy, 7) breastfeeding initiation, and 8) infant sleep position.Results: In 2003, prevalence of intended pregnancy among women having a live birth ranged from 48.1% in Louisiana to 66.5% in Maine; during 2000--2003, no state experienced a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in prevalence of intended pregnancy, and one state experienced a significant decrease. In 2003, prevalence of multivitamin use at least four times per week during the month before pregnancy ranged from 23.0% in Arkansas to 45.2% in Maine; during 2000--2003, multivitamin use increased significantly in three states (Illinois, North Carolina, and Utah). In 2003, prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during the 12 months before pregnancy ranged from 2.2% in Maine to 7.6% in New Mexico; during 2000--2003, significant decreases were recorded in three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska). In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from cigarette smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 72.5% in West Virginia to 96.1% in Utah; during 2000--2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of smoking cessation during pregnancy ranged from 30.2% in West Virginia to 65.8% in Utah; during 2000--2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 91.3% in Colorado to 98.0% in Utah; during 2000--2003, abstinence increased significantly in Louisiana and Utah but decreased significantly in Florida and Nebraska. In 2003, prevalence of mothers who breastfed their babies in the early postpartum period ranged from 51.2% in Louisiana to 90.3% in Alaska; during 2000--2003, significant increases were recorded in six states (Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, and South Carolina). In 2003, prevalence of healthy full-term infants who were placed to sleep on their backs ranged from 50.0% in Arkansas to 78.7% in Washington; during 2000--2003, significant increases were recorded in eight states (Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, and West Virginia). In 2003, all 19 states achieved or exceeded the HP 2010 objective for smoking cessation during pregnancy, and 16 states achieved the HP 2010 objective for abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy. In addition, nearly half of the states achieved the objectives for breastfeeding in the early postpartum period and infant back sleep position. However, no state achieved the HP 2010 objectives for intended pregnancy, multivitamin use before pregnancy, absence of physical abuse before pregnancy, or abstinence from smoking during pregnancy.Interpretation: PRAMS data indicate variability among states regarding progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives in the area of maternal and child health. More progress has been made in achieving objectives focused on the period during and after pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation and proper infant sleep position); less progress has been made in achieving objectives related to behaviors and experiences in the preconception period (e.g., pregnancy intention and multivitamin use).Public Health Action: State maternal and child health programs can use these state- and population-based data to monitor progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives, identify indicators to target for intervention, and plan and evaluate programs that promote positive maternal and infant health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes. These data also can be used to guide policy decisions that could affect the health of mothers and infants.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to draw together recent thinking on pregnancy and obesity, with a particular emphasis on prevention strategies and emerging clinical complications. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies including a large meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted. SUMMARY: There will be a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem.

AB  - Induction of labour is a common intervention in obstetric practice. Traditionally, in most hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and child. To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening, coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to coincide with office hours. We contacted the Trials Search Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16 February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012). We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. The search resulted in 2693 articles that we screened on title and abstract for eligibility.Thirteen studies were selected for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150 women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons separately.In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning.In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes. Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably consider administering prostaglandins in the morning.There is no strong evidence that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Objectives To determine the incidence of admission in labor after morphine sleep (therapeutic rest), patient characteristics associated with labor, and adverse outcomes associated with treatment. Methods We reviewed medical records of women treated with morphine sleep from December 2005 to December 2009. Variables evaluated included medications used for treatment, cervical examination, maternal demographic characteristics and obstetric history, fetal heart rate patterns, and maternal/neonatal outcomes. These characteristics were compared between those admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged. Results Fifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17 (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg. Those with effacement > 50% (p < 0.01) and carrying term gestations (p < 0.01) were more likely to be admitted in labor after treatment. There were no adverse maternal outcomes. There were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes. Conclusion Sixty-two percent of women were admitted in labor aftermorphine sleep. Admission effacement > 50% and term gestational age were associated with admission in labor. There were no significant differences inmaternal or neonatalmorbidity in those admitted versus discharged home after treatment with morphine sleep.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. DESIGN: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. SETTING: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

AB  - QUESTIONIs a structured behavioural intervention (SBI) for infant sleep problems effective for maternal depression, parenting style, and child mental health and sleep outcomes at 2 years?METHODSDesign: cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Allocation: concealed.Blinding: blinded {families, nurses, data collectors, and data analysts}.*Follow-up period: {17 months}.*Setting: 49 maternal and child health centres in 6 government areas in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Patients: 328 mothers (mean age 33 y) who reported infant sleep problems (mean infant age 7.4 mo, 54% boys). Infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation and mothers who did not know sufficient English to complete questionnaires were excluded. Intervention: 25 centres (n = 174) were allocated to SBIs to improve infant sleep, and 24 centres (n = 154) were allocated to usual well-child care. In the SBI group, 100 families accepted the offer of help from nurses and were given sleep management plans based on adult fading (mother sits with infant until infant falls asleep and slowly removes her presence over 2-3 wks) (n = 7) or graduated extinction (mother responds to infant's cry at increasing time intervals) (n = 53) or were taught simple strategies (positive bedtime routine or management of pacifiers) (n = 20). Nurses did not record the choice of SBI in 20 families.Outcomes: maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score >9 or >/= 13), parenting practices, child mental health, and child sleep problems (as reported by mother).Patient follow-up: outcome data were available for 100% of centres and 83% of families at child age 2 years (intention-totreat analysis).MAIN RESULTSFewer mothers in the SBI group had depression compared with the usual care group (table). Groups did not differ for parenting practices, child sleep problems (table), or child mental health.CONCLUSIONA behavioural intervention for infant sleep problems improved maternal depression but did not differ from usual well-child care for child sleep problems or mental health at child age 2 years.*Information provided by author.

AB  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a potentially fatal form of heart failure associated with pregnancy. A 29-yearold African American woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 36 weeks' gestation had a history of cardiomyopathy, morbid obesity (body mass index > 70 kg/m[2]), uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and required a repeat cesarean delivery. The patient was admitted to the hospital several times throughout her pregnancy for congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and headaches. Two years previously the patient received a diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy 3 weeks after the delivery of her second child.This case report illustrates the recognition of peripartum cardiomyopathy and the risks early in pregnancy. It also describes the appropriate medical management, including transesophageal echocardiography and the need for collaboration of multiple medical specialists before and during delivery to provide the best possible outcome for both mother and infant.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there is considerable evidence of a relationship between the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) and pain disorders, including migraine and fibromyalgia. An association between multi-site pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of young adults.Methods: Twenty two year olds (n = 1072), followed since birth of part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex, psychological distress and sleep quality.Results: The prevalence of RLS was 3.0 % and MSK pain was reported by 37.4 % of the participants. In multivariable logistic regression models, strong associations were found between RLS-diagnosis and long duration (three months or more) of MSK pain (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 1.4-9.2) and reporting three or more pain sites (4.9, 1.6-14.6).Conclusions: Different dimensions of MSK pain were associated with RLS in young adults, suggestive of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Overlap between these conditions requires more clinical and research attention.

AB  - Preterm birth is on the rise causing neonatal mortality and is a major determinant of early childhood mortality and morbidity in the United States. Numerous preterm infants suffer from neurological disability including cerebral palsy; visual and hearing impairments; learning difficulties; and, psychological, behavioral, and social problems. This increasing incidence of prematurity, prevalence of significant morbidity, and burden to society, both personal and cost-related, make it imperative to identify developmental care strategies such as music that might reduce this burden.This study integrates the work of music therapy, neuroscience, audiology, and medicine with nursing to address the uncertainty regarding the effect of music as a holistic health patterning modality and discover if preterm infant physiological and neurobehavioral state responses to music and ambient noise are different. The goal of this study was to establish a foundation for further research related to the use of music with preterm infants and to address the issue of safety in providing music as a health patterning modality for this population.Forty-one clinically stable, non-ventilated, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) preterm infants from 32 to 35 weeks gestation in a large, urban Midwest Children's Hospital NICU were included in this study. An interrupted time-series design with repeated measures was used to explore the health patterning responses of preterm infants to an intentionally designed music intervention of recorded piano music. The effect of the music was measured every 30-seconds before, during, and after the sound condition of music or ambient noise by observing the oxygen saturation, heart rate, and behavioral state of randomly assigned preterm infants in the NICU in relation to a control group in which no music (only standard NICU care with recorded ambient noise) was provided.Mixed modeling was used to look at how preterm infant responses varied over time as well as changes between music and ambient noise groups of infants. Although there were no significant differences between group responses over the three time periods, there were significant changes in individual infant oxygen saturations, heart rates, and behavioral states over time. Infant oxygen saturations did not change significantly in the 10 minutes before the sound (p = .97) or during the 20 minutes of sound (p = .75); however, preterm oxygen saturation decreased significantly in the 10 minutes after presentation of the sound conditions (p = .004). Infant heart rates did not change significantly before the sound (p = .71) or during the sound (p = .54); however, preterm heart rate changes after the sound conditions approached significance by increasing during the 10 minutes after the sound conditions (p = .07). Infant behavioral states changed significantly before the sound as infants went from a state of active sleep to quiet sleep (p = .04) and after the sound as infants became slightly more aroused going from quiet sleep to active sleep (p = .05). There were no significant preterm infant behavioral state changes over the time period during the sound conditions (p = .22).Infants listening to music and those listening to ambient noise recorded from the inside of an incubator all exhibited changes in oxygen saturations, heart rates, and behavioral states during the three time periods and variability in those changes; however, these responses remained within normal limits. Findings from this study demonstrated that preterm infants in a NICU did not have adverse reactions to a carefully designed music intervention.

AB  - Aim: To determine the effect of music on sleep-wake cycle (SWC) patterns in late preterm neonates.Methods: In a masked crossover study, infants between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks gestation were randomised to music exposure either during the first six or last six hours of a 12-hour observation period. SWC characteristics were determined by continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) read by two coders masked to exposure sequence. Analysis was performed in paired comparisons. ANOVA was used to assess the effects of music exposure, period and crossover on SWC outcomes: (i) Burdjalov Scores (BS) during active sleep (AS) (ii) per cent and duration of quiet sleep (QS).Results: Thirty infants were studied. A total of 222 QS cycles (median seven per patient; range five to 12) were analysed. Music exposure was associated with higher BS (F = 10.60, p = 0.0019) in AS and decreased interruptions during QS. The advanced postconceptual age (PCA) SWC pattern during AS was equivalent to a one-week mean. Number, duration and ratio of QS cycles did not change with music exposure.Conclusion: Music exposure elicits an increasing PCA pattern in AS and fewer interruptions in QS. Music may benefit sleep in late preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. METHODS: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a 'sleep consciousness,' and bed-sharing. Mercer's stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives.

AB  - Background: Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed.Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy.Study Design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status.Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs).Outcome Measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference.Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants.Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P < .003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P < .003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1[beta] were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-[alpha], interferon-[gamma], and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. STUDY DESIGN: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 microg). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < or = .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate.

AB  - The health of future generations, both physical and psychological, depends upon good parental and early environment, free particularly from malnutrition, toxins and undue stress. Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth. Alcohol in early in the pregnancy -- just when many mothers are unaware they are pregnant -- can produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face. Prenatal exposure to alcohol has significant effects on the intelligence and behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a negative self-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the Borderline Personality Disorder. Undue stress of any kind during the pregnancy leads to problems for the developing child.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health, specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. Methods A systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words 'shift-work' and 'female/women.' Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause. Results Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure. Discussion Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe sleep duration and quality in the first month postpartum and compare the sleep of women who exclusively breastfed at night to those who used formula. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in a predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 first-time mothers. Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy, diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior. RESULTS: Mothers who used at least some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. Total nighttime sleep was 386 ± 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding group and 356 ± 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum. CONCLUSION: Women who breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and fragmentation. CITATION: Doan T; Gay CL; Kennedy HP; Newman J; Lee KA.

AB  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep-related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24-hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy-derived nor self-reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the "2-5 rare night-waking" (77% of the children) and the "2-5 common night-waking" pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the "2-5 common night-waking" trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (MC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects.

AB  - With rapid urbanization and life style changes, loud noise is omnipresent and has become a part of life. Indoor and outdoor environmental noise pollution have been documented as a serious health hazard with increasing adverse effects on fetus, infants, children, adolescents and adults. Noise induced hearing loss and non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution, are being increasingly diagnosed in all age groups including the fetus. Outdated motorized vehicles, machinery, increasing traffic, congested residential areas, crowded educational institutions and workplaces, unregulated commercial and industrial noise have become a source of noise pollution with long-term disability. Areas of noise pollution must be identified and corrective measures be taken. Toys, personal, domestic, commercial, industrial equipment should be within the safe sound intensity. Loudspeakers and vehicular horns should be banned except in emergencies. Nocturnal noise pollution must be avoided near residential areas as sleep disturbances have serious long-term health consequences. Pregnant women, fetus, newborns, infants and children are most susceptible to noise induced health hazards and should be given utmost protection. Educational institutions, workplaces, commercial and industrial areas should be regularly monitored for noise levels and protective ear muffs and plugs be used. Public be educated repeatedly regarding health hazards of noise. Traffic noise should be regulated to be within safe limits. Bus-stands, railway stations and airports should be moved away from residential areas. Houses should be sound proofed suitably.

AB  - Insomnia affects 10% to 30% of the population with a total cost of $92.5 to $107.5 billion annually. Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability, poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women, especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia. Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for refractory cases.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the literature regarding non-pharmacological inteventions for improving sleep quality and insomnia during pregnancy. Methods: An electronic search strategy was conducted using several online databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Index to Chiropractic Literature) from inception to March 2013. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies evaluating non-pharmacological interventions, published in English in a peer reviewed journal, and assessed sleep quality or insomnia. The full text of suitable articles was reviewed by the authors, and scored using a risk of bias assessment. Results: 160 articles were screened and seven studies met the inclusion criteria in the form of three prospective RCTs, one prospective longitudinal trial, one experimental pilot study, and two prospective quasi-randomized trials. Quality scores ranged from five to eight out of twelve on the risk of bias scoring criteria. Conclusions: Exercise, massage, and acupuncture may be associated with improved sleep quality during pregnancy, however, due to the low quality and heterogeneity of the studies yielded, a definitive recommendation cannot be made. Further higher quality research is indicated.

AB  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

AB  - This article reviews three new and emerging risk factors for stillbirth that may be modifiable or might identify a compromised fetus. We focus on fetal movements, maternal sleep, and maternal diet. Recent studies have suggested than a sudden increase in vigorous fetal activity may be associated with increased risk of stillbirth. We review the papers that have reported this finding and discuss the implications as well as potential future directions for research. There is emerging literature to suggest that maternal sleep position may be a risk for stillbirth, especially if the woman settles to sleep supine. This risk is biologically plausible. How this knowledge may be utilized to assist stillbirth reduction strategies is discussed. Finally, we examine the somewhat limited literature regarding maternal diet and pregnancy outcome. Introducing probiotics into the diet may prove useful, but further work is required. The possible next steps for research are considered, as well as some potential intervention strategies that may ultimately lead to stillbirth reduction.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is to determine whether sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.Study Design: NuMoM2b is a prospective cohort study of 10,037 nulliparous women with singleton gestations that was conducted across 8 sites with a central Data Coordinating and Analysis Center. The Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy recruited 3702 women from the cohort to undergo objective, overnight in-home assessments of sleep disordered breathing. A standardized level 3 home sleep test was performed between 6(0)-15(0) weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again between 22(0)-31(0) weeks' gestation (visit 3). Scoring of tests was conducted by a central Sleep Reading Center. Participants and their health care providers were notified if test results met "urgent referral" criteria that were based on threshold levels of apnea hypopnea indices, oxygen saturation levels, or electrocardiogram abnormalities but were not notified of test results otherwise. The primary pregnancy outcomes to be analyzed in relation to maternal sleep disordered breathing are preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth.Results: Objective data were obtained at visit 1 on 3261 women, which was 88.1% of the studies that were attempted and at visit 3 on 2511 women, which was 87.6% of the studies that were attempted. Basic characteristics of the substudy cohort are reported in this methods article.Conclusion: The substudy was designed to address important questions regarding the relationship of sleep-disordered breathing on the risk of preeclampsia and other outcomes of relevance to maternal and child health.

AB  - This is a descriptive and exploratory study that aims to assess the most frequent nursing diagnoses among pregnant patients with hypertension from a public hospital. Ten pregnant patients underwent a semi-structured interview and a physical examination. Data collection tools were based on Gordon's Functional Health Patterns. Data were analyzed, categorized and synthesized following the hypothetical-deductive model of Gordon. Thirteen diagnoses were identified. The most frequent ones were: poor knowledge about the health problem; ineffective health maintenance; ineffective management of therapeutic regimen; anxiety; disturbed sleep pattern; disturbed body image; altered sexuality patterns and fluid volume excess. These results show us the main nursing problems that pregnant women with hypertension present. It also points out the need to improve health education practices in this population.

AB  - This is an analytical-descriptive retrospective study, carried out in the Family Health Unit of Vila Real, in Marilia - SP, whose aims had been to elaborate the nursing diagnosis according to classification of North American Diagnoses Association (NANDA) and to elaborate the interventions of nursing for these diagnosis, having as base the record analysis of 40 pregnant women registered in the program of prenatal of that Unit. The data collection, in records, was carried out from April 1st to August 4th, 2005. Eleven nursing diagnosis had been elaborated: nauseas, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, disturbed standard of sleep, chronic pain, extreme volume of liquid, risk for impaired breast-feeding, impaired urinary elimination, unbalanced nutrition for more or less than the corporal necessities and risk for impaired maternity or paternity. The interventions of nursing for each one of these diagnosis had been elaborated in accordance with pertinent literature. When concluding the work we could verify that the survey of the diagnosis and the nursing interventions provided to the nurses an adequacy in the conduction of the work process.

AB  - This descriptive research aimed to analyze the Nursing Diagnoses identified in low-risk pregnant patients. Eleven pregnant women received prenatal care in a safe maternity in the state of Goias. The data were classified under the NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy II and analyzed according to the referrals in obstetrics. Twenty-five different Nursing Diagnoses were identified. All pregnant women presented: insufficient knowledge (different levels and subjects), disturbed sleep pattern, activity intolerance, self care deficit (bathing and hygiene), stress urinary incontinence, and some risk diagnoses. Identifying NANDA's Nursing Diagnoses allows the identification of the risk level, early detection of complications, and individualization in nursing assistance.

AB  - We aimed to analyze the responses of pregnant women pertaining to the sleep and rest class of the activity and rest domain of NANDA's Taxonomy. This is a cross-sectional study with 66 pregnant women selected by simple randomized sampling, performed in a basic health unit of the city of Fortaleza, from 2004 to 2005. Data collection was accomplished by the use of a form containing defining characteristics and factors related to nursing diagnoses, allowing for the verification of statistical association among these variables. The mean age of the pregnant women was 24,4 years; 78,8% of them had a companion and the family income of 86,4% was between 1 to 3 minimum wages. The standard diagnosis of disturbed sleep was associated to waking up three or more times during the night, annoyance and urinary urgency. The diagnosis of sleep deprivation did not present statistical association with the studied variables. We concluded that the standard disturbed sleep was strongly determined by the occurrence of urinary urgency and had annoyance as a consequence.

AB  - The regulation of linear growth by nutritional and inflammatory influences is examined in terms of growth-plate endochondral ossification, in order to better understand stunted growth in children. Linear growth is controlled by complex genetic, physiological, and nutrient-sensitive endocrine/paracrine/autocrine mediated molecular signalling mechanisms, possibly including sleep adequacy through its influence on growth hormone secretion. Inflammation, which accompanies most infections and environmental enteric dysfunction, inhibits endochondral ossification through the action of mediators including proinflammatory cytokines, the activin A-follistatin system, glucocorticoids and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In animal models linear growth is particularly sensitive to dietary protein as well as Zn intake, which act through insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins, triiodothyronine, amino acids and Zn2+ to stimulate growth-plate protein and proteoglycan synthesis and cell cycle progression, actions which are blocked by corticosteroids and inflammatory cytokines. Observational human studies indicate stunting to be associated with nutritionally poor, mainly plant-based diets. Intervention studies provide some support for deficiencies of energy, protein, Zn and iodine and for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, at least during pregnancy. Of the animal-source foods, only milk has been specifically and repeatedly shown to exert an important influence on linear growth in both undernourished and well-nourished children. However, inflammation, caused by infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, which may be widespread in the absence of clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and endogenous inflammation associated with excess adiposity, in each case contributes to stunting, and may explain why nutritional interventions are often unsuccessful. Current interventions to reduce stunting are targeting WASH as well as nutrition.

AB  - The United States is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The majority of American women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. The presence of excess body weight in a woman can negatively impact fertility, pregnancy, postnatal recovery, and the health of her child. Psychiatric comorbidities, including eating and mood disorders, can influence nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss in the postpartum period. Stress associated with caretaking in the postpartum period impacts levels of sleep and physical activity, which further impact postpartum weight retention. This article reviews the literature in these areas; the article discusses the management of excess body weight during and after pregnancy as well as related psychiatric conditions in pregnant and postpartum women.

AB  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of US women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

AB  - Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity. Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts, and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment.Copyright © 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea–hypopnea index (AHI)>5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI)>25, AHI<5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI<25, AHI<5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson’s and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25±0.23, 0.58±0.55, and 0.51±0.37mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n =23), obese non-apneics (n =45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n =29), respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p =0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p =0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r =0.22, p =0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r =0.10, p =0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β=0.02, p =0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study.

AB  - The aims of this paper are to study the associations between objective and subjective sleep in pregnant women, to examine which specific aspects of women's sleep are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and to test the moderating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the relations between objective and subjective sleep. The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants' home, and subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their wellbeing.
