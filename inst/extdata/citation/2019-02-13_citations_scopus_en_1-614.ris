AB  - Treatment of Anxiety Neurotic anxiety is by far the most common indication for benzodiazepines. In a three-month period, approximately one in 10 American adults will take diazepam because of tension or nervousness. Symptomatic anxiety is extremely common among the adult population, but whether it is severe or prevalent enough to justify this extent of pharmacotherapy is questionable. Anxiety is an elusive clinical syndrome. It describes a psychophysiologic response resembling fear but inappropriate to the reality of the perceived threat. Manifestations can include psychic symptoms (irritability, tension, excessive worry, and inappropriate apprehension), somatic symptoms (palpitations, breathlessness, diaphoresis, tremor, urinary frequency, fatigue,…. © 1974, Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB  - By a simple rocket immunoelectrophoretic method the 90% normal range of serum human placental lactogen hormone (HPL) in the second half of pregnancy was determined in 436 normal pregnant women. The mean half life of HPL after delivery of normal infants determined in 5 patients was found to be 14.6 min (range 13.2-16.4 min). A close correlation was found between serum HPL and serum progesterone (r = 0.75). No circadian rhythm was found.

AB  - A series of 240 patients admitted for termination of middle trimester pregnancy received prostaglandin F2α by intraamniotic injection at various times of the day. It was shown that the response (in terms of induction abortion interval, total dose of PGF2α required and duration of hospitalization) was significantly influenced by the time of injection and that for each of these parameters there was a statistically circadian or 24 hr rhythm. The optimal response was obtained following infusion of PGF2α at 1800 hr. Observations on additional groups of patients indicated that this response rhythm was disturbed by bed rest during the day prior to PGF2α administration. The induction abortion interval was also prolonged by concomitant use of d propoxyphene for analgesia and by twin pregnancies. In addition to the circadian rhythm of response related to the time of administration of PGF2α there was a circadian rhythm in the hourly incidence of abortion, the peak incidence being recorded at about 0800 hr. The temporal relation of the observed periodicity in response to the intraamniotic administration of PGF2α to circadian fluctuations in plasma steroid levels is discussed. It is suggested that a chronotherapeutic approach to the induction of abortion or labor with prostaglandins may be advantageous.

AB  - The eye movement frequencies and related paradoxical sleep rhythms have been measured in normal and abnormal neonates and infants, and in normal and mentally retarded children and adults. It appears that the eye movement frequencies > 1 Hz and related PS cycles are 2 different entities. The first ones alone are positively correlated with the IQ and with hormonal changes. The PS cycles are similar in all the subjects past the age of 1 yr, and seem to be related to conditions of survival. The eye movement frequencies > 1 Hz and the related PS cycles are differentiated by their temporal pattern characteristics alone.

AB  - Analysis of data from a series of 240 prostaglandin (PG) F2a induced terminations of pregnancy has indicated that there are circadian rhythms in the induction abortion interval, the total dose of PGF2a required to produce abortion, the duration of hospitalization and in the distribution of abortions along the 24 hr scale. The response rhythm was disturbed by bed rest during the day and by withholding the evening meal prior to PGF2α administration. The induction abortion interval was also prolonged in ditokous pregnancies and with the use of d propoxyphene for analgesia. The temporal relationship of circadian variations in peripheral plasma steroid to the observed periodicity in response to the intraamniotic administration of PGF2a is discussed. Both the periodicity in spontaneous delivery at term and PGF2a induced abortion may be related to circadian fluctations in steroid metabolism.

AB  - The problem of the cutaneous pain threshold induced by thermal stimuli is considered from a biophysical point of view. A new method for the determination of the cutaneous pain threshold is described. Research has been carried out with this method on rhythmic changes of the cutaneous pain threshold. It was observed that a circadian rhythm is present both in men and in women. A circatrigintan rhythm is present: in fertile women, in which it coincides with the menstrual cycle; in women in pregnancy; in women in menopause; in young men; in men over 55 yr of age. During the administration of oral contraceptives the circatrigintan rhythm is no more evident in the fertile women, but persists, instead, in women in menopause.

AB  - Plasma corticosterone response level showed a smaller rise in lactating than nonlactating female rats exposed to a strange environment. The hypothalamic CRF activity of lactating females did not differ from that of the nonlactating in unstressed conditions. After placement of both lactating and nonlactating female rats in a strange environment for one hour, the hypothalamic CRF activity of nonlactating animals showed a significant decrease which could not be observed in lactating rats. Moreover, it was found that the diurnal rhythm of plasma corticosterone concentration is almost absent in lactating animals.

AB  - A competitive protein binding assay for thyroxine (T 4) and a radioimmunoassay for triiodothyronine (T 3) were applied to determine the urinary concentrations of these hormones. These measurements were shown to offer excellent diagnostic discrimination between euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid subjects. Urinary T 3 and T 4 levels were not affected by changes in the concentration of thyroxine binding globulin or by changes in binding capacity; and therefore, remained normal during pregnancy, estrogen, and phenytoin therapy. There was no significant circadian variation in urine T 3 excretion. Thus T 3 assays of overnight urine samples could be used in conjunction with dynamic test procedures, such as thyrotrophin stimulation test, to enable the rapid assessment of the integrity of the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis.

AB  - Hypothalamic serotonin content and plasma corticosterone level were measured daily at 8 a.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m., during different phases of the estrus cycle in rats. The hypothalamic serotonin level showed a diurnal variation with a peak at 8 a.m. and the lowest level at 11 p.m. The morning level during proestrus and estrus was significantly lower than in metestrus and diestrus. The decrease in the hypothalamic serotonin level observed at 11 p.m. was significant in each phase of the cycle but it was the most marked during proestrus. The plasma corticosterone level showed an opposite trend. It was low in the morning and high at 11 p.m. in each phase of the estrus cycle except during estrus when there was no significant difference between the morning and the late evening value. The morning values in proestrus and estrus were twice as high as those in the metestrus and diestrus phases. Ovariectomy did not abolish the daily serotonin rhythm in the hypothalamus, but the morning value was significantly lower than in the proestrus, metestrus and diestrus phases. Estrone and progesterone treatment increased the morning hypothalamic serotonin level of castrated famale rats.

AB  - A radioimmunoassay for plasma unconjugated estriol is described using a highly specific antiestriol-antiserum. The antibody was obtained by immunising rabbits with a mixture of an estriol-C2- and estriol-C4-albumin conjugate. The specificity was demonstrated by crossreaction studies with various steroids and phenolic derivates. By use of this antiserum plasma estriol can be determined by radioimmunoassay with no preceeding chromatographic separation steps necessary. Within one working day the estriol concentration of up to twenty plasma samples can be determined with only 0.1 ml plasma required per estimation. The plasma concentration of unconjugated estriol increased from an average of 2.9 ng/ml in the 20th week of gestation to 15.3 ng/ml at term, with most of the increase demonstrable during the last trimester of pregnancy. There was a considerable variation of the individual estriol concentrations in different patients. The results of serial determinations at four hour intervals for 24 hours showed slight fluctuations with no consistent pattern. The mean coefficient of variation was 16.1±5.2%. Subnormal values of plasma estriol were found in patients in whom a placental insufficiency was assumed on clinical grounds. Serial determinations in 7 patients showed either no increase or even a decline of the plasma estriol levels. The newborns had a low birth weight and showed signs of fetal growth retardation. In cases of intrauterine fetal death a decrease in the plasma-concentration of unconjugated estriol could be demonstrated by serial determination early in the clinical course. Shortly after fetal death no measurable estriol concentrations could be obtained. The low estriol values in plasma and urine correlated significantly. Therefore determination of plasma unconjugated estriol is a significant contribution to the diagnosis of placental insufficiency. Serial determinations increase the liability of this method as an index of fetal well being, just as urinary estrogen assays do. Moreover, plasma determinations allow controls within shorter time intervals then urinary estimations do, the latter requiring collection of a 24 hours specimen. © 1974 J. F. Bergmann.

AB  - Blood samples were collected at 1 hour intervals for 24 hours from indwelling cannulas placed in the jugular vein of 7 lactating cows free from intramammary mastitis pathogens and from 5 cows infected with mastitis pathogens. 250 I.U. of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) was then administered intravenously to the 12 cows and blood samples were collected at 1 hour intervals for the next 6 hours, and at 8, 10, and 24 hours. Least squares analysis of variance indicated that concentrations of total leukocytes and neutrophils were greatest (P<0.01) in infected cows, but circulating lymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil concentrations were similar (P> 0.05) in both infected and noninfected cows. Throughout the 24 hour period, circulating erythrocyte concentrations varied significantly (P<0.01) for both groups of cows, whereas circulating leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte concentrations only varied (P<0.05) in noninfected cows. Erythrocyte and leukocyte concentrations were lowest and most stable in both groups of cows during the interval from 0200 to 1300 hours. Circadian rhythm was not detected (P>0.05) in plasma adrenal corticosteroid concentration for either infected or noninfected cows, nor was there any difference (P>0.05) in the concentration of this steroid between infected and noninfected cows (4.5 and 4.9 ng/ml of plasma, respectively). For both groups of cows, corticosteroid concentrations averaged approximately 4.7 ng/ml of plasma before intravenous injection of ACTH and increased (P<0.01) to 34 ng/ml 1 hour later. After this increase, plasma corticosteroid concentrations remained increased for the next 8 hours, then decreased to pre injection concentrations by 10 hours. In contrast to plasma corticosteroids, the concentration of circulating leukocytes for both groups of cows did not increase (P<0.01) until 2 hours after injection reached a peak at 10 hours, and remained increased (P<0.01) over the next 24 hours. Major changes in the concentration of circulating leukocytes were attributed primarily to changes in neutrophils in both groups of cows; however, the percentage increase in neutrophils was significantly (P<0.01) greater in noninfected than in infected cows. The bacteriologic status of the mammary gland did not have a significant effect on either the plasma corticosteroid or circulating leukocyte response to ACTH, whereas the stage of lactation and milk yield did. Corticosteroid and leukocyte responses were significantly less for cows in late lactation or which produced more than 18 kg of milk each day. These data indicate that both stage of lactation and milk yield should be considered in experiments designed to assess adrenal corticosteroid and circulating leukocyte responses to exogenous ACTH. Significant changes in the concentrations of granulocytes, agranulocytes, or epithelial cells were not detected in milk samples from noninfected quarters after administration of ACTH.

AB  - The interrelations of plasma values of insulin, sugar and acetoacetate (AcAc) were investigated on nocturnal blood samples from 544 dairy cows at different stages of lactation. A wide range of plasma levels was observed (plasma sugar 42 to 106 mg/100 ml, insulin 0.3 to 2.2 ng/ml, AcAc 0.05 to 27 mg/100 ml). Nocturnal samples were taken to exclude as much as possible variations in plasma components induced by feeding. The following correlations were found: sugar/insulin r = 0.45, P<0.001; insulin/AcAc r = -0.23 (P<0.001); sugar/AcAc r = -0.61 (P<0.001). The partial correlation between insulin and AcAc was not significant (r = 0.07) when glucose was eliminated. A simultaneous decrease in plasma insulin and sugar was found, hypoglycemic cows having the lowest insulin levels. It is concluded that this decreased insulin level is probably of importance in facilitating lipolysis during hypoglycemia, thus being a prerequisite for the development of ketosis. Ten cows were sampled twice, one sample being taken before partus and the other during the 45 first days of lactation. After the onset of lactation, indications of a more diabetic metabolism were found. The mean plasma insulin level was reduced from 1.3 to 0.6 ng/ml; a significant fall in plasma sugar and a rise in AcAc was also observed. Nine samples from cows developing ketosis and 23 with elevated AcAc levels, but without clinical symptoms, were compared to 26 samples of cows with low AcAc levels from the same herds and in the same stage of lactation. The mean insulin levels were 0.42, 0.52 and 0.71 ng/ml, and sugar 50.5, 59.5 and 73.6 mg/100 ml, respectively. It is concluded that the low insulin values found in the samples from the ketotic cows were due to reduced glucose stimulation of the pancreatic β cells.

AB  - The criteria for a test of placental function are as follows: The material measured should occur only in pregnancy, with the maternal contribution limited to clearance and excretion. The levels should not show gross variation from day to day, and there should be no circadian rhythm. The half life should be sufficiently short that only a brief time elapses between a fall in synthesis and a decrease in levels. The technique of measurement should be precise, should be applicable to large numbers of samples, and should be rapid so that the results are available to the clinician within hours rather than days. Of these criteria, the first 3 are to a large extent beyond the control of the investigator. Present tests, including the measurement of the hormone products discussed here, all have some disadvantages; for instance, they cannot be measured directly in the fetoplacental unit. The most important practical criterion is the fourth, that measurement should be easy, rapid, and precise, and that it should be possible to process large numbers of samples. The latter will ensure that studies of adequate size can be performed, and thus that the place of the test can be scientifically evaluated. It is also essential if a large increase in clinical application is envisaged. For the future, it is certain that the approach to placental function tests will be very different in the 1980's from that which obtains at the present time. First, all tests are likely to be performed on blood samples; the disadvantages of urine collection are such that it is bound to be replaced. Secondly, all tests for hormone products will be performed by radioimmunoassay; unless this technique is replaced by a better one, it offers immense advantages in terms of both precision and the ability to process large numbers. Thirdly, every unit will have available a spectrum of tests: for instance, oestriol as a test of fetus and placenta together; human placental lactogen as a test of the placenta alone; and a specific fetal product such as alphafetoprotein, as a test of the fetus alone. Fourthly, and most important, these tests will not be confined to those patients who have obvious clinical abnormalities, but rather, they will be extended to all patients. The collection of a blood sample for biochemical determinations will become as routine a part of an antenatal visit as is the taking of blood pressure.

AB  - 17 male rats were studied who had recovered from severe neonatal jaundice induced by giving the mother phenylhydrazine during pregnancy. The mean duration of paradoxical sleep was reduced in these animals by comparison with 17 controls. This observation is correlated with the reduced ability of such experimental rats to learn active avoidance tests, and compared with data showing that paradoxical sleep tends to be reduced in mentally retarded children and adults.

AB  - Seventy one patients with primary and secondary sterility were treated 164 times with clomiphene citrate. Seventy per cent reacted with ovulation, 39.4% of the patients treated became pregnant. The initial dosage was in all cases 50 mg chlomiphene dihydrogen citrate daily for 5 days. Only after an adequate study of results was a further course of treatment given with an increase in dosage. The side effects were uniformly of minor degree, and the hyperstimulation syndrome was not encountered. Twenty eight patients became pregnant. Of 31 pregnancies, 25 ended with the birth of a mature child, there were 2 premature labors and 2 pregnancies were still continuing at the time of assessment. In 2 cases abortion occurred. The only multiple pregnancy was a twin pregnancy where there was a familial disposition. The abortion rate of 6% was extraordinarily low. In this connection there is no doubt that (in 2/3 of cases) the use of hormonal prophylaxis once pregnancy was established played an important role.

AB  - Of 1,690 infants born after 38 completed wk of gestation and examined at birth, 163 who showed moderate to severe subcutaneous wasting were selected for prospective study. A number of adverse effects were recorded in the neonatal period, namely, increased perinatal mortality, birth asphyxia, abnormal central nervous system signs and congenital abnormalities. Many of these effects increased as the severity of the wasting increased. When compared with matched controls there was a significantly increased incidence of hospital admissions and sleep disorders during the first yr of life and of low social quotients at the one yr examination, the highest proportions occurring in the severely wasted group.

AB  - A statistically significant relationship exists between psychological ill health in the past, during pregnancy and at the time of admission of distressed babies to an infant care hospital. In this study 77 of 104 mothers showed such a relationship. Past and present physical ill health and that during pregnancy was not statistically significant. The infant developmental distress syndrome is characterised by feeding difficulties and vomiting, excessive crying, crossness and hyper responsivity, and sleep disturbances. Response to hospitalisation and non specific therapy rapidly reverses the syndrome which clinically can be recognised by the presentation of the distressed infant in association with the mother's psychological ill health as defined. The vulnerability of the mother, particularly of those who have premature infants, and the unmarried who intend to keep their babies is discussed, together with the potential for primary prevention of further developmental pathology.

AB  - To determine the nature and extent of fetal metabolic changes during administration of inhalation anesthesia to the mother, the authors studied maternal and fetal cardiovascular and acid base changes during general anesthesia with halothane and isoflurane in 16 near term pregnant ewes with chronically implanted intravascular catheters and uterine artery flow probes. Three levels of anesthesia were examined for 90 min each. During light and moderately deep anesthesia (1.0 and 1.5 MAC) with either agent, maternal blood pressure was slightly depressed (< 20% from control), but uterine vasodilation occurred and uteroplacental blood flow was maintained. Fetal hypoxemia or metabolic acidosis did not occur. Deep levels of anesthesia (2.0 MAC) produced greater reductions (> 35%) in maternal blood pressure and cardiac output. Despite uterine vasodilatation, uterine blood flow decreased and the fetuses became hypoxic and acidotic.

AB  - Both ERA thresholds and conventional behavioral thresholds or behavioral orienting responses were obtained on 179 children, 112 of them under 4 yr of age. A total of 374 comparisons were made, all at 1,000 Hz, 283 awake and 91 asleep. For the waking cases in which the confidence in the ERA test was high or average the agreement was satisfactory: about 70% within ± 15 dB. When ERA confidence was low the divergencies were much more frequent. Most of the worst ERA errors (false positives) were rectified when ERA was repeated. Other divergences rest only on behavioral orienting responses in which our confidence is low. The ERA tests asleep show a systematic trend toward ERA less sensitive than behavioral. The chief clinical value of ERA has been to confirm low confidence behavioral estimates based on orienting responses or to provide threshold values when no behavioral threshold could be obtained. A few ERA tests were classified as inconclusive.

AB  - Infant rats were raised by dams whose drinking water did, or did not, contain ethanol throughout the nursing period. The body weights of infants reared by alcohol drinking mothers was significantly lower than that of water reared subjects. Alcohol reared infants were also found to be tolerant to a challenge dose of ethanol when tested at 21 days of age.
Sprague-Dawley lactating female rats were divided into 2 groups. The control group was fed water and the experimental given a 10% solution of ethanol as its only source of fluid. All other conditions such as food, housing, and number of suckling pups were identical. Animals were weighed daily. After 21 days 'sleeping time' of all off spring was determined following an ip injection of 4g/kg (20% w/v) ethanol. Blood and brain ethanol concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. The results showed a depressed growth rate in offspring (38.7 gm as compared with 44.6 gm in controls, p less than .01). The mean fluid intake was lower (p less than .01) in lactating ethanol treated females. The mean sleeping time of offspring of ethanol treated females was lower (p less than .05). The results indicate that suckling animals whose mothers are drinking ethanol have significantly lower growth rates and that a tolerance to ethanol in the sucklings can occur.

AB  - 6 Hydroxydopamine (6 OHDA) produces a relatively selective effect on sympathetic nerve terminals. The selectivity of this action appears to be related to its accumulation within noradrenergic neurons by uptake 1 transport mechanisms. Once inside the neuron, 6 OHDA is bound in a granular storage pool and can be released by nerve stimulation, thus acting as a false neurotransmitter. In sufficiently high amounts, apparently more related to the concentration in the cytoplasmic pool, 6 OHDA generates highly reactive products, suggested to be peroxides, superoxides, hydroxyindoles, and quinones. These products react nonspecifically with neuronal structures and eventually destroy the neuron. Accompanying the loss in the adrenergic nerve active amine uptake mechanism is the appearance of presynaptic supersensitivity at a host of sites. Development of postsynaptic supersensitivity has been suggested to occur with time in certain structures. In the peripheral nervous system the terminals regenerate, and it has been observed that functional activity is restored at early times, when the amine levels are still reduced and while the terminal network is far from being fully regenerated. In the peripheral nervous system, 6 OHDA alters noradrenergic terminals to various degrees in different end organs. Time course studies, following various routes of administration, have determined the threshold for terminal destruction in various organs of several species. In general, the increasing order for threshold of the destructive action of 6 OHDA in various end organs is cardiac ventricles > salivary glands > whole heart > iris > nictitating membrane > spleen > atria > blood vessels > vas deferens > sympathetic ganglia > adrenal glands. In regard to the adrenals it bears mentioning that they apparently are unaffected by direct 6 OHDA action, but respond to diminished sympathetic function by compensatorily increasing catecholamine (CA) turnover. Terminals in all organs studied regenerate at a steady rate. In the CNS of mature animals 6 OHDA produces marked alterations of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons after injection into the parenchyma of the brain or into one of the brain cavities. Early studies showed that 6 OHDA in moderate doses could deplete the brain of NE in the absence of ultrastructural damage. Also, DA stores are initially increased after 6 OHDA and are depleted only as a consequence of damage to dopaminergic neurons. The regional effects of 6 OHDA on noradrenergic neurons in the brain vary according to the parameter under study. Different regional variations are found when either NE content, NE uptake or tyrosine hydroxylase activity is measured. The degeneration of the central noradrenergic neurons occurs in different phases, classified as primary and secondary degeneration. The primary phase is related to the direct destructive action of 6 OHDA on the neuron and occurs in about the first 48 hr after treatment. The secondary phase occurs over a period of weeks and appears to be the result of retrograde degenerative events subsequent to terminal or axonal damage. Numerous behavioral parameters are altered by 6 OHDA. Initial behavioral changes are likely to result from norepinephrine or DA release from central CA containing neurons after treatment with 6 OHDA, while more permanent alterations appear to be a better reflection of central neuronal destruction. Immediately after injection 6 OHDA decreases food and water consumption, lowers body temperature, and decreases locomotion. More permanent effects are manifested by altered sleep patterns, increased irritability and aggression, and altered operant activity. Numerous studies have been performed to characterize the observed alterations to a specific region in the brain and also to the specific neurohumor involved. Studies with 6 OHDOPA indicate that it is metabolically decarboxylated to 6 OHDA, which then destroys CA containing neurons. It appears to be useful for selective destruction of noradrenergic neurons. One distinct advantage of 6 OHDOPA is its ability to cross the blood brain barrier, so that both central and peripheral noradrenergic neurons may be destroyed after a single dose. (394 references).

AB  - A series of 240 patients admitted for termination of middle trimester pregnancy received prostaglandin F2β by intra-amniotic injection at various times of the day. It was shown that the response (in terms of induction-abortion interval, total dose of PGF2β required and duration of hospitalization) was significantly influenced by the time of injection and that for each of these parameters there was a statistically significant circadian or 24-hour rhythm. The optimal response was obtained following infusion of PGF2β at 1800 hours. Observations on additional groups of patients indicated that this response rhythm was disturbed by bed rest during the day prior to PGF2β administration. The induction-abortion interval was also prolonged by concomitant use of d-propoxyphene for analgesia and by twin pregnancies. In addition to the circadian rhythm of response related to the time of administration of PGF2β there was a circadian rhythm in the hourly incidence of abortion, the peak incidence being recorded at about 0800 hours. The temporal relationship of the observed periodicity in response to the intra-amniotic administration of PGF2β to circadian fluctuations in plasma steroid levels is discussed. It is suggested that a chronotherapeutic approach to the induction of abortion or labour with prostaglandins may be advantageous. © 1974.

AB  - A serum estrogen assay was evaluated for use in an indigent population in terms of its practicality as well as accuracy, precision, and other statistical parameters. Seventy patients were chosen retrospectively from the obstetric high-risk clinic at the University of Alabama Medical Center on the basis of delivery of a normal infant (Apgar score of 7 or greater). Twenty-four-hour total urinary estrogen (UE), the estrogen/creatinine ratio ( E C), and serum estrogen (SE) were determined on these patients throughout the third trimester of pregnancy. Correlation coefficients for 218 paired samples were highly significant (p < 0.01) between SE and UE (r = 0.31), SE and E C (r = 0.28), and UE and E Cr = 0.72). The over-all means and standard deviations for UE, E C, and SE, respectively, were 27.5 ± 15.3 mg. per 24 hours, 22.1 ± 11.2 mg. per gram, and 26.0 ± 11.6 ng. per milliliter while the equations for the best-fit regressions were y = -31.94 + 1.79x, -30.37 + 1.57x, and -16.46 + 1.26x, demonstrating that the rise in weekly SE levels is slower than for UE parameters. Since only one case of overscreening existed in 70 patients, it can be concluded that SE is a most useful clinical aid in screening the high-risk obstetric population for indications of possible fetal compromise. This assay system has the necessary practicability to be useful under the conditions presented by an indigent population seen predominantly as outpatients. © 1974.

AB  - Employed a behavioral monitoring technique using magnetic tagging for the prolonged observation of 6 colonies of control CBA mice (n = 102) and 3 colonies of CBA mice that were socially isolated for 6 mo (n = 51). After 40 days of social interacton in a population cage, several physiological and behavioral abnormalities were observed in the preisolated Ss. The males were hyperaggressive and failed to establish a stable social hierarchy, with a consequent high male mortality. Also, the preisolated Rank-1 males did not patrol their territory effectively in spite of greater overall activity. Phase drifts were found in both preisolated male and female circadian activity rhythms, together with elevated systolic blood pressures and adrenal weights. The females in the preisolated colonies had fewer pregnancies and an increased litter mortality compared with the control females.

AB  - The material carried by axoplasmic transport affords a unique opportunity for the study of proteins vital to synaptic function. In order to obtain reproducibly labelled transported material for investigation, we have examined the properties of fast axoplasmic transport in the optic pathway of the rat. The rate of fast transport in axons of the retinal ganglion cells is 202±8 mm/ day. No difference was seen in the rate of transport when male and female animals were compared. The oestrus cycle of the female had no effect on the observed rate of transport. Proline was the most efficient precursor employed for labelling the transported material. Of the tritiated amino acids examined, L-proline resulted in the lowest amount of blood-borne radioactivity reaching the nerve terminals. The efficiency of the other amino acids examined was L-leucine > D, L-leucine ≫ L-alanine > L-asparagine. The amount of tritiated material transported varied with a diurnal rhythm. This variation was due to changes in incorporation of the injected precursor into retinal protein. The variation in amount of incorporation can create a ten-fold difference in the amount of tritiated protein accumulating in nerve terminals. The solubility properties of proteins transported throughout the day were investigated by extraction into media of increasing solubilizing power. By this measure, the proteins transported at different times of day were not differentiable. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The experience of becoming and having a sibling is a common situation for many preschool children. In order to clarify the implications of such an event for the older preschool child, the authors have surveyed the literature and interviewed a series of families where there was a second or third birth. This is a preliminary communication where a broad overview of the many variables involved is sought. Varied techniques for preparing the older preschool sibling were observed, as were varied coping mechanisms employed by the older child in adjusting to the change in his family status. Fourteen variables are discussed, and suggestions are made for further research. © 1974 Behavioral Publications, Inc.

AB  - Although the clinical and experimental data were in favour of the existence of prolactin in humans like other vertebrates, as a pituitary hormone distinct from growth hormone, its presence remained contested until recent years. The predominant influence of the human hypothalamus on prolactin secretion is inhibitory. Circulating prolactin shows diurnal variations, which are not synchronized with that of TSH or ACTH; the prolactin rhythm is abolished during the last trimester of pregnancy and in patients with prolactin secreting tumors. Estrogens appeared to be less marked stimulators of prolactin secretion in man than in animals, although serum prolactin levels follow a pattern similar to that of endogenous estrogens during the normal menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. After delivery, basal prolactin levels declined progressively. In women under long term medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment, the immunoreactive serum prolactin was within the normal range of cycling women. Prolactin is found in appreciable amounts in amniotic fluid and in the serum of newborn infants. Synthetic LH and FSH releasing hormone did not change circulating prolactin levels in normal humans. A possible luteotrophic action of human prolactin in synergism with LH cannot be excluded. © 1974.

AB  - Fetal tracheal pressure was recorded continuously for prolonged periods in awake, restrained rhesus monkeys. Other parameters recorded included fetal blood pressure, heart rate, eye movements, and EEG. Fetal arterial blood samples were obtained intermittently for determination of pH and respiratory gas tensions. The observations spanned the interval from approximately 115 days' gestation until term. Changes in tracheal pressure representing a variety of respiratory movements were observed. Isolated and repetitive gasping movements exceeded 30 mm. Hg negative pressure. Rhythmic and rapid irregular breathing movements of lesser intensities were also recorded. These breathing movements occupied approximately two thirds of the time in the healthy fetuses. Somatic and eye movements were more frequent and the heart rate and blood pressure more irregular during the periods of respiratory activity than during the intervening quiet times. Fetal breathing movements disappeared during fetal stress and failed to develop in fetuses which did not exhibit normal pH and respiratory gas tensions following operation. © 1974.

AB  - Blood cortisol levels were studied during normal human pregnancy. Blood samples were obtained from patients during the last weeks, during labor, at the time of delivery, and from the umbilical cord. Plasma cortisol was estimated by a competitive protein-binding assay. The mean value observed prepartum was 35.9 ± 1.27 μg per 100 ml.; a sharp increase was observed during labor with a maximum at birth of 64.7 ± 21 μg per 100 ml. and a rapid decrease in the six hours following birth; the mean value obtained in mixed cord blood was 10.7 ± 3 μg per 100 ml. The increase of cortisol during labor was compared with cesarean sections and surgical procedures in nonpregnant patients. A possible relationhas been found with fetal distress and rupture of the membranes. Dexamethasone infusion to mothers during labor had no effect on maternal plasma cortisol. © 1974.

AB  - In vitro accumulation of 3H-labelled monoamines into hypothalamic slices taken from rats in different endocrine conditions was investigated. Accumulation of 3H-labelled noradrenaline into hypothalami from ovariectomised rats was increased by pretreatment for 3 days with 1 μg oestradiol. Accumulation of 3H-labelled dopamine (DA) was decreased by 4 mg progesterone given together with 0.05 μg oestradiol for 3 days. 3H-labelled 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) accumulation was not affected by any of the hormonal treatments. When oestradiol (3.6 × 10-12-3.6 × 10-6 M) or progesterone (1.6 × 10-6-1.6 × 10-4 M) was added to the incubation flask both hormones inhibited accumulation of all 3 amines. In hypothalami taken from immature rats induced to ovulate, accumulation of [3H]NA and [3H]5HT on the day before ovulation was not different from untreated controls; in both groups there was a diurnal rhythm. Accumulation of [3H]DA in these hypothalami significantly increased at the beginning of the critical period and decreased at the end, indicating a dopaminergic control of the timing of the critical period. © 1974.

AB  - Acute and chronic observations of the fetal electroencephalogram (EEG) in a fetal sheep preparation revealed two distinct patterns of sleep activity consisting of high-voltage slow activity (HVSA) and low-voltage fast activity (LVFA). A decrease in fetal heart rate, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebral blood flow was observed consistently during LVFA when compared to HVSA. There was no significant difference in cerebral metabolism during the sleep stages. © 1974.

AB  - Because of our previous findings that pregnanolone and related metabolites of progesterone inhibit drug demethylation and hydroxylation reactions in vitro, a variety of other steroids and naturally occurring substances were tested for inhibition of the O-demethylation of p-nitroanisole by 9000 g hepatic supernatants from adult male rats. Of some 58 steroids tested, none was more potent than pregnanolone. Other potent inhibitors, with the exception of norethindrome, had a similar structure (C21) with hydroxyl or keto groups at C3 and C20. Inhibitory activity was not related to the endocrine activity of the steroid. Inhibition by a group of 11 steroids was generally greater with 9000 g supernatants from female rats, and was uniformly increased with supernatants from pregnant rats. By 10 days after delivery, inhibition returned to levels equivalent to those found with supernatants from virgin females. Cholesterol and related compounds, fatty acids and esters, ceramides, gangliosides, phosphatidyl inositol and other natural fatty acid conjugates and a variety of indoles and lipids had no inhibitory activity. Pregnanolone administration increased the duration of hexobarbital- and of barbital-induced sleep in rats, apparently due to an additive sedative effect. However, microsomes prepared from these animals exhibited lesser rates of demethylation, with kinetics compatible with uncompetitive inhibition. These results indicate that progesterone, its metabolites and structurally similar steroids are potent inhibitors of microsomal drug metabolism. Such inhibition may be responsible in part for the low rates of drug metabolism seen in the female, during pregnancy, and in the neonate. © 1974.

AB  - Sleep consists of several distinct patterns of CNS activation, including synchronized or slow wave of sleep and desynchronized or rapid eye movement sleep. Specific areas of the brain as well as specific biogenic amine neurotransmitters appear to be responsible for the periodic shifts between sleep stages. Hypothalamic regulation of the anterior pituitary gland also is influenced by the same biogenic amine neurotransmitters, and the episodic release patterns of the anterior pituitary hormones suggest prominent CNS influences. This review considers the relationship of these hormone release patterns to the circadian sleep-wake cycle and to sleep staging within the sleep period itself. © 1974.

AB  - Observations on Animals THE question of whether the fetus normally breathes before birth has been a matter of uncertainty for the past 80 years. The casual or fugitive observations of breathing movements in fetuses of different species at cesarean section have been attributed to inadvertent tactile or thermal stimuli1 or to asphyxia, an argument that was hard to meet until the introduction of blood gas electrodes. Secondly, it was noticed that radiopaque contrast material, introduced into the amnion, soon appeared in the fetal intestines but, provided there was no asphyxia, not in the fetal bronchi.

AB  - Cocaine was administered orally on a double-blind basis to depressed patients and effects on EEG-monitored sleep were assessed. In doses which did not produce consistent effects on vital signs or mood, cocaine significantly reduced total sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The REM sleep supression with cocaine administration and rebound upon cocaine discontinuation was dose related; there was a greater effect at higher doses. Two properties of cocaine appear to closely correspond to those of many other drugs which suppress REM sleep in man-enhancement of functional catecholamines and/or high drug-abuse potential. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The hourly fetal urine production rate (H.F.U.P.R.) was measured in 92 normal antenatal patients by an ultrasonic technique. There was a rapid and linear rise in the mean H.F.U.P.R. from 9·6 ml. at thirty weeks to 27·3 ml. at forty weeks menstrual age. No circadian variation was demonstrated. 62 antenatal patients with complicated pregnancies were also screened. In 29 cases (47%) the H.F.U.P.R. was below the lower 5 % tolerance limit for normal fetuses; there was a highly significant increase in the number of growth-retarded babies in this group, but no correlation was found between reduced H.F.U.P.R. values and perinatal hypoxia. © 1974.

AB  - The diurnal variation of unconjugated estriol concentration was investigated in eight normal patients between the 34th and 41st week of gestation. Every two hours, blood samples were taken. Serum estriol was determined by radioinmunologic method developed recently. A circadian rhythm of serum unconjugated estriol was observed with the lowest estriol values at 08.00 h in the morning and the highest at 20.00 h at night. During this time, estriol increased by an average of 31 7. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Changes in the offspring of rats exposed to acute hypoxia during pregnancy were investigated in terms of the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone contents and brain acetylcholine levels for periods ranging from 15 to 120 postnatal days. The accelerated maturation of the daily adrenocortical rhythm and the retarded maturation of the circadian rhythm of brain acetylcholine levels were observed in the offspring of the maternal animals subjected to acute hypoxia three times. The same offspring, on the other hand, began to show, when as late as 90 to 120 days old, certain changes of the circadian rhythms already formed, which were characterized by the significant decrease in the evening value for corticosterone and also by that in the morning for brain acetylcholine levels as compared with the control groups. The more often the offspring experienced acute hypoxia in the fetal stage, the more markedly the above changes occurred. It was postulated that experimental acute hypoxia imposed on the mother produced certain chemical changes in the brain of offspring. © 1974, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Our method for the assay of total plasma estriol in human pregnancy has been scaled down and modified to accommodate 0.2ml samples. The method was applied to the evaluation of diurnal rhythms in 7 subjects who were studied at 5 regular intervals on two successive days. Three subjects exhibited little fluctuation over the 48-hr period. The other 4 subjects showed occasional wide fluctuations but in no case did the pattern repeat on the second day. The results contradict 2 previous studies, one emanating from this laboratory, in which circadian rhythms were reported. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The authors report the results of PRL and TSH determinations in 15 hypothyroid patients. Three of them have spontaneous galactorrhea independent of oral contraception. Basal serum values of PRL are normal, those of TSH are constantly high. One case of congenital myxoedema had a high value of TSH, with a moderately elevated serum PRL concentration. The circadian rhythm of PRL remained unchanged. Administration of TRH was followed by normal or exaggerated prolactinic response. The results suggest a certain independence of the regulatory mechanisms of PRL and TSH during myxoedema. In the authors' cases, galactorrhea was not accompanied by elevated concentrations of PRL.

AB  - Serum unconjugated estradiol-17β (E<inf>2</inf>) was measured by a radioimmunoassay method using a specific antibody raised against 6-oxo-estradiol-17β succinyl bovine serum albumin conjugate. Serum E, estimation was performed on 294 normal single pregnancies from 6 weeks to 42 weeks' gestation, 28 samples from uncomplicated twin pregnancies, and 12 samples from uncomplicated triplet pregnancies. In late pregnancy, serum E- levels fluctuated throughout the day and were lowest at night. Unconjugated E. rose slowly from a mean d= SE of 2.10 ±: 0.56 ng/ml at 6 to 7 weeks’ gestation to 8.03 ± 0.97 ng/ml at 30 weeks' gestation. From the 30th week of pregnancy, unconjugated E<inf>2</inf> rose much more rapidly until term to reach a nadir at 41 weeks’ gestation with a mean ±. SE of 35.85 ± 2.96 ng/ml. It dropped to 24.00 ± 3.67 ng/ml at 42 weeks. There was a wide scatter of serum E<inf>2</inf> values during pregnancy. Serum E<inf>2</inf> concentrations in uncomplicated twin and triplet pregnancies were usually much higher than for single pregnancies or within the normal range for single pregnancies. The significance of these findings is discussed. © 1974 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - A series of 240 patients admitted for termination of middle trimester pregnancy received prostaglandin F2α by intra‐amniotic injection at various times of the day. It was shown that the response (in terms of induction‐abortion interval, total dose of PGF2α required and duration of hospitalization) was significantly influenced by the time of injection and that for each of these parameters there was a statistically significant circadian or 24‐hour rhythm. The optimal response was obtained following infusion of PGF2α at 1800 hours. Observations on additional groups of patients indicated that this response rhythm was disturbed by bed rest during the day prior to PGF2α administration. The induction‐abortion interval was also prolonged by concomitant use of d‐propoxyphene for analgesia and by twin pregnancies. In addition to the circadian rhythm of response related to the time of administration of PGF2α there was a circadian rhythm in the hourly incidence of abortion, the peak incidence being recorded at about 0800 hours. The temporal relationship of the observed periodicity in response to the intra‐amniotic administration of PGF2α to circadian fluctuations in plasma steroid levels is discussed. It is suggested that a chronotherapeutic approach to the induction of abortion or labour with prostaglandins may be advantageous. Copyright © 1974, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The concentrations in plasma of progesterone, of unconjugated estradiol-17ß, and of uncon jυgated polar estrogens (estriol plus other C15 or Cl6 substituted estrogens such as estetrol) have been studied during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy in 10 women. The spread of values from subject to subject and from time to time has been calculated. The levels of unconjugated estradiol-17ß were least variable, and from this point of view assays of this steroid are recommended as a measure of fetoplacental function. © 1974 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Pinealectomized and sham operated adult male and female hamsters were kept under natural photoperiodic and temperature conditions beginning Sept. 22, 1972. On Dec. 28, 1972, sham operated male and female hamsters had atrophic reproductive organs, whereas those of pinealectomized animals appeared to be reproductively competent. Pinealectomized females, which were caged with pinealectomized males, bore litters during the months of Jan. and Feb. Pinealectomized or sham operated females, caged with sham operated males, did not become pregnant until early March. The results show that pinealectomized hamsters remain reproductively competent during the winter months.

AB  - It has been consistently found that when normal adults go to sleep they release a large quantity of growth hormone from the pituitary into the plasma. Over a 24 hour period, very little other growth hormone is detectable in plasma with the exception of a few episodes of release at irregular intervals during waking. If an individual does not fall asleep there will be no release of growth hormone. When release occurs it is associated with the nonREM portions of the sleep waking cycle, and indeed appears to be related to the deeper phases of slow wave sleep, especially stages 3 and 4. There is a general night to night consistency in this release in any given subject with respect to number of release episodes and magnitude of release. There is, however, considerable variability from subject to subject. Sleep related release of growth hormone has been shown to occur in children after early infancy. It occurs in both men and women, although there is some variation according to sex in that women seem to have less consistent release from night to night. There appears to be a decreasing release with age so that by middle aged persons the amount of hormones secreted in sleep appears to be less than in younger adults. The 24 hour pattern of prolactin secretion is that of secretion of prolactin in numerous small episodes during the daytime. When sleep occurs there is a marked release of the hormone and a marked augmentation of plasma concentrations as sleep progresses with highest concentrations reached at the end of sleep. In distinction from growth hormone, there does not appear to be a sleep stage relationship. In similarity to growth hormone, when sleep does not occur the augmentation of release of prolactin does not occur, indicating that this augmentation of release is totally dependent on the occurrence of sleep. With both prolactin and growth hormone, sleep reversal and nap studies have shown that release will occur in sleep during daytime hours. Since the study of the 24 hour patterns of prolactin release is so recent, we do not know as yet the pattern of release in pregnancy or the differences between the sexes or with aging.

AB  - A simple inexpensive technique for chronic intravenous cannulation of small laboratory animals is described. With this technique multiple daily blood samples can be taken to form serial hormone profiles of individual animals. The procedure does not interfere with ongoing behavioral and physiological processes. As a measure of stress caused by the procedure, prolactin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Prolactin levels were only elevated on the first postoperative day; subsequent levels were comparable to those measured in decapitated animals. It is concluded that this technique can be very useful for short- and long-term experiments in the field of hormones and behavior. © 1974.

AB  - Videotape sampling of behavior in a dual-chambered apparatus indicates that the continuous monitoring of the amount of time a mother spends in the cage with its litter can be taken as a valid reflection of maternal behavior. Nursing is the principal behavior of lactating females while in the compartment with their litters; lying still, consummatory behavior, and activity occur with greater frequency in the cage away from the litter. Both the time that mothers spend with their litters and nursing behavior displayed a 24-hr rhythm with crest values occurring during the period of light. © 1974.

AB  - A competitive protein-binding technique was used to measure progesterone concentrations in the peripheral plasma of pregnant ewes. Neither haemolysis of blood nor thawing of plasma samples affected plasma progesterone concentration. Blood samples should be chilled immediately upon collection but subsequent to centrifugation immediate chilling of the plasma samples is not critical. No consistent diurnal variation in progesterone concentrations was evident but there was large apparently random day-to-day variation in progesterone concentrations for any ewe. Although a significant positive correlation was found between endogenous progesterone and corticosteroid concentrations, the present study failed to correlate experimentally elevated plasma corticosteroid concentrations with progesterone concentrations. Progesterone concentrations varied greatly between ewes at the same stage of pregnancy. © 1974 ASEG.

AB  - The content of renin in rabbit uterus is known to increase many fold during pregnancy followed by a rapid fall to normal levels within a few days after delivery. In order to study this mechanism the blood concentrations of renin and its substrate were measured. Contrary to the concentration of renin in uterus, the plasma renin concentrations were not increased either during pregnancy or in the post partum period. The renin‐substrate concentration was unchanged during the first part of pregnancy but was increased 2–3‐fold in the days around delivery. This increase resulted in a corresponding increase in plasma renin activity. It was concluded that the rapid inactivation of uterine renin post partum was due to a local inactivation and not to a release of renin to the blood. 1974 Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica

AB  - In 1962, a protein body which resembled the somatotropic hormone of the human hypophysis and was therefore given the name of human chorion somato mammotropin (HCS), was discovered for the first time in the placenta and serum of women at the end of pregnancy. Over the years it has been possible to elucidate the structure, molecular properties, biosynthesis and physiology and to determine the hormone more accurately with radioimmunological methods. The HCS level in the maternal blood is an indicator of the placental function. A reduction of HCS was found in placental dysfunction and impending abortion, and also in disturbances of fetal development and exceeding the expected date of birth.

AB  - Abstract. An investigation has been carried out to assess the accuracy by which the diurnal urinary excretion of oestriol (dU‐oestriol) in pregnant women can be estimated from urine specimens collected in periods less than 24 hours. Night urines (9 h) are not recommended as a substitute for diurnal urines (24 h). Even correlation of the oestriol output from the night urines with the output of creatininium gives day by day variations which are significantly greater than the corresponding variations of the diurnal urines. in cases where the collection of a correct diurnal urine specimen (24 h) is difficult to obtain and it is important to get a quick answer it is recommended to use a single voided urine specimen and to calculate the diurnal excretion of oestriol by means of the creatininium output. 1974 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Serum progesterone (P) levels display a circadian rhythm of varying amplitude during the estrous cycle. This rhythm is characterized by lowest levels of the day around noon and maximal levels at 1600 or 2300 hr. Amplitude was smallest on estrus and progressively greater on diestrus II, diestrus I and proestrus. Serum estradiol (E2) concentrations declined gradually through estrus till 0800 hr of diestrus I. Thereafter, levels increased rapidly to peak at noon, and returned later to near nadir at 2300 hr of diestrus I. During diestrus II and morning of proestrus serum E2 concentrations increased in a biphasic pattern; a moderate increase till 1800 hr of diestrus II was followed by relatively rapid rise to peak levels at 0800 hr of proestrus. A reciprocal relationship between circulating levels of E2 and P during the estrous cycle was also detected. The elevations in serum P levels during estrus, diestrus I and proestrus appeared to coincide with a gradual reduction in serum E2 levels. In addition to the surge of serum LH in the afternoon of proestrus small increases in serum concentration of LH over the base line value were noted at 0800 hr of diestrus I and at 1600 hr of estrus. The influence of experimentally altering the circulating levels of P on endogenous levels of E2 was next examined. Administration of P at 0800 hr of diestrus I blocked the afternoon rise in serum E2; the suppressive effects persisted till 1800 hr of diestrus II. Similarly, injection of P at 0800, 1800 or 2300 hr of diestrus II suppressed the rise in E2 normally observed at proestrus. These observations suggest that circadian variations in peripheral serum P concentrations during the estrous cycle may constitute a regulatory mechanism for the observed daily fluctuations in serum E2. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Infant rhesus monkeys whose mothers were fed diets providing 1, 2, or 4 g protein/kg body weight/day during pregnancy were fondled for 5 min before their noon and 1600 hour feedings on 2‐3 weekdays weekly. Fourteen were caressed between 10 and 30 days of age; 18 between 41 and 95 days of age. The intake at meals following handling was compared to that for meals when handling was not given. The younger animals' intake was specific to the diet group and treatment. The older animals ate more at the 1600 hour meal than at the noon meal and more at weekday, nonhandled feedings than at weekday, handled or weekend feedings. Differences due to maternal nutritional history were not significant. Infant monkeys subjected to a variety of laboratory anxiety‐producing tests during weekdays drank more formula on test days than on tranquil weekends. This effect was ameliorated by preprandial comforting. Copyright © 1974 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract. Plasma progesterone levels were estimated by competitive protein binding in 815 samples from healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies. This series includes 32 patients who were followed serially throughout pregnancy. The mean level increased from 47 ng/ml in week 22 to 148 ng/ml in week 41. The spread was large. Individual patients showed very large variations between two consecutive weeks. Diurnal variations were examined in 7 patients and short‐time variations during one hour in 5 patients. Large but non‐systematic variations were found in most cases. The maximal difference between values observed over a 24‐hour‐period was 123 ng/ml and during one hour 150 ng/ml. Plasma progesterone levels were studied in 87 cases of toxemia of pregnancy, 6 cases of hypertension, 54 cases of Rh‐immunization, 37 cases of diabetes and 5 cases of fetal growth retardation of unknown origin. The results indicate that no constant changes occur in plasma progesterone levels in these groups or in cases of impending fetal death. As the normal limits are very wide, the intraindividual variations large, and the progesterone values in high risk pregnancies are inconclusive, plasma progesterone estimates during the latter part of pregnancy seem to be of limited value. During human pregnancy large amounts of progesterone are produced by the placenta (1, 14). The production rate during the third trimester lies between 200 and 300 mg/day (9). Part of the progesterone produced is metabolized to pregnanediol and excreted in the urine as the 3‐glucuronidate (16). The percentage of conversion to pregnanediol seems to vary with the stage of gestation and is influenced by pathological alterations in risk pregnancies (2, 5). Large day to day variations in the urinary pregnanediol levels have been found. It is thus hardly surprising that the clinical value of serial determinations of urinary pregnanediol in late pregnancy has been limited. Recently useful methods for the assay of progesterone in plasma have been developed and applied to physiological and clinical studies. A number of reports dealing with the prognostic value of progesterone determinations in complicated pregnancies have been published (8, 12, 17). The number of cases investigated is, however, small and the results are, in many respects, inconclusive. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the normal limits during the latter half of uncomplicated pregnancies, circadian and short‐time variations, and to evaluate the prognostic value of progesterone determinations in plasma in high risk pregnancies. 1974 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Sequential measurements were made of prolactin, LH and progesterone levels in un-mated, mated and prolactin-deprived rats. Prolactin deprivation was achieved by the use of 2-Bra-ergocryptine (CB-154), a drug which specifically blocks pituitary prolactin release. All drug-treated rats continued to cycle normally, although they were mated repetitively. Blood samples were collected from drug-treated mated rats, sham-treated mated rats and unmated rats at 7 AM, 4 PM and 11 PM. The drug treatment completely abolished the preovulatory prolactin peak and any elevation of serum prolactin levels in mated rats. The LH pattern found in the CB-154 treated rats was normal; the proestrous progesterone levels were subnormal. One and 2 days after mating progesterone levels were only slightly affected in CB-154-treated mated rats when compared with mated controls. Day 3 after mating, however, was characterized by subnormal progesterone values. When the treatment was discontinued before day 3 of pregnancy all drug-treated animals remained pregnant, and only complete prolactin deprivation up to the afternoon of day 3 after mating resulted in abortions, which were followed by normal cycles. In pregnant control rats serum progesterone was highest at 11 PM, which may be indicative of a daily rhythm in serum progesterone during pregnancy. This possible rhythm is out of phase with the semicircadian prolactin peaks because prolactin was lowest at 11 PM. Highest progesterone values in normally cycling rats were found at 4 PM on each day of the estrous cycle. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In principle, a patient informs the air travel company several days prior to a planned journey by air that he needs a medical fitness report. The airline ticket office hands to him a questionnaire which is filled in by his medical practitioner. The questionnaire is then passed on to the company's medical service; they decide whether and in which way (lying down, sitting up, with attendance of a physician or of nursing personnel, etc.) the air travel can be undertaken. In many cases, consultation with the attending medical practitioner is necessary. Large airlines have contracts with physicians at practically every airport.

AB  - Prolactin has variable effects on the weights of ovaries and uteri of hamsters depending on the time of day when the injections are made. The photoperiodic entrainment of these daily variations in responses to prolactin is apparently mediated by the adrenal cortex because corticosterone injections can entrain similar response rhythms in hamsters held in continuous light. The estrus cycle appears to be arrested in late diestrus or early proestrus by injections of prolactin at 18 hr after the onset of a 12-hr daily photoperiod or at 12 hr after the injection of corticosterone. The body fat stores are also increased or decreased depending on the temporal pattern of injections of prolactin and corticosterone. © 1974, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pineal HIOMT activity was measured following induction of pseudopregnancy by uterine cervical stimulation in the rat. The diurnal pattern of enzyme activity was altered within 2 days and was significantly different from that measured during the estrous cycle. Though diurnal rhythmicity persisted, the change in activity could be accounted for by a modification of 1 of 2 hypothetical component rhythms which describe the HIOMT pattern. No change in the mean rate of enzyme activity or of the hypothetical amplitudes of the component rhythms was noted. Ovariectomy, performed after the induction of pseudopregnancy, did not alter the pseudopregnant pineal rhythms, but caused a decrease in the mean rate of enzyme activity. Ovariectomy, performed prior to cervical stimulation, did not prevent the development of the pseudopregnancy pattern of HIOMT activity in the pineal gland. In this instance also, the mean rate of enzyme activity was less than that in intact rats. These results are consistent with a previously proposed model for pineal gland function in relation to reproductive activity.

AB  - The degree of uterine responsiveness to exogenous estrogen was studied in 4-day cycling rats and in ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats. Uterine tissue collected at different stages was incubated in medium-199 containing [3H]leucine at 37 C under 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide for 2 hr. Tissue uptake and protein incorporation of the radioactivity were measured to assess uterine activity. In cycling rats, the uterus was able to respond to 1.0 μg of 17β-estradiol by increases in both uptake and incorporation of [3H] leucine during estrus, metestrus and in the morning of diestrus but not during proestrus nor in the afternoon of diestrus. In ovariectomized rats, estrogen priming (1.0 μg) seemed to cause an immediate loss in uterine sensitivity to further hormonal stimulation. Subsequently, the estrogen-primed uterus gradually regained its estrogen responsiveness and eventually reached a degree even higher than that of unprimed uterus. The data suggest that the ability of the uterus to respond to exogenous estrogen appears to correlate with the level of available estrogen receptor in the tissue. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Return to fertility was evaluated in women discontinuing the oncea-month oral contraceptive, quinestrol and quingestanol acetate. The time from the last drug-induced to the first post-treatment menstruation ranged from 25 to 45 days in 73% of the 290 women interviewed. Seventy-two percent of the endometrial biopsies, taken 14 days or less before this first menses, were found to be normal secretory. One-hundred-and-four women desiring to become pregnant after stopping therapy required an average of 7 months to conceive after their last treatment. The duration of contraceptive treatment did not influence the type of endometrial biopsy nor the time required to become pregnant. There was, however, a direct relationship between the duration of therapy and the length of time to the first post-treatment menses. The return to fertility in these women was found to be prompt with no evidence of significant delay. © 1974.

AB  - The concentration of prolactin in serum after estrogen and progesterone injection into spayed rats was measured by radioimmunoassay. After a single injection of 5 μg estradiol benzoate (OB) into long term ovariectomized rats, serum prolactin concentrations showed a circadian rhythm with high levels in the afternoon and almost no changes in the morning. Peaks of prolactin occurred 2, 3 and 4 days after the injection. Below a dose of 1 μg OB, the response was dose dependent, but the response was then maximal. In spayed rats primed with 5 μg OB, the injection of 2 mg progesterone 2, 3 or 4 days later resulted in a significant increase in serum prolactin. This response, in contrast to that of estrogen, occurred in the morning and in the evening and was found to be dose dependent. The rise in serum prolactin after injection of 1 mg progesterone also showed a close relationship to the priming dose of OB. Progesterone had no effect in spayed, untreated animals. Maximal levels of prolactin were attained 3 to 4 hr after the s.c. injection of progesterone. The release of prolactin which can be induced either by OB or by progesterone was blocked by the administration of progesterone injected 1 day before the expected release would occur. These results indicate that progesterone exerts both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on prolactin secretion. Male rats were found to be less sensitive to the ovarian steroid treatment. It is suggested that estrogen could be responsible for the rise in prolactin observed at proestrus and progesterone for the increase in prolactin in pseudopregnancy and pregnancy.

AB  - Five to 10% of all air passengers may present medical problems during travel, but with simple precautions, advice, forethought and possibly simple medical equipment, less than one in 10,000 passengers need actually be refused. With the number of passengers growing considerably, physicians are more and more often asked for advice concerning the advisability capacities. air travel in special cases. The construction and design not only of the aeroplanes but even more so of the airports may cause considerable strain to passengers. Airports throughout the world are far from standardized from a passenger's point of view, and often give little consideration to man's physiology and physical capacties. Airport design may cause special problems for certain groups of passengers such as the elderly, handicapped or weak-sighted. Conditions also vary widely as regards medical services and preparedness for catastrophy. The problems arising during air transport are partly physiological because of low oxygen tension and dysbarism, partly physical among other things because of restricted space. The rules for refusal of passengers are in principle common to all air lines, corresponding with International Air Transport Association regulations. Where required, medical certificates of fitness for air travel are also based on uniform formulae. As a general rule a passenger is refused if he 'does not look, act and smell normal'. Certain pathological conditions may cause special problems during air travel, for example cardio-respiratory problems, gastro-intestinal disorders, ENT-diseases, pregnancy, and psycho-neurological disorders. In general most such problems are easily prevented by simple measures and medical guidance. Exotic and contagious disease give rise to increasing problems for doctors and health authorities, and a 100% safe solution is practically unobtainable because of ever shorter cruising times and increasing intercontinental air travel.

AB  - Gonadectomy in the newborn produced an elevated or "female" pattern of serum corticosterone levels when basal levels of corticosterone (B) were measured at the trough and peak of the daily rhythm and when the response to a 2 minute ether stress was recorded after weaning age. Administration of 1.25 mg testosterone propionate (TP) at two days of age did not significantly alter corticosterone patterns in intact males but did prevent the rise in serum B noted in gonadectomized (Gondx) males. In contrast with oil-injected females, females androgenized with 1.25 mg TP showed precocious vaginal opening,persistent estrous and a failure of serum B to become elevated at noon on the day of vaginal opening. Gonadectomy at weaning age had no effect on basal levels of B but there was a more rapid elevation of B after ether stress in Gondx males. By 30 minutes post-stress, the levels of B were the same in both groups. Gonadectomy at 60 days of age had no effect on B levels except for a transient decrease in B at 8 p.m. one week after surgery. The stress response was also normal in castrated males. It can be concluded that early androgen exposures does alter the functional properties of the adrenal but that continued secretion of androgen is not necessary to maintain adrenal function at a "male" level in adults. © 1974.

AB  - An animal can only achieve its full genetic potential if it has lived its life in an ideal environment. Few environments are ideal; they may be unfavorable for numerous reasons and for different lengths of time. Indeed, variations on these themes are almost infinitely possible, but concrete examples will be selected and their effects on the lives of animals and of man demonstrated. Time comes into all this, but its importance and the difference between chronological and biological time have not been properly appreciated. The interactions of time and the environment on the growth of animals and of their organs are complex, but recent work on malnutrition and growth has given us some insight into the matter. Theories that have been formulated are discussed, but none of those yet put forward explain all the facts that can be demonstrated experimentally, and studies that might provide clues have been neglected.

AB  - The general theory of critical periods applies to organizational processes involved in the development of any living system on any level of organization and states that the time during which an organizational process is proceeding most rapidly is the time when the process may most easily be altered or modified. Complex organizational processes involving 2 or more interdependent subprocesses may show 1 to several critical periods, depending on the time relationships of the subprocesses. The nature of the relationships between interdependent processes operating on different levels is again dependent on time and is a more meaningful formulation than that of the old “innate‐acquired” dichotomy. These theoretical considerations lead to the conclusion that understanding a critical‐period phenomenon rests on analyzing the nature of the organizational process or processes involved. An example is given in a review of research on the critical period for primary socialization (social attachment) in the dog. Evidence that attachment has taken place consists of discriminative behavior in relation to familiar and unfamiliar objects and rests on a minimum of 3 processes: (1) organization of the separation distress response; (2) visual and auditory sensory capacities; and (3) long‐term associative memory capacities. Once these capacities are developed, the overall attachment process proceeds very rapidly (the critical period for such attachment). Thus the critical periods for the organizational subprocesses precede or slightly overlap that for the overall process. Deeper analyses of these processes must rest on neurophysiological research. The theory of critical periods is a general one that should apply to any developmental organizational process which proceeds at grossly different rates at different times.

AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to determine the ovarian contribution to changes in peripheral progesterone (PROG) levels during normal maturation and after treatment with 25 IU pregnant mare’s serum gonadotrophin (PMS) at 26 days of age. Sprague-Dawley derived rats were ovariectomized (OVX) at 22 days of age and given either saline or PMS at 9 AM at 26 days of age. Groups of animals were killed by decapitation every 4 hr on days 28–29 and days 33–34 (3 days and 7 days after PMS). There was a significant peak (p < 0.01) of PROG at 1600 on day 28 in both intact and OVX saline-treated rats. The lowest PROG levels were found at 0400. PROG values were higher on day 33 in both intact and OVX rats with a maximum at 1600. Peripheral values of corticosterone (B) were the same in intact and OVX saline-treated rats at 28 days of age with a peak at 1600 while B was higher in intact rats at 33 days of age than OVX rats (p = 0.01). PMS given on day 26 produced a marked elevation inserum progesterone and corticosterone in comparison to intact saline-treated controls and a longer period of peak blood concentration (1200 to 2000 us 1600 only in controls). Peak B values in PMS-treated rats were higher than in controls (p = 0.01). Ovariectomy prior to PMS administration prevented the increase in P and B on day 28, but resulted in higher than control values for P and B on day 33 (p = 0.05). It is concluded that the daily rhythm of progesterone in maturing rats persists after ovariectomy but that the increase seen in progesterone at ovulation is initiated in the presence of the ovaries. Peripheral progesterone and corticosterone rise and fall together in immature rats but become dissociated a week after PMS treatment when high levels of progesterone persist in association with suppression of adrenal corticosterone. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity (NAP) increases in the final mth of gestational age and becomes normal in puerperium. The enzyme's activity is presented in the perinatal period in 20 healthy women aged 20 to 38 yr. The cytochemical determination of NAP activity was performed before delivery, in the second hr after delivery, and in the second, fourth and sixth days of puerperium. Statistically significant increase of NAP activity was demonstrated in the second day post partum. This increase was probably due to an increase of the white cell count in blood samples during this period.

AB  - During the 9 mth of pregnancy, a woman passes through her usual wide range of consciousness states. She sleeps, wakes, laughs, cries, has orgasms, becomes intoxicated, works, plays, continues her life as a person. But, as repeated studies have shown, she is undergoing profound physiological and psychological changes. Some women change more than others, but all enter into the special state to one degree or another. Characteristically, they become more intensely emotional than usual and rapidly swing from one mood to another, a phenomena known as emotional lability. They are unusually prone to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and crying spells. She may become obsessed with dreams and symbols, become suddenly superstitious, feel extraordinarily vulnerable, or become phobic to cars, to small spaces, or to strangers. Pregnancy is not an 'altered state of consciousness' only because of altered chemical balance, it is also a special state because of the content of the pregnant consciousness.

AB  - A study of behavioral patterns and the mental state of children in early preschool age during the period of adaptation to conditions of children's institutions was carried out. It was established that the duration of the period of adaptation depends upon different circumstances. The longest adaptation appears to be in children with anomalies in past history (unfavorable pregnancies and deliveries, frequent diseases, a wrong upbringing in the family). These children require psychiatric observation.

AB  - To evaluate the effect on testicular function of the sleep related LH rise in pubertal subjects, identical twin boys (JA-1; JA-2) in stage 2 of puberty were studied for 36 hours using a frequent sampling technique. While each subject was awake the mean ± S.E. testosterone (T) level was 257 ± 41 and 325 ± 31 pg/ml for JA-1 and JA-2 respectively. Each night with the commencement of sleep, sharp increases of T and LH but not FSH levels occurred. The nocturnal elevations of T reached peaks of 1887 and 1833 pg/ml for the same respective subjects and were always preceded by the sleep related LH rises. The interval between the nocturnal LH rise and the beginning of the subsequent T elevation was 40-80 minutes. This data suggests that in adolescent boys the sleep related LH increase stimulates a nocturnal rise of T. This androgen increase could account for some of the early pubertal changes seen in males. © 1974 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The authors carried out 120 electroencephalograms of fetuses in labour. The tracings were of good quality in all except 25 cases. In normal labour the tracing is the same as would be found in a newborn child of the same gestational age. In particular, the sleep cycle (deep sleep, disturbed sleep and wakefulness) is found. The alterations that were observed in each type of pathological circumstance were studied in detail, as were the effects of certain drugs. When the sleep cycle disappears over a prolonged recording this is a most specific sign of cerebral distress.

AB  - On the basis of 223 serial polygraphic eeg recordings made of 27 pre‐term, 72 small‐for‐dates and two hypoxic full‐term infants, the duration and percentages of total quiet‐sleep time per one sleep cycle spent in slow‐wave sleep and trace alternant (or trace discontinu) were studied, with the following results. (1) The duration of quiet sleep was constant between 32 weeks and 45 weeks' conceptional age. (2) The slow‐wave sleep pattern emerged from quiet sleep at about 35 to 36 weeks and gradually increased thereafter to replace immature trace alternant at 44 to 45 weeks. (3) Small‐for‐dates infants of toxemic mothers showed delayed maturation compared with those of non‐toxemic mothers and pre‐term appropriate‐for‐dates infants of the same age. (4) The two hypoxic infants had abnormal sequences of development of slow‐wave sleep. Depending upon the degree of hypoxic damage, slow‐wave sleep was affected to a variable degree. (5) The developmental sequence of slow‐wave sleep is one of the useful indices of the maturity of the central nervous system of the newborn infant, though it is unreliable for the assessment of conceptional age because of the considerable individual variability. Un total de 223 enregistrements eeg polygraphiques en série a été fait chez 27 prématurés vrais, 72 nourrissons de poids faible pour le terme et deux nourrissons nés à terme ayant présenté un épisode d'hypoxie. Ceci dans le but d'étudier la durée et le pourcentage de temps total passé en sommeil lent tranquille et les tracés alternant (ou tracés discontinus) pour un cycle de sommeil avec les résultats suivants. (1) La durée de sommeil tranquille s'est montrée constante de 32 à 45 semaines d'âge conceptionnel. (2) Les patterns d'ondes lentes de sommeil sont apparus à partir du sommeil tranquille vers 35 à 36 semaines et se sont accrus progressivement pour remplacer les tracés alternant immatures vers 44 à 45 semaines. (3) Les nourrissons de poids faible pour le terme, chez les mères toxémiques, ont montré une maturation retardée par comparaison avec les nourrissons de mères non toxémiques et ceux de poids normal pour le terme, de même âge. (4) Des exemples de sequences anormales de développement ont été observées chez deux enfants hypoxiques. Selon le degré des lesions hypoxiques, le sommeil lent fut altéréà des degrés variables. (5) La succession en cours de développement du sommeil lent est l'un des indices les plus utiles de la maturité du système nerveux central à la naissance mais il ne peut permettre une determination de l'âge conceptionnel du fait de la variation considerable inter‐individuelle. Insgesamt wurde 223 polygraphische Langzeit eeg Aufzeichnungen bei 27 Frühgeborenen, 72 hypotrophen und 2 reifen hypoxischen Kindern durchgeführt, mit der Absicht, die Dauer und den prozentualen Anteil des Tiefschlafs mit langsamen Schlafwellen, mit ‘trace alternant’ (oder tracé discontinu) während eines Schlafzyklus zu untersuchen, wobei es zu folgenden Ergebnissen kam. (1) Die Dauer des Tiefschlafes während des Gestationsalters von 32 bis 45 Wochen war konstant. (2) Das eeg Muster der langsamen Schlafwellen unterschied sich vom Tiefschlaf ungefähr in der 35–36 Woche, nahm danach langsam zu und verdrängte schließlich um die 44–45 Woche das unreife trace alternant Muster. (3) Hypotrophe Kinder toxämischer Mutter zeigten eine verlangsamte Reifung verglichen mit reifen, gleichaltrigen Kindern gesunder Mutter. (4) Bei den zwei hypoxischen Kindern fanden sich Beispiele eines abnormen Entwicklungsablaufes. Je nach Grad der Hypoxie waren die langsamen Schlafwellen unterschiedlich stark beeinträchtigt. (5) Der entwicklungsmäßige Ablauf der langsamen Schlafwellen ist ein nützlicher Hinweis für die Reifung den Zentralnervensystems bei Neugeborenen, jedoch ist er unzuverlässig fur eine Bestimmung des Gestationsalters, wegen der bemerkenswerten Streubreite beim individuellen Kind. Se realizó un total de 223 trazados poligráficos de eeg a 27 niños nacidos antes de término, 72 niños con bajo peso al nacer y 2 nacidos a término con hipoxia, con el objeto de estudiar la duración y el porcentaje de tiempo de sueño con quietud total presente en un sueño con onda lenta y trazado alternante (o trazado discontinuo) en un ciclo de sueño, obteniéndose los resultados siguientes. (1) La duración del sueño tranquilo era constante desde las 32 a las 45 semanas de edad concepcional. (2) El trazado de sueño de onda lenta aparecia en el sueño tranquilo alrededor de las 35–36 semanas y aumentaba graduamente para reemplazar el trazado alternante inmaduro a las 44–45 semanas. (3) Los niños con bajo peso al nacer hijos de madres toxémicas mostraban una maduración retrasada en comparación con los niños de madres sin toxemia y con niños de la misma edad con peso apropiado. (4) En dos niños hipóxicos se dieron ejemplos de una secuencia anormal de desarrollo. En dependencia con el grado de lesion hipóxica, el sueño de onda lenta estaba afectado en grades variables. (5) La secuencia de desarrollo del sueño de onda lenta es uno de los indices utiles de maduración del SNC del recién nacido, aunque no es fiable para la valoración de la edad concepcional por la considerable variación individual.

AB  - In this prospective study on epilepsy over a period of 2 yr involving 631 subjects, 65% were residents of Bangalore city. Major epilepsy accounted for 46% of all types of attacks, while temporal lobe epilepsy and/or temporal lobe epilepsy becoming generalised came next with 34%. Motor and/or motor epilepsy becoming generalised accounted for only 7%. Absence and myoclonus were very rare. There was a significant direct relationship between pregnancy order and epilepsy. There was a significantly higher incidence of past febrile convulsions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, restricted or becoming generalised, than in other types. Sleep sensitive attacks were significantly more frequent in major epilepsy than in other types. Hot water epilepsy, which accounted for 9% of all cases, was more often temporal lobe in type. Unequivocal EEG confirmation of epilepsy from a single interictal resting record was seen in one third of patients with major epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy restricted or becoming generalised, under three fourths of patients with absence and myoclonus and in about one eighth of patients with other focal epilepsies, restricted or becoming generalised. Thus the diagnostic value of a single resting EEG in epilepsy is limited.

AB  - The authors describe a method of polygraph recording of fetal electroencephalograms (EEGF) in labor. This method was introduced in the Baudelocque clinic in 1972 to 73. 20% of 85 tracings collected during this period of introduction of the technique were of sufficiently good quality to merit analysis. While it is impossible to draw firm conclusions from these preliminary results it was possible to draw the following two tentative conclusions. EEG activity of a normal fetus during a normal labor seems to be exactly the same as that of a newborn infant of the same gestational age. In particular there was found, but not regularly, a succession of periods of 'average activity', which correspond in the newborn to a state of awakeness or of light sleep, and periods of 'alternating' tracings which were indicative (and normal) in the newborn normal child of deep sleep. This suggests that perhaps in the uterus as much as outside the uterus there is a variation from the waking to the sleeping state and back again. If this is true it is remarkable that it is totally independent of the state of contraction of the mother's uterus and even of her bearing down efforts which do not modify the tracings obtained of the sleeping and waking states. These features were only observed in normal deliveries. The flattening of the tracing, which most authors consider as a sign of fetal distress, is certainly a complex phenomenon and requires very careful interpretation. Opinions about its significance are far from unequivocal.

AB  - An analysis was made of 450 children up to 2 yr of age with cerebral lesions of a perinatal nature. A description of the main forms of pathology is given. Of special importance is the consideration of the state of the child in an assessment of the EEG (vigilance, sleep and falling asleep). On the basis of a correlation of the EEG data and clinical symptomatology (124 cases with different forms of cerebral paralysis and 19 with perinatal encephalopathy), EEG was found to be valuable as an auxiliary method in the general clinical study of this contingent of children.

AB  - Pretreatment of rats and mice of either sex with a single 2.0 mg/kg dose of cadmium acetate (840 μg Cd ion) potentiates the action of subsequently administered hexobarbital. Three days after cadmium administration to the male rat the duration of response to hexobarbital, but not that to barbital was significantly prolonged. Plasma concentrations of hexobarbital at awakening were not different from controls, indicating that cadmium treatment had not altered central nervous system sensitivity to the barbiturate. Such treatment of male rats 3 days prior to sacrifice leads to a significant inhibition of the metabolism of aminopyrine, hexobarbital, p-nitroanisole and zoxazolamine in microsomal subfractions obtained from these animals; microsomal cytochrome P-450 is reduced to 50% of control values by the cadmium treatment. Inhibition of the metabolism of these substrates by cadmium was also achieved when the metal was added to isolated microsomes in concentrations ranging from 5 × 10-4 to 5 × 10-7 m. © 1974.

AB  - Clonazepam is a useful drug, at least when used in combination with other anticonvulsants. It has numerous closely related side effects many of which are shared by other benzodiazepine derivatives, e.g. nitrazepam, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. No serious or irreversible side effects have been reported to date and 2 females who inadvertantly became pregnant during therapy with clonazepam gave birth to healthy infants. The occasional exacerbation of seizures by clonazepam therapy is well recognised and may be related to a clonazepam induced fall in plasma phenytoin levels in patients taking the 2 drugs. Withdrawal of clonazepam may be followed by particularly severe status epilepticus, but whether this reflects the severity of the person's epilepsy per se, or is a drug interaction phenomenon, is uncertain. Clonazepam induced side effects can be minimised in most subjects by dosage adjustment, thus enabling adequate therapeutic administration over prolonged periods.

AB  - Twenty cases are reported of acute encephalopathy with myoclonia, in patients receiving continuous treatment via oral bismuth salts, mainly subnitrate in large doses, but within the usually accepted limits. Slowing of intestinal transit due to chronic colonic disease with particularly severe constipation, was found in all cases, in which women predominated. The neurological syndrome masked by often misleading psychiatric disorders came on gradually, and was remarkably similar in all cases. It included mental confusion with striking troubles of the attention and in some cases, stupor or transient coma with diffuse myoclonia, predominating in the limbs, occurring spontaneously, but mainly during voluntary and passive movements, with pseudo tremor of the upper limbs; complex dysarthria, static and walking disorders, attacks of generalised epilepsy in some cases, slow, diffuse, nonspecific EEG changes without any parallel with the clinical condition, total reversibility of the neurological phenomena within a few weeks after stopping bismuth. Blood and urinary estimations of bismuth levels by absorption spectometry, confirmed the massive absorption of the metal into the blood and its slow elimination. These toxic phenomena which are radically different from those of soluble, injectable salts of bismuth, raise 3 main pathogenic problems: the cause of passage of bismuth into the blood, its precise circulating form or the nature of the organometallic compound, its relationship with encephalitis. The only theory which now seems probable is the fact that modern forms of bismuth subnitrate present in the form of fine particles, which may explain the rapid absorption and the apparent epidemic nature of these encephalopathies.

AB  - Early diagnosis and operative treatment are important to achieve a lasting disappearance of the complaints and symptoms of chronic compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is surrounded by stiff tissue, namely bone and ligament, carpi transversum and is very narrow. The contents are, apart from the median nerve, composed of flexor tendons and even under normal conditions the nerve sustains distinct stress during extreme flexion and extension. The patient is awakened after several hours of sleep by tormenting paraesthesiae in the first 3 fingers, or in the whole hand. Shaking of the hand and massage relieve the symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms exist for years, before neurologic symptoms develop, as a disturbance of sensation and atrophy of the thenar muscles. Women are more often affected than men. The diagnosis is clear when the syndrome is complete. Without objective signs one can provoke the typical symptoms by extreme flexion of the wrist during 1-2 min and by tying up the upper arm. Pain syndromes from other causes must be excluded, for instance: lower cervical syndrome, compression of the lower part of the brachial plexus, arthritis and syringomyelia with atrophy of the thenar musculature. By bipolar stimulation a prolonged conducting time of the nerve is found. The etiology includes hormonal changes (pregnancy), climacteric, acromegaly, hypothyroidism), rheumatic changes, tendovaginitis, trauma, and ganglion. Conservative treatment by cortisone injection in the carpal tunnel is given. When conservative measures fail operative treatment is indicated. The median nerve is decompressed under general anesthesia and local hemostasis. Via a lazy S incision the transverse ligament is incised along its ulnar border and partly excised. Often the compression is mostly in the distal part of the tunnel. In a 4 yr period the diagnosis was made in 96 cases. Thirty seven patients were operated on (42 hands). Thirty five had very painful paraesthesia mostly limited to the area of the median nerve and 29 hands showed more or less atrophy of the thenar musculature. The operative results were good in 30 patients (35 hands) (complete disappearance of the symptoms to very satisfactory). Four cases showed only slight improvement and 3 cases no improvement. In 35 hands (30 patients) there was definite improvement of sensation, of which 15 showed complete cure.

AB  - Assessment of temporal relationship between levels of prolactin (PRL), gonadotropins, and ovarian steroids in 14 ovulatory cycles was made. Serum PRL concentrations were determined by a homologous radioimmunoassay. Our data showed that, although the highest mean PRL concentration was found on the day of LH-surge and the day after estrogen peak, a consistent pattern of circulating PRL in daily morning samples was not present in ovulatory cycles; variations in random fluctuation with erratic spikes were observed within cycles and between subjects. In two cycles studied, despite markedly elevated PRL levels (eightfold) induced by amphetamine, optimal ovulatory events occurred in terms of both hormonal patterns and luteal function. These findings implicate a lack of apparent physiologic role of PRL in the regulation of ovarian function in human subjects. The random daily fluctuation of PRL was further characterized in samples obtained at 10 to 30 minute intervals during different days of five ovulatory cycles and continuous sampling during day and night was made in three of five studies; a clear episodic nature of PRL release was disclosed. A circadian rhythm with marked elevation during sleep which was composed of multiple peaks with larger excursions than those found during waking periods was revealed. The event of sleep-induced PRL rise was initiated shortly (30 to 90 minutes) after the onset of sleep and ceased upon wakening. In one subject a quantitatively greater nocturnal PRL release around midcycle (eightfold) than during the follicular and the luteal phases (threefold) was found. These data would facilitate future elucidation of the inapparent role as well as the neuroendocrine regulation of PRL secretion during the human menstrual cycle. © 1973.

AB  - The timing of the acrophases for human natality appears to vary in such a pattern that on the average the greater the latitude north or south from the equator the later the computative acrophases occur in the year. The same finding is seen for acrophases of simian natality in various habitats, presumably in the absence of human interference. However, in human data from countries as diverse as Australia, Cuba, India, South Africa and the U.S.A. there is an unexplained 'leveling off' of the relation between birth acrophases and latitude. The variation in acrophase with latitude suggests an environmental influence upon human fertility patterns. This relationship, if proved, may reflect with possibly yet greater likelihood differences between the more urban and industrial populations of the middle and higher latitudes as compared to the more agrarian and gaming ones of the equatorial regions. Moreover, even at similar latitudes, the circannual acrophase of birth may differ drastically because of varying customs. Emphasis must therefore again be placed upon results of least squares spectral analyses on separate time series. From these series, new groupings may be explored. Thus, in populations less likely to be using contraceptive devices the circannual computative acrophase occurs early in the year. Differences in the timing of human birth rhythms for various subsets of all samples are summarized. In populations where a majority are believed not to practice birth control an average acrophase of -16° is estimated; but for countries in which contraceptives are freely available and their use encouraged, the circannual computative acrophase occurs at -120°. For the United States the timing of computative acrophases is much later, at -248°. A circannual rhythm in birth for regions inhabited mainly by populations relying primarily on natural methods of family planning must not be interpreted as expressing an endogenous human fertility rhythm. On the contrary, such a periodicity, and in particular its timing, apparently reflects a societal influence. For example, any widespread practice of sexual abstinence and delay of marriage during spans involving certain kinds of religious observance may influence if not synchronize human circannual birth rhythms.

No distinct pattern could be demonstrated, neither was there an observable pre ovulatory progesterone peak. Estrogen levels were very low except on days 2 and 3 prior to the onset of estrus. The LH peak started before estrus and lasted for 8-10 hr.

AB  - Although much is known about the physiological effects of high altitude, relatively little is known about any possible deleterious effects in the case of pregnant passengers or air hostesses exposed to the cabin altitude of modern jet transport aircraft. Possibly because of this lack of knowledge, there appears to be uncertainty regarding the advisability of pregnant women flying. The author examines those physiological factors in flying which could conceivably have an adverse effect in such cases, in particular the blood gas values quoted by various authors in normal crews as well as in pregnant women and the foetus. The method of nutrition of the developing embryo is discussed. The conclusion is drawn that there is no evidence that flying per se or the hypoxia induced at a cabin altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 ft has any deleterious effect on mother, embryo, or foetus. Air hostesses should therefore be permitted to continue flight duty during the first trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - Serum levels of immunoreactive human placental lactogen (HPL) were determined in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine retardation of fetal growth. Retarded fetal growth was assumed if the weight of the newborn was found below the tenth percentile of the diagram of Lubchenco. This group was divided into two subgroups with extreme and light retardation of fetal growth. In the first group serum levels of HPL were found to be significantly below the 95.5% range of confidence of normal, in the second group the serum levels of HPL were found only partly below normal. Serial determinations of serum HPL in the course of pregnancy showed a positive correlation between the profiles of serum HPL and the dynamics of intrauterine growth in cases of severe retardation of fetal growth.

AB  - Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay in groups of Wistar rats at 6 hr intervals during the course of a 4 day oestrous cycle. In addition to a surge at about 18.00 hr on the day of prooestrus, a circadian rhythm in LH levels was observed which was accentuated during metoestrus. FSH levels showed a protracted periovulatory rise which reached peak levels at about 03.00 hr on the day of oestrus. A daily rhythm was not observed. The incorporation of [35S]methionine (injected subcutaneously 1 hr before death) into the trichloroacetic acid precipitable proteins of the anterior pituitary and of discrete brain areas implicated in the control of gonadotrophin release was also measured. An increase in protein synthetic activity was observed in the anterior pituitary and the area of the median eminence on the evening of prooestrus with peak levels coinciding with the LH surge at 18.00 hr on the day of prooestrus. An increase in protein synthetic activity relative to that in a 'control' area (the putamen) was observed in the preoptic area and in the amygdala 15-18 hr before the LH surge. It is suggested that these changes in protein synthetic activity are associated with the train of neural and humoral events leading to ovulation. After ovariectomy, protein synthetic activity in all areas investigated was at the low levels observed during the oestrous cycle. Daily injections of 20 μg oestradiol benzoate into intact females led to levels of protein synthesis as great as, or greater than, the maximal levels observed during the oestrous cycle. Measurements of variations in total protein concentration/unit wet weight of pituitary or brain tissue showed that they were apparently unrelated to variations in protein synthetic activity. Protein concentration appeared to be high in all the brain samples taken at oestrus and low in those taken at metoestrus. Furthermore, superimposed upon a marked daily rhythm, there was a peak of protein concentration on the evening of dioestrus both in the preoptic area and in the area of the median eminence.

AB  - Organochlorine compounds enter the metabolic system and ultimately appear in milk. The extent of contamination in certain geographic areas may be considerable at times. Determining the feed sources of pesticide in an actual operating farm led to the realization that several unanswered questions existed concerning the levels actually found in milk. These included differences in route of exposure, postpartum secretion, diurnal variation, and the effect of thyroprotein feeding. Basic information concerning rate of transfer from the blood compartment and the metabolic products formed by the liver was obtained. Rate of depletion during low residue intake and correlation between levels in carcass and milk were determined.

AB  - The excretion of free cortisol was determined in 181 urine samples of normal individuals. The logarithmic values but not the numerical values were normally distributed. The normal range (2 SD range) in subjects without disturbances of adrenal function was found to be 15.3-83.1 μg/day (mean 35.9 μg/day). No significant difference could be found between male and female individuals or between groups of different body weight. However, the free cortisol was significantly higher in ambulatory persons as compared to hospitalized persons (P<0.001). The 17 OH corticoids, on the other hand, as estimated from the same urines, were highly dependent on body weight but showed no difference between outpatients and hospitalized patients. The mean free cortisol in 17 pregnant women was found to be slightly elevated but all individual values fell into the normal range. Among 18 patients with renal failure of various degrees the free cortisol was below the normal range in 6 cases and the 17 OH corticoids in 3 cases. All values of free urinary cortisol in patients with adrenal insufficiency were below the normal range and all values in patients with Cushing's syndrome or after ACTH administration were above the normal range. The 17 OH corticoids in these groups of patients showed a considerable overlap with the normal range. In contrast to determination of the 17 OH corticoids, the free urinary cortisol, which can be estimated by a simple, precise and very sensitive protein binding method, discriminates well between various pathological conditions and therefore often provides a diagnosis from one single 24 hour sample.

AB  - No systematic changes in the percentage of paradoxical sleep were found either over pregnancy or over the menstrual cycle, whether ovulatory or not. On the other hand, the number of rapid eye movements increased significantly in the latter half of pregnancy and of the ovulatory menstrual cycles. This variation was not found in nonovulatory menstrual cycles. The rapid eye movement of paradoxical sleep would therefore seem to be a parameter which can reflect, though in a nonspecific way, the activation of the CNS endocrine system occurring during pregnancy and during the menstrual cycle.

AB  - To determine if body protein is used as energy substrate for exercise under conditions of chronic malnutrition, body composition, nutrient intake, basal and exercise metabolic rates, and rates of urinary excretion of creatinine, urea, and total nitrogen were determined in male twins with anorexia nervosa; both were track athletes. Urinary nitrogen and metabolic data were collected during periods of heavy exercise, resting awake, and sleep. Both subjects had very low stores of body fat; their basal metabolic rates were -24 and -27%, respectively. During the 3 day study, the nitrogen balance was negative. Heavy exercise increased oxygen consumption 10 to 15 fold over basal levels but no change was detected in the urinary excretion of nitrogen during or after heavy exercise. Urinary loss of nitrogen remained at basal levels throughout each period of study (resting, exercising, and sleeping). It was concluded that nitrogen was conserved during heavy exercise and that these subjects could maintain a high rate of activity, even though in a chronic wasted state clinically, because activity did not change the rate of use of their only major body stores of energy: their lean body mass.

Piotr appeared to show the highest rate of height and weight growth; Ewa, the lowest one. In the 7th mth of age, head and chest circumference values achieved the standards of singletons born at term. Psychomotor development of the quintuplets was not only normal but even high. Teething occurred in the 8th to the 10th month. Hematological examinations in the first 6 mth showed some anemia, which disappeared in the 7th mth. Other laboratory examinations did not show any deviations, except for slightly lowered serum level of gammaglobulins. In their first yr of age the children suffered from diseases. Infections of the upper respiratory tract followed a mild course.

AB  - Threshold values have been established for a number of the older inhalation anesthetics but are as yet unknown for the more modern agents. However, it is easy to determine the variable proportion of anesthetic vapors in the operating room which are considered to be responsible for some morbid processes observed in a certain percentage of anesthetics. The need for correct elimination of the anesthetic gases is therefore obvious. This can be done in two ways: by removing the exhaled gases to the outside atmosphere or by binding the exhaled gases on a filter. The testing of two commercial filters is reported . The results of a study investigating the allegedly higher rate of abortions among women anesthetists are also discussed.

AB  - The question of the occurrence of respiratory movements in utero, until now very controversial, was the object of recent experiments: the use of chronic preparations in lambs and rabbits has shown that respiratory movements occur in utero in the normal fetus about half the time. These respiratory movements, irregular with respect to frequency as well as amplitude, are present during periods of paradoxical sleep. They are not accompanied by the inhalation of amniotic fluid. The factors responsible for the onset and the cessation of these respiratory movements of the fetus remain unknown. Identical respiratory movements have been recently detected in the normal human fetus. Several factors that could play a role in the initiation or the definite resumption of respiration at birth have been studied. None of them up to this time is known to be the determinant and unique factor in this phenomenon. Asphyxia may, under certain conditions, be an adequate stimulus to initiate respiratory movements but its role in the normal newborn is still unproven. The activity of the carotid chemoreceptors, weak in utero, increases immediately after the cord is clamped. However the presence of the peripheral chemoreceptors is not necessary for the initiation of respiration at birth. The role of the central chemoreceptors in the regulation of respiration of the fetus and of itself is necessary for the initiation of respiration in the normal newborn. Temperature might play an important role in the initiation of breathing at birth since a cold stimulus induces respiratory movements in the apneic infant whereas a marked elevation of the ambient temperature provokes apnea in the newborn. Meanwhile it is still unclear to what degree this factor considered by itself is necessary for the initiation of respiration in the normal newborn. Under certain conditions the newborn responds to the immersion of the glottis by a reflex apnea. In the fetus this phenomenon does not play a role in the intermittence of the periods of respiratory movements. Similarly the importance of emergence from the amniotic fluid for the initiation of respiration at birth has not been established.

AB  - 1. The fluid sacs and bladders of sixteen foetuses in fourteen ewes were catheterized between 81 and 92 days gestational age and the rumens of four ewes were also catheterized. 2. Between 95 and 145 days gestational age in forty‐six 24 hr experiments hourly samples of maternal plasma and foetal urine were obtained and in fifteen experiments foetal fluid samples were also taken at 4‐ to 6‐hr intervals. 3. The osmolality, pH, and concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, fructose and urea were measured on all samples. 4. During experiment there was no significant variation in the composition of amniotic or allantoic fluid. Marked changes in osmolality occurred in maternal plasma and foetal urine when ewes drank after feeding, but not in ewes that received water intrarumenally via catheter while feeding or in fasting ewes. Post‐prandial changes in maternal plasma osmolality may have altered transplacental water fluxes and as a result foetal plasma volume and osmolality. 5. The results suggest that the foetus alters renal water retention by varying antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion in response to changes in blood volume and at later gestational ages plasma osmolality as well. 6. Post‐prandial changes in the [Na+]/[K+] ratio of foetal urine suggested that foetal adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) secretion is influenced by variations in foetal blood volume and glucose concentrations. 7. The post‐prandial changes in foetal urine composition observed here support previous suggestions (Mellor &amp; Slater, 1972) about the role of foetal urine in foetal fluid formation which were based on gestational changes in the composition of foetal fluids and urine sampled once daily during the post‐absorptive state. © 1973 The Physiological Society

AB  - Factors modifying the head twitch response to 5-hydroxy d,l-tryptophan (5-HTP) have been investigated in the mouse. Stage of oestrous cycle and time of day had no effect. Local anaesthesia of the pinna region virtually abolished the response. Painting the pinnae with xylene increased the response and also increased the spontaneous head twitch rate. A concurrent variable frequency sound reduced the head twitch rate as did isolation. These results suggest that sensory input from the pinna is a necessary precondition for the head-twitch response to 5-HTP and demonstrate that the rate of twitching is modified by environmental conditions. The suggestion is made that 5-HTP might allow the perception of previously subliminal stimuli from the pinna region. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Plasma levels of human placental lactogen (HPL) in normal pregnancy from the 22nd week until delivery were measured with a rapid radioimmunoassay. The HPL concentration in plasma rose steadily up to the 37th week and thereafter gradually decreased until delivery. Individual women followed during the latter part of pregnancy showed a characteristic pattern with very small deviations from their original relative level within the normal range. Significant fluctuations in HPL levels were noted during a 24-hour period of sampling and during shorter periods. No systematic circadian variation was observed. The variations showed no clear relation to sleep, meals or light exercise. During spontaneous and induced labour significant fluctuations in HPL concentrations occurred but these were of the same magnitude as those during the latter part of normal pregnancy; no correlation between HPL levels and uterine contraction and relaxation was found. Strenuous physical exercise during the last month of pregnancy sufficient to affect the fetal heart rate did not influence the HPL levels. © 1973.

AB  - HEROIN addiction and now also methadone addiction among pregnant women have been increasing steadily over the years. The full scope of the problem is unknown because of the illicit nature of the drug traffic. However, with the increasing incidence of drug addiction in general, and since 85 per cent of the women involved are in the childbearing age (15 to 40 years), one would thus also expect an increase in the number of births of infants of drug-addicted mothers. It has been estimated that there are between 400,000 and 600,000 heroin addicts in the United States. The latter figure is. © 1973, Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - In rats 19-20 days pregnant, liver weight is increased by 40 per cent, cytochrome P-450 concentration is decreased by 25 per cent and the specific activities of 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronyl transferase and biphenyl-4-hydroxylase are reduced by 25 and 30 per cent, respectively; biphenyl-2-hydroxylase and p-nitrobenzoic acid reductase are not changed. In rats, 15-16 days pregnant, liver weight is increased by 33 per cent but the concentration of cytochrome P-450 and the specific activities of the drug microsomal enzymes are unchanged. Expressed as total amounts per whole liver, there is an increase in microsomal protein and nitro-reductase in both 15-16 and 19-20 day pregnant animals but no changes occur in cytochrome P-450, glucuronyl transferase or biphenyl hydroxylases. Hexobarbital administered to rats at doses related to pregnant body weight increases the sleeping-time from 50 min in non-pregnant animals to 110 min at full-term, but when administered on the basis of the non-pregnant body weight the duration of anaesthesia remains unchanged. Pretreatment of pregnant (19-20 days) and non-pregnant rats with phenobarbital leads to similar increases in microsomal protein (25 per cent) and nitroreductase activity (40 per cent); cytochrome P-450 is increased in non-pregnant animals (30 per cent) but not in the pregnant, although biphenyl-4-hydroxylase is increased in both to such extents as to annul the inhibitory effect of pregnancy. Pretreatment with methylcholanthrene gives rise to similar increases in cytochrome P-450 (30 per cent) and biphenyl-2-hydroxylase (10-fold increase) in both pregnant and non-pregnant rats and again increases biphenyl-4-hydroxylase so as to annul the effect of pregnancy. With rabbits, no change occurs in liver weight, microsomal protein, nitro-reductase, cytochrome P-450, or biphenyl-4-hydroxylase at full-term pregnancy, but glucuronyl transferase is reduced by 20 per cent, and coumarin-7-hydroxylase by 60 per cent. Pretreatment of rabbits with phenobarbital increases microsomal protein (15, 25 per cent), nitro-reductase (70, 80 per cent), cytochrome P-450 (130, 90 per cent), biphenyl-4- hydroxylase (50, 60 per cent), coumarin-7-hydroxylase (40, 150 per cent), and glucuronyl transferase (65, 15 per cent) in both non-pregnant and pregnant animals, respectively. The decrease during pregnancy of hepatic glucuronyl transferase is attributed to competitive inhibition by high levels of endogenous estrogenic and progestational steroids, but the decrease in the activities of the microsomal hydroxylating enzymes is attributed to the decrease in P-450, which may result from high levels of growth factors. © 1973.

AB  - A possible relevant animal model for the hormone-triggered emotional disturbances of premenstruum, post-partum, and the menopause was investigated. The common characteristic situation of progesterone decline was simulated in ovariectomised rats, studied 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after the last of a week-long 12-hourly series of progesterone injections. In vitro uptake of 3H-dopmine and 3H-serotonin in slices from cortex, preoptic-hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain and striatum was measured. Serotonin uptake was reduced in progesterone treated slices from the preoptic-hypothalamus 24 h, from the thalamus 36 h after the last injection, whereas no change in dopamine uptake in any region was noted. Dopamine uptake was found to increase with time after the last injection (a possible effect of the particular stress situation of chronic injection), and was also significantly higher at 8 h than at 20 h in cortex, midbrain, and striatum. Serotonin uptake did not vary with the time of day. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In normal pregnancy the concentration of non-protein-bound (N.P.B.) cortisol in maternal plasma is higher, especially at night, than in normal non-pregnant women. However, in pregnancy complicated by pre-eclamptic toxæmia (P.E.T.), or ante-partum hæmorrhage, the increase in N.P.B. cortisol is smaller, and day-night variation is greater than in normal pregnancy. These changes in N.P.B. cortisol may be dependent on œstrogen levels, but they correlate poorly with œstriol excretion. The results provide further evidence that the adrenal is not involved in the development of P.E.T. © 1973.

AB  - Twenty-one normally pregnant patients had their urinary output fractionated into 4 hour aliquots for a total of 6 days. Each urinary specimen was analyzed for estriol. By using duplicate assays the statistical error was reduced to between 3 and 5 per cent. From these data it is not possible to predict the 24 hour urinary estriol excretion from a single 4 hour period specimen. Even the use of two 4 hour specimens in combination will not successfully predict the 24 hour excretion rate. While diurnal variation clearly exists, it is extremely complex and not simply predictable for a given patient. In these normally pregnant patients, bed rest had no significant influence on urinary estriol excretion rates. © 1973.

AB  - The urinary excretion of unconjugated cortisol and plasma levels of cortisol and non-protein-bound cortisol as well as the circadian rhythm of cortisol in blood were investigated in normal and pregnant women and in females on oral contraceptives. A definite increase in both urinary excretion of cortisol and in plasma levels of non-protein-bound hormone was found in pregnant and in estrogen-gestagen treated women. Furthermore, the normal day-night variation of plasma cortisol was lower in pregnant women, but not in women treated with estrogen-gestagen. © 1973 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Sex difference in the circadian periodicity of the hypothalamic content of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was examined in the rat. The CRF content in the female hypothalamus was higher in the morning than in the afternoon. In contrast, in the male rat under similar experimental conditions, the CRF content was higher in the afternoon than in the morning. In the female rat, a peak value of CRF content was found at 8 a.m. and a precipitous fall ensued around noon, with a concomitant sharp rise of plasma corticosterone levels. Ovariectomy reduced the morning levels without raising the afternoon levels, the peak value occurring at noon. Cervical ganglionectomy did not essentially affect the basic pattern of the circadian rhythm of CRF content in the female rat. These results indicate that there is a marked sex difference in the manifestation of circadian rhythm of hypothalamic CRF content, that is, the pattern of circadian rhythm in the female rat is the reverse of that found in the male rat. The rapid fall of hypothalamic CRF content around noon in the female rat always accompanies a sharp rise of the plasma corticosterone; thus, the whole pattern of changes of CRF content during a 24 h period is a mirror image of that of plasma corticosterone. © 1973 S.

AB  - Pregnant rats were exposed to concentrations of nitrous oxide similar to those present in the operating room during routine occupational exposure for various periods during pregnancy. Those exposed to 15,000 ppm and 1,000 ppm for 24 hr/day had fetal death rates and pregnancies/rat ratios which were significantly different from the controls. 2 groups exposed to 1,000 ppm for 8 hr/day also had fetal death rates significantly different from the controls. Exposure for 8 hr/day did not significantly alter the pregnancies/rat ratios. Differences in the fetal death rates between groups exposed from 6 AM to 2 PM and from 2 PM to 10 PM suggest a diurnal variation in the embryotoxic effect of nitrous oxide in the rat.

AB  - Pregnant CFN Wistar rats demonstrated marked fluctuations of body weight within 24‐h periods during late gestation. Maternal weight loss during the daytime phase of the daily cycle was accompanied by a slowdown in fetal growth. The period of rapid maternal weight gain that occurred during the night was paralleled by a period of rapid fetal growth. The periodicity of fetal growth was due to variation in accumulation of solids and not to diurnal fluctuations in relative water content. Copyright © 1973 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - A diurnal rhythm exists in peripheral plasma progesterone concentrations during the 4-day estrous cycle of rats. Peak values in this rhythm were obtained during the early morning hours (0100-0500), whereas in the afternoon plasma concentrations of the steroid were at a nadir. Ovarian progesterone secretion rates within this same period remained unaltered, suggesting that the adrenal glands were responsible for these fluctuations. © 1973, SAGE Publications.

AB  - In 16 healthy women a serial study was made during pregnancy and 3 mth after delivery of the day/night patterns of urine flow and the excretion of total solute, sodium, potassium, and urea. Whereas a single pattern of nyctohemeral renal excretory activity was observed in the nonpregnant state, 3 basic patterns were identified during pregnancy. Increases in the night excretion of sodium and/or nonosmotically obligated water were mainly responsible for the altered patterns in pregnancy. The occurrence during the first trimester of maximal mean values for noctural urine flow and sodium excretion suggests that hormonal influences are likely to be of greater significance in initiating the altered nyctohemeral excretory patterns of pregnancy than posturally determined venous and ureteric compression by the gravid uterus.

AB  - Cortisol, gonadotropins PSH-LH and testosterone were estimated in 13 normal men: in 10 subjects blood samples were collected at 8 a.m., 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. and in the others every 2h. The results obtained show significant diurnal variations of cortisol and testosterone with the highest values at 8 a.m. and the lowest at 10 p.m. On the contrary, the daily variations in the concentration of plasma FSH and LH were less constant: the two hormones when recorded on plasma samples collected every 2 h, did not show a gradual decrease during the day, but oscillations reproducing a jagged line. However the mean values of the evening seem to be lower than those of the morning. These data confirm the existence of a gonadal diurnal cycle for testosterone, which is probably controlled by the hypophysis, although a close correlation between the cyclicity of gonadotropins and testosterone secretion is not clearly demonstrated. © 1973.

AB  - The correlation between the daily changes of the hypothalamic CRF content and the stages of the estrous cycle was examined in the rat. During proestrus and estrus, the CRF content was significantly higher in the morning (9 a.m.) than in the afternoon (4 p.m.). During diestrus, however, no essential difference was observed. In the morning, the hypothalamic CRF content tended to be higher during proestrus than during diestrus II, but in the afternoon the content was lower during proestrus and estrus, even though the difference did not attain significance. These results, indicating a correlation of daily CRF rhythm with stages of the estrous cycle, are essentially consistent with our previous finding of a sex difference of circadian rhythm of CRF activity in the rat. © 1973 S.

AB  - Summary: Progesterone was measured in 232 normal pregnancy sera by a competitive protein binding assay. The mean serum progesterone concentration increased gradually from 15.1 ng./ml. at 6 weeks of gestation to 22.5 ng./ml. at 8 weeks, dipped slightly to 18.8 ng./ml. at the ninth week and then rose steeply during the second and third trimesters to reach 180.5 ng./ml. at term. There was a 5.5‐fold difference between the lowest and highest concentrations of serum progesterone for any period of gestation. In 5 patients investigated for diurnal changes there were small, random fluctuations in the serum concentration. The mean umbilical venous serum progesterone concentration in 10 babies was 4.5 times higher than the corresponding maternal venous concentration. Copyright © 1973, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The glycogen content in the pineal of the adult female mouse was examined by a semiquantitative histochemical method at different times of the day. As was observed in males in our previous study (Kachi et al., 1971b), it varied diurnally in females in correlation with the daily light and dark periods. In this study, the diurnal variation was considered particularly in relation to the estrous cycle. The pattern of the rhythm appeared to be slightly modified by the estrous cycle, but the difference was not statistically significant between the phases of the estrous cycle. © 1973, International Society of Histology and Cytology.

AB  - Experiments on the effects of oestrus and oestrogens on food intake in the rat showed that food intake is higher after ovariectomy than during the dioestrous phases of the natural cycle, and that it is suppressed by doses of oestradiol too low to produce cornification of the vaginal smear. There may therefore be a tonic inhibition of food intake throughout the oestrous cycle. Another experiment showed that the period of maximal sexual receptivity during the cycle coincided with the period of greatest anorexia, and the loss of receptivity with a rebound hyperphagia. © 1973.

AB  - Human chorionic somatomammotrophin (HCS or HPL) is a polypeptide hormone sharing close structural, biological and immunological similarities with pituitary growth hormone. HCS is secreted in increasing amounts during pregnancy and intervenes in the development of glucose tolerance impairment in the course of gestation. The maternal circulating levels of HCS are submitted to wide diurnal fluctuations, sometimes of nearly 50%. After 10 to 12 hr of basal oscillations a discrete peak value of HCS secretion is attained. The time of appearance of the peak is not predictable and is independent from the meals. A weak but statistically significant association exists between the weight of placental tissue and the circulating levels of HCS. Different metabolic factors seem to regulate HCS secretion. Among them, the effect of maternal glucose level variations on circulating levels of HCS was investigated. An inverse relationship was shown to exist between blood glucose concentration and HCS levels. Hypoglycemia causes HCS levels to rise and conversely. These HCS fluctuations are superimposable on the pituitary growth hormone variations in response to glycemic stimuli.

AB  - The effect of various concentrations of 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose (2DG) and sodium fluoroacetate (SFA) on the Q O 2 of day‐11 and 12 rat embryos was studied in vitro. The dose‐response curves—% inhibition versus log concentration—were linear for 2DG between 500 μM and 50 mM; day‐11 rat embryos showed a higher rate of inhibition than day‐12 embryos and adult kidney tissue. The inhibitory effect of SFA on the embryonic Q O 2 in vitro was significantly lower than on adult kidney tissue slices. These in vitro effects are in agreement with recent investigations on the energy metabolism of rat embryos that revealed a change from glycolysis to an oxidative, respiratory metabolism during organogenesis. The administration of a single dose of 2DG and SFA to pregnant rats at day 9 or 10 of pregnancy significantly reduced the Q O 2 and dry weight of the embryos at day 11, whereas both parameters were unchanged at day 12. The same treatment was nonteratogenic, which is in contrast to the findings of other investigators. Copyright © 1973 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Diurnal variations in serum unconjugated estradiol-17β (SE2), serum total estriol (SE3), total urinary estrogens (UE), and UE/creatinine ratios (E/C) were determined on samples obtained at 4-hr intervals from 22 women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy. Analysis of variance indicated significant variations in SE2 (p &lt; 0.001), UE (p &lt; 0.01), and E/C (p &lt; 0.05). Multiple comparison of means showed maximum values at 12 PM to be significantly greater than minimum values at 12 AM (p &lt; 0.01). The SE3 rhythm was less marked with individual daytime (8 AM-12 PM-4 PM) means significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) than those at nighttime (8 PM-12 AM-4 AM). It is proposed that this rhythm reflects changes in availability of estrogen precursors known to be secreted rhythmically by the maternal adrenal. © 1973 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Daily and hourly running rates of spayed female rats implanted with estrone or injected with estradiol benzoate (EB) were examined to determine whether estrous periodicity in activity occurs in the absence of hormone fluctuations. No evidence of a 4-5 day estrous cycle was found in the estrone implanted or in the EB injected gonadectomized females. Periodicity did not appear when amplitude of running was reduced by injections of the antiestrogen, MER-25. The major difference in hourly rates of running found on the 4 days was that intact animals took fewer rests during the latter part of the night when in estrus. Estrone implanted animals' hourly running pattern did not vary over days. It was concluded that hormonal fluctuation rather than intrinsic neural rhythmicity was the major determinant of estrous running periodicity in the rat. © 1972.

AB  - Previous work with male Quelea showed that agonistic behaviour in relation to individual distance is controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH), rather than by testosterone, and that males are more aggressive than females. Experiments with female groups are reported which show that: (a) LH injections increase aggressive encounter frequency; (b) ovariectomy in the breeding season (but not outside it) also increases encounter frequency; and (c) oestrogen injections decrease encounter frequency. The effects of LH were shown to be specific to agonistic responses rather than mediated through changes in activity. Correlations between changes in natural hormone levels and encounter frequency support the injection findings. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LH controls aggressive encounters over individual distance in the female as in the male and that oestrogenic inhibition of this LH-mediated aggressiveness is a cause of female subordination and the lower encounter frequency found in female groups. The annual cycle of encounter frequency is described and the significance of different systems of hormonal control is discussed. © 1973.

AB  - The development of a rapid, highly sensitive double antibody-solid phase (DASP) radioimmunoassay for ovine/caprine prolactin is described. The assay was applied to the measurement of basal levels of prolactin in the blood of 4 anoestrous lactating female, 4 anoestrous virgin female and 4 castrated male goats. For several hours after milking there was a chronic gradually decreasing release of prolactin in the lactating goats, such that the circulating levels of prolactin were, for 14-16 h of the day, at a much higher level than those in the virgin female or castrated male goats. The basal levels of prolactin in the castrated male goats (87-200 ng/ml) were somewhat higher than those in the virgin females (47-77 ng/ml). The effects of feeding and stress on prolactin levels are discussed. © 1973, Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Serum and pituitary FSH, LH and prolactin contents during the normal rat estrous cycles were assayed every two hours in adult female rats of Holtzman strain (lights on 5 a.m. to 7 p.m.), using NIAMD rat FSH, LH and prolactin radioimmunoassay kits. The serum LH surge was observed from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the proestrous day. The serum FSH surge was observed from 7:00 p.m. on the proestrous day to 5:00 a.m. on the estrous day. The serum prolactin concentrations also began to rise at 1:00 p.m. on the proestrous day, and remained at high levels until 10:00 a.m. on the estrous day. The reduction in pituitary FSH, LH and prolactin content was simultaneously observed from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on the proestrous day. These results not only comfirmed the data reported by Daane & Parlow (1971), but also demonstrated no diurnal rhythm on the first and second diestrous day. Dissociation between FSH and LH patterns seems to suggest the possibility that FSH and LH secretion may be controlled independently by the two distinct “Releasing factors, FRF and LRF”. © 1973, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - Several variables were examined at nine time periods over a 24-hour period in rats following prolonged exposure 10 constant light (LL), compared with animals housed in an alternating light-dark (LD) environment. The data indicated: (1) LL animals had lower ovarian weights and increased uterine weights, which were not dependent on the time of day of autopsy; (2) pituitary LH content was lower in LL animals, and dependent on time of day only in LD rats; (3) there were no significant differences in serum LH concentrations between the LL and LD animals, nor among times of blood collection; (4) serum FSH concentrations varied significantly with time, but were not different between LL and LD animals. It is suggested that, in the absence of cyclic surges of LH, low tonic levels of serum LH can support estrogen secretion, resulting in higher uterine weight, and that fluctuating but low serum FSH levels may help maintain the follicular stimulation observed in LL animals. © 1973 S.

AB  - The pituitary-adrenal system plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of lactation in rats, with the suckling stimulus itself inducing the release of ACTH. The recent finding of a reduced plasma corticosterone response to a variety of noxious stimuli during lactation led us to further investigate the activity of this system in lactating (L) rats, compared with post-parturient non-lactating controls (NL). Plasma and adrenal corticosterone and plasma ACTH were measured, the latter with a mouse bioassay. Over a 24 h period (12 L:12 D), basal concentrations of plasma corticosterone were elevated in L females, only at those times when the NL basal concentrations were at the trough in the diurnal cycle. At all times, the plasma corticosterone increase 15 min after ether was significantly lower (by a mean of 55%) in L rats than in NL rats. The elevations in plasma corticosterone after ether were higher for all rats during the day. The night-day difference in response to ether was greater in Lrats than in NLrats. Although morning basal levels were not significantly elevated in L females deprived of their litters for 24 h, in these females, as in continually lactating rats, stress concentrations of plasma ACTH (2–4 min after ether) were one third that of the NL controls. Finally, after dexamethasone treatment, the corticosterone output to exogenous ACTH was lower in the plasma and higher in the adrenal in L rats. Thus, pituitary-adrenal activity is altered in a variety of ways during lactation. © 1973 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - A single injection of 10μg/rat of estradiol benzoate (EB) at 10.00 hr on the day of estrus (designated as Day 1) in 4-day cyclic rats caused a marked increase in ovarian secretion of progesterone and a concomitant decrease in 20α-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one secretion for over a week. Hypophysectomy on Day 3 completely diminished the secretion of progesterone on Day 5. The treatment with EB induced the surgy releases of prolactin and LH on the evening of Day 2 or 3, but no further release was seen thereafter. In pseudopregnant rats, a marked release of prolactin occurred between midnight and early morning, but any nocturnal release of neither prolactin, LH, nor FSH was seen in the EB treated rats so far examined on Day 4 to 5. Single injections with prolactin, LH and/or FSH on the evening of the first day of diestrus in cycling rats failed to sustain the luteal function. Pretreatment with progesterone, given an hour prior to the EB treatment, completely blocked the release of gonadotropins expected on Day 2 without reducing the elevated secretion of progesterone in the EB treated rats. These results suggest that the gonadotropins released on Day 2 can not be mediators for the luteotropic action of estrogen. Since hypophysectomy after EB treatment reduced ovarian secretion of progesterone to the basal level, it is presumed that estrogen maintains luteal function by acting on the luteal tissue in the presence of hypophyseal factors. © 1973, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - Luteal cell structure and function were studied by electron microscopy in conjunction with measurement of progesterone production by corpora lutea which were isolated and incubated in vitro on successive days of the four‐day hamster estrous cycle. Granulosal cells were primarily responsible for the formation of the corpus luteum. Agranular endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets developed during luteinization of granulosal cells on the first post‐ovulation day (day 1). Luteal cell hypertrophy on day 2 resulted from dilation of tubular agranular endoplasmic reticulum and swelling of mitochondria with tubular cristae. Plasma progesterone levels on the first two days of the cycle appeared to be correlated with luteal activity as corpora lutea were demonstrated to synthesize progesterone during this interval. Luteolysis occurred on day 3 with a reduction in luteal cell size accompanied by condensation of the agranular endoplasmic reticulum, regressive changes in the mitochondria, and a marked drop in luteal progesterone synthetic activity. On day 4, extensive phagocytic activity and luteal cell autolysis indicated an advanced involutional state. The short but functional luteal phase in the cyclic hamster does not appear to involve the production of 20α‐hydroxy‐pregn‐4‐en‐3‐one as occurs in the rat. This progestin was not detectable in plasma or luteal tissue before or after incubation at any time during the cycle. Possible mechanisms regulating luteal cell development and regression during the estrous cycle are discussed. Copyright © 1973 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Peripheral levels of plasma estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), as measured by RIA, showed little correspondence in the cycling hamster. A diurnal pattern of E1 was apparent during the cycle with peak levels reached at 2200. Estradiol levels were low on the first 2 days of the cycle, correlated with the absence of antral follicles, but were higher at 2200 of day 2. A peak was reached at 1400 of day 3 (approximately 90 pg/ml) and the levels remained elevated for at least 8 hr. E2 was depressed at 0900 of day 4, but this was followed by an almost linear increase between 0900 and 1500 when the highest value for the estrous cycle was attained (186.6 pg/ml). A sharp decrease, down to baseline values, followed. The day 4 peak in E2 was temporally related to the preovulatory surge in LH and an abrupt increase in ovarian progesterone. Phenobarbital (Phen) injected to day 4 cycling animals prevented the E2 peak at 1500, whereas the addition of 5 μg of LH restored E2 to normal values. However, E1 was not affected by either Phen or LH. Injection of Phen to day 3 animals at 1300 lowered E1 and E2 levels, but this treatment does not affect the time of ovulation. LH administration on day 3 elevated E1 and E2 to levels comparable to day 4 cycling animals. Unilaterally ovariectomized animals displayed depressed E1 levels as compared to controls only on day 3 of the first cycle while E2 was significantly elevated on day 1 and lowered on day 3. By the second cycle E1 and E2 did not differ from intact control animals. Chronic hypophysectomy (for 8 days) yielded E1 values comparable to ovariectomized hamsters, but E2 values were significantly higher. LH administration did not increase either E1 or E2, indicating that antral follicles are necessary for optimal estrogen secretion. Plasma estrogen levels in the hamster were much higher than values previously reported for the rat, guinea pig and rabbit, and within the range found in man and rhesus. This seems to represent a true species difference since assays on rat and rabbit plasma, using the same RIA technique used with the hamster, yielded E1 and E2 values similar to those reported in the literature. © 1973 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The ontogenesis of the states of sleep in guinea pig fœtus was studied polygraphically. Long lasting recordings were made in utero between the 40th and the 64th day of gestation. The prenatal evolution of the states of sleep in guinea pig is similar to postnatal evolution of other animals born immature (rat, cat). Paradoxical sleep, observed from the 40th day, appears before slow wave sleep ; according to our experiments, this slow wave sleep is to be observed towards the 52nd or 53rd day of gestation. Before that time, a very large percentage of paradoxical sleep was noticed (73 p. 100-97 p. 100 according the age). Two transitory states of sleep are to be observed : a « discontinuous ECoG activitystate before the 48th day of gestation and a « spindlesstate between the 49th and 52nd day. These states, which are difficult to define with the classic criteria such as ECoG, EOG and EMG, raise the problem of the choice of criteria to classify the states of sleep. © 1973 Masson et Cie, Paris.

AB  - SUMMARY The cyclic patterns of sleep and wakefulness (behavioural ‘states’) were studied polygraphically in a group of 21 normal newborn infants on the first and the fifth days of life. The percentage of time spent awake underwent drastic reduction between the first and the fifth days. The percentage of time spent in state 2 (active sleep) increased correspondingly. The percentage of time spent in state 1 (quiet sleep) remained relatively unchanged; it exceeded state 2 on the first day and was exceeded by state 2 on the fifth day. On the fifth day, there was a tendency for the number of state transitions per hour to be less than on the first day, and for the durations of periods in state 2 to increase. On the first day, infants quite often appeared to wake directly from state 1, but this seldom happened on the fifth day, when waking usually occurred from state 2. Late‐clamped infants spent a higher percentage of time in state 1 and less in the quiet awake states than did the early‐clamped infants. Individual differences between the lateclamped infants were much greater. Respiratory rate (which is positively related to blood volume in the neonate) was significantly lower in the early‐clamped compared with the late‐clamped group, in whom the results showed considerable scatter. It is possible that late clamping of the cord represents an additional stress to the neonate and that early clamping confers an advantage on the infant who spends more time awake on the first day, thereby promoting a sound mother and baby relationship. RÉSUMÉ Un groupe de 21 nouveaux‐nés normaux ont étéétudiés au ler et 5ème jour de la naissance à l'aide de techniques polygraphiques pour mesurer le pourcentage de temps passé dans les différents états de vigilance ainsi que la durée des périodes de chacun de ces états. Le pourcentage de temps passééveillé subit une réduction considérable entre le ler et le 5ème jour. Le pourcentage de temps en stade 2 (sommeil actif) s'accroit d'autant. Le temps passé en stade 1 (sommeil tranquille) demeure inchangé, de telle façon qu'il dépasse le temps du stade 2 le premier jour et est inférieur le 5ème. Il y a une tendance au 5ème jour à ce que le nombre de changements d'états par heure soit moindre et que les périodes individuelles de stade 2 s'allongent. Au ler jour, très souvent, les enfants se réveillent directement à partir du stade 1, mais au 5ème jour, le réveil surveint généralement à partir du stade 2. Les nourrissons à‘clampage tardif’ passent un pourcentage plus élevé de temps au stade 1 et moindre à l'état tranquille éveillé que les enfants à‘clampage précoce’. Les enfants à clampage tardif présentent des variations individuelles beaucoup plus importantes. Le rythme respiratoire qui est relié plus au volume sanguin chez le nouveau‐né est significativement plus lent chez les nourrissons à clampage précoceé qu'à clampage tardif, parmi ceux‐ci, les résultats présentent une dispersion très marquée. Il est possible que le clampage tardif du cordon représente une agression supplémentaire chez le nouveau‐né et que la clampage précoce confère un avantage en permettant au nourrisson de passer plus de temps éveillé le ler jour, ce qui favorise une bonne relation mère‐enfant. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wurde eine Gruppe von 21 normaler Neugeborener am 1. und 5. Lebenstag mit polygraphischen Methoden untersucht, um den Prozentsatz der Zeit, die in jedem der verschiedenen Verhaltenszustände verbracht wurde, und die Dauer der einzelnen in ihnen verbrachten Perioden zu messen. Der Zeitanteil des Wachseins erfuhr zwischen dem 1. und 5. Tage eine drastische Verminderung. Der Prozentsatz der Zeit, die im Stadium 2 (aktiven Schlaf) verbracht wurde, stieg entsprechend an. Die Gesamtdauer des Stadium 1 (ruhigen Schlafes) blieb relativ unverändert, so daß er am ersten Tage über den Anteil des Stadium 2 hinausging und am fünften Tage hinter ihm zurückblieb. Es zeigte sich die Tendenz, daß die Zahl der Stadienwechsel pro Stunde am 5. Tage geringer war und die Dauer der einzelnen Perioden im Stadium 2 anstieg. Am 1. Lebenstag erwachten die Kindern offenbar ganz häufig direkt aus dem Stadium 1, während sie am 5. Tage gewöhnlich aus Stadium 2 erwachten. Die spätabgenabelten Kinder verbrachten einen größeren Prozentsatz ihrer Zeit im Stadium 1 und weniger im ruhigen Wachzustand als die früabgenabelten Kinder. Die spätabgenabelten Kinder zeigten viel größere individuelle Unterschiede. Die Atemfrequenz, die dem Blutvolumen beim Neugeborenen proportional ist, war bei den frühabgenabelten Kindern signifikant niedriger als bei den spätabgenabelten, bei denen die Ergebnisse wiederum eine beträchtliche Schwankungsbreite zeigten. Es ist möglich. daß das Spätabnabeln einen zusätzlichen Stress für das Neugeborene bedeutet und daß das Frühabnabeln von Vorteil ist, da es das Kind am 1. Tage mehr Zeit im Wachzustand verbringen läßt, was eine intakte Mutter‐Baby‐Beziehung begünstigt. Copyright © 1973, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The ontogenesis of the states of sleep in guinea pig foetus was studied by polygraphic method. Long-lasting records have been made in utero between the 40th and the 64th day of gestation. The ECoG activation pattern of paradoxical sleep (PS) and wakefulness appear from the 40th day (0,6 of term); the slow-wave sleep (SWS) appear about the 49th day (0,7 of term) and is characterized by cortical spindles. Between the 40th and the 47th day, cerebral maturation is accompanied by a progressive decrease of a discontinuous ECoG activity state. From 53 days (0,8 of term), the ECoG patterns of states of vigilance are similar to those of the newborn guinea pig. The percentage of time spent in PS is very high (80-90% at 48 days) before the SWS appearance. These observations prove the existence of a prenatal differentiation of the states of vigilance. The differentiation stages are similar to those observed after birth in immature newborn mammals. No relationship exists between the sleep of mother and foetus. © 1973.

AB  - In 48 newborns born at 24-42 weeks gestational age computer-averaged visual (VERs) and somatosensory (SERs) evoked responses were studied. The following results were obtained: 1. 1. In pre-term newborn infants below 30 weeks gestation the main or only component was a very slow negative wave, most distinct in the corresponding projection area. In the two modalities studied the response patterns were similar but not identical. 2. 2. During further development the slow negative wave gradually decreased and faster components appeared. VER and SER became more and more dissimilar. 3. 3. Constant primary components appeared after 29 weeks gestation in SER and between 32 and 35 weeks in VER. 4. 4. Non-specific SERs at the vertex and in ipsilateral leads increased during development. 5. 5. The latencies of both responses decreased. age was linear after 30 weeks gestation. age was linear after 30 weeks gestation. 6. 6. The amplitude generally decreased during development. Evoked responses are a suitable tool for developmental studies in man because of the close dependence of their variables on cerebral maturation. © 1973.

AB  - Pregnant and postpartum women were presented with auditory stimuli, of from 10 to 70 decibels, of baby's cries, a woman's voice saying 'baby is crying' and a speech noise during stage 2, stage REM and slowwave stages of sleep. The subjects were awakened with increasing difficulty in the above given order of stages, and with increasing facility going from speech noise to human voice to baby's cry, in that order. There was an overall lowering of awakening threshold after delivery. All the differences found were statistically significant, except that the difference between the voice saying 'baby is crying' and the tape recorded baby's cry was not significant. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Plasma levels of human placental lactogen (HPL) in normal pregnancy from the 22nd week until delivery were measured with a rapid radioimmunoassay. The HPL concentration in plasma rose steadily up to the 37th week and thereafter gradually decreased until delivery. Individual women followed during the latter part of pregnancy showed a characteristic pattern with very small deviations from their original relative level within the normal range. Significant fluctuations in HPL levels were noted during a 24‐hour period of sampling and during shorter periods. No systematic circadian variation was observed. The variations showed no clear relation to sleep, meals or light exercise. During spontaneous and induced labour significant fluctuations in HPL concentrations occurred but these were of the same magnitude as those during the latter part of normal pregnancy; no correlation between HPL levels and uterine contraction and relaxation was found. Strenuous physical exercise during the last month of pregnancy sufficient to affect the fetal heart rate did not influence the HPL levels. Copyright © 1973, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Early administration of the sedative and sympathicolytic hypotensive combination of small doses of barbituric acid and dihydroergotoxin is of decisive advantage in pre eclampsia. An attack of eclampsia can almost always be prevented in this way. The manifest attacks of eclampsia and status eclampticus are most reliably controlled with a rapidly acting, rapidly eliminated barbiturate, administered intravenously. Once the attack is under control, induced therapeutic sleep has a good chance of success. This treatment is described in detail and the pharmaceutical and obstetric aspects are discussed from the clinical and pharmacological points of view.

AB  - SUMMARY Polygraphic methods were used to evaluate the percentage distribution of sleep and awake states and the mean duration of individual periods spent in these states in infants with Down's syndrome, bilirubinaemia and in a heterogeneous group of ‘high‐risk’ infants. Not unexpectedly, alterations from previously established normal values were found, as were differences in pattern between the groups. Infants with Down's syndrome spend more time awake at the expense of time in state 2 (active sleep), but prolonged sleep cycles are occasionally possible. Bilirubinaemic infants showed a drastic reduction in the amount of time spent in the awake states. Individual periods spent in state 2 were significantly longer, producing also a prolonged sleep cycle duration. The high‐risk group spent abnormally short periods in state 2 and none of the infants studied produced a long sleep cycle. The amount of time spent in awake states varied widely. Anti‐epileptic drugs induced more and longer individual periods of state 1 (quiet sleep) at the expense of state 2. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind these alterations in the state cycle are discussed. RÉSUMÉ Cycles de niveaux de vigilance chez les nouveaux‐nés anormaux Grâce à des méthodes polygraphiques, trois groupes de nourrissons de conditions anormales ont étéétudiés pour évaluer le pourcentage de temps passé dans chacun des divers états de sommeil et d'éveil ainsi que la durée des périodes individuelles passées dans ces différents états. Comme on pouvait s'y attendre des différences ont été observées non seulement par rapport aux valeurs établies antérieurement mais aussi avec les trois groupes. Les mongoliens passent plus de temps éveillés aux dépens du temps passé en stade 2 (sommeil actif), mais des cycles prolongés de sommeil ont pu êtren otés occasionnellement. Les nourrissons hyperbilirubinémiques ont montré une réduction considérable du temps passé dans les états de veille. Les périodes individuelles en stade 2 étaient significativement allongées et de ce fait, les plus longs cycles de sommeil étaient également allongés. Le groupe hétérogène des nourrissons à `hauts risques' présentait des périodes anormalement courtes en stade 2 et en aucun cas, il n'a été enregistré de longs cycles de sommeil. La quantité de temps passé en état de veille variait considérablement. Les médications anti‐épileptiques provoquaient un accroissement en nombre et en durée des périodes de stade 1 (sommeil tranquille) aux dépens des périodes du stade 2. Les mécanismes physio‐pathologiques sous jacents à ces altérations des cycles de vigilance sont discutés. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenszustandszyklen bei abnormen Neugeborenen Drei Gruppen von Kindern mit abnormen Bedingungen wurden mit polygraphischen Methoden untersucht, um den Prozentsatz der Zeit, die sie in jedem der verschiedenen Schlaf‐ und Wachzu‐stände verbringen, und die Dauer der einzelnen Perioden dieser Zustände zu berechnen. Erwartungsgemäß fanden sich Unterschiede nicht allein von früher festgestellten Werten, sondern auch zwischen den drei Gruppen. Die Kinder mit Down‐Syndrom verbrachten mehr Zeit im Wachzustand auf Kosten der Zeit des Stadium 2 (aktiven Schlafes), doch wurden gelegentlich auch verlängerte Schlafzyklen gefunden. Die Kinder mit Bilirubinaemie zeigten eine beträchtliche Verminderung der Zeitdauer, die im Wachzustand verbracht wurde. Einzelne Perioden im Schlafstadium 2 waren signifikant verlängert und als Ergebnis dessen war der längste Schlafzyklus auch verlängert. Die heterogene Gruppe der ‘high risk’ Kinder zeigte abnorm kurze Perioden im Schlafstadium 2, und in keinem Fall wurde ein längerer Schlafzyklus festgestellt. Die Zeitdauer des Wachzustandes variierte beträchtlich. Antiepileptische Medikamente verursachten größere Mengen und längere Einzelperioden des Stadium 1 (vuhigen Schlafes) auf Kosten des Stadium 2. Die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen dieser Veränderungen im Zustandszyklus werden diskutiert. Copyright © 1973, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The recent development of bioassay and radioimmunoassay techniques has confirmed the existence of a human prolactin and has opened a new field of physiologic studies. Some of the recently identified physiological and pharmacological factors affecting prolactin secretion in man are briefly discussed. The stimulatory effect of neuroleptic drugs, agents which deplete or antagonize cerebral catecholamines, is shown in various situations. Also shown are the suppressive actions of L-DOPA. Possible loci of dopamine- mediated prolactin inhibition are discussed. © 1973, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - No causal connection exists between the development of the medullary sheath and that of psychomotor behavior. Cytological maturity of the ganglion cells, particularly the development of their processes, counts as an important criterion of brain development and a vital prerequisite for function, since these cells provide the site of synaptic interlinkage between the nerve cells and therefore the necessary anatomical substrate for the spread of stimulation. The further parallel morphological biochemical differentiation of the cerebral cortex and its share in functioning are also reported. At fullterm birth, dendritic branches with synapses demonstrable under the electron microscope are already found in the neocortex; this provides the morphological basis for cerebral cortex function. A demonstration of cortical neurone activity in the neonate is provided by means of neurophysiological methods, a cliniconeurological analysis and experimental psychological research data. The old notions of a 'pause from cortical activity', or of the neonate as a 'decerebrate reflex being' are no longer suitable and will have to be revised.

Sixty-eight reported some change in their sleep, in some cases throughout the pregnancy, but in most cases the change had occurred only in the third trimester. The changes were sufficient for 12 patients to take sleeping tablets at some stage. The reasons given for altered sleep may be considered as falling into the following groups: physiologic, psychological, background (hormonal?) factors, medical symptoms, and environmental factors. © 1972.

AB  - A biphasic pattern of development of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is found in foetal and neonatal rats synchronized as to conception. The first burst of activity is at 22 days and 12 h. The second burst activty occurs between 2 and 3 weeks of age. Progesterone decreases the maximal level of enzyme activity achieved during the initial burst. However, the fundamental biphasic pattern seems to be independent of birth, progesterone or maternal milk. Hypophysectomy, thyroidectomy and adrenalectomy do not result in a significant change of enzymatic activity in the 26-day-old rat. The activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase is maintained at a constant steady state during a 24-h cycle in the 6-week-old rat. © 1972.

AB  - Immunoreactive human serum prolactin of pituitary origin has been measured by a radioimmunoassay developed for ovine prolactin. Blood samples were collected at four-hour intervals during a 24-hour period from 12 non-pregnant women, three pregnant women, and seven adult men. A circadian periodicity was found in serum prolactin concentration, with peak values during the night, between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. for the nonpregnant women, and at 5 a.m. for the adult men. Mean serum levels of prolactin were 1•5 times higher in nonpregnant women than in men. In women investigated during the last month of their pregnancy the mean serum prolactin levels were 2•3 times higher than in the non-pregnant women, but there was no circadian periodicity. © 1972, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

AB  - A 30-year-old woman was found to have Cushing's syndrome two months prior to becoming pregnant. During her pregnancy she demonstrated both clinical and biochemical amelioration of her Cushing's syndrome starting about the 21st week of gestation and continuing to the time of delivery. At 34 weeks she was delivered of a healthy, premature female infant who is now 4 years old and thriving. About 7 months postpartum the mother again demonstrated florid hypercortisolism. At surgery, bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia was found and a total adrenalectomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient's clinical state gradually returned to normal. She has remained well receiving conventional hormone replacement. Women with Cushing's syndrome have difficulty in conceiving and in maintaining pregnancy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of amelioration of Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy. © 1972, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - DEVELOPMENTAL formation of circadian rhythm of hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT: EC 2.6.1.5.) activity was investigated in rats between day 3 and day 33 after birth. A diurnal change of TAT activity with low day time levels and high night-time values was initially recognized in rats between day 11 and day 15, the "eye-opening" stage. This diurnal variation of TAT activity became less evident during the weaning period due to a marked elevation of TAT activity throughout an entire 24 hour cycle. After the completion of weaning (day 27), however, a distinct circadian rhythm with a high amplitude of TAT activity was established, exhibiting a peak at the onset of darkness. © 1972.

The intravenous ketamine anesthesia was the easiest to administer for the staff, but 41.5% of the patients stated they would not want ketamine anesthesia again. Recovery room time for the no-ketamine group was shorter than in the 2-ketamine groups. Patients receiving Ketamine were most frequently nauseated. 24.5% of the ketamine-only patients reported unpleasant sensations on going to sleep.

The results have been compared with those obtained in untreated patients and in a group taking preparations containing only progestogens (the mini pill). The marked changes produced by the combined preparations are not seen with the mini pill which does not appear to affect cortisol metabolism. Dynamic tests of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function (the assessment of the nyctohemeral rhythm of plasma corticosteroids and urinary free cortisol, ACTH stimulation, insulin-hypoglycaemia and dexamethasone suppression tests) showed no abnormality in patients taking either the combined pill or the mini pill. © 1972.

AB  - To investigate possible variations in plasma progesterone levels during the hyperthermic phase of the menstrual cycle and during early and late pregnancy, venous blood samples were taken at 4-hour intervals during periods of 24 hours. Progestrone determinations were done by gas-liquid chromatography. No significant circadian variation in peripheral plasma progesterone concentration was determined in the 10 women studied during the hyperthermic phase of their menstrual cycles or in 14 women studied during early pregnancy. However in the 15 women studied in late pregnancy a statistically significant rise was found from 8 a.m. until 4 or 8 p.m. (p less than .001), followed by a decrease until 4 to 8 a.m. Results indicate a daily change in peripheral plasma progesterone level during the last trimester of pregnancy. The cause of this diurnal variation is not known.

AB  - This paper presents the results obtained from the study of oestriol and pregnanediol in maternal peripheral venous plasma throughout normal pregnancy. Changes of oestriol, pregnanediol and II-hydroxysteroid levels throughout the day in late pregnancy were studied. The levels of these steroids found in maternal peripheral venous blood and umbilical venous blood in patients delivered normally and by elective Caesarean section have been compared. The range of values for plasma pregnanediol was so large that further study had little to recommend it. In a relative sense there was good agreement between plasma oestriol and urinary 24-hour oestriol excretion. There was no difference in fetal plasma levels of oestriol, pregnanediol or II-hydroxysteroids when babies delivered vaginally were compared with those delivered by elective Caesarean section. The difference in maternal II-hydroxysteroids in these two situations approached significance. © 1972.

AB  - The levels of HCS in plasma at different times during uncomplicated pregnancies were studied by a rapid radio-immunoassay. A steady rise was observed from the 22nd to the 37th week. After the 37th week, the HCS levels were fairly stable. The HCS levels were virtually unchanged in plasma samples stored at + 4°C or - 20°C for 1 to 7 days. © 1972 Informa Healthcare.

AB  - The spontaneous flight activity of Glossina morsitans was monitored in rocking-box actographs in constant conditions under different light régimes. The mean daily time spent in activity in the actographs (12·5 min) accords well with what is estimated for behaviour in the field. In all types of fly tested, a clear 'V'-shaped diurnal pattern of activity occurred in LD 12 : 12. The morning peak comprised more activity than the evening peak, but for hungry flies roughly the same proportion of the population was involved at each time. The similarity between this spontaneous activity pattern in the laboratory and the diurnal pattern typically observed in the field suggests that it is unnecessary to invoke environmental control to explain the gross form of the latter. In DD a clear circadian rhythm emerged in the activity of teneral flies, though in LL this rhythm damped out after 2 to 3 cycles. These findings are discussed in relation to current theories of circadian rhythms. A linear daily increase in activity occurred during 5 days of starvation in all flies, except pregnant females, whose daily increase followed an exponential pattern, implying that a complex behavioural change results from the act of fertilization. © 1972.

AB  - Adrenal corticosteroid concentrations were determined by a competitve protein-binding technique in blood samples taken at various times of the day via indwelling jugular cannulae from six cows in each of three groups, pregnant nonlactating, nonpregnant lactating, and pregnant lactating. The results showed a pattern of plasma corticosteroid concentration suggestive of a daily rhythm with higher concentrations between 2:30 and 6:30 AM and lower concentrations at 8:30 PM in the three groups. Pregnancy and lactation status had no significant effect on the daily pattern, but the daily corticosteroid mean was higher in the pregnant, lactating group (.64 ± .05 μg/l00 ml; mean ± SE) than in the pregnant, nonlactating group (.50 ± .03 /μg/100ml). © 1972, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - A circadian rhythm in food intake as measured every 2 hr over a period of 4 days was observed in adult male rats, and adult female rats on each day of the estrous cycle, as well as in prepubertal male and female rats. The pattern of food intake was similar in each group, with a peak of feeding activity at the onset of darkness and a second peak a few hours later. These peaks, relative to activity at other times of the day, were greatly reduced on the day of proestrus and in the prepubertal females. An increase in body weight was observed to occur daily in the prepubertal animals and in the adult males, while in the adult females there was a significant increase only on the day of estrus. The relationship of these phenomena to physiological estrogen levels and to previous observations in the literature are discussed. © 1972.

AB  - Blood was collected following decapitation of 280 Sprague-Dawley rats with 4- day estrous cycles, which were killed at 3 hr intervals from 3 AM of proestrus to midnight of day 4 of gestation (day after finding of sperm in the vaginal smear was considered day 1 of gestation). Groups of rats also were killed at 30 min intervals from 2–7 PM of proestrus. Plasma was stored frozen until analysed by radioimmunoassay for prolactin. The plasma concentrations of prolactin showed a distinct semicircadian rhythm during the first 4 days of gestation. Peaks of prolactin were observed late in the periods of light and dark with nadirs at noon and between 9 PM and midnight. The proestrus peak of prolactin was present, but extended 12 hr longer than the interval reported for unmated rats. A peak of prolactin also was observed on the afternoon of estrus. © 1972 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Prolactin and growth hormone in serum of 10 lactating cows was measured by radioimmunoassay at hourly intervals on 4 days. Prolactin in lactating cows was released in erratic pulses throughout the day. Serum prolactin concentration followed a 24-hr periodicity (p <. 01), with the highest value occurring at 4:00 p.m. (58 ng/ml) and lowest values being recorded between 4 and 10 a.m. (28 ng/ml). However, circadian changes accounted for only 8% of the total variation in prolactin values, differences within cows accounted for 45% and differences among cows accounted for 47%. Serum growth hormone concentration was more stable than prolactin and did not exhibit circadian periodicity. © 1972, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Determinations of plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) have been made in normal men and non-pregnant women, in normal pregnant women and women with pre-eclampsia, in maternal and cord blood during normal vaginal delivery and during delivery by Caesarean section. The findings in normal individuals, including the demonstration of diurnal variations, are in agreement with those of other workers, thus validating the methodology used. In pregnancy the plasma cortisol is raised and ACTH lowered so that, in comparison with nonpregnant individuals, the ACTH/cortisol ratio is greatly reduced. In pre-eclamptic pregnancies, on the other hand, the plasma cortisol tends to be lower and the ACTH much higher than in normal pregnancies, so that the ACTH/cortisol ratio is similar to that found in non-pregnant individuals. This rise in ACTH/cortisol ratio may occur in pregnant women before the development of oedema, proteinuria and hypertension. It appears that in pregnancy adrenocortical responsiveness to ACTH is enhanced while in pre-eclampsia the ability to secrete cortisol is relatively impaired, leading to increased ACTH secretion and this, by stimulating an increased output of aldosterone and possibly other salt-retaining steroids, may partly be responsible for the manifestations of pre-eclampsia. The concentration of cortisol in cord blood is lower than that in maternal blood at the time of delivery and both these concentrations are lower during delivery by Caesarean section than during normal vaginal delivery. On the other hand, although during delivery the ACTH levels in cord blood and maternal blood are greatly elevated, the difference between them is not significant, suggesting that the maternal adrenal cortex is more responsive to ACTH stimulation than the fetal adrenal cortex. © 1972.

AB  - The incorporation of radioactivity into protein (cpm/pg protein) in the anterior pituitary (AP) and discrete areas of the brain has been measured in both mice and rats following systemic injection of [35 S]methionine. Serum levels of luteinising hormone (LH) were also measured by means of a micro-radioimmunoassay using a sheep system. The incorporation of [35 S]methionine in the preoptic area (relative to that of the putamen) of groups of mice of different ages showed a gradual increase over the course of puberty, during which time vaginal opening occurred. Because the preoptic area controls the pre-ovulatory surge of LH, similar measurements were made on groups of rats every 6 hours over a 4-day oestrus cycle. On the morning of prooestrus, peaks of protein metabolism were observed in both the preoptic and amygdaloid areas which preceded, by 16 hours, similar peaks of activity in the median eminence and anterior pituitary, these latter being coincidental with the pre-ovulatory surge of LH.The presence of a circadian rhythm in both LH serum levels and protein specific activity was also observed as in adult males. Adult females, however, showed a sexual difference in that their diurnal fluctuations were 12 hours out of phase with those of the other groups with respect to protein synthesis, and 6 hours with respect to serum LH levels. © 1972, Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The patterns of prolactin secretion during the estrous cycle and pseudopregnancy were determined in rats bearing chronic aortic catheters from which blood samples were withdrawn at 2-hr intervals throughout both reproductive states. Prolactin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Except for the spontaneous proestrus surges observed at the beginning and end of the blood collection, plasma prolactin concentrations during the estrous cycle were low, never rising above 10 ng/ml. In pseudopregnant animals, prolactin concentrations were highly erratic but significantly elevated during the 24 hr period following cervical stimulation. Beginning on day 1 and at approximately 24-hr intervals thereafter through day 11, a surge of prolactin secretion occurred, beginning at 0100 hr, peaking at 0300–0500 hr and terminating by 0900–1100 hr. Maximal mean prolactin values during the surges ranged from 40–110 ng/ml. These daily nocturnal surges of pseudopregnancy alternate daily with a period from 1100 hr to 2300 hr in which the plasma prolactin concentrations resemble those observed during the estrous cycle. The failure of prolactin levels to be continuously elevated during pseudopregnancy suggests that information derived from cervical stimulation is stored in the brain and is “remembered” each night, resulting in a surge of prolactin secretion. © 1972 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Female rats on a free diet hoard food at relatively high rates. They differ from males in which hoarding depends on a hypothalamic mechanism active only during nutritional depletion. This anomalous hoarding by undeprived females was found to be strongly associated with the phase of the oestrus cycle. Like nestbuilding, but unlike reproductive and locomotor activities, it occurred maximally during dioestrus. Where a choice was available, undeprived females hoarded a much greater proportion of nesting material (dental swabs) than was hoarded by food-deprived male and female control groups, but food pellets continued to predominate. Thus modified or displaced nest-building activity appears to contribute to, but cannot fully account for the anomalous hoarding of food by undeprived females. © 1972.

AB  - Simple, accurate and reliable radioimmunoassays for estimating prostaglandins of the E(PGE), F(PGF) and AB(PGAB) groups in human plasma have been developed. With the assays we have found a plasma PGE concentration of 0.35-1.20 mμg/ml in normal males and 0.25-1.30 mμg/ml in normal females, a PGF concentration of 0.40-1.50 mμg/ml in normal males and 0.30-1.40 mμg/ml in normal females and a PGAB concentration of 0.04-0.77 mμg/ml in normal males and 0.12-0.81 mμg/ml in normal females. Significant circadian changes in PG levels with highest values in the early morning hours were observed in normal subjects. During the menstrual cycle in normal females PG levels were highest at midcycle and during the luteal phase. A rise in PG levels was observed during the last trimester of gestation, at the peak of the uterine contraction and during delivery. In patients with essential hypertension plasma PG levels usually were within normal limits. In normal males PGE concentration in seminal fluid ranged from 10.9-60.0 μg/ml, PGF from 9.2 to 34.5 μg/ml and PGAB from 41 to 171 μg/ml. Our assays have made it possible to understand the role of prostaglandins in some physiologic events. We hope they also would be useful to study the role of prostaglandins in human diseases. © 1972.

AB  - The influence of light on fur growth and reproduction in the mink has been investigated. Exposure of kits and adults to 4L/20D (4 light hours/20 dark hours) after completion of the summer furring cycle accelerated the development of the winter pelage. Gradually increasing the length of the daily photoperiod after growth of the winter pelage had been completed also hastened the onset of the breeding season. An abrupt change from 4L/20D to 16L/8D either inhibited gonadal development or initiated gonadal atrophy. It was also noted that mink changed from a 4L/20D schedule to a 16L/8D schedule immediately after completion of the winter furring cycle failed to begin development of the summer pelage for 10 to 12 weeks. This observation suggests that a refractory period exists in the initiation of growth of the summer pelage. However, a similar experiment conducted after completion of the summer pelage showed that the animals responded immediately to decreased light by molting into the winter pelage. It was also noted that changes leading to the development of the summer pelage occurred concomitant with or slightly after the initiation of testicular regression, while gonadal recrudescence occurred after completion of the winter furring cycle. The significance of these observations in relation to possible hypophyseal mechanisms for their control is discussed. Copyright © 1972 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Ovarian progesterone and/or progestins, which normally are released late on proestrus, could prolong LH release. Ovariectomy was performed on the morning of proestrus to determine whether the duration of release of the LH surge later that day would be shortened. The role of the adrenals in modulating gonadotrophin secretion at proestrus was also investigated. Rats were ovariectomized, adrenalectomized, laparotomized, or autopsied as controls at 10 AM proestrus; the experimental animals, plus other controls, were autopsied at 3,6,8, and 10 PM. Control and adrenalectomized rats were also autopsied at 8^10:30 AM estrus. Plasma LH in proestrous controls was not significantly higher than 10 AM levels until 6 PM, and fell to 10 AM levels by 10 PM. Ovariectomy did not shorten the duration of LH release, but advanced its onset; 3 PM plasma LH levels were greater (p < 0.01) than in controls. Similar results were obtained in the sham group; this stressinduced advancement in plasma LH was not seen in diestrous rats. Adrenalectomy abolished any detectable release of an LH surge at proestrus, and pituitary LH was high at estrus despite the fact that ovulation had occurred. The findings suggest the advancement of LH release noted in the sham-operated and ovariectomized rats was effected by release of adrenal hormones, and that an interaction of ovarian and adrenal hormones prior to, and after, the initial triggering of the ovulatory LH release mechanism influences hypothalamic-pituitary secretory activity. Adrenalectomy may have decreased LH release to a point undetectable by bioassay but yet sufficient to support ovulation. © 1972 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Changes in mouse serum FSH and LH during the estrous cycle and pseudopregnancy were determined by the NIAMD Rat FSH and LH radioimmunoassay systems. The principal characteristics of these changes; namely, a surge of serum LH on the late afternoon and early evening of proestrus; significant elevation of serum FSH on the late afternoon of proestrus; and maximal elevation of serum FSH at the time of ovulation, are very similar to those previously observed in the rat estrous cycle (4). A 10-fold decrease in the ratio of concentrations of serum FSH and LH occurred during a period of IS hr between late afternoon of proestrus, when both LH and FSH were elevated, and early morning of estrus, when only FSH was elevated. Serum FSH and LH levels were low throughout pseudopregnancy, until the onset of the proestrus and estrus which terminated the pseudopregnant period. At that time the characteristic periovulatory increments in both serum FSH and LH concentration occurred. SO days after gonadectomy, male mouse serum FSH and LH concentration had only doubled; 50 days after gonadectomy, female mouse serum FSH had increased substantially, but to a level only half that of the male, while female mouse serum LH had increased to a level equal to that of the gonadectomized male. © 1972 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The evolution of cortical activity was studied from 0.6 of term in utero in eleven foetal lambs, and through most of parturition and the early post-partum period in two newborn lambs. At 0.8 of term the alternating periods of wakefulness and sleep were definite. During a period of electrocorticographic desynchronization paradoxical sleep could be recognized by the return to slow wave sleep that occurs at the sounding of a bell and also by rapid eye movements. No apparent major modification of electrocortical activity accompanied the transition from intra-uterine to extra-uterine life. At parturition there was a sudden increase in muscular tone and a 50% decrease in paradoxical sleep. © 1972.

AB  - 1. In foetal lambs from 40 days gestation (0·27 of term) onwards delivered into a warm saline bath, apparently spontaneous breathing movements were present intermittently. They became deeper and more rapid with increasing age. 2. In foetal lambs (from 0·66 of term) in which observations were made for many days after chronic implantation of tracheal, carotid and amniotic catheters, rapid irregular respiratory movements were present up to 40% of the time, and brief gasps also were seen. 3. The presence of these movements was unrelated to the foetal carotid blood gas values over a wide range of spontaneous variation. 4. These foetal breathing movements were accompanied by comparatively small alterations of pulmonary volume recorded from a tracheal flowmeter, insufficient to clear the tracheal dead space. Occasionally a more prolonged expiration led to the outward flow of fluid. 5. A description is given of sleep and wakefulness in foetal lambs from 0·78 of term. 6. Rapid irregular breathing was associated with rapid eye movement sleep as seen in a warm saline bath or, in utero, as inferred from records of eye movements and electrocortical activity. 7. Respiratory movements were often associated with relatively large variations in foetal heart rate, blood pressure and descending aortic blood flow. 8. Rapid irregular foetal breathing was unaffected by section or blockade of the cervical vagi, but was abolished by general anaesthesia. 9. It is concluded that respiratory movements are normally but intermittently present in the foetal lamb over the greater part of gestation. © 1972 The Physiological Society

AB  - Medial preoptic area (MPOA) multiple unit activity and EEG from the cerebral cortex, dorsal hippocampus, olfactory bulbs and caudal pontine reticular nucleus were recorded in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats possessing indwelling cannulas in the aortic arch. The rats were housed in glass chromatography jars inside a soundproof, light-controlled (14 hr light, 10 hr darkness) electrically shielded chamber. There were two rats in the recording chamber at all times. After a two-week habituation period the studies were begun. Blood samples were removed through the cannulas during waking, slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) at various times during the estrous cycle. All three samples (0.3 ml) were removed within a one-hr period. Blood LH levels were the lowest during SWS and increased several fold during PS and waking. These differences were observable during all stages of the estrous cycle. Integrated multiple unit activity from the MPOA was higher during PS than during SWS or waking. Levels of activity during SWS were similar to those found during waking. In view of these results, we suggest that SWS is inhibitory to LH secretion, and during PS or waking this inhibition is removed. © 1972 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - DATA from carefully conducted epidemiologic studies suggest that the sudden infant death syndrome, also known as “crib death, ” is the major cause of infant death after the first month of life. Crib death is the unexpected demise of an infant not known to have had a serious disease, whose death remains unexplained after complete autopsy. In the majority of cases, the baby does not have a cold or other infection and takes his feedings without difficulty. The infant is then placed in his crib for a nap or for the night; several hours later, or in the morning, the baby is found dead. The sudden infant death syndrome occurs more frequently in families of lower socioeconomic status, a factor which may explain its higher incidence in nonwhite infants. It occurs in infants with a history of prematurity, particularly those born between the 34th and 35th weeks of gestation. Male infants appear to be more at risk than females. Victims are mostly between the ages of one and six months; the frequency is highest around the third month of life. The largest number of deaths occur between the months of November and March. These numerous epidemiologic associations with the sudden infant death syndrome may be independent or merely part of a whole set of circumstances commonly associated with low socioeconomic conditions. The etiology of the sudden infant death syndrome is probably rooted in a factor or set of factors found in all socioeconomic classes but most prevalent among the poor. © 1972 by the American Genetic Association.

AB  - The blood flow of the brain is markedly heterogeneous and the changes, which occur in cerebral perfusion in various physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions, are often focal in nature. This chapter deals with a quantitative method for measuring such regional changes in cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and delineates those changes that occur in cerebral hemodynamics under various conditions. The normal values for rCBF in cats are presented. The effect of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep on these flow values is discussed in relation to the distribution of changes seen and the possible mechanism responsible for these changes. Studies in cats following cerebral trauma are reported which demonstrate a focal loss of the normal autoregulatory capacity of the cerebral vessels. Prolonged partial asphyxia in the term monkey fetus and its effect on rCBF was also studied. The mechanism of production of these flow changes and their relation to the pathologic changes seen in these animals is discussed. Finally, preliminary results from the development of an autoradiographic technique for measuring regional cerebral glucose consumption in vivo utilizing [2-14C] deoxyglucose are presented. © 1972, Academic Press Inc.

AB  - Sifaka troops (Propithecus verreauxi) at Berenty, Madagascar, seem stable numerically, geographically, and in spacing behavior. Recognizeable individuals preserved their 1963-1964 ranges in 1970, in a classical mosaic of defended territories. Lemur catta had twice as many troops of half the mean size in 1970, and had changed from spatial exclusivity to time-plan spacing, both within and between troops, with intertroop ‘battles’. The change may reflect long-term population effects or seasonal food shortage. © 1972 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - A wild troop of Papio papio was observed over a 3-month period in Senegal, West Africa. The overall organization of the troop is described, and it is suggested that some kind of substructuring occurs within the troop. An analysis of the compositions of night-and day-resting parties confirms this, but indicates that the way in which the troop splits up varies according to the time of day. Vigilance behaviour and troop organization during travel are discussed and compared with findings by Bert et al. [1967a, b] on troops of P. papio in other parts of Senegal. The observations are discussed with reference to similar findings from other species of monkeys in Africa. © 1972 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Forty newborn infants received tactile stimulation to the cheek, followed by glucose solution which was either contingent (Experimental Ss) or noncontingent (Control Ss) upon an ipsilateral headturn. Treatment groups were subdivided into No-Drug or Drug groups, on the basis of medication given to mothers in the 4-hr period preceding delivery. Results indicated no main effect of maternalmedication. There was a main effect of Treatment, with Experimental Ss responding with more headturning than Control Ss. The Experimental Ss did not maintain their increased responding throughout trials, but tended to return to the Control group's level of responding toward the end of conditioning. When Ss were categorized into subgroups on the basis of state of wakefulness when entering the experimental room, "awake" Ss proved to be significantly more responsive than did "asleep" Ss. All Ss had experienced a wake-up procedure in order to control for arousal state at the beginning of conditioning. However, those Ss spontaneously awake showed more headturning throughout the session than did those Ss initially rated asleep, but rated awake after the wake-up procedure. In discussing the discrepancies between this study and previous conditioned headturning studies by Siqueland and Lipsitt (1966), the authors noted that Ss in the earlier work had all been spontaneously awake, and that a smaller headturn was reinforced than in the present study. © 1972.

AB  - Visual evoked responses (vers) were studied in a total of 104 polygraphic eeg recordings of 11 small‐for‐dates and 15 pre‐term infants, with the following results. Definite vers were obtained at as early as 25 weeks gestational age. The latency of each component of the ver showed progressive decrease with increasing conceptional age, both in Stage 3 and in rem sleep. The wave form of the ver manifested a definite sequence of development with conceptional age. The vers of small‐for‐dates infants were proportional to the conceptional age both in their latencies and wave forms, indicating that they are not affected by the intra‐uterine growth retardation. The wave form of the ver, rather than the peak latencies, is an additional and valuable tool for distinguishing between true pre‐term and small‐for‐dates infants, especially in those older than 37 weeks conceptional age. Maturation des reéponses visuelles évoquées chez les enfants de faible poids de naissance Des réponses visuelles évoquées (vers) ont étéétudiées sur un total de 104 enregistre‐ments polygraphiques eeg chez 11 enfants de faible poids pour le terme et chez 15 prématuéts vrais avec les résultats suivants. Des vers bien définis ont été obtenus dès 25 semaines d'âge de gestation. La latence de chaque composant des ver ont montré une diminution progressive avec l'âge conceptionnel à la fois au stade 3 et dans le sommeil rapide. Une forme en onde des ver traduit un stade précis des développements par rapport à l'âge conceptionnel. Les vers des enfants de faible poids pour le terme sont proportionnels à l'âge conceptionnel en ce qui concerne la latence et la morphologie en onde indiquant qu'il n'y a pas d'influence liée au retard de croissance intra‐utérine. La forme en onde de la ver, plus que le pic des latences, est un élément additionel et de valeur pour établir une différence entre les vrais prématurés et les enfants de faible poids pour le terme, spécialement chez ceux qui ont plus de 37 semaines d'âge conceptionnel. Die Ausreifung der visuell evozierten Potentiale bei Kindern mit niedrigem Geburtsgewicht Anhand von 104 polygraphischen EEc‐Ableitungen von 11 hypotrophen Kindern und 15 Fruhgeborenen wurden visuell evozierte Potentiale (vep) untersucht und Folgendes gefunden. Deutliche vep wurden bereits bei einem Konzeptionsalter von 25 Wochen gefunden. Die Latenz jeder Komponente des vep nahm progressiv mit steigendem Konzeptionsalter ab, sowohl im Stadium 3 als auch im rem Schlaf. Der Wellencharakter bei dem vep zeigte eine deutliche Abhängigkeit der Entwicklung vom Konzeptionsalter. Die vep der hypotrophen Kinder entsprachen dem Konzeptionsalter sowohl in ihrer Latenz als auch in ihrem Wellencharakter, was erkennen läßt, daD sie von der intrauterinen Wachstumsverzögerung nicht beeinträchtigt werden. Weniger die Spitzenlatenzen als vielmehr der Wellencharakter der vep stellt ein weiteres wertvolles Maß für die Unterscheidung der wirklichen Frühgeborenen von den hypotrophen Kindern dar, insbesondere bei den Kindern, deren Konzeptionsalter mehr als 37 Wochen beträgt. Maduración de las respuestas visuales evocadas en niños con bajo peso al nacer Se estudiaron las respuestas visuales evocadas (ver) en un total de 104 trazados eeg poligráficos en 11 lactantes con peso pequeño al nacer y en 15 nacidos antes de término. Los resultados fueron los siguientes. Se obtuvieron ver definidos a las 25 semanas de edad gestacional. La latencia de cada componente del ver mostró una disminución progresiva al aumentar la edad concepcional, tanto en el estadio 3 del sueño como en el sueño REM. La forma de la onda en el ver manifestó una definida secuencia de desarrollo de acuerdo con la edad concepcional. Los ver de niños con bajo peso al nacer fueron proporcionales a la edad concepcional tanto en sus latencias como en las formas de la onda, indicando que no están afectadas por el retraso de crecimiento intrauterino. La forma de la onda de los ver, más bien que las latencias de la punta, constituye un dato adicional y valioso para distinguir entre niños verdaderamente prematuros y niños de bajo peso al nacer, especialmente en los que sobrepasan las 37 semanas de edad concepcional.

AB  - 14 diagnostic criteria of iron metabolism have been studied in 425 subjects. In prelatent iron deficiency (storage iron deficiency) (n=119) the diffuse Prussian Blue reaction of bone marrow macrophages was negative or considerably reduced, the intestinal iron absorption as measured by the diagnostic59Fe++-absorption-whole body-retention test in a strictly fasting state showed already a clinically significant increase. Serum iron, transferrin saturation, sideroblasts, haemoglobin, red blood cells, and haematocrit varied in a similar range as the corresponding values of healthy subjects with normal iron stores and otherwise normal laboratory results (n=110). Latent iron deficiency (n=72) was differentiated from the prelatent stage by a lowered serum iron and transferrin saturation. In manifest iron deficiency (n=89) the anaemia was hypochromic in 67 cases. The total and the unsaturated iron binding capacity increased with the aggravation of iron deficiency, but varied considerably in all groups. The highest levels occurred in pregnant women mens IV-IX without iron stores (n=35). Systematic combination of the available data was of higher diagnostic significance than the overemphasis of single criteria. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Seven hundred and thirty-one neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) estimations were carried out during normal and abnormal pregnancies. The normal range of activity is defined, and it is shown that in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, dysmaturity, fetal distress, or perinatal death the NAP activity is lower than normal. Despite this, the value of the estimations in the prediction of these complications is minimal. © 1971.

AB  - ADVANCES in methodology have largely been responsible for the newer data on thyrotropin (TSH) secretion by the human pituitary gland. These advances are the radioimmunoassay of human TSH and the discovery of the structure of thyrotropin-releasing factor (TRF) that has led to its synthesis, the first hypothalamic neurohormone to be synthesized. Our aims are to review the recent progress in understanding the regulation of the pituitary secretion of thyrotropin in man and point out its clinical importance. In addition, we discuss the development of tests of the reserve capacity of the gland to secrete TSH, with emphasis on the clinical. © 1971, Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - A radioligand assay procedure with the use of rabbit uterine cytosol as specific binder and activated charcoal as nonspecific absorbent has been developed for the measurement of unconjugated estriol (E3) in less than 1 ml. of pregnancy plasma. Chromatography of plasma extract on a celite column separated E3 from other estrogens. The E3 blank was always below the sensitivity of the method which was 0.1 ng. per milliliter and the coefficient of variation was &lt;15 per cent for values above 7 ng. per milliliter. Values from 130 normal pregnant patients revealed a rise in the mean E3 concentration from 1.4 ng. per milliliter at 16 weeks to 13 ng. per milliliter at term, with most of the increase taking place in the last trimester. Therapeutic abortion with hypertonic saline at 14 to 20 weeks of gestation resulted in a prompt drop in E3 concentration. Subnormal E3 values were found in 6 patients prior to fetal death and in 6 patients admitted with dead fetuses. In 5 severely Rh-isoimmunized patients, in whom intrauterine fetal transfusion was necessary, plasma E3 remained normal until fetal death was clinically apparent. © 1971.

AB  - Daily concentrations of progesterone and estradiol were measured throughout the menstrual cycle in 6 apparently healthy, regularly menstruating women. Four women showed typical "ovulatory" patterns; the fifth subject had an anovulatory cycle, while the remaining woman became pregnant and subsequently aborted spontaneously during the fourth month. During the 4 ovulatory cycles, plasma progesterone levels rose sharply following the preovulatory estradiol peak. The premenstrual phase was characterized by a simultaneous decline in plasma levels of both progesterone and estradiol. In the woman who became pregnant during the cycle under study, the early surge in plasma progesterone was not accompanied by a similar rise in plasma estradiol. The anovulatory cycle was associated with a delayed peak in estradiol and absence of a significant elevation in plasma levels of progesterone during the second half of the cycle. The significance of these hormone patterns is discussed in relation to the underlying ovarian physiology. © 1971.

AB  - Two hundred and sixteen paired estimations of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) and total urinary estrogen excretion and 369 paired NAP and serum heat-stable alkaline phosphatase (HSAP) estimations were carried out during normal and hypertensive pregnancies. In the latter, positive correlations were found between the NAP estimations on the one hand and total urinary estrogen excretion and serum HSAP levels on the other. There was no correlation between the estimations in normal pregnancy. The significance of these results is discussed. © 1971.

AB  - 1. Thermoregulatory reactions of lactating cows (33 kg milk/day) have been measured in summer (25–39° C) and in winter (9·5–24° C) at 3 hr intervals, during four nychthemeral (24 hr) cycles in each season. 2. The rectal‐to‐tympanic temperature gradient increased with rising body temperatures. The seasonal changes were larger for the rectal temperatures than for the tympanic membrane temperatures. These and the significantly lower correlations between rectal temperatures and regulatory responses suggest that in the ruminant rectal temperatures are considerably affected by rumen metabolism and do not represent a reliable index of the regulated temperature. 3. In the winter the regulatory responses were correlated with skin temperatures only. In the summer responses were correlated with both skin and tympanic temperatures, excepting for skin water loss. 4. The seasonal difference in the effects of skin and tympanic temperatures on regulatory responses was associated with a small change in mean tympanic temperature. The twofold larger nychthemeral fluctuation in the summer tympanic temperature is suggested to cause the seasonal difference in the thermoregulatory mode. 5. The winter range of nychthemeral fluctuations in tympanic temperature suggests a range of permitted core thermolability. A wider permitted core thermolability in summer is unlikely to be a mechanism of acclimatization in the cow. © 1971 The Physiological Society

There is a fall during sleep, the lowest systolic pressures being half the highest during the waking period. This is the same pattern as in the non-pregnant. A similar pattern exists when pregnancy is accompanied by chronic hypertension, the fall in blood-pressure being much greater in absolute terms. In pre-eclampsia the degree of the fall in blood-pressure during sleep is reduced. © 1971.

AB  - In normotensive pregnancy control of the arterial pressure by the baroreceptor reflex is set at a high level of sensitivity. The baroreceptor reflex sensitivity is diminished in chronic hypertension both in the nonpregnant and pregnant. In pre-eclampsia there is interference with baroreceptor function. This is implicated in the instability of the blood-pressure in this condition and in the lower degree of fall of blood pressure during sleep. The loss of baroreceptor function is not due to the raised level of the blood pressure. © 1971.

The advantages of the measurement of plasma oestriol levels over the 24- or 48-hour urinary oestriol assays are discussed. The pattern of plasma oestriol levels in the third trimester of pregnancy was investigated in over 400 healthy women and in general a uniform increase was found from the 28th week until term. Diurnal variation was found to be present, but this did not preclude the use of the method for assessing the feto-placental unit. Exercise and meals had a minimal effect on the oestriol levels. Following delivery the level decreased sharply to reach, within four hours, one-half that found just prior to delivery. © 1971.

AB  - The activities of lactose synthetase (in the presence and absence of α-lactalbumin), galactosyltransferase and α-lactalbumin levels were determined in rat and mouse mammary glands during pregnancy, lactation and involution. In the rat, essentially none of the above activities were detected prior to parturition. This was followed by a sharp increase with the maximum occurring during late lactation and then by a rapid drop during involution. In the mouse, detectable levels of all the activities occurred at 15 days of pregnancy and these levels increased during pregnancy and reached a maximum level during early lactation and again sharp decreases occurred during involution. The study shows that mammary gland development occurs at an earlier date in the mouse than in the rat. © 1971.

AB  - Onset of estrus was observed every 4 days in the same hamsters exposed either to 24-hr light:dark cycles (LD 16:8) or to constant light (LL). Regression analysis indicated that only LL hamsters maintained estrous cycle periods significantly greater than 96 hr (p >0.05). These “circa-quadridian” (CQ) rhythms indicate that an endogenous timing mechanism capable of entrainment by 24-hr LD cycles (the Zeitgeber) controls the estrous cycle. Pituitary gonadotropin release and ovulation maintained constant time relationships to onset of estrus in both LD and LL. Pregnancy and pseudopregnancy reset the CQ rhythm to an earlier hr. However, spontaneous extensions from a 4- to 5-day estrous cycle followed by a day of vaginal cornification did not cause a phase shift in the CQ rhythm. This indicates that the endogenous timer functions with circadian rather than CQ rhythmicity. In LL, periods of the endogenous circadian timer ranged from 23.84 to 24.39 hr. Most values are significantly greater than 24 hr (p > 0.05). In LD, timer periods ranged from 23.96 to 24.03 hr. No value is significantly greater than 24 hr. © 1971 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - No disruption of menstrual cycles or ovulation was observed in baboons exposed to constant light. Adult cycling female rats as a reference animal were exposed to the same constant light, and persistent vaginal cornification and follicular ovaries devoid of corpora lutea developed. It is inferred that a difference exists between baboons and rats for sensitivity to light - as a regulator of gonadotrophin secretion. When baboons were exposed to this constant light, polydipsia and polyuria were observed, suggesting that other disorders of neural activity did develop. © 1971 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - A simple, accurate and reproducible radio-immunosorbent technique has been developed to measure serum concentrations of chorionic somatomammotrophin (HCS). It appears to fulfil all the criteria for a good placental function test. The syncytiotrophoblast is the sole source of the hormone. It is easily measured in the serum from the 6th week until delivery. There is no circadian rhythm and the serum level is unaffected by stress or metabolic changes. It has a short half-life of 20 minutes. The serum HCS levels mirror the curve of fetal growth increment and low serum HCS concentrations were present in hypertensive disease of pregnancy. There appears to be a definite fetal danger zone separating normal from abnormal values. In cases of fetal death in hypertensive disease of pregnancy the serial serum HCS readings entered this zone before fetal demise. Serum HCS estimation was not helpful in diabetes nor in rhesus sensitization. © 1971.

In the 58 days old premature, the electrocorticographic patterns of sleep were already similar to those of the full term neonate; but signs of immaturity of the sleep-wakefulness rhythm were present: the percentage of time spent in paradoxical sleep (PS) was high (30 per cent); the periods of wakefulness were infrequent and short lasting (23 per cent), whereas the frequency of appearance of the periods of waking and sleep was very high. A prenatal organization of the sleep behavior was achieved between the 61st and the 63rd day of gestation. During this critical period, an increase in the duration of wakefulness periods was observed and the percentage of PS decreased abruptly down to the neonate rate (7 per cent). These observations suggest that cerebral maturation plays a role in the organization of the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness. © 1971.

AB  - To define factors controlling blood levels of the placental hormone, human chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS), scrum levels were determined scrum by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay procedure. A weak, but statistically significant association exists between the circulating level of HCS and the mass of placental (weight) and fetal tissue (weight). An inverse relationship also exists between blood glucose concentration and HCS. Hypoglycemia elevates the level of HCS, and hyperglycemia causes it to fall. No relationship was found between HCS levels and the time of day, fetal sex, fetal anomalies or maternal hemoglobin level. The importance of fetal placental factors as they regulate HCS is discussed. © 1971 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - A simple and reliable method of determining oestriol in non-pregnancy urine is presented. The procedure includes acid hydrolysis, separation of oestriol by solvent partition, gel adsorption and fluorimetric measurement. The method fulfils all criteria of reliability. This was particularly proven by an accuracy control with tritium-labeled oestriol. Serial determinations of oestriol excretion during the menstrual cycle demonstrate that the use of 12 h overnight samples does not cause any considerable loss of information for the clinician. Of the three classical oestrogens only the oestriol fraction is not influenced by exogenous hormonal substances. Thus the method is specially suited for investigations during treatment with hormonal contraceptives. © 1971.

AB  - A simple, accurate and reproducible radio‐immunosorbent technique has been developed to measure serum concentrations of chorionic somatomammotrophin (HCS). It appears to fulfil all the criteria for a good placental function test. The syncytiotrophoblast is the sole source of the hormone. It is easily measured in the serum from the 6th week until delivery. There is no circadian rhythm and the serum level is unaffected by stress or metabolic changes. It has a short half‐life of 20 minutes. The serum HCS levels mirror the curve of fetal growth increment and low serum HCS concentrations were present in hypertensive disease of pregnancy. There appears to be a definite fetal danger zone separating normal from abnormal values. In cases of fetal death in hypertensive disease of pregnancy the serial serum HCS readings entered this zone before fetal demise. Serum HCS estimation was not helpful in diabetes nor in rhesus sensitization. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Fluorimetrically determined plasma corticosteroids were studied in normal individuals. In female subjects the 7 a.m. mean baseline values were significantly higher than those in the male subjects. The adrenal response during the 4-hour ACTH test was significantly higher in female controls than in the male. During insulin test (0.10 i.u./kg) the maximum increase in plasma corticosteroids was 10.7 (3.7-22.8) μg/100 ml (mean and range). No difference in response was observed between male and female controls. During the 1 mg dexamethasone test plasma corticosteroids were suppressed to 2.7 (1.4-4.4) μg/100 ml (mean and range); serum corticotrophin was also significantly suppressed. © 1971 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The incidence of symptoms of bladder dysfunction and of urinary‐tract infection in a population aged 65 and over is reported. The population represented 85 per cent of all the men and women in this age group on the list of one general practice. Nocturnal frequency of micturition occurred in 64 per cent, including 29 per cent who got up two or more times at night to pass urine. Nocturia became more common and more severe with advancing age, and was more common in patients with intellectual deficits. It was considered to be a neurogenic symptom. Incontinence was present in 20 per cent. Neurogenic changes and also trauma at parturition seemed to be contributing causes. Diurnal frequency (occurring in 10 per cent) showed no age association in women, but in men it became more common with advancing age, probably due to prostatism. Precipitancy (in 30 per cent) and scalding (in 11 per cent) were not associated with ageing, sex or infection. The symptoms generally are regarded as the ‘urethral syndrome,’ and our findings suggest a nonspecific urethritis. Although a significant degree of bacteriuria was present in 20 per cent of the women from the age of 65 and men from the age of 70, it played little part in producing any of the foregoing symptoms. Bacteriuria was not related to previous pregnancies, nor to trauma at parturition. It was related in men to a history of prostatectomy. © 1971 The American Geriatrics Society

AB  - Rat prolactin 131I, prepared by a standard method for radioimmunoassay, was given intravenously by constant infusion or by a single injection into anesthetized (Na pentobarbital) intact male rats, and ovariectomized, hypophysectomized or intact female rats. Blood samples were collected at frequent intervals and the serum was assayed for immuno-precipitable prolactin and for total radioactivity. The disappearance curve after a single intravenous injection of rat prolactin in a pituitary homogenate, as measured by radioimmunoassay, was the same as that of the labeled prolactin, indicating that the latter was cleared from the blood in a manner identical to that of the endogenous hormone. The metabolic clearance rate (MCR), denned as the volume of blood cleared of prolactin per unit time, was 1.26 ± 0.08 ml/min by the constant infusion method and 1.2 to 1.46 ml/min by the single injection method. The half-life time for the first exponential (first 10 min after iv injection) of injected rat prolactin ranged from 3.95 to 5.76 min. It is concluded that the MCR of rat prolactin is the same in male and female rats, and is not influenced by the estrous cycle, ovariectomy or hypophysectomy.The secretion rate of prolactin was calculated by multiplying the MCR (av. of 1.32 ml/min in all groups) by the endogenous serum prolactin concentration as measured by radioimmunoassay. Serum prolactin concentration and secretion rate were significantly higher at 5:45–6:15 PM than at 9:45–10:15 AM during each stage of the estrous cycle, and also in castrated female and intact male rats. Prolactin secretion rate was approximately 7 times as great on the afternoon as on the morning of proestrus, but was only about twice as great on the afternoons as on the mornings of all other groups. This indicates the existence of a diurnal rhythm in prolactin secretion rate in the rat. © 1971 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Sleep-wakefulness cycles were recorded in ovariectomized female rats that were injected with estrogen plus progesterone and estrogen alone. Two daily injections with estrogen followed by progesterone resulted in significant reductions in the percentages of time spent in both REM and NREM stages of sleep during the night following the injection of progesterone. Treatment with estrogen alone for six consecutive days resulted in a reduction in REM sleep but did not appear to influence NREM sleep. Thus both hormone treatments modified sleep, but the combined action of estrogen and progesterone more closely duplicated the sleep patterns observed in the intact animal on the night of behavioral estrus. © 1971.

AB  - Blood‐pressure variation throughout the 24 hours has been measured in pregnancy using an automatic cuff type recorder. There is a fall during sleep, the lowest systolic pressures being half the highest during the waking period. This is the same pattern as in the non‐pregnant. A similar pattern exists when pregnancy is accompanied by chronic hypertension, the fall in blood‐pressure being much greater in absolute terms. In pre‐eclampsia the degree of the fall in blood‐pressure during sleep is reduced. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - In normotensive pregnancy control of the arterial pressure by the baroreceptor reflex is set at a high level of sensitivity. The baroreceptor reflex sensitivity is diminished in chronic hypertension both in the nonpregnant and pregnant. In pre‐eclampsia there is interference with baroreceptor function. This is implicated in the instability of the blood‐pressure in this condition and in the lower degree of fall of blood pressure during sleep. The loss of baroreceptor function is not due to the raised level of the blood pressure. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Serial studies were carried out on the EEG and sleep rhythms of 24 short‐gestation and small for‐dates babies. A regular cyclical alternation of eye movement sleep with non eye‐movement sleep was identifiable in all short gestation babies studied. The EEG was periodic in REM sleep up to 32/52 total age, and was continuous thereafter; in non‐REM sleep the EEG was always periodic, but the periodicity became regular at 36 weeks total age. ‘Slow waves’, (1–3 c.p.s.), ‘intermediate slow waves’ (4–6 c.p.s.), and ‘fast activity’ (14–24 c.p.s.), disappeared from the EEG in REM sleep at 34 weeks, but persisted for longer in non‐REM sleep. ‘Frontal humps’ and a period of marked flattening following non‐REM sleep appeared in the EEG during REM sleep at 36 weeks. Vertex sharp waves appeared during non‐REM sleep at 36 weeks. Développement des rythmes innés de sommeil chez les enfants nés avant terme Des études en série ont été entreprises sur les EEG et les rythmes de sommeil d'enfants nés avant terme. Une succession cyclique régulière de sommeil avec mouvements oculaires et de sommeil sans mouvement oculaire a pu être observés chez tous les bébés nés avant terme étudiés. L'EEG est périodique durant le sommeil avec mouvement oculaire jusqu'à 32 semaines d'âge total et est ensuite continu. Dans le sommeil sans mouvement oculaire, l'EEG est toujours périodique mais la périodicité devient régulière à 36 semaines d'âge total. Les ‘ondes lentes’ (1 à 3 c.p.s.) les ‘ondes intermédiaires’ (4 à 6 c.p.s.) et l' ‘activité rapide’ (14 à 24 c.p.s.) disparaissent de l'EEG durant le sommeil à mouvement oculaire à 34 semaines d'âge total mais persiste plus longtemps dans le sommeil sans mouvement oculaire. Des ‘bases frontales’ et une période d'aplatissement accentuéà la suite du sommeil sans mouvement oculaire apparaissent à l'EEG durant le sommeil avec movement oculaire à 35 semaines d'âge total; des ondes pointues au niveau du vertex apparaissent durant le sommeil sans mouvement oculaire à 36 semaines d'âge total. Die Entwicklung eines angeborenen Schlafrhythmus bei frühgeborenen Kindern Über das EEG und den Schlafrhythmus frühgeborener Kinder wurden Verlaufsuntersuchungen angestellt. Ein regelmäßiger zyklischer Wechsel von Augen‐Bewegungs‐Schlaf und Nicht‐Augen‐Bewegungs‐Schlaf fand sich bei allen untersuchten frühgeborenen Kindern. Das EEG war beim RAB‐Schlaf bis zum Alter von 32/52 periodisch und danach gleichbleibend; beim Nicht‐RAB‐Schlaf waren die EEGS immer periodisch, aber die Perioden wurden im Alter von 36/52 regelmäßig. ‘Langsame Wellen’ (1–3 c.p.s.), ‘Zwischenwellen’ (4–6 c.p.s.) und ‘schnelle Aktivität’ (14–24 c.p.s.) verschwanden beim RAB‐Schlaf mit 34/52 aus dem EEG, hielten jedoch beim Nicht RAB‐Schlaf länger an. El desarrollo de los ritmos de sue no innatos en lactantes de gestatión corta Se realizaron estudios seriados del EEG y ritmos de sueño en niños de corta gestatión. En todos los casos estudiados fue identificable una alternancia cíclica regular del movimiento ocular durante el sueño. El EEG era periódicoen el sueño REM hasta la edad total de 32/52, y a partie de aquí era contínuo; en el sueño no‐REM el EEG era siempre periódico, pero los períodos se hacían regulares a la edad total de 36/52. Las ‘ondas lentas’ (1–3 c.p.s.) ‘ondas lentas intermediarias’ (4–6 c.p.s.) y la ‘actividad rápida’ (14–24 c.p.s.) desaparecieron del EEG en el sueno REM a 34/52, pero persistieron más en el sueño no‐REM. ‘Jorobas frontales’ y un periodo de aplanamiento marcado siguiendo al sueño no‐REM, aparecieron en el EEG durante el suendo REM a 36/52: ondas sharp en el vértice aparecieron durante el sueño no‐REM a 36/52.

AB  - Two experiments were devised in which the auditory responses and spontaneous ‘responses’ of short‐gestation babies were compared with full‐term infants in two prestimulus arousal states. In both states (‘light sleep’ and ‘deep sleep’) the full‐term babies tended to be the better sound detectors (significant at the 5 per cent level in light sleep; just failed 5 per cent level in deep sleep). A hyper‐reaction to sounds by the short‐gestation babies in a state of light sleep appeared to be associated with a higher level of spontaneous activity. This hyper‐reaction was interpreted as evidence of hyper‐responsivity rather than hyper‐sensitivity. Réponse exagérée aux sons chez le prématuré Deux expériences ont été réalisées dans lesquelles les réponses auditives et les réponses spontanées de bébés prématurés ont été comparés à ceux d'enfants nés à terme dans deux états de faible niveau de vigilance. Dans les deux états (sommeil léger et sommeil profond) les bébés nés à terme se sont montrés plus sensibles aux sons (difference significative au seuil de 0,05 dans le sommeil léger; manquant de peu le seuil de 0,05 dans le sommeil profond). Une hyperréaction aux sons chez le prématuré en état de sommeil léger apparait associée à un plus haut degré d'activité spontanée. Cette hyper‐réaction est indiquée comme signe de réponse exagérée plutôt que comme relevant d'un abaissement du seuil de sensibilité. Überempfindlichkeit gegenüber Tönen beim frühreifen Säugling Es wurden zwei Experimente festgelegt, in denen die Reaktionen des Gehörs und spontane ‘Reaktionen’ von frühgeborenen Kindern mit denen ausgetragener Kinder in zwei Prästimulus‐Stadien des Erwachens verglichen wurden. In beiden Stadien (‘leichter Schlaf'und’ tiefer Schlaf) neigten die ausgetragenen Kinder dazu, Töne besser zu entdecken (im tiefen Schlaf bei 5 prozent significant). Eine Überempfindlichkeit gegenüber Tönen in einem Stadium leichten Schlafes schien bei den frühgeborenen Kindern mit vermehrter spontaner Aktivität verbunden zu sein. Diese vermehrte Reaktion wurde eher als Ausdruck gesteigerter Reizbeantwortung denn als Überempfindlichkeit gedeutet. Capacidad de repuesta elevada para los sonidos en el nino prematuro Se establecieron dos experimentos en los cuales las respuestas auditivas y las respusetas ‘espontáneas’ de niños de corta gestación eran comparadas con niños a término en dos estados ‘de alerta’ previos al estfmulo. En ambos estados (‘sueño ligero’ y ‘sueño profundo’) los niños recién nacidos a término tendían a mostrarse unos detectores de sonido mejores (significativo al nivel de 5 por ciento en sueño profundo). Una hiperreacción de los sonidos por parte de los niños con gestación corta en estado de sueño ligero apareció asociada con un nivel más alto de actividad espontánea. Esta hiperreacción se interpretó como evidencia de una hipercapacidad de respuesta más bien que de una hiper‐sensibilidad. Copyright © 1971, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - In a comparison of 51 pairs of plasma oestriol and urinary oestriol levels during pregnancy the correlation coefficient was highly significant. This close relationship of plasma and urinary oestriol values was present not only in normal pregnancy, but also in the serial assays made in pregnancy complications. No significant variation in plasma oestriol values was found between blood samples taken in the morning and evening. © 1970.

AB  - A detailed analysis was made of circulating luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin throughout the estrous cycle in rats. Vaginal cytology was recorded daily for 18 or 23 days in 2 groups of adult female rats, 300 and 400 per group. The presence of distended uteri or tubal ova was noted at the time of exsanguination under ether anesthesia. Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. In 404 rats with regular 5-day cycles, all 3 hormones reached maximum concentrations on the afternoon of functional proestrus. During the next 3 days FSH decreased progressively, and LH levels indicated a diurnal fluctuation with minimum concentrations during darkness. Serum prolactin may have b een elevated due to anesthesia and exsanguination and showed a rapid increase which occurred simultaneously with elevated LH and FSH on the afternoon of proestrus. Radioimmunoassay of all 3 hormones indicated that the increases in serum LH and prolactin did not necessarily occur simultaneously. Hypophysectomy and sequential heart puncture of proestrus rats during maximum hormone release showed disappearance rates (half-lives) for LH, FSH, and prolactin of 20, 110, and 13 minutes, respectively.

AB  - 1. Blood gas tensions, pH, packed cell volume (PCV) and the levels of glucose, fructose and lactic acid have been followed in foetal and maternal blood for periods of 3‐30 days in conscious ewes between 80 days gestation and term (∼ 147 days). 2. Blood samples were withdrawn through indwelling catheters placed in one or both umbilical vessels, a uterine vein and a maternal artery. 3. The success of the operation appeared to depend on the maintenance of maternal blood gas and pH levels within normal limits as well as on the final position of the tip of the catheter. The difficulties and limitations of the technique are discussed. 4. Foetal blood gas tensions, pH, PCV, lactic acid and glucose levels did not change markedly during the last 50–60 days of gestation. The fructose concentration fell during this period, the greatest change was between 100 and 120 days gestation. 5. Small fluctuations in PO2, PCO2 and pH in umbilical venous blood were associated with similar changes in the uterine vein, so that the gradients across the placenta appeared to remain constant. 6. Daily changes in maternal plasma glucose levels were reflected in similar changes in foetal plasma fructose and by much smaller alterations in the foetal glucose levels. The glucose concentration in the foetal plasma was less than 25% of that in maternal plasma. 7. The existence of a general relationship between maternal plasma glucose and foetal plasma fructose was masked by the independent fall in fructose levels with age. However, at any given stage of gestation, there was a significant correlation between foetal fructose and maternal glucose. 8. Few changes in the umbilical blood were associated with impending abortion or birth. Blood gas tensions remained constant, but a sharp fall in fructose levels often occurred 48 hr before any changes in pH, PCV and lactate concentration. 9. Present and other findings on conscious animals are compared with previous observations on acute, anaesthetized preparations. © 1970 The Physiological Society

AB  - Changes in plasma cortisol levels following the 30-minute Synacthen test were studied in 13 women throughout normal pregnancy and in the non-pregnant state. The plasma 11 OHCS response to Synacthen was also studied during labour in 9 of the 13 patients. A rise in resting plasma glucocorticoids as pregnancy progressed was found, similar to that described by previous workers. The post synacthen response was normal in early and mid pregnancy, enhanced in the third trimester and diminished during labour. The significance of these results is discussed. © 1970.

AB  - A questionnaire was distributed through pharmacists to French-Canadian users of oral contraceptives to study their sexual adaptation and psychological changes. The response rate was 12%, yielding 114 questionnaires. 40% answered "no change," but more noted improvement than worsening in sexual desire, frequency, and satisfaction. In a group designated "frigid" (those who answered rarely or never to an undisclosed question) 38.5-61.5% reported increased desire; and 20-55% reported increased satisfaction. 42.85% noted physical side effects, which correlated with satisfaction of the method. 34.7% claimed psychological side effects such as anxiety, irritability or fatigue, which correlated with dissatisfaction with the method. The authors hypothesized that physical effects like weight-gain, breast enlargement, and pseudopregnancy unconsciously supplement the conscious relief from fear of pregnancy to improve sexual adaptation.

AB  - In late normal pregnancy the mean day-night variation of non-protein-bound cortisol in plasma was found to be reduced to 52%, from a mean of 82% in non-pregnant subjects. Levels of unbound cortisol at midnight and at 9 ami. in late pregnancy were raised above the non-pregnant normal. These levels led to increased urinary free cortisol excretion in pregnancy. This “tissue exposure” in late pregnancy is two to three times normal, as judged by both plasma unbound and urinary free cortisol measurements. The well-known increase in urinary free cortisol excretion in pregnancy is explained by the reduced day-night rhythm. © 1970, British Medical Journal Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plasma-zinc levels were measured by atomic-absorption spectrophotometry in healthy adults and children, in patients with a variety of diseases, in pregnancy, and in women taking oral contraceptives. The mean level was 96 μg. per 100 ml. for healthy adults and 89 μg. per 100 ml. for healthy children, and the concentration was constant with no significant variation attributable to sex, food consumption, or diurnal variation. Abnormally low values were obtained in alcoholic cirrhosis, other types of liver disease, active tuberculosis, indolent ulcers, uræmia, before and after a single hæmodialysis, myocardial infarct, non-tuberculous pulmonary infection, Down's syndrome, cystic fibrosis with growth retardation, growth-retarded Iranian villagers, pregnancy, and in women taking oral contraceptives. In cystic fibrosis without growth retardation and in inactive tuberculosis, there was no significant decrease. No conditions have been observed with a higher-than-normal plasma-zinc concentration. © 1970.

AB  - 1. 1. The influence of light on the free running endogenous circannual rhythm has been studied for 4 consecutive years in laboratory born animals of the hibernating species, Citellus lateralis. 2. 2. Under constantly controlled environmental conditions, it has been found that when juvenile animals are subjected to bilateral enucleation, they have a more accurately timed free running circannual rhythem than normal animals under various other lighting regimens. 3. 3. It is concluded that light does influence the circannual rhythm and is therefore a potential Zeitgerber. 4. 4. It is demonstrated that laboratory born animals establish circannual rhythms from birth, including synchrony of the homothermic-heterothermic and body weight rhythms. 5. 5. As a result of a laboratory accident, it has proved possible to theorize a cause for the enormous winter death rate in the wild. 6. 6. The terminology associated with endogenous rhythms is discussed. © 1970.

AB  - Urinary cortisol and corticosterone have been measured simultaneously without prior purification or chromatography using a fluorometric method which incorporates a correction for non-specific fluorescence. Non-corticoid fluorescence was corrected for by the introduction of a sample blank in which corticosteroid fluorescence has been altered by interaction with hydroxylamine. Daily excretion of cortisol in normal subjects from 18 to 120 μg with a mean of 51 ± 24 υg S.D. and of corticosteronre o to 16 μg with a mean of 3.0 ± 3.2 μg S.D. The demonstration of a circadian rhythm, low levels in patients with adrenocortical hypofunction, elevation in the third trimester of pregnancy and the expected responses to metyrapone and corticotropin illustrate the close correlation with adrenocortical activity. © 1970.

AB  - The temporal course of the adrenocortical response to handling was determined on Day 16 of pregnancy in previously handled and non-handled rats. Fifteen days of prior handling did not influence the plasma corticosterone response to handling stimulation measured at either the peak or the trough in the 24-hr adrenocortical rhythm. Corticosterone levels in animals sampled at the peak of the 24-hr adrenocortical rhythm were elevated 60 min after handling stimulation which was found to be a function of elevated resting corticosterone levels. In a second experiment the 24-hr adrenocortical rhythm in pregnant animals was characterized by peak values which occurred approximately two hr before darkness but, unlike nonpregnant animals, these peak values were sustained throughout most of the dark period. © 1970.

AB  - Running activity was continuously recorded for about one year from individual adult female S1 rats under controlled conditions. Characteristics of this activity were compared in matched pinealectomized, sham-operated, and unoperated siblings during and following 4 separate 12-hr shifts in photoperiod (ΔΦ = 12) with standard conditions = LD 12:12 (110-470:5-20). Time for entrainment was about 8 days in all groups but during the phase shifting of the animals' circadian running activity, that of the pinealectomized animals differed in shifting initially more quickly in starting time and activity midpoint, in having less increase post ΔΦ in activity phase length (α) and amount of activity (A), and in having a different distribution of activity per transient cycle. These results suggest that the mammalian pineal may be more closely related to general central homeostatic mechanisms than to specific service in transducing photoperiod information to peripheral response systems. However, the probable relevance of these results to the interpretation of variable and photodependent or environmentally dependent physiologic effects of pinealectomy is pointed out. © 1970.

AB  - The duration of gestation and the time of onset of parturition were measured by means of a specially constructed recording apparatus. Animals were exposed to 1 of 3 photoperiod schedules from Day 0 of pregnancy (sperm-positive vaginal smear) to parturition. Light regimens of 2 hr/day (short), 14 hr/day (control), or 22 hr/day (long) duration were used in these experiments. Animals exposed to the short photoperiod delivered only on Days 21 and 22 of gestation, control animals delivered on Days 21, 22 and 23, whereas animals exposed to the long photoperiod delivered during Days 21 through 24 of pregnancy. The data indicate that, with a prolonged daily illumination, an apparent 12-hr increase in the duration of gestation occurs. The time of onset of parturition also was photoperiod dependent. In all 3 environments, animals exhibited a marked tendency to deliver during the light phase of the light:dark cycle. This tendency for the onset of parturition to display a 24-hr periodicity was obscured, in part, by long daily photoperiods. The data indicate that the effect of light on the prolongation of pregnancy may be in part an action to delay implantation, as well as to delay the time of delivery, since the birth weights of rats delivered on Days 23-24 of pregnancy were not significantly different from those delivered on Days 21-22 of gestation. Under the conditions of the present experiments, pinealectomy did not significantly alter the effect of photoperiod on the duration of gestation or the time of day of delivery. © 1970 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In immature female rats that were injected with 8 IU of PMS at 30 days of age (day 30) and that were exposed to light (130 lux) daily between 0500 and 1900, the mean time for ovulation was 0135 on day 33. If exposed to light continuously (LL) beginning at 0500 on day 30, 27, or 24, the mean hour of the day for ovulation was progressively delayed, occurring, respectively, at 0450 on day 33, 1405 on day 34, and 1850 on day 33. These results suggest that the ecretion of ovulation-inducing hormones (OIH) in rats is contoolled by an endogenous circadian rhythm, the period of which is lengthened by LL. In rats exposed to LL since day 27 (LL 27s), advancing the time of PMS on day 30 from 0930 to 0500 advanced the time of ovulation by an entire day. In LL 24s, delaying the time of PMS on day 30 from 0930 to 1900 delayed the time of ovulation by an entire day. Thus, altering the time of the PMS injection changed the day, but not the hour of the day, at which ovulation occurred. If phenobarbital sodium (PB) was injected at 0645, approximately 12 hr before the anticipated time for the onset of ovulation in LL 24s, ovulation was inhibited. Ovulation was not inhibited if PB was injected at 1000 or 1245, thus indicating that the time interval between OIH secretion and ovulation is about 12 hr in immature rats exposed to LL. © 1970 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In order to assess the amount of heat stress in pregnant sows under the climatic conditions of Southern Nigeria, respiratory counts were made for 20 sows of the Landrace and Large White breeds randomly allocated to pens with and without wallows. Ten values were taken per animal throughout the day for one day of each week from conception until parturition. It was found that all three main effects, stage of pregnancy, time of day, and the treatment with wallows contributed significantly to the total variability (P < 0.001). The rapid increase of metabolism during the last third of pregnancy will, in tropical climates, lead to an increase in heat stress. The results indicate that in pregnant swine respiratory counts may be taken as a measure of endogenous heat production. © 1970.

AB  - The simultaneous determination of the corticosteroid levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid were carried out in healthy subjects and patients with meningitis, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, epilepsy and schizophrenia. A diurnal rhythm of the corticosteroid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was observed and the characteristics of the pattern were similar to those of the blood, but the onset of the maximal peak of the concentration of corticosteroids in the cerebrospinal fluid was somewhat delayed compared with that of the blood. In acute meningitis with high fever, a marked increase in the levels of corticosteroids in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid was observed. This increase in the levels returned to normal following recovery from the disease. The ratio of the corticosteroid levels of cerebrospinal fluid to blood in acute aseptic meningitis was not significantly modified, suggesting no modification of bloodcerebrospinal fluid gradient in this disease. However, in tuberculous and septic meningitis the ratio of the corticosteroid levels in cerebrospinal fluid to blood slightly increased compared with that of normal subjects. The corticosteroid levels in brain tumor, hydrocephalus, epilepsy and schizophrenia were within normal limits. © 1970 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - This chapter discusses steroid metabolism that concern either recent developments in analytic techniques or interpretations of complex endocrine laboratory data. It is frequently pertinent to determine accurately the production rate (PR) of a steroid hormone. “Production rate” is defined as the sum of the glandular secretion of a particular hormone plus all other compounds that contribute to this hormone or to the metabolites measured. In the past, the PR has been approximated or inferred from the measurements of urinary metabolite levels or blood levels. The urinary metabolite levels only approximate actual glandular production because of unpredictable alterations in metabolism, difficulties in hydrolysis of urinary steroid conjugates, and the fact that several precursors can yield the same metabolites. In an attempt to relate steroid blood levels to production rate, variations are produced by circadian rhythms and alterations in metabolic clearance rate. Thus, attention has shifted to the more direct measurement of steroid production rates using isotopic methods. © 1970, Academic Press Inc.

AB  - A study has been made of the effects of progesterone on multiple unit activity (MUA) in the hypothalamus of ovariectomized estrogen-primed rats maintained under light-controlled conditions (14 hr light, 10 hr dark). With large microelectrodes (25 μ), recordings were made of integrated MUA in the arcuate nucleus-median eminence (ME) and the preoptic region of proestrous rats (nucleated vaginal smears) under light urethane anesthesia. Cortical EEG, EKG, and respiration were also monitored. Injection of progesterone (2.5 mg sc in oil) induced a "sleepy" EEG within an hour, regardless of time of administration. However, afternoon (14:30) injections induced a depression in ME multiunit activity followed by several hours of elevated activity starting around 17:00, while injections at 11:00 evoked a rise in activity preceding the phases of depression and secondary elevation (a triphasic effect). In natural proestrus progesterone at 11:00 activates release of pituitary ovulating hormone ("advances the critical period"), and the initial elevation in multiunit activity may represent a neural correlate of this process. The secondary rise in activity occurs at about the time on onset of behavioral estrus. Anterior deafferentation of the hypothalamus eliminates the diurnal variation in responsiveness to progesterone, and injection of the steroid is followed by a slow rise in multiunit activity regardless of time of day. © 1970.

AB  - The 24-hr urinary excretion of cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in 21 control subjects (3544 ± 175 nmoles, mean ± SEM) was contrasted with the cyclic AMP excretion in patients with hyperparathyroidism (5719 ± 1200 nmoles, p <.01), hypoparathyroidism (1943 ±312 nmoles, p <.001), renal disease (596 ±208 nmoles, p <.001), and women during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. An effect of parathyroid hormone on the urinary excretion of cyclic AMP was implied from: 1) the increased urinary excretion of the nucleotide in patients with hyperparathyroidism and the low excretion in patients with hypoparathyroidism, and 2) the acute reduction to normal in urine cyclic AMP following removal of a parathyroid adenoma. An effect of steroid and/or pituitary or placental hormones on the urinary excretion of cyclic AMP was suggested from observing a midcycle peak in nucleotide excretion during ovulatory menstrual cycles, and a progressive increase in urinary excretion of the nucleotide during pregnancy. In addition, acute increments in urinary excretion rates of cyclic AMP in response to injections or infusions of parathyroid extract, glucagon and vasopressin were demonstrated. Acute infusions of human GH had no effect on cyclic AMP excretion. The marked variation in the magnitude of the acute responses and the variations in 24-hr cyclic AMP excretion in different patient groups suggested that many different factors must be considered in evaluating the 24-hr urinary content of the nucleotide. Among those considered were: 1) those factor(s) which influence the escape of the nucleotide from cell membranes, 2) the renal or extrarenal origin of the nucleotide, and 3) the functional status of the kidneys. © 1970 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Adult, virgin Holtzman rats, maintained in a 14-hr light/day photoperiod, were transferred during proestrus to an environment of 2 hr light/day or 22 hr light/day. Pseudopregnancy (Day 0 = estrus) was induced upon transfer (0 days pre-exposure, 0 estrous cycles) or following short (1 estrous cycle) or long (5 estrous cycles) pre-exposure to an experimental photoperiod. Decidual sensitivity, assessed after surgical traumatization of the uterus, was measured as uterine weight 5 days post trauma. Sensitivity to decidualization in control animals was absent on midnight of Day 2, but developed rapidly to a peak (2000 mg/cornu) during the interval between midnight of Day 3 and noon of Day 4 of pseudopregnancy. A rapid loss of sensitivity occurred afterward. In relation to controls, 0 and 1 cycle of pre-exposure to 2 hr light/day did not significantly alter the time of onset of decidual sensitivity, though a decreased magnitude of response and a slightly earlier regression were noted. Long pre-exposure to 2 hr light/day resulted in a pattern similar to controls, but somewhat delayed. Pre-exposure for 0 cycles to 22 hr light/day caused a shift in pattern such that sensitivity was reduced significantly from the control on Day 3 midnight but not at noon of Day 4. In animals pre-exposed for 1 estrous cycle, the times of onset and peak responsiveness were delayed about 12 hr. Long pre-exposure delayed further the time of onset of sensitivity and in addition hastened its regression. The data suggest that extended daily illumination may limit decidual sensitivity by increasing endogenous estrogen secretion during early progestation in the rat. © 1970 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Sleep patterns were studied throughout pregnancy in female rats. The percentages of time spent in wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep remained relatively constant from the beginning of pregnancy until shortly before delivery. For a period of approximately 15 hr prior to the onset of parturition there was an increased wakefulness and a decrease in both types of sleep. However, REM sleep decreased proportionally more than NREM sleep. During parturition the females were almost constantly awake allowing little time for NREM sleep and none for REM sleep. Soon after the end of parturition the amounts of NREM and REM sleep rose quickly to reach levels comparable to those obtained during pregnancy. The significance of these results is described in terms of the hormonal and nonhormonal events occurring at the time of parturition. © 1970.

AB  - A simple visual observation system, supplemented by measurement of skin potential, was devised for developmental studies of sleep cycles in settings where multiple electrode placement is not practicable. The findings replicated essential features of quiet and active sleep cycles which had been reported previously to exist against the background of decreasing level of physiological arousal, as sleep proceeds. Twelve newborns showed approximately one‐half of their inter‐feeding sleeping time in the rapid eye movement stage of sleep. Skin potential rapidly declined from the waking level, continued to decrease in level throughout sleep, increased in variability during REM sleep, and increased in level at the second waking period.

AB  - Long hour polygraphic recordings were repeatedly performed in 19 premature, 8 small for date and 3 full term infants. The recordings were made every week or two after delivery until the time of their calculated date of aerm gestation. No difference is present electroencephalographically among REM sleep, wakefulness and non-REM sleep before 32 weeks of conceptional age. EEG is characterized by burst-suppression pattern. 13-20c/s spindle like fast rhythm with 0.5-1.5 slow waves are characteristically seen in bursts. Difference between REM and non-REM sleep appears for the first time around 32-33 weeks. The latter is characterized by burst-suppression pattern (an immature pattern of tracé alternant). After 34-35 weeks, REM sleep shows low voltage desynchronized pattern with some semirhythmic theta and alpha waves which increase with advancing age. Difference between moderately deep sleep and deep sleep appears for the first time around 36-37 weeks. The former is characterized by increase of slow waves and their amplitudes (slow wave sleep pattern). The latter shows tracé alternapt. 13-20c/s spindle like fast rhythm decreases gradually to disappear around 40 weeks. After 36-37 weeks EEG shows gradual development with increase of activity in each stage. Burst-burst intervals of tracé alternant decrease gradually with advancing age but their modal values are relatively constant throughout various conceptional ages. © 1970, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Es wurde eine operative Technik entwickelt, die über lange Zeit eine wiederholte Blutentnahme aus der V. portae und V. cava caud. am wachen Schaf ohne Erregung erlaubt. Zwölf Stunden nach der letzten Fütterung wurden in zweistündigen Intervallen während 24 Stunden bei einem männlichen und zwei weiblichen Schafen die Insulin‐ und Glukosekonzentrationen im Plasma bzw. Vollblut der V. portae und V. cava caud. bestimmt. Die Insulinkonzentrationen zeigten im Verlauf von 24 Stunden starke Unterschiede (Mittelwerte in der V. portae zwischen 23 ± 10 μE bei Schaf B und 75 ± 17,2 μE bei Schaf C, in der V. cava caud. zwischen 15 ± 6,6 μE bei Schaf B und 64 ± 14,8 μE/ml Plasma bei Schaf C). Die Glukosewerte im Blut beider Gefäße stimmten weitgehend überein und unterlagen nur geringen Schwankungen (Mittelwerte zwischen 46,1 ± 4,5 bei Schaf B und 54,8 ± 3,7 mg/100 ml bei Schaf C). Bei Glukosedoppelbelastungsversuchen zeigte sich bei einem männlichen Schaf (0,5 g Glukose/kg Körpergewicht i. V.) ein synchroner Verlauf der Insulin‐ und Glukosekonzentrationsänderungen. Bei drei weiteren trächtigen Schafen (0,25 g Glukose/kg Körpergewicht) waren entsprechend der geringeren Glukosekonzentration im Blut die Anstiege der Insulinkonzentrationen geringer (besonders bei der Zweitbelastung) und lagen außerdem zeitlich spater als die höchsten Glukosewerte. Permanent catheterisation of the caudal vena cava and portal vein in the sheep for measurement of 24‐hour insulin excretion after glucose administration Part I. A surgical technique was developed which enables repeated blood samples to be taken from the portal vein and caudal vena cava over a long period in the conscious sheep without disturbance. Twelve hours after the last meal, insulin and glucose levels in the plasma and whole blood from the portal vein and the caudal vena cava were measured every two hours over a period of 24 hours in one male and two female sheep. The insulin level showed marked variations over the 24 hours (mean value in the portal vein lying betwenn 23 ± 10 μE for sheep B and 75 ± 17.2 μE for sheep C; in the caudal vena cava values were between 15 ± 6.6 μE for sheep B and 64 ± 14.8 μE/ml in the plasma of sheep C). The glucose values in the blood from both vessels showed close correlation and underwent only small variations (means between 46.1 ± 4.5 for sheep B and 54.8 ± 3.7 mg/100 ml for sheep C). In double glucose tolerance tests on a male sheep (0.5 g glucose/kg body‐weight i.v.) there was a synchronous relationship between the changes in levels of insulin and glucose. In three pregnant sheep (0.25 g glucose/kg bodyweight) the rise in insulin level was less, corresponding to the lower glucose concentration (especially in respect of the second dosage) and also occurred later than the peak of glucose level. Le cathétérisme à demeure de la veine cave inférieure et de la veine porte chez le mouton pour une détermination de la libération d'insuline avec ou sans surcharge de glucose On développe une technique opératoire, qui permet des prises de sang répétées, pendant une période prolongée, dans la veine porte et la veine cave inférieure, sur le mouton éveillé, sans provoquer d'excitation. Douze heures après la dernière ingestion alimentaire, on détermine les concentrations d'insuline et de glucose dans le plasma, resp. le sang complet de la veine porte et de la veine cave inférieure, et ceci toutes les deux heures, pendant 24 heures, chez un mouton mâle et deux femelles. Les concentrations d'insuline subissent de fortes fluctuations dans le cours des 24 heures (valeurs moyennes dans la veine porte entre 23 ± 10 μU chez le mouton B et 75 ± 17,2 μU chez le mouton C, dans la veine cave inférieure entre 15 ± 6,6 μU chez le mouton B et 64 ± 14,8 μU/ml de plasma chez le mouton C. Les valeurs de glucose dans le sang des deux vaisseaux correspondent entre elles et ne manifestent que de faibles variations (valeurs moyennes entre 46,1 ± 4,5 chez le mouton B et 54,8 ± 3,7 mg/100 ml chez le mouton C). Dans des expériences de double surcharge de glucose chez un mouton mâle (0,5 g glucose/kg de poids du corps i. v.), on observe un cours synchrone des variati ons de la concentration de l'insuline et du glucose. Chez trois autres brebis portantes (0,25 g glucose/kg de poids du corps), les augmentations de la concentration de l'insuline sont plus faibles, en corrélation avec la concentration plus faible du glucose dans le sang, (en particulier lors de la deuxième surcharge), et on observe en outre un décalage dans le temps par rapport aux valeurs maximum de glucose. La cateterización permanente de la vena cava caudal y vena porta en la oveja para medir el vertimiento circadiano de insulina y la insulinosecreción tras gravamen glucosado Se desarrolló una técnica operatoria, que permite, a lo largo de un tiempo prolongado, la toma repetida de sangre de la v. porta y de la v. cava caudal en la oveja vigil sin sufrir excitación. Doce horas después de la última alimentación, se valoraron en intervals de dos horas durante 24 horas en un carnero y en dos ovejas las concentraciones de insulina y glucosa en el plasma sanguíneo y en la sangre íntegra, resp., de la v. porta y v. cava caudal. Las concentraciones de insulina mostraban en el transcurso de 24 horas diferencias marcadas (valores medios en la v. porta entre 23 ± 10 μU en la oveja B y 75 ± 17,2 μU en la oveja C, en la v. cava caudal entre 15 ± 6,6 μU en la oveja B y 64 ± 14,8 μU/ml. de plasma sanguíneo en la oveja C). Los valores glucémicos de ambos vasos coincidían a grandes rasgos y solo estaban sometidos a oscilaciones ligeras (valores medios entre 46,1 ± 4,5 en la oveja B y 54,8 ± 3,7 mg./100 ml. en la oveja C). En ensayos de gravamen glucosado doble se vio que un carnero (0,5 g. glucosa/kg. peso en pie i. v.) tenía un curso sincrónico en las variaciones de las concentraciones de insulina y glucosa. En tres ovejas gestantes (0,25 g. glucosa/kg. peso en pie), correspondiendo a la concentración menor de glucosa en sangre, los aumentos de las concentraciones insulínicas eran menores (sobre todo en el gravamen segundo) y además se producían temporalmente después que los valores glucosados máximos. © 1970 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - The placental transfer of pentobarbital and/or metabolites was determined in rats using 14C‐labeled pentobarbital. The level of pentobarbital and/or metabolites in fetal blood was greatly influenced by the circulating level of pentobarbital and/or metabolites in the mother. Of the total pentobarbital and/or metabolites transferred, the percentage of unbound pentobarbital in fetal blood plasma was influenced by the pentobarbital dose level administered to the pregnant rat. A greater percentage of total pentobarbital and/or metabolites was present as unbound pentobarbital in fetal blood plasma than in maternal blood plasma. Chronic administration of pentobarbital during gestation decreased sensitivity to the pharmacological effects of further drug administration to the newborn. The changes induced by pretreatment were not permanent. Copyright © 1970 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - . Male and female kittens and adult cats were given p‐chlorophenylalanine orally. . After treatment, some of the male cats showed mounting behaviour and the kittens and non‐oestrous females showed an increase in treading and rubbing which was similar to one aspect of pro‐oestrus behaviour. . The treated animals also appeared to suffer from skin irritation and showed increased restlessness which accompanied sleep deprivation. . Injection of 5‐hydroxytryptophan stopped abnormal sexual activity and restored normal sleep for about 5 hours. . It is concluded that 5‐hydroxytryptamine‐containing neurones inhibit sexual behaviour in cats and that this role can be seen in male and, to some extent, also in female animals. 1970 British Pharmacological Society

AB  - The ontogeny of responsiveness to repetitive visual stimulation between 32 weeks of conception and 2 years of life was studied in 135 subjects. The effects of flickering light on the EEG was minimal at birth, but it improved conspicuously during waking between 2 and 5 months of age. In the early half of this period the responsiveness to higher and higher flash rates increased abruptly: at the end of this period, significantly longer runs of "driven" rhythm were observed during stimulation, the amplitude of "driven" waves became higher and the interference of photic driving with the waves of the resting EEG began to decline. The sudden increase in number of exogenous fibres and dendritic branching in the cortex, with the subsequent increase in quantity of synaptic connections, in this period, shown by some authors, might be associated with the prominent improvement of photic driving during months 2-5. In sleep, responsiveness in the visual system became better during the last half of the first year after birth. We consider the high intensity of photic stimulation to be the most important factor underlying the relatively marked responsiveness to flicker in the first 2 years of life, compared with the findings of other workers. © 1970.

AB  - Two‐second long square wave tones at frequencies of 125 and 1000 Hz and 75 db sound pressure were presented to six newborn infants. Mean heart rates were computed for the 10 sec prior to and the 10 sec following stimulus onset, i.e. the prestimulus and stimulus heart rate values respectively. LIV was shown to operate strongly only in the case of the 125 Hz stimulus. Even for this stimulus, LIV depended upon the state of the infant, showing an appropriate negative correlation between prestimulus and stimulus values in regular sleep and quiet wakefulness but a slightly positive correlation in irregular sleep. In randomly selected control periods, the first 5 sec served as prestimulus values and the second 5 sec as stimulus values. Regression coefficients for these control periods did not differ significantly from those during which the stimulus was actually present. In view of the special conditions required for its demonstration, the generality of Wilder's “law” seems to be seriously questioned. Copyright © 1970, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Electro‐oculographic recordings were made of the eye‐movements of small groups of normal and of mentally retarded subjects during periods of paradoxical sleep. Normal subjects had longer average duration of paradoxical sleep and differed sharply in that they also registered more eye‐movements. Frequency of eye‐movements did not vary with age in the mentally retarded subjects, whereas in the normal subjects there was noticeably more oculomotor activity between the ages of 6–12 years, the periods when intensive learning occurs. However, there was a dramatic increase in eye‐movements in a group of normal pregnant women, suggesting that there may be reciprocal interactions between endocrine mechanisms and those responsible for learning capacities. Mouvements oculaires pendant le sommeil: critérium commun des capacityés d'apprendre et de l'activité endocrine Des enregistrements électro‐oculographiques ont été faits des mouvements oculaires de petits groupes de sujets normaux et mentalement retardés au cours des périodes de sommeil paradoxal. On a trouvé que la durée moyenne du sommeil paradoxal était plus longue chez les sujets normaux, qui enregistraient aussi plus de mouvements oculaires. La fréquence des mouvements oculaires ne variaient pas selon l'âge chez les sujets mentalement retardés, tandis que chez les sujets normaux il y avait une activité oculo‐motrice notamment plus grande entre les âges de 6 à 12 ans, le temps des périodes d'apprentis‐sage le plus intense. Cependant, il y avait une forte augmentation de mouvements oculaires chez un groupe de femmes normales enceintes, ce qui suggére qu'il puisse exister des interactions réciproques entre les mécanismes endocrines et ceux qui sont responsables des capacityés d'apprendre. Augenbewegungen während des Schlafes: Ein allgemeines Kriterium für Lernkapazitäten und endokrine Aktivität Bei kleinen Gruppen von normalen und von geistig zurückgebliebenen Kindern wurden während der Perioden von paradoxem Schlaf elektro‐oculographische Aufzeichnungen über die Augenbewegungen angefertigt. Man fand, daß die durchschnittliche Dauer des paradoxen Schlafes bei den normalen Kindern länger dauerte und daß sie auch häufigere Augenbewegungen zeigten. Die Häufigkeit der Augenbewegungen änderte sich bei den geistig zurückgebliebenen Kindern mit dem Alter nicht, während sich bei den normalen Kindern zwischen 6 und 12 Jahren, den intensiven Lernperioden, eine deutlich größere oculomotorische Aktivität fand. Allerdings fand sich auch ein dramatischer Anstieg der Augenbewegungen bei einer Gruppe von schwangeren Frauen, woraus zu schließen ist, daß zwischen endokrinen Abläufen und der Steuerung der Lernkapazität eine gegenseitige Einwirkung besteht. Movimientos oculares en el sueño: un criterio común sobre las capacidades de aprendizaje y de actividad endocrina Se realizaron trazados electro‐oculográficos de los movimientos oculares en pequeños grupos de sujetos normales y retrasados mentales en el período de sueño paradógico. Se halló que la duración media del sueño paradógico era més larga en los normales, los cuales registraron también una mayor movilidad ocular. La frecuencia de los movimientos oculares no era variable con la edad en los sujetos con retraso mental, mientras que en los normales se notó una actividad óculomotora mayor entre los 6 y 12 años, en los períodos donde es mas intenso el aprendizaje. Sin embargo habia un aumento intenso de los movimientos oculares en un grupo de mujeres normales gestantes, lo que sugiere que pueden haber interacciones recíprocas entre los mecanismos endocrinos y los responsables de la capacidad de aprender.

AB  - Both the age of the infant and the birthweight in relation to age are relevant factors in studying prenatal and neonatal physiology and in evaluating immediate and future clinical risks to the fetus and the newborn. Since the true age of the infant (the time‐span from conception) is not available, the first day of the last menstrual period is commonly used as the time reference. In many cases, however, there is doubt as to the accuracy of this reference day, necessitating other criteria to indicate the duration of fetal development or of the postmenstrual age of the newborn. The authors discuss the use of pre‐ and postnatal evaluations of the developmental changes in various organ systems‐by physical measurement, observation, physiological registrations and biochemical analysis ‐ for the estimation of the postmenstrual age. They use the following criteria: Does the observable phenomenon change suddenly from absent to present at a particular postmenstrual age? Does the phenomenon remain unaltered in sick children? Is the method relatively easy and reliable? Is the technique without risk for the fetus, the mother and the newborn? At present, a combination of parameters, serially measured, on the developing nervous system and the developmental changes of the skin seem to be most helpful in pre‐ and postnatal life, and the authors report that the optimal accuracy obtainable so far still has a range of plus or minus 2–3 weeks. The reasons for this wide range are discussed. Estimation de & lcar;âge post‐menstruel: vue d'ensemble L'âge de l'enfant et le poids de naissance en fonction de l'âge sont tout deux des facteurs importants dans l'étude de la physiologie prénatale et néo‐natale, dans l'évaluation clinique des risques immédiats et futurs du foetus et du nouveau‐né. Puisque l'âge vrai de l'enfant (durée depuis la conception) ne peut être connu, le premier jour des derniéres régies est pris généralement comme référence. Dans de nombreux cas cependant, on peut douter de la précision de cette référence et d'autres critéres sont néces‐saires pour indiquer la durée du développement foetal ou l'âge post‐menstruel du nouveau‐né. Les auteurs discutent l'emploi de mesures pré et post‐natales de modifications lieés au développement au niveau de certains organes pour la détermination de l'âge post‐menstruel (par mesure physique, observations, enregistrement physiologique et analyse biochimique). lis utilisent les critéres suivants: Le phénoméne observé“passe‐t‐il de l'absence à la présence brusquement à un âge post‐menstruel particulier? Ce phénoméne persiste‐t‐il chez les enfants malades? La méthode est‐elle suffisamment facile et fidéle? La technique est‐elle sans risque pour le foetus, la mére et le nouveau‐né? A l'heure actuelle, une combinaison de paramétres, déterminés sur des séries, au niveau du développement du systéme nerveux et des modifications progressives de la peau semble être la plus utile durant la vie pré ou post‐natale; les auteurs précisent que la précision optimale atteinte jusqu'a ce jour est de plus ou moins deux ou trois semaines. lis discutent les raisons de cette large erreur. Die Schätzung des postmenstruellen Alters: Eine umfassende Synopse Sowohl das Gewicht eines Säuglings als auch das Verhältnis zwischen Geburtsgewicht und Alter sind wichtige Faktoren beim Studium der pränatalen und neonatalen Physiologie und bei der Bestimmung des unmittelbaren und zukünftigen Risikos des Foetus und des Neugeborenen. Da das wahre Alter des Kindes (die Zeit von der Konzeption an) nicht zu erfahren ist, wird im allgemeinen der erste Tag der letzten Menstruationsperiode als Orientierungspunkt gewählt. In vielen Fällen muß man jedoch Zweifel haben an der Genauigkeit dieser Angabe, woraus sich die Notwendigkeit ableitet, andere Kriterien für die Dauer der foetalen Entwicklung oder des postmenstruellen Alters des Neugeborenen zu finden. Die Autoren diskutieren die Verwendung prä‐ und postnataler Ermittlungen der durch die Entwicklung bedingten Veränderungen in verschiedenen Organsystemen–durch physikalische Messung, Beobachtung, physiologische Bestimmungen und biochemische Analysen–für die Bestimmung des postmenstruellen Alters. Sie benützen die folgenden Kriterien: Wechselt das zu beobachtende Phänomen plötzlich von nicht vorhanden zu vorhanden bei einem bestimmten postmenstruellen Alter? Bleibt dieses Phänomen bei kranken Kindern unverändert? Ist die Methode verhältnimäßig einfach und verläßlich? Ist die Technik für den Foetus, die Mutter und das Neugeborene ohne Risiko? Zur Zeit scheint eine Kombination von regelmäßig gemessenen Parametern über die Entwicklung des Nervensystems und die Veränderungen der Haut im prä‐ und postnatalen Leben besonders hilfreich zu sein, und die Autoren berichten, daß die bisher erreichte Genauigkeit immer noch eine Spanne von plus minus zwei bis drei Wochen beträgt. Die Gründe für diese weite Spanne werden diskutiert. Copyright © 1970, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - IN foetuses and newborn animals, the activity of the hepatic enzymes required to metabolize and conjugate drugs is low1-4, apparently because of a defect in enzyme synthesis5, and can be markedly compensated for by treating the newborn animals with various compounds - rats with 3,4-benzpyrene4 and rabbits or mice with phenobarbitone6-8, for example. Administration of these drugs to pregnant animals also increased the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes in the maternal liver4,9, but in most cases8,10,11 exerted little effect on the foetal liver. This indicates the complexities of induced drug metabolism during pregnancy. © 1969 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - A case of recurrent metastatic pheochromocytoma in pregnancy is reported. Localization of the extra-adrenal tumor sites was accomplished by inferior vena caval catheterization with segmental determinations of epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. Profiles of urinary catecholamine excretion in uncomplicated pregnancies are also presented. To assess daily fluctuations in catecholamine excretion, a series of daily determinations of 24 hour urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine were performed in one subject with an uncomplicated pregnancy from the thirty-second week of gestation until delivery. © 1969.

AB  - Cireadian rhythms of urine flow, creatinine, sodium, chloride, potassium, and osmolar excretion were studied in 11 healthy pregnant women. The effects of posture and activity were tested by studying subjects in bed in lateral recumbency, ambulant while normally active, and while awake and upright all night. On recumbency days all measured rhythms were constant from subject to subject with daytime peaks as in nonpregnant individuals. On activity days, however, rhythms of volume and sodium excretion varied: 2 had diurnal peaks of both urine flow and sodium excretion; nocturnal peaks of flow alone occurred in 5; and nocturnal peak of sodium excretion alone in 1 and of both flow and sodium excretion in 3 subjects. These nocturnal peaks did not appear when the same subjects were recumbent all day, nor most of the time in 2 subjects kept awake and upright all night, suggesting that posture plays a major role in their production. © 1969.

AB  - Electroencephalographic records were obtained from unanesthetized freely moving rats with electrodes permanently implanted in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and frontal cortex while the animals were housed in large glass cylinders within a sound-, temperature-, and light-controlled chamber. The EEG records were converted to percentages of alertness, slow-wave sleep, and paradoxical sleep for each 10-min. interval around the clock and analyzed by computer. After ovariectomy, the records showed greater amounts of slow-wave sleep per day largely because of major increases in nighttime slow-wave sleep levels. Furthermore, the circadian pattern of paradoxical sleep was altered by ovariectomy: the daily (24-hour) amounts of paradoxical sleep remained constant but the night-time hours contained more and the daylight hours concomitantly less, almost obscuring the circadian rhythm. Estrogen injections restored the circadian pattern by sharply reducing the amount of paradoxical sleep at night, resulting in significant diminution in total paradoxical sleep per 24 hours. © 1969.

AB  - A modification of the Halász-Pupp neurosurgical knife was used in two groups of female rats to completely or partially (anterior cuts) isolate the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) from adjacent central nervous system. A scries of experiments was performed over a period of approximately 6 months to determine effects on several aspects of pi-tuitary-adrenal and pituitary-ovarian functions. Plasma levels of corticosterone, obtained under a variety of conditions, were used as an indirect index of adrenoeortieotropin (ACTH) secretion. Vaginal smears, ovarian histology, and weights of ovaries and uteri were used to assess gonadotropin sccrction. The most conspicuous effect of complete MBH isolation on the pituitary-adrenal system was elimination of the diurnal peak in nonstress plasma corticosterone levels. Such isolation was compatible with a normal response to 3-min ether stress; the response to immobilization stress was present, though significantly reduced. Dexamethasone administered subcutaneously caused complete suppression of non-stress plasma corticosterone levels in all rats. Interruption of anterior connections of MBH did not measurably influence these aspects of ACTH secretion. Both complete and anterior cuts were associated with abnormal pituitary-ovarian function, but there were differences between the effects of these two procedures. Whereas constant vaginal diestrus and ovarian and uterine atrophy occurred frequently in rats with complete cuts, the persistent vaginal cstrous syndrome was more common in rats with anterior cuts. © 1969 S.

AB  - A series of forty subjects, twenty-eight males and twelve females, with the 4-5 c/sec rhythm is described. This 4-5 c/sec rhythm is characterized by the following: rhythmic 4-5 c/sec waves with amplitudes from 20 to 120 μV, regularly in the occipital and temporal regions; blocked by eye opening; immediately after eye closing there is a short group or a long train of alpha waves, which are then replaced by the 4-5 c/sec rhythm; it can easily be disturbed by acoustic, tactile or visual stimuli; it disappears during drowsiness and sleep and reappears only when the individual is completely awake. The 4-5 c/sec rhythm is a constant personal characteristic; diagnosis becomes possible after the first decade of life. The estimated frequency of trait carriers among the population examined in EEG laboratories is 0.025-0.075%. The trait seems to become rarer with advancing age and there is some indirect evidence that it might disappear some time during adult life. Two pairs of monozygotic twins were observed who showed complete concordance. In four out of forty siblings of propositi, the 4-5 c/sec rhythm was also present, but not in their parents or children. These results may suggest a genetic basis at least in a few, but do not confirm the assumption of a simple Mendelian mode of inheritance. The medical history of some cases raises the question of a possible exogenous causation (phenocopies), but no consistent pattern emerges. Reports pointing to a higher incidence of psychological abnormalities are confirmed. © 1969.

AB  - Two hundreds and thirteen cases of Caesarean section were carried out under general anesthesia. 1. A rapid induction technic with 150-200 mg, thiamyral and 60 mg. succinylcholine chloride given intravenously facilitated the intratracheal intubation. This small dose of thiamyral is sufficient to let the patient sleep, when it is injected rapidly, and the effect on both mother and newborn baby is minimal. No vomit or regurgitation was seen. The rate to get sleepy baby and the extent and duration of depression on newborn were decreased even in the cases of poor condition before surgery. 2. The high flow rate of gas, 7 L. nitrous oxide and 3 L. oxygen at the begining and 5 L. nitrous oxide and 5 L. oxygen prior to the child birth, elevates the alveolar concentration of nitrous oxide quickly to prevent the awareness during surgery in spite of a small dose of thiamyral. 3. The flow rate was decreased to 3 L. nitrous oxide and 1 L. oxygen after parturition. The emergence was quick and complete. No postpartum uterine atony was seen. © 1969, Japanese Society of National Medical Services. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of bodyweight on bioelectrical maturation of the brain was studied by power spectral analysis of the EEG in active (A) and quiet (Q) sleep in 3 groups of newborn infants: full‐term small‐for‐dates infants were compared with pre‐term infants of comparable weight and normal weight full‐term infants, with the following results: The A/Q ratio decreased with increasing conceptional age, being 1–5 at 30 and 0–5‐0‐7 at 40 weeks. The A/Q ratio was similar in infants of equal conceptional ages, regardless of their bodyweights. The A/Q ratios of full‐term infants of normal and subnormal bodyweights differed significantly from those of the pre‐term infants with a mean conceptional age of 35 weeks and bodyweights comparable to the small‐for‐dates group. The most pronounced age differences in the A/Q ratio were in the low frequency range up to 7 5 c./sec. recorded from the fronto‐central region. Maturation bio‐électrique du cerveau chez les enfants de poids à la naissance faible pour le terme L'influence du poids à la naissance sur la maturation bio‐électrique du cerveau a étéétudiée par l'analysedu spectre de puissance de l' EEG dans (A)lesommeilactif et calme (Q) sur trois groupes d'enfants nouveaux‐nés: des nourrissons à terme de poids faible pour le terme ont été compareés avec des nourrissons nés avant‐terme et de poids comparable et des nourrissons nés à terme, avec un poids normal. Les resultats suivants ont été notés: Le rapport A/Q diminue lorsque l'âge conceptionnel augmente; il est de 1–5 à 30 semaines, de 0‐ 5‐0‐7 à 40 semaines. Le rapport A/Q est le mSme chez les nourrissons d'âge conceptionnel egal, sans considération de leur poids. Les rapports A/Q des nourrissons nés a terme, de poids normal et subnormal différent de faclon significative de ceux des nourrissons nés avant‐terme, d'un âge conceptionnel moyen de 35 semaines et d'un poids à la naissance comparable à ceux du groupe nés à terme avec un poids faible pour le terme. Les differences liées à l'âge entre les rapports A/Q sont surtout prononcées sur les basses fréquences, jusqu'a 7‐5 c./sec, enregistrees dans la région fronto‐centrale. Bioelektrische Hirnreifung bei hypotrophen Neugeborenen Der Einfluß des Körpergewichts auf die bioelektrische Hirnreifung wurde mit Hilfe der Frequenzanalyse des Elektroencephalogramms im aktiven (REM) und im ruhigen (Non‐REM) Schlaf an drei Gruppen von Neugeborenen untersucht: Reife, hypotrophe Neuge‐borene wurden verglichen mit Frühgeborenen gleichen Gewichtes und mit normalge‐wichtigen Neugeborenen gleichen Gestationsalters: Das Verhältnis der biolektrischen Energie in den beiden Schlafstadien aktiv/ruhig (A/Q‐Quotient) nahm mit zunehmendem Konzeptionsalter ab. Es betrug 1,5 mit 30 und 0,5‐0,7 mit 40 Wochen Konzeptionsalter. Der A/Q‐Quotient war gleich bei Kindern gleichen Konzeptionsalters und unabhängig von ihrem Körpergewicht. Die A/Q‐Quotienten sowohl der normal‐ als auch der untergewichtigen reifen Neugeborenen waren signifikant verschieden von denen der Frühgeborenen mit einem mittleren Konzeptionsalter von 35 Wochen und mit Körpergewichten, die denen der hypotrophen reifen Neugeborenen vergleichbar waren. Die ausgeprägtesten Altersunterschiede für den A/Q‐Quotient fanden wir im Frequenzbereich bis zu 7,5 c./sec. über den Frontozentralregionen. Maduracion cerebral bioelectrica en lactantes pequeños para la duración de la gestación Se estudió la influencia del peso corporal en la maduración eléctrica del cerebro por medio de espectroanálisis mecánica de los electroencefalogramas en sueño activo (A) y sueño tranquilo (T) en 3 grupos de recién nacidos: lactantes nacidos a término pero pequeños para la duratión de la gestación fueron comparados con lactantes prematuros de peso parecido y con niños nacidos a término y de peso normal, con los resultados siguientes: La proporción A/T caiAa a medida que la edad desde el día de concepción aumentaba, siendo 1.5 a 30 semanas y 0.5‐0.7 e 40 semanas. La proporción A/T era semejante en niños de la misma edad desde el día de conceptión a pesar de diferencias del peso corporal. Las proporciones A/T de niños nacidos a término de peso corporal normal o subnormal se diferenciaban significantemente de las de los niños prematuros cuya edad media desde el día de concepción era 35 semanas y cuyos pesos corporales se parecían a los del grupo de niños pequenós para la duratión de la gestateón. Las diferencias de edad máa notables en la proporción A/T eran en la banda de baja frecuencia hasta 7.5 c./seg. registrada desde la zona frontocentral. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - CIRCADIAN rhythms1-3 have not yet been investigated in twins. The mathematical methods used in one-phase examinations of twins - variance analysis4,5, cross-twin analysis or intra-subject correlation - are not suitable for expressing the concordance or discordance of a certain biological phenomenon in time between the individuals of separate twin pairs. We have therefore tried to devise a method of our own, suitable both for the basal physiological research of medical genetics, and for the study of biological rhythms, for example, in human biometeorology. © 1968 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - 1. Pathological changes are revealed by the EEG as early as in the premature and newborn baby. 2. The following EEG-changes were recorded in premature infants indicating pathological electrical activities: 1. Abnormally low voltage; 2. Abnormally high voltage; 3. Steep as well as spiked activities, spike potentials; 4. Differences of amplitude and frequency between right and left; 5. Altered sleep formations, the sleep formations first becoming detectable at the age of 8 months; 6. Altered and delayed evoked potentials. 3. EEG-changes in newborns indicating pathological electrical activities: 1. Abnormally low voltage; 2. Abnormally high voltage; 3. Abnormally rhythmic activity; 4. Steep and spiked potentials, spike potentials; 5. Pathological formations during wakefulness; 6. Abnormally high and steep sleep formations; 7. Both unilateral or unilaterally prevailing alterations or unusual voltage differences even of normal cortical activities. 4. The validity of these criteria is illustrated in six exemplary cases. Results are taken from follow-up examinations representing part of a prospective study initiated by Janzen, Schroeder, and Heckel between 1950 and 1952. Six newborns were selected, the result of normal pregnancies and deliveries, the infants appearing healthy upon birth. However, these six children were found to have pathological EEGs according to the above criteria when examined routinely. Only one of the infants whose present ages are ranging from 8 to 12 years, has remained clinically inconspicuous while in the EEG a localized alteration has persisted. The further development of this child remains to be seen. The other five children, in addition to their EEG-findings, became known for constitutional, psychic or neurological abnormalities. © 1968 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The present investigation provides an accurate description of the EEG sleep pattern characteristics of late pregnancy and early postpartum periods and compares this with age-matched controls. The over-all sleep pattern observed in gestation seemed similar in some respects to insomnia and was characterized by a longer sleep latency, frequent awakenings, shorter sleep time, and a marked reduction of deep sleep (Stage 4). In addition, immediately after delivery, there was a suppression of the dreaming (Stage 1-REM) sleep. By the second postpartum week, these profound sleep changes tended to normalize. Mechanisms of these findings and their possible relationship to postpartum emotional disturbances are discussed. © 1968.

AB  - Fetal membranes grafted to the omentum in mice do not degenerate at a time corresponding to the normal termination of the donor pregnancy, as would be expected if a “biological clock” were matching their lifespan with that of the embryo and placenta. Neither, in our experience, did such grafted membranes form a variety of highly differentiated secondary tissues, as some authors have suggested. Rather, the fate of the various components of the membrane seemed different for each cell type. In allogeneic hosts a brisk cellular reaction occurred and the membranes were destroyed. In isogeneic hosts, the grafts was vascularized and healthy membrane‐derived structures were still present after 33 days of grafting (48 days conceptual age). Mesothelial cells remained applied to well‐preserved basement membrane, whereas visceral endoderm cells appeared to degenerate or else detach themselves and become free rounded cells with foamy cytoplasm, sometimes multinucleated. Mesodermal cells accompanying the blood vessels of the membrane probably accounted for the connective tissue stroma seen in these grafts. The normal failure of the fetal membranes to persist in situ after the termination of pregnancy may result from the resistance of the uterine lumen to grafts not having highly invasive properties, together with the general sloughing of the uterine lining which takes place after delivery.

AB  - Continuous EEG records from chronically implanted cerebral electrodes have been made of sleep-wakefulness in 5 female rats throughout their 4-day or 5-day estrous cycles, under controlled lighting conditions with 14 h light and 10 h darkness per day. Percentages of alertness, slow wave sleep (SS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) in each 10-min period were punched on IBM cards and introduced to a computer system capable of plotting these percentages daily in each rat and averaging across animals for each time period on corresponding days of the estrous cycle. The results reveal rapid shifts from relative alertness to sleep after the lights come on in the morning. Highest levels of alertness generally occur during the early evening and PS during the afternoon, including the afternoon of proestrus. The day of vaginal cornification ('estrus') shows a high percentage of PS - after a night characterized by alertness and virtual absence of PS, i.e., the night of behavioral estrus and ovulation. The female rat, like the male, sleeps on the average about two-thirds of the daylight hours and only one-third of the dark period. Hormonal changes during the day of proestrus appear to increase alertness that night, compensated by an increase in sleep, especially PS, the following day. © 1968.

AB  - In verschiedenen Wildgattern und in einem Großgehege (Lainzer Tiergarten) wurde das Brutfürsorge‐ und Brutpflegeverhalten, die Ontogenese des Verhaltens sowie die Aktivitätsperiodik des Europäischen Wildschweines untersucht. Grundeinheit der sozialen Organisation ist die Mutterfamilie. Mehrere Mutterfamilien vereinigen sich zu größeren Familienverbänden. Zu Beginn der Wurfzeit sondern sich die beschlagenen Bachen von den Gruppen ab. Die Bachen bringen ihre Frischlinge in Wurfnestern zur Welt. Sie haben durchschnittlich 5 Jungtiere pro Wurf. Neben den Wurfnestern werden Ruhe‐ oder Schlafnester angelegt. Die Bachen gebären und säugen ihre Frischlinge in Seitenlage, was für die Nesthocker typisch ist. In den ersten Tagen nach der Geburt bleiben die Muttertiere mit ihren Jungen im Wurfnest. Die Bindung an das Nest vermindert sich danach allmählich. Die wichtigste Mutter‐Kind‐Beziehung sind das Saugen und der Nasenkontakt zwischen den Frischlingen und der Bache. Der Saugakt gliedert sich in Vormassage, Milchfluß und Nachmassage. Den Jungen fehlen die für die Nesthocker typischen Suchautomatismen; sie finden die Zitzen mit einem “oralen Einstellmechanismus”. Das Saugen ist ein Lecksaugen. Die Entwicklung der Verhaltensweisen in den verschiedenen Funktionskreisen wird beschrieben. Außer dem Wälzen und dem Suhlen sind alle Verhaltenselemente bereits in den ersten Tagen nach der Geburt entwikkelt oder reifen bald heran. Selbst das Paarungsverhalten und die Grundelemente des Nestbauverhaltens laufen bei wenige Tage alten Tieren voll koordiniert ab. Die Entwicklung des Kampfverhaltens durchläuft verschiedene Phasen. Die Verhaltensweisen des Fußstemmens und des Totschüttelns, die dem Funktionskreis der Nahrungsaufnahme angehören, sowie das Gähnen und Schütteln im Sitzen sind formal mit denen der Raubtiere zu vergleichen. Wildschweine sind in störungsfreien Gebieten vorwiegend tagaktiv. Ruheund Aktivitätsphase sind klar getrennt. Der entscheidende Zeitgeber dürfte der Licht‐Dunkel‐Wechsel sein. Der Übergang von der Ruhe zur Aktivität und umgekehrt vollzieht sich in verschiedenen Stufen, denen typische Verhaltensweisen zugeordnet sind. 1968 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity is increased during pregnancy. This study confirms the clinical impression that oral contraceptive hormones may increase NAP. Eighty-four healthy female subjects receiving any one of four commonly prescribed oral contraceptive hormone preparations demonstrated a mean increase of approximately three times values determined in 61 control subjects. Peak levels were noted during the final week of the menstrual cycle. The NAP returned to normal during the first week of the subsequent menstrual cycle. Oral administration of either of the constituents of a selected oral contraceptive (mestranol, 0.1 mg, or norethindrone, 2 mg daily) for 20 consecutive days also significantly increased NAP over control levels. The diagnostic usefulness of the NAP reaction in clinical medicine may be minimized as more of the general female population use oral contraceptive hormones. © 1968, American Medical Association.

AB  - A systematic study was made of the cardiac conduction system in babies dying suddenly and unexpectedly and in whom careful necropsy had provided no explanation. Forty such hearts were compared with 16 hearts from babies of the same age range, but who had died of known causes, and with the hearts from five stillbirths at term and 1 five month fetus. An unusual histologic process involved the A-V node and His bundle of 56 of the 62 hearts, including all the hearts in the sudden unexplained deaths as well as all the deaths of known cause; the only hearts not showing this change were those of the stillbirths and the fetus. Adult human hearts do not show this change. The histologic process consisted of a resorptive degeneration involving the left portion of the His bundle and the left margin of the A-V node. There was no associated inflammation or significant hemorrhage, but only focal degeneration of conduction tissue cells which were being removed by macrophages and replaced with collagen by young fibroblasts. This molding and shaping process apparently begins at about the time of birth and may be initiated in part by the normal postnatal hemodynamic changes leading to increased physical stress on the central fibrous body and the septal attachments of the atrioventricular valves. However, there must be additional controlling factors (e.g., chemical reactions at the interface between cells of conduction tissue and fibroblasts). The molding process (which distinctly includes cell death) proceeds focally rather than diffusely. It probably has periodic acceleration of activity and must ordinarily be completed within the first year or two of life since it is not normally found in the hearts of older subjects. When one is dealing with critically important structures such as the A-V node and His bundle, which are only millimeters in maximal dimensions, then the presence of any histologic lesion becomes functionally significant. One can neither ignore small lesions nor attach significance only in direct relation to their size. Because the degenerating cells may be anticipated to behave electrophysiologically in a different fashion from normal cells, it is suggested that focal malfunction of the A-V node and His bundle may develop periodically. Presence of the focal resorptive degeneration in all the postnatal hearts, both of "controls" and of sudden unexplained deaths, suggests this is a ubiquitous postnatal process. It is postulated that lethal arrhythmias or conduction disturbances due in large part to the consequences of developmental histologic changes in these critical regions of the heart may be the final common pathway in crib deaths. Many otherwise innocuous or less serious problems in babies may act as triggering mechanisms. Today, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are rarely lethal when properly treated, particularly when the general myocardium is as conspicuously normal as it was in the present study, but such treatment requires anticipation of the event and prompt diagnosis when it occurs. With these considerations, crib death may be a potentially reversible phenomenon. © 1968.

AB  - Inbred mice (C3H1) have been studied in regard to estrus cycle length and efficiency of reproduction in 24 hour (L12:D12) days and 28 hour (L14:D14) days. Early results indicate an increased scatter of cycle lengths and an increase in longer cycles in the 28 hour day. Reproduction is affected by an increase in maternal cannibalism, which may be due to birth at an unphysiologic hour in mice not as yet adapted to a 28 hour day. Length of gestation and litter size are not strikingly affected. It is not yet known whether or when C3H1 mice can synchronize with an L14:D14 regimen, but there is evidence of such adaptation in later litters. © 1967.

AB  - Urinary concentration levels and total amounts excreted of both free and conjugated 17-hydroxy-cortico-steroid (17-OHCS) were estimated in 10 normal non-pregnant women, in six healthy women in late pregnancy and in six pre-eclamptics. Urine was collected at 4-hourly intervals throughout the 24 hours. There was no significant difference between normal pregnant women and pre-eclamptic patients with regard to the total amounts excreted, their concentration and the ratio between the two fractions. Concentration and ratio changed little during the day. The total amounts excreted showed a maximum in the later part of the morning and a minimum just before mid-night, but this diurnal variation was less marked in both groups of pregnant women, compared with the non-pregnant controls. © 1967 S.

AB  - An attempt was made to evaluate the possibility of a humoral, rather than neural, mediation of the epiphenomena of REM sleep. The exclusively systemic communication between a mother and her fetus provided a readily available preparation for an initial approach to this problem. With reference to the sleep of newborn infants, it was assumed that periods of active motility in the fetus of a sleeping mother reflected the occurrence of REM sleep in this organism. Maternal sleep was monitored by standard recording procedures, and fetal sleep was inferred from recordings of intrauterine activity. The following results were obtained from comparisons of all-night sleep records of the mother-fetus unit: (a) The fetus tends to develop a recurrent quiet-active cycle in the course of gestation. (b) Specific instances of high fetal activity frequently occur together with or in close proximity to the recurrent episodes of REM sleep in the mother. Such increases, when they occur, appear to be related to the appearance of maternal REM sleep; however, they are not a systematic feature of this sleep phase. (c) A number of potential mechanisms for a dynamic humoral communication between the two physiological units during REM sleep are discussed. © 1967.

AB  - Consecutive nocturnal recordings in pregnant women have shown: 1. (1) The percentage of P.S. increased during the final 2 months of pregnancy and reached proportions comparable to those found in new-born children of the same gestational age. 2. (2) Stage 4 disappeared between the 4th and 6th month of pregnancy. 3. (3) Quiet sleep was associated with a stage 2 or 3 characterized by periodic outbursts of slow waves similar to stages b and c of premature and new-born children. 4. (4) During stages 2 and 3 some ocular movements occurred. 5. (5) Foetal movements were more numerous during P.S. and awakening but less frequent during quiet sleep. 6. (6) Delay from sleep-onset until the first P.S. decreased when P.S. increased and stage 4 disappeared. 7. (7) During the first two weeks after delivery, the mother's sleep pattern retains the characteristics found during the final month of pregnancy, and at 2 months the percentage of P.S. reached again its normal value although it still remained labile. © 1967.

AB  - Suggestions that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is ontogenetically primitive and observations of the behaviour of premature infants led to an attempt to trace the development of sleep in human infants from the premature period to three months after the expected date of delivery. Three sleep states were established, Quiet Sleep, Active Sleep (REM sleep), and Transitional Sleep, for the categorization of each 20 second interval of sleep during lengthy electroence‐phalographic and polygraphic recordings. Criteria regarding observed movements, eye movements, respiratory pattern, heart rate, chin electromyogram, and the EEG were used for a visual analysis of the tracings, with the specification that only four of the six criteria had to be met for classification of a 20 second interval as one sleep state or another. A second analysis, by means of computer sorting, was more rigid in that each 20 second interval had to meet all three criteria regarding observed movement, respiratory pattern, and eye movements. The other criteria were omitted. The second stricter analysis yielded a greater percentage of intervals that could not be called Active or Quiet Sleep and were, therefore, classified as Transitional Sleep, especially below 35 weeks gestational age. This finding/supports the concept that the sleep states of the more premature infants are less well defined and that the simultaneous occurrence of all the necessary criteria, particularly in Active 5jileep, is rarer than at later ages. Both analyses showed that the amount of Quiet Sleep increases as the infant matures, from 10 per cent at 31–32 weeks gestational age to roughly 50 per cent at 3 months past term. Conversely, Active Sleep decreases with maturation, the exact amount depending on the method of categorization. When the records were analysed visually, Active Sleep was found to constitute 68 per cent of the total sleep at 33–34 weeks gestational age and diminished to 36 per cent at 3 months; with computer sorting the comparable figures were 45 per cent and 25 per cent. Nevertheless, the figures for premature infants at term and 3 months were similar to those for full‐term infants at the same ages. The ill‐defined nature of the Active Sleep state in the early gestational ages and its subsequent delineation and diminution in amount amplify previous characterizations of this sleep state as a neurophysiologically primitive state and predecessor of the later stage during which dreaming occurs. EAtats de sommeil chez les prématurés On a suggéré que le sommeil avec mouvements rapides des yeux (REM) est primitif ontogénétiquement; ceci, ajoutéà des observations du comportement des prématurés, nous a amenéà tenter de tracer le développement du sommeil chez les nouveaux‐nés humains depuis la période prématurée jusqu'à trois mois après la date prévue de l'accouchement. Trois états de sommeil ont étéétablis: Sommeil Tranquille, Sommeil Actif (Sommeil REM), et Sommeil Transitoire; pour la caractérisation de chacun d'entre eux on a étudié des intervalles de 20 secondes de sommeil pendant de longs enregistrements électroencépha‐lographiques et polygraphiques. Les critères concernant les mouvements observés, schéma respiratoire, vitesse du coeur, électromyogramme du menton et électroencéphalogramme ont été utilisés pour une analyse visuelle des courbes, en spécifiant que la rencontre de quatre des six critères suffisait pour la classification d'un intervalle de 20 secondes dans un état de sommeil ou un autre. Une seconde analyse, au moyen d'un computeur, a été plus rigoureuse du fait que chaque intervalle de 20 secondes devait satisfaire chacun des trois critères concernant les mouvements observés, schéma respiratoire et mouvements des yeux. Les autres critères avaient été supprimés. La seconde analyse, plus stricte, a fourni un pourcentage plus élevé d'intervalles qui ne pouvaient être appelés ni Sommeil Actif ni Sommeil Tranquille, et qui, par conséquent, ont été classés comme Sommeil Transitoire, en particulier au dessous de 35 semaines d'âge de gestation. Ces résultats viennent à l'appui du concept selon lequel les états de sommeil des plus prématurés sont moins bien dé nis et que l'occurrence simultanée de tous les critères nécessaires, particulièrement dans le Sommeil Actif, est plus rare qu'à un âge plus élevé. Les deux analyses ont montré que la quantité de Sommeil Tranquille augmente à mesure que l'enfant mûrit, de 10 pour cent à 31–32 semaines de gestation jusqu'à environ 50 pour cent à trois mois après terme. Au contraire, le Sommeil Actif diminue avec la maturation, sa quantité exacte dépendant de la méthode de caractérisation. Lorsque les enregistrements étaient analysés visuellement, le Sommeil Actif constituait 68 pour cent du sommeil total à 33–34 semaines d'âge gestationnel et diminuait jusqu'à 36 pour cent à trois mois; l'analyse par computeur donnait comme chiffres correspondants 45 pour cent et 25 pour cent. Tout de même, les chiffres pour les enfants prématurés à terme et à trois mois étaient similaires à ceux concernant les enfants nés à terme aux mêmes âges. La nature mal définie du Sommeil Actif dans les premiers âges gestationnels, ensuite son esquisse et sa diminution en quantité amplifient les caractérisations précédentes de cet état de sommeil comme un état neurophysiologiquement primitif et le prédécesseur de cet état plus avancé de sommeil pendant lequel les rèves se forment. Schlafzustände bei Frühgeborenen In der Literatur auftréténde Hinweise dass Schlaf mit rapider Augenbewegung (REM) ontogenetisch primitiv ist, sowohl als auch Beobachtungen des Benehmens frügeborener Kinder, führten zu einem Versuch, die Entwicklung des Schlafes bei Kindern zu verfolgen, von der Frühgeburtsperiode bis zu drei Monaten nach dem erwartétén Niederkunfts‐Datum. Drei Schlafzustände wurden festgestellt, Ruhiger Schlaf, Aktiver Schlaf (REM‐Schlaf) und Übergangs‐Schlaf, bei der Kategorisierungjedes 20‐Sekunden‐lntervalls im Schlaf während langdauernder elektro‐enzephalographischer und polygraphischer Aufnahmen. Kriterien im Hinblick auf beobachtété Bewegungen, Augenbewegungen, Atem‐Rhythmus, Herz‐Geschwindigkeit, Kinn‐Elektromyogramm und Elektro‐Enzephalogramm wurden bei einer visuellen Analyse der Aufnahmen verwendet, mit der Spezifikation dass nur vier der sechs Kriterien vorhanden sein mussten, um einen 20‐Sekunden‐Intervall als den einen oder anderen Schlafzustand zu klassifizieren. Eine zweite Analyse, bei der Rechenmáschinen verwendet wurden, war strenger insofern als jeder 20‐Sekunden‐Intervall alle drei Kriterien im Hinblick auf beobachtété Bewegungen, Atem‐Rhythmus und Augenbewegungen aufweisen musste. Die anderen Kriterien wurden nicht beachtet. Die zweite, strengere Analyse ergab einen höheren Prozentsatz von Intervallen die weder Aktiver noch Ruhiger Schlaf gennant werden konnten, und die deshalb als Übergangs‐Schlaf klassifiziert wurden, besonders bei einem Schwangerschafts‐Alter von weniger als 35 Wochen. Dieser Befund unterstützt die Auffassung dass die Schlafzustände der früherge‐borenen Kinder nicht so bestimmbar sind, und dass das gleichzeitige Auftreten all der notwendigen Kriterien, besonders bei dem Aktiven Schlaf, seltener ist als bei späteren Altersstufen. Beide Analysen zeigten dass der Ruhige Schlaf zunimmt bei zunehmender Reife des Kindes, von 10 Prozent bei einem Schwangerschafts‐Alter von 31–32 Wochen bis zu ungefähr 50 Prozent bei einem Alter von 3 Monaten nach der vorhergesehenen Niederkunft. Andererseits nimmt der Aktive Schlaf mit der Maturation ab, wobei die Vergleichsziffern von der Methode der Kategorisierung abhängen. Bei visueller Analyse des Untersuchungs‐materials fand man dass der Aktive Schlaf beim Schwangerschafts‐Alter von 33–34 Wochen 68 Prozent des totalen Schlafes ausmacht und sich bei 3 Monaten auf 36 Prozent verringert hat; bei Anwendung der Rechenmaschine waren die entsprechenden Zahlen 45 Prozent und 25 Prozent. Doch waren die Zahlen für Frühgeborene im Geburtsalter und im Alter von 3 Monaten ähnlich denen für normalgeborene Kinder derselben Altersstufen. Estados de sueño en niños prematuros Sugestiones de que un sueño en que los ojos mueven rápidamente es ontogenéticamente primitivo, así como observaciones del comportamiento de niños prematuros, motivaron una tentativa de trazar la evolución del sueño de los infantes humanos desde el período prematura hasta tres meses después de la fecha cuando se había esperado el parto. Se establecieron tres estados de sueño; sueño tranquilo, sueño activo (en el que los ojos mueven rápidamente), y sueño transicional, para clasificar cada período de sueño de 20 segundos durante registros electroencefalográficos y poligráficos prolongados. Se usaban criterios tocante a movimientos observados, movimientos de los ojos, tipo de respiración, velocidad de latir el corazón, electromiograma del mentón, y el EEG para hacer una análisis visual de los trazados, especificando que solamente había que satisfacer cuatro de los seis criterios para clasificar un período de 20 segundos como cierto estado de sueño o como otro. Una segunda análisis, que consistió en una clasificación por calculadora, fue más rígida puesto que cada período de 20 segundos tuvo que satisfacer todos los tres criterios tocante a movimientos observados, tipo de respiración, y movimientos de los ojos. Se omitieron los otros criterios. La segunda análisis, más rigurosa, reveló un porcentaje mayor de intervalos que no podían clasificarse como sueño tranquilo ni como sueño activo y por eso se clasificaron como sueño transicional, sobre todo en niños menores de 35 semanas de edad gestacional. Este hallazgo apoya el concepto que los estados de sueño de los niños más prematuros son menos bien definidos, y que la ocurrencia simultánea de todos los criterios necesarios, sobre todo en el sueño activo, es más rara que en los infantes mayores. Ambas análisis mostraron que la cantidad de sueño tranquilo crece a medida que el niño madura, desde el 10 por ciento a la edad gestacional de 31–32 semanas hasta el 50 por ciento aproximadamente a los tres meses después de término. El sueño activo, en cambio, se disminuye a medida que el niño madura, con una rapidez que varía un poco según el método de categorizatión. Según un análisis visual de los registros, el sueño activo com‐prendía un 68 por ciento del sueño total a la edad gestacional de 33–34 semanas, pero solamente un 36 por ciento a los tres meses. Según un análisis por calculadora, las cifras eran un 45 por ciento y un 25 por ciento. De todos modos, las cifras para niños prematuros, a término y a los tres meses, eran semejantes a las para niños nacidos a término, a las mismas edades. El carácter mal definido del estado de sueño activo a las edades gestacionales menores, así como su delineatión y diminutión en cantidad subsiguientes, apoyan caracterizaciones anteriores de este estado de sueño como tipo primitivo del punto de vista neurofisiológico, y como antecesor del tipo de dormir que se ve más tarde, en el cual ocurren sueños.

AB  - Recently weaned rats developed cataracts within 10 weeks after being given a diet containing 15 ppm of busulfan (1,4-dimethanesulfonoxybutane). However, when the drug was introduced at 90 days of age for 21 weeks, cataracts did not develop until after some additional 9-18 weeks on a drug-free diet. Rats exhibiting toxic symptoms produced by busulfan had prolonged hexobarbital sleeping times and, for a few, the combination was even lethal. busulfan likewise interfered with reproduction at this dosage by reducing the number of pups in litters, increasing fatalities in female parents, and probably interfering with sperm formation in the males. © 1967.

AB  - The reproductive cycle in G. s. moholi is described and reference is made to as many other studies on this species as possible. In the southern hemisphere G. s. moholi comes into estrous twice a year between March and August, the second estrous being an immediate post-partum estrous, and produces twins twice a year between July and January. The gestation period is 122 to 125 days in both primiparous and multiparous females and irrespective of whether a single infant or twins are born. Infants at birth normally weigh between 8 and 13 g. Comparisons with two other sub-species indicate quite large differences between these and G. s. moholi in respect of length of gestation, incidence of twinning, birth weight and incidence of postpartum estrous. Courtship and mating behaviour in three pairs of animals is described. Irrespective of the social conditions, i.e., the presence of other males, females or young, and whether the estrous female is nulliparous or multiparous, courtship and mating is stereotyped and perfunctory. Two parturitions in a multiparous female and one in a primiparous female are fully described. The pattern of parturition indicates three distinct stages. The first stage is characterised by intense activity in jumping about the cage from one nest box to the other, carrying nesting material in the mouth and manipulating this with hands and mouth hut without any nest resulting. There is minimum interaction with other animals. The onset of daylight in the middle of this activity has no effect in decreasing activity. The second stage begins as the first stage subsides. The female joins the other animuls who have retired to the nest box to sleep and begins intense self- and other-grooming activity. Though there is no jumping around or carrying of nesting materia), the female is extremely restless. Grooming activity increases in frequency; the female is unable to settle down, changes her position frequently anil disturbs the other animals. During this stage she examines her genitals for the first time. The restlessness at this stage is probably due to an increase in the frequency and duration of uterine contraction* the incidence of which is not otherwise apparent at any particular time. During the latter part of the first stage and during the second stage the female neither cats nor drinks. The activities! of the second stage gradually subside. The third stage begins with the delivery of the first infant and U heralded by a short period of intense genital grooming. Delivery of the Gist infant takes about 30 s. From this time on the female's behaviour is directed towards grooming, carrying and handling the infant and frequent examination of her genitals. This pattern of activity continues following subsequent deliveries. None of the other animals interferes with or assists in any way in delivery. Within one or two hours following the last delivery, during which time the afterbirth is consumed, activity gradually declines and the mother settles down with the infants under her in one of the nest boxes. The other animals, disturbed by the mother's activities, settle down in the otheT nest box. Soon after birth infants move vigorously about and can grip the mother's fur with hands and feet. Their activity is directed towards maintaining close bodily contact with the mother. In this they receive a minimum of assintence from the mother und survival must depend to a large extent on the infant itself. Initial observations of maternal behaviour following female P's 4th confinement are briefly reported up to the time of the death of the second twin 12 days after birth. These observations suggest that the mother, distracted by the presence of two older infants, approximately seven weeks of age, neglected her own infants and directed her maternal activities to the older infants. This in turn suggests that in the natural habitat the mother nests separately from other mothers with young and this, together with the fact that the animals occupy a larger living space, minimises the risk of-encountering distracting influences and ensures that maternal behaviour will be directed entirely towards her own infants. © 1967 S.

AB  - Wheel-running and direct observation of animals in their home cages were used to measure the activity of golden hamsters through the oestrous cycle, pregnancy and pseudopregnancy. Both methods showed that the pro-oestrous and oestrous days of the cycle were days of increased activity. Levels of hweel-running fell immediately after copulation and were low throughout pregnancy and pseudopregnancy. Except for bar-chewing, categories of behaviour scored in the home cages did not show a comparable decline. Nest-building increased during pregnancy. Sleeping was reduced on days 5 and 10 of pregnancy. The differences between the two methods of recording activity are discussed, as are the physiological bases of the changes in behaviour. © 1966.

AB  - Minimal rates Of O2 consumption were measured in 115 premature and term babies, usually at several different ages, making a total of over 350 measurements. The changes in minimal rates Of O2 consumption with age, length of gestation, size, and clinical condition are reported, and some of the factors affecting these rates examined in more detail. All babies have a minimal rate Of O2 consumption of about 4.6 ml./kg. min. in the first hours of life. Thereafter, there is a rise in rate, but the magnitude and timing of the rise vary. In babies of more than 36 weeks' gestation the rise occurs within 24 hours. In 'small for dates' babies the rise occurs at the 3rd to 4th day, after which many such babies have high rates Of O2 consumption. In premature babies the rise occurs more gradually over a period of days or weeks. Body temperature, depth of sleep, hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, and hypothyroidism all affect minimal rates of O 2 consumption.

AB  - 1. 1. The CSFP elevation in response to a uterine contraction is predictable and consistent. It is associated with an increase in central venous pressure, ABP, stroke volume, and cardiac output. 2. 2. The maternal circulatory system serves as "transducer" which readily transmits the pressure change to the CSFP even in the presence of sleep and total sensory blockade. 3. 3. Respiratory cycle changes in CSFP demonstrate the rapidity with which changes in intrathoracic venous pressure can be communicated to the central nervous system. The Valsalva maneuver produces an exaggerated respiratory response. 4. 4. This study does not support the theory that the injection of a spinal anesthetic should be delayed during a uterine contraction because of turbulence of the cerebrospinal fluid. © 1965.

AB  - An apparatus which automatically records blood pressure at 2-minute intervals in babies is described. The fluctuations and rhythms in a baby's blood pressure are demonstrated. Although there is no circadian rhythm in babies, there is a rhythm related to feeds. Feeding itself causes a large rise in blood pressure and the reasons for this rise are analysed. Direct arterial blood pressure readings from a number of babies are reported and analysed according to weight, gestation, and clinical condition. In 'small for dates' babies, the blood pressure is more closely related to the size of the baby than to his gestational age. The efficiency of external cardiac massage in producing a pulse pressure is demonstrated. The general contention that vasomotor regulatory mechanisms are functioning in babies is supported.

AB  - General anesthesia was employed for 123 cesarean sections (including two twin deliveries) during a period of six years and two months from January 1958 through February 1964. Two main anesthetic procedures were used. The first method used for 93 cesarean sections from 1958 through 1963 was as follows: the patients premedicated with oral barbiturates, intramuscularr pethidine and phenothiazine derivatives, were administered with cyclopropaneoxygen gas mixture through a mask during the early period of operations; following fetal deliveries, endotracheal tube was inserted with an aid of intravenous thiopenthal and succinyichaline, then anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide-oxygen gas mixture. The second method employedd for 30 sections from 1963, was consisted of: (1) premeditation with 0.5mg. of atropine sulfate; (2) intubation following i. v. thiopenthal (a sleep dose) and succinylcholine (40~80mg.); (3) maintainance of anesthesia with nitrous oxide-oxygen gas mixture (if fetal distress presents, only pure oxygen was administered until ligation of the umbilical cord); and (4) additional i. v. thiopenthal and succinylcholine following neonatal deliveriesa No maternal deaths were associated with these procedures. Maternal blood pressure could be maintained relatively high during these procedures, especially in the second method. Eight perinatal deaths (3.3%), including 3 intrauterine deaths prior to the operations, were observed in 95 babies delivered with the first method of anesthesia, while only one postnatal death (3.3%)was seen among 30 neonates with the second method. None of these deaths were primarily attributed to the anesthetic procedures. Asphyxia or retardation in the initial respiration was observed in 18 (18.9%) of the first group and in 6 (20.0%)of the second group. In 10 cases of the second group, fetal EKG were recorded through the abdominal leads, and found to demonstrate no remarkable changes during these anesthetic procedures. © 1965, Japanese Society of National Medical Services.

AB  - 1. 1. Pentobarbital disappears from the blood of pregnant rats relatively more slowly than from the blood of nonpregnant females. From the eighth through the twelfth hour after injection the blood level remains significantly higher in the pregnant animal. 2. 2. Brain levels remain significantly higher in the pregnant rat from the sixth hour. Two to 4 hours after injection fetal brain levels are 90 per cent of maternal values and up to 12 hours fetal levels remain approximately 75 per cent of that of the mother. 3. 3. Similarly, the drug level remains higher in the liver of the pregnant rat than in the nonpregnant rat. Fetal liver has a slightly higher affinity for barbiturate than does the fetal brain. It is doubtful, however, that the fetal rat liver contains enzymes capable of detoxifying the drug. 4. 4. Pentobarbital is also present in small amounts in amniotic fluid, but its disappearance from this site is slower than from the fetal tissues. 5. 5. Thus, when the nonpregnant female is given drug, the brunt of detoxification falls upon the liver at once. The respiratory, circulatory, and temperature regulatory mechanisms are severely depressed until detoxification is achieved within a few hours, and the drugged rat awakens relatively early. 6. 6. In the pregnant rat, on the other hand, the liver does not receive the full burden of the drug as rapidly. It crosses the placental barrier and pools in fetal tissues and in amniotic fluid, only to be fed back into maternal tissues gradually. The fetal tissues play no role in detoxification, but merely serve to decrease the load thrown upon the mother at one time. Thus, maternal barbiturate levels remain high and sleep is prolonged. 7. 7. In light of the higher barbiturate levels in pregnancy, the failure of the pregnant rat to become as severely depressed as the nonpregnant female remains enigmatic. A possible cause could lie in alterations of protein-binding in pregnancy. 8. 8. Two unknowns remain to be solved: (1) Is the assumption that fetal rats are incapable of detoxifying barbiturate valid as in neonatal rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice? (2) To what degree is protein-binding of pentobarbital altered in pregnancy? © 1964.

AB  - I. Behaviour of the golden hamster during normal parturition is described. 2. This is compared with behaviour of mothers who did not rear their litters because of faulty response to suckling attempts by the pups. Absence of milk at the nipples is suggested as a cause for this unwillingness to nurse. 3. Pups which are not born in the nest are often abandoned. 4. Pups born dead are often treated as food, but live pups are not eaten until after parturition is over. 5. Litters do not form into the characteristic compact unit until they have fed and been brooded. 6. Three stages in family break-up are recognised: (i) At about twentyfive days the mother begins to wean her litter, stops rebuilding the old nest, and may build a smaller one elsewhere. It is possible she would normally leave her litter at this point. (ii) During their fifth week the pups stop trying to suckle and showing contact behaviour; they begin to sleep in small groups, and seem to try to escape from the mother's cage. At this time the mother attacks them occasionally. (iii) With sexual maturity of the females (six weeks) play-fighting stops, and marking was not seen. If a female becomes pregnant she becomes dominant in a few days, but does not dare fight the mother. 7. It is likely that the third stage is an artefact of captivity and that the litter would be left by the mother in stage (i) and would largely disperse during stage (ii) in natural conditions. 8. The interpretations of observations described are necessarily tentative, and need experimental tests before they can be accepted. © 1961, Brill. All rights reserved.

AB  - Foot and leg cramps are among the most frequent complaints presented by patients of both sexes, especially older persons. Similar cramping may occur in the thighs or in other skeletal muscles of the extremities and trunk. Foot and leg cramps usually occur after unusual exertion or during sleep. "Nocturnal leg cramps" may be of sufficient intensity to prevent sleep. "Pregnancy cramps" are particularly distressing. Effective treatment of foot and leg cramps requires an understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology and diagnostic techniques. Weight reduction and improved diet are essential. Among the useful supplementary medications are calcium lactate or gluconate, vitamin-mineral supplements, sympathetic blocking agents, vasodilators, ataraxics, muscle relaxants, quinine, hydrochloride, antihistamines, and nonmercurial diuretics. Improved foot care and correction of foot imbalance is usually required. Edema and venous insufficiency are improved by elastic support, by repeated foot elevation for massages, by manipulations and exercises and by the use of diuretics. There may be need for operations on the veins and for sclerotherapy. Patients with arterial insufficiency are often benefited by lumbar sympathetic blocks with long-acting anesthetics and intra-arterial injections with relaxants, vasodilators, thrombolytic enzymes and anticoagulants. Sympathectomy, angiography and reconstructive arterial operations are indicated in only a small proportion of patients with foot and leg cramps.

AB  - A disorder characterized by disturbed relaxation of limbs at rest is described. Cases are divided into the following groups, in accordance with the chief clinical features: myoclonus group, pain and myoclonus group, pain group, “sleep-pain” group, and “restless legs” group. Legs are usually, but not always, the only limbs affected in this disorder, which often shows a heredofamilial incidence and tends to have a long, fluctuating course. Myoclonus during sleep is common. Pregnancy and anaemia greatly aggravate this condition. During the phase of overt manifestation of symptoms, sensory precipitation of myoclonus may occur. Differential diagnosis and treatment are discussed. “Dyslysis” is suggested as a name for this syndrome. © 1958, British Medical Journal Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chlorpromazine prolongs and intensifies the action of many central nervous system depressants, such as opiates, barbiturates, alcohol, and ether1. Its ability clinically to potentiate drugs in surgery and anesthesia has been demonstrated by Laborit2 and Forster3 and their associates. Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine derivative, structurally related to Phenergan, but exhibiting only weak antihistaminic properties. This drug, however, has one of the broadest known spectrums of activity on the nervous system, since it is at the same time sympatholytic, vagolytic, spasmolytic, and sedative4, 5. It has a number of diverse pharmacodynamic effects, facilitating sleep, inhibiting psychomotor agitation, relaxing skeletal muscle, reducing body temperature, slowing metabolism, and altering reaction to pain. It has been used to control nausea and vomiting6, psychomotor excitement in certain psychiatric disorders7, and intractable hiccough8; to alleviate severe pain in neoplastic diseases9, induce hypothermia10, 11, potentiate anesthesia in surgery12, 13, and to produce sedation in labor14, 15. The purpose of this study was: (1) to determine whether chlorpromazine would potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine hydrochloride sufficiently to allow a substantial reduction in the amount of meperidine required for relief of labor contractions, (2) to ascertain whether such potentiated analgesia could be administered without hazard to either the mother or infant, and (3) to determine whether potentiated analgesia might not reduce the incidence of narcotized and apneic newborn infants. © 1956, All rights reserved.

AB  - By analysis of 69,875 deliveries we have shown a regular daily rhythm in the onset of clinical labour (1st labour pains, flow of liquor amnii). Labour most frequently starts at night at about 1 to 2 a.m. and least frequently at noon. Vertical relationship max.: min. is 5:2. Deliveries starting at night are shortest, those during the day longest. The ability of the human uterus to contract and the intensity of these contractions in pregnancy is clearly dependent on the time of the day. © 1952 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - 1. A study of the literature in the reproduction of bats reveals that there are two types of sexual phenomena exhibited by bats, some bats experiencing a definite hibernation during winter after copulation in autumn, and others where copulation is immediately followed by fertilisation and gestation in spring. The bat Scotophilus wroughtoni does not show any evidence of a winter " sleep " and thereby falls into the second category. 2. Scotophilus wroughtoni has a sharply defined breeding season, copulation occurring at about the middle of March and followed immediately by fertilisation and gestation. 3. The period of gestation is about 105 to 115 days. 4. The age which this bat attains, as determined by its pregnancy records, may safely be placed at about three years. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The author presents a detailed description of parturient behavior in a Siamese domestic cat and includes photographs of the animal at various stages of the delivery process. It was noted that the response pattern is highly variable and free of stereotypy. Although a chain-like succession of response is necessitated by the actual mechanics of birth, there is no regular order for the occurrence or duration of the component responses. From his own experience and from the accounts in the literature, the author concludes that "provided the environmental and physiological conditions are correct, sequences of patterns will occur which are, in such a grouping, parturition."

AB  - Surviving Indian codices and inscriptions, reports written down by the Spanish, and continuity of practice from pre-conquest times are the sources of knowledge about obstetrics in Mexico prior to 1600. Antenatal care included avoidance of exposure to heat, no sleep during the day, and plenty of nourishment, although certain dietary precautions were recommended. Moderate intercourse during the first trimester was permitted but prohibited near the time of parturition. In general, midwives counseled the prospective mother to eat well, to rest physically and mentally, and to engage very moderately in manual labor. Massage was given at regular intervals, and vapor baths were taken. Juices of medicinal plants were administered during labor both to expedite it and to relieve pain. Women assumed a squatting position during labor, which was also assisted by abdominal massage and the manual dilation of the vulva. If parturition was prolonged, pressure was applied by the midwife who used her feet for this purpose. The child was bathed immediately after birth. Lactation was prolonged among the Mexicans.

AB  - Presents the dream analysis of a 35-yr-old pregnant woman, to highlight the relation between erotic and vesical dreams. Eight dreams starting from the 4th month of the S's pregnancy were analyzed, and it was revealed that a tendency to menstrual periodicity influenced the causation of erotic dreams. Dreams exhibited the erotic needs of the S clearly. Thus, they were symbolic of the physical sexual phenomena arousing or accompanying the dream. Both vesical and erotic stimuli were present in the dreams. It has been observed that it is more difficult for women than men to achieve sexual satisfaction during sleep. Sexual impulse, which is primary, is regarded as a symbol of urination (vesical impulse), which is secondary. Thus, sexual and vesical impulse are 2 closely allied, yet distinct forces, which may arouse or stimulate the activity of the other. An associative and compensatory relation exists between them.
