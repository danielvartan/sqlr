The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background. Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design. This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods. Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21-40 years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results. Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion. When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed countries.Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria.Results: In total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence.Conclusions: Health-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.

AB  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004. Results: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters. Conclusion: The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible

AB  - AIM: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the sleeping environment of Irish infants. METHODS: A five year population based case-control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203 SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994-98 were studied. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, co-sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both as a usual practice (adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last sleep period (adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was dependent on maternal smoking (OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not significant for infants who were > or =20 weeks of age (OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 70.10) or placed back in their own cot/bed to sleep (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to 5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value > or =10 were not significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also significantly increased the SIDS risk (OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36). CONCLUSION: Co-sleeping should be avoided in infants who are <20 weeks of age, or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable requiring further study.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15-35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting). Results: More than one in four women (28.4 %) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6 % reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0 % reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4-1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM. Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

AB  - The experience of fatigue in early pregnancy was studied, using a general model of fatigue as the conceptual framework. A convenience sample of 30 women, age 20-35 years, who were at less the 20 weeks' gestation and without health problems were included in the study. Physiologic, psychological, and environmental factors were measured and related to the occurrence and intensity of fatigue. Pearson correlations and content analysis were used to analyze the data. Results showed that a large portion of the sample (90%) experienced fatigue and that this fatigue had a significant impact on their ability to maintain personal and social activities. Significant correlations were observed between fatigue and the physiologic variables of nausea and feeling tired upon awakening from sleep. There was no significant relationship between fatigue and environmental variables such as number of hours worked or the number of children living in the home. In addition, significant correlations were observed between fatigue and psychological variables that included depression, anger, anxiety, and confusion. These data suggest that fatigue is a significant problem for pregnant women and is not relieved by rest. These data further suggest that the fatigue may be related to other physiologic changes, perhaps hormonal, that mediate physiologic and psychological variables, including fatigue.

AB  - Question: How is HIV related fatigue experienced and managed on a daily basis by people with HIV infection or AIDS? Design: A hermeneutic phenomenological study. Setting: An inner city medical centre in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Patients: 5 men and 5 women with HIV infection (mean age 33 y, 80% African-American) who reported that fatigue had developed since their previous clinic appointment. Fatigue was severe enough to affect activity levels. All participants were receiving disability benefits, lived alone, and 7 reported previous substance abuse. Methods: Individual, semistructured interviews of 30-60 minutes were done at the clinic. Topics discussed were personal meanings of fatigue, subjective responses to fatigue, contextual description of when fatigue occurred and the interpretation of the fatigue, the effect fatigue had on daily life, how each person managed the fatigue, and how the fatigue associated with HIV infection was similar or different from non-HIV fatigue. Audiotapes were transcribed, initial interpretations were made, and a team of content experts achieved consensus on the findings. The team consisted of an expert in each of phenomenological research, clinical management of patients with HIV, and fatigue research. Main findings: Thematic analysis identified 3 concerns for participants. The first, fatigue as a signal of AIDS, showed that fatigue was seen as a critical factor in the fight against the disabling effects of disease progression and AIDS. Because fatigue seas variable, participants continuously evaluated their own fatigue and compared it with that of others. Fatigue was seen as an indication of disease status. 'It's a danger sign. A lot of my friends, the ones that went on, that's how it started with them.' The second concern was the body, the mind the social experience of fatigue. The sensation of the body being tired was intense and was seen as being different from previous experiences with other conditions such as pregnancy and intoxication primarily because the fatigue was felt to be linked to disease progression. Emotional awareness of fatigue was linked to feelings of tearfulness, isolation, and lack of motivation and contributed to a depressed mood and fear of the future. Fatigue led to changes in social aspects such as isolation, frustration on the part of both patients and families, and family members taking on protective roles. 'It's like being stuck in a dark, cold, clammy room where you can't get out. You can't go nowhere, you're not really locked in a room, you just can't get enough motivation to get out of it. It's just there.' The third concern was choosing ways to live with fatigue and addiction and involved both personal understandings and actions. Participants chose to push themselves to fight the fatigue, accept the fatigue as inevitable, come to terms with the need to pace themselves, think positively, and improve their lifestyles. Participants felt the need to stop alcohol and drug abuse and to try to come to terms with their disease and its progression while balancing what was important to them in their daily lives. 'To sit around and mope about it is a sign of defeat so I find things to do. Then I go and try to take a little nap. You've got to keep your mind on the right perspective. You're not dead.' Conclusions: Among people with HIV infection or AIDS, fatigue was seen as a barometer of disease progression. Participants developed ways to deal with the fatigue both physically and emotionally to achieve their desired activities. [Original article accession number: 1998061427 (research)]

AB  - Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management.

AB  - Background: Smart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.Methods: The feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n = 20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.Results: Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands.Conclusions: A smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.

AB  - In recent years, the field of scientific and practical interest has shifted to ensuring the health of newborns and children that contribute to public health and future generations. The health of Russia's population, including reproductive health, to date, represents the State value. In recent years, in Russian Federation, there is a trend to an increase in fertility, including in connection with transition from 2012 registration of childbirth recommendations of the WHO with 22 weeks of gestation, but is directly proportional to increasing morbidity and mortality through early disability and perinatal morbidity. The highest frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes occurs in placental insufficiency, particularly in critical condition in the fetus, resulting in the subsequent health of the future generation. The aim of our study is to investigate the morbidity of babies in the first year of life birth on antenatal diagnosed critical state of the fetus. The highest perinatal mortality, high perinatal morbidity with the outcome of the disability we get at the critical state of the fetus, which should be understood as a degree of violation of the morphofunctional state in which the depletion of the compensatory mechanisms is the high risk antenatal, intrapartum or early neonatal death. According to various authors, the perinatal mortality rate in critical condition of the fetus reaches 9.3‰, early neonatal and 7.5‰. or the critical condition of the fetus characterized by early and very early preterm birth, severe perinatal CNS damage, respiratory distress syndrome, which subsequently affects the health status of children born in decompensated placental insufficiency. The aim of our research is the study of morbidity of children of the first year of life, born with antenatal diagnosed critical condition of the fetus. A clinical prospective study of 83 pregnant women with complicated critical to the fetus during pregnancy. The results of the study revealed high perinatal morbidity. Perinatal loss in the study group was 1.8‰ (N=15 ). Of the 8 surviving children, only 33 (48,5%) were observed later in the study of the catamnesis. When studying the history of the development of children during the first year of life with a critical antenatal diagnosed fetal-placental blood flow was noticed by the high frequency of infectious, allergic, neurological morbidity, abnormalities of bone and cartilage system of the visual apparatus. When analyzing the frequency and duration of monitoring by a neurologist, we have identified the expected high frequency of neurological pathology in children with antenatal critical condition. So, all children up to 1 year of life and further consisted on the account at the neurologist, which was due not only to the severity of CNS damage, but also by prematurity. The effects of neonatal ivh transferred 2-4 degree newborns manifested in children over 1 year of life in the form of hypertension-hydrocephalic syndrome in 5 children (15,1%), ischemic brain infarction in the region of the "island zone" with the subsequent formation of cystic leukomalacia in 1 child at 1 month of life. For these children, a characteristic diagnosis to the end of the 1st year of life was cerebral palsy (N=6, 18.2 %). It should be noted the high frequency of perinatal encephalopathy among children in this group (100%). Among the violations of psychomotor development we were allocated a syndrome of increased neuro-reflex irritability (restlessness, sleep disturbances, frequent and persistent vomiting) in 3 children (10,5%). The syndrome of autonomic dysfunction remained until 1 year of life in 24 (71,72%) children, premature live births, respectively gestational age was fading reflexes motor automatism, spinal reflexes, had a late start walking, crawling, ability to sit. There was a high frequency of diagnosis of retinopathy and risk of all children observed in the study of the catamnesis, which is natural, as in decompensated MON characteristic for newborns preterm labor, and abnormalities of cerebral blood flow including microcirculation in the body. For infants born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition of the fetus, characterized by high incidence of infectious disease (more than 2 times per year) in 7(21%) children by the end of 1 the first year of life. Allergic reactions manifest in the first year of life are clinically atopic dermatitis in 5 (15,1%), a high frequency which could be explained not only by prematurity at birth, but also the fact that the majority of children in this group were on artificial feeding. Thus, the results of the study showed that children born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition are at high risk of development of neurological pathology, physical, infectious, allergic morbidity, which may further entail the delay of psychomotor, speech development, with a likely outcome in the disability and social maladjustment.

AB  - Abstract: Background and Aims: In‐utero exposure to opioids including buprenorphine (BUP) has been shown to affect fetal activity, specifically heart‐rate variability (FHRV) and fetal movement (FM). Our objective was to extract simultaneous recordings of fetal cardiac and brain‐related activity in BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non‐invasive biomagnetic technique. Design: A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women. Signals were acquired with the non‐invasive 151‐channel SARA (SQUID‐Array for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal‐processing techniques were applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. Setting: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). Participants: Eight BUP‐maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program between gestational ages (GA) of 29–37 weeks who were treated with 8–24 mg of BUP daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range were also included. Measurements: Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR–FM coupling, FHRV, fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. Findings: Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified successfully from 18 non‐opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and 5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35–37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (~9 s) was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5‐4 Hz bandwidth. Transitions in FBS from quiet to active sleep were > 50% of sessions. Conclusions: This pilot study showed that a novel biomagnetic technique allows simultaneous quantification of cardiac and brain activities of a group of buprenorphine‐exposed and non‐exposed fetuses in the third trimester.

AB  - Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are comparable to those of the neonate: 1F (quiet sleep), 2F (active state), 3F (quiet awake), and 4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is not considered to have a fetal correlate. In a study assessing the effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine during pregnancy on fetal response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, what appears to be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours were seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and include: an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening and tongue depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths, the last breath ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration and settling. This is the first report/video documenting these behaviours and suggests the possibility of a state 5F.

AB  - This paper reviews available evidence on fetal and maternal sleep states during pregnancy. While the mother spends the bulk of her sleep time during pregnancy in NREM (non REM) Stage N2 (light) sleep, the developing baby spends the bulk of its sleep time in REM. Fetal REM is synchronized with maternal wake-rest activity schedules and is tightly coupled to respiratory physiology. Fetal REM exhibits hormonal and sensory signaling functions as well. The absence of sufficient fetal REM activity is associated with fetal distress and may be interpreted as a danger signal by the pregnant mother. It is suggested that maternal N2 NREM light sleep allows the mother to quickly awaken and respond to any danger signals received from internal or external sources. Near term NREM Stage N3 (slow wave activity) helps initiate birth contractions. At birth fetal REM is maximal and declines rapidly in the neonate.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the possible association between fetal gender and long-term pediatric neurological morbidity.Methods: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort analysis comparing the risk of long-term neurological morbidity (up to age 18 years) of children born during the years 1991 to 2013 according to their gender. Neurological morbidity evaluated included hospitalizations in childhood involving pervasive developmental disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and infantile spasms and disorders of eating as recorded in the hospital files. Multiple pregnancies and fetal congenital malformations were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare the cumulative neurological morbidity over the study period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for obstetrical confounders, including gestational age at birth, birth weight, and maternal factors.Results: During the study period, 240,953 newborns were included in the long-term analysis: 51.0% (n = 122,840) males and 49.0% (n = 118,113) females. Hospitalizations for neurological problems (up to age 18 years) were significantly more common in males compared with females (1.1% vs 0.8%, respectively, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001). Specifically, pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea were found to be significantly more common in males, and cerebral palsy reached borderline significance (0.1% vs 0.04%, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.9, P = 0.06). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated males to have a significantly higher cumulative incidence of total neurological morbidity as well as of pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea (all log-rank test P values <0.001). In the Cox regression model, male gender exhibited an independent association with long-term neurological morbidity, while adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, and other confounding variables (adjusted hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Males are at an increased risk for pediatric neurological morbidity independent of gestational age at birth and birth weight.

RECENT FINDINGS: Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy.

AB  - Objectives: Modern technology may have desensitised the 'biological clock' to environmental cues, disrupting the appropriate co-ordination of metabolic processes. Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk.Methods: We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI) z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)).Results: No association was found between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609). Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p = 0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep duration. Evidence for uncorrected gene-by-sleep interactions of the CLOCK-rs4864548 (p = 0.0039), PEMT-936108 (p = 0.016) and GHRELIN-rs696217 (p = 0.046) were found in relation to BMI z-scores but not for PBF.Conclusion: Our results indicate that children may have different genetic susceptibility to the effects of sleep duration on obesity. Further confirmatory studies are required in other population cohorts of different age groups.

AB  - Background: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.Methods: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.Results: After adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping < or = 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m2) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (> or = 25 kg/m2). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations.

AB  - Preterm infants represent the largest child patient group in the European Union (EU), accounting for 5.5-11.4% of all births (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, 2011b). Preterm birth is defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation. Infants born late preterm (34-36 weeks) are considered more similar to early preterm (> 34 weeks) than to full-term infants, despite previously regarded as near-term (Raju Higgins, Stark, & Leveno, 2006). For preterm infants, sleeping functions are critical as they demonstrate the ability to adjust to biological and social rhythms and support emotional regulation, learning, and memory. Many studies have focused on sleep patterns of full-term infants; however, few have investigated preterm infants and none have compared early and late preterm infants with a population from the Republic of Ireland. The purpose of this study was to identify infant and parent characteristics that promote optimal sleep in preterm infants and to establish whether the parent-infant relationship mediates this association. A secondary purpose was to test the transactional model of sleep. Parent report of infant sleep was taken from a recent population-based dataset from the Republic of Ireland. A comparison of the day and nighttime sleep patterns of early and late preterm infants found no difference between groups. There was also no difference in infant temperament, breast-feeding, parental stress, depression, or sociodemographics. A difference was found between groups in infant development, weight at 9 months, and age infant began solid foods. This finding was not surprising as infants born early preterm are at greater at greater risk of developmental delay and disability. Results of this study suggest that the paternal-infant relationship has a mediating impact on the relationship between infant temperament and nighttime waking in the early preterm group only, while the maternal-infant relationship has a mediating role in both groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge on the transactional model of sleep, and are the first to identify infant temperament and the paternal-infant relationship as important factors. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the transactional model of sleep and recommendations for future research are presented.

AB  - The objective was to identify guidelines in relation to self-care practices in pregnancy received by pregnant adolescents during the prenatal period. This is a descriptive, quantitative and transversal study conducted at the clinic of the Hospital de Clínicas, Federal University of Triângulo Mineiro with 30 pregnant adolescents. Data collection was performed in 2012 through home visits, using a script of sociodemographic characteristics and guidance received by pregnant women. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Most patients were aged between 16 and 19 years, had a steady partner, between seven and nine years of schooling, were homemakers, had a family income of one to three minimum wages. The most common guidelines were the importance of early prenatal care, the prenatal booklet, exams, vaccination, about smoking, alcohol intake, use of ferrous sulfate and folic acid. The less frequent information was related to weight control, healthy eating, physical exercise, balance between sleep and rest, practice of sexual activity and use of condom during sexual intercourse. The conclusion is that guidance provided during the prenatal period has biological approach and the guidelines with a holistic view on adolescents were carried out less frequently.
AB  - Tuvo el objetivo de identificar las orientaciones referentes a las prácticas de autocuidado en el embarazo recibidas por adolescentes embarazadas durante el prenatal. Se trata de estudio descriptivo, cuantitativo y transversal, realizado en el Ambulatorio del Hospital de Clínicas de la Universidad Federal del Triângulo Mineiro con 30 adolescentes embarazadas. La recolección de datos fue realizada en 2012, mediante visita a domicilio, utilizando guión de caracterización sociodemográfica y de orientaciones recibidas por las embarazadas. Los datos fueron analizados por estadística descriptiva. La mayoría de las embarazadas poseía edad entre 16 y 19 años, compañero fijo, siete a nueve años de estudio, ama de casa y renta familiar de uno a tres sueldos mínimos. Las orientaciones más frecuentes fueron sobre la importancia del prenatal precoz, la tarjeta de la embarazada, los exámenes, la vacunación, sobre el consumo de tabaco y alcohol, uso de sulfato ferroso y ácido fólico. Las informaciones menos frecuentes fueron relacionadas con el control del peso, alimentación saludable, práctica de ejercicios físicos, equilibrio entre sueño y reposo, práctica de actividad sexual y el uso de preservativos en las relaciones sexuales. La conclusión es que las orientaciones proporcionadas en el prenatal poseen abordaje biológico y las que comprenden holísticamente a la adolescente no fueron realizadas con tanta frecuencia.

AB  - Background: Depression is frequently observed in patients with untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the general population. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems.Methods: A retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were ≥18 years old, pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).Results: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring. Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score ≥10. Significantly more snoring women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score ≥10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1 ± 4.9 vs. 5.4 ± 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score ≥10 (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023).Conclusion: Maternal snoring may be a risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms. Further investigation of the temporal relationship between maternal snoring and depressive symptoms is warranted.

AB  - This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify 'red flag symptoms' suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a health coaching (HC) intervention designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and promote positive psychosocial and motivational outcomes in comparison with an Education Alone (EA) group.Design: Randomized-controlled trial.Methods: Two hundred and sixty-one women who were <18 weeks pregnant consented to take part. Those allocated to the HC group received a tailored HC intervention delivered by a Health Coach, whilst those in the EA group attended two education sessions. Women completed measures, including motivation, psychosocial variables, sleep quality, and knowledge, beliefs and expectations concerning GWG, at 15 weeks of gestation (Time 1) and 33 weeks of gestation (Time 2). Post-birth data were also collected at 2 months post-partum (Time 3).Results: There was no intervention effect in relation to weight gained during pregnancy, rate of excessive GWG or birth outcomes. The only differences between HC and EA women were higher readiness (b = 0.29, 95% CIs = 0.03-0.55, p < .05) and the importance to achieve a healthy GWG (b = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.02-0.52, p < .05), improved sleep quality (b = -0.22, 95% CIs = -0.44 to -0.03, p < .05), and increased knowledge for an appropriate amount of GWG that would be best for their baby's health (b = -1.75, 95% CI = -3.26 to -0.24, p < .05) reported by the HC at Time 2.Conclusions: Whilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use of weight monitoring.Statement Of Contribution: What is already known on the subject? Designing interventions to address gestational weight gain (GWG) continues to be a challenge. To date, health behaviour change factors have not been the focus of GWG interventions. What does this study add? Our health coaching (HC) intervention did not reduce GWG more so than education alone (EA). There was an intervention effect on readiness and importance to achieve healthy GWG. Yet there were no group differences regarding confidence to achieve healthy GWG post-intervention.

AB  - The present study was conducted in a population living near a recycling plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to determine whether exposures to these substances were occurring and producing adverse health effects. The plant is situated in a suburb of Monterrey, which is the third most populous city in Mexico and the second most industrialized. A cross-sectional study design was used for the investigation, which was carried out from September 1994 to November 1994. Using cluster sampling procedures, homes in two areas were selected--one exposed through proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed to serve as a control--until the desired sample size was achieved (621 individuals, with an average of five per dwelling). A specially trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to an adult member of each family, soliciting data on the presence of acute and chronic infections, complications of pregnancy, and congenital diseases among the family members. One hundred twenty-seven questionnaires were administered in the exposed population, yielding information on 596 individuals. In the unexposed population, 147 questionnaires were administered furnishing data on 743 individuals. The sex and age distributions of the two populations were similar. The unexposed population had a slightly longer average duration of residence. The most common health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, excessive fatigue, skin problems, otitis, and anemia. The exposed population had significantly higher risks for skin eruptions and diseases, excessive fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, otitis, bronchitis, and allergies. Exposed and unexposed women had comparable prevalences of obstetrical problems, spontaneous abortions, congenitally malformed offspring, and low birthweight. The questionnaire used to detect health problems has low sensitivity and may have generated underestimates of some conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis controlled for several different biases, and thus it can be concluded that a positive association exists between environmental exposure to these wastes and increased risk of disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). RESULTS: Overall, 9.2% of all women 'usually' chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio = 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). CONCLUSIONS: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers-especially private providers-should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants.

AB  - The Chinese are deeply influenced by traditional Chinese culture. Chinese herbal use is a common practice to enhance reproductive health. 'Good' menstrual health facilitates fertility and sets a positive stage for pregnancy during the childbearing years. Many Chinese Americans use traditional Chinese health practices, but they are less likely to disclose these practices. Although the upward trend of herbal use is more prevalent among women and ethnic minorities, little data are available about herbal use in these populations.The overall aim of this dissertation was to examine the influences of health promoting behaviors and the perimenstrual symptom experience on Chinese herbal use among childbearing-age Chinese American women from the theoretical perspectives of Chinese culture, women's health, and health promotion. This cross-sectional, descriptive study included 103 Chinese American women, 21 to 40 years, responding to self-administered questionnaires. Follow-up data were collected prospectively on a subset of the women regarding their perimenstrual symptoms during menstruation.Over 90% of women reported past use of Chinese herbs; 22% were current herbal users; and 70% had consumed Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms, with 55% to 95% of them experiencing relief. Current herbal users were significantly less acculturated. The primary reason for using Chinese herbs was enhanced sense of well-being. A majority of herbal users did not inform their Western health provider of their herbal use. Being less acculturated and engaging in nutrition-related health promoting behaviors were statistically significant determinants of Chinese herbal use.Most women experienced minimal severity of perimenstrual symptoms. Abdominal bloating, fatigue, and breast soreness were the most prevalent and severe symptoms reported retrospectively and prospectively. Uterine cramps were more prevalent during the menstrual period only. Although there were no statistically significant perimenstrual symptom differences between herbal and non-herbal users, women who reported a higher severity of sleep disturbance and emotional related perimenstrual symptoms were more likely to use Chinese herbs.Congruent with Chinese culture, which values health promotion, a majority of the women were relatively healthy and engaged routinely in health promoting behaviors. One such health promoting practice was the use of Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth leads to multiple morbidities affecting the health of a child. Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka.Methods: A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790 preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status, a preterm birth, was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire (prepared in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure status, outcome and additional variables such as child development status and birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different domains of health (subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear regression.Results: Response rate was 95.5% (n = 379) for preterm group and 95.2% (n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with subscales on sleep wellbeing, general wellbeing and abdominal symptoms in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness, delayed development status, socio economic status and maternal perception on the health status of the child were common predictors of quality of life.Conclusion: Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.

AB  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring > or =10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status.

AB  - Background: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers.Objective: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers' perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website.Methods: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website.Results: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health. Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of father-focused websites.

AB  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named "mixed)", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the extremely obese manifest sleep disordered breathing with a preponderance of hypopneas and relative paucity of obstructive apneas. METHODS: Retrospective review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) < 35, Group B: BMI >= 45. Exclusion criteria: age < 18 years, pregnancy, >= 5 central apneas/hour, BMI >= 35 < 45. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Statistical methods: t-test for independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis [chi](2). Descriptive statistics were expressed as interquartile range, median and mean ± standard deviation, p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 ± 11.5 years, BMI = 28.9 ± 4 kg/m(2); Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 ± 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 ± 8 kg/m(2). HAR was significantly higher in Group B (38.8 ± 50.7) than Group A (10.6 ± 16.5), p = 0.0006, as was HI (28.7 ± 28.6 in B vs 12.6 ± 8.4 in A, p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 ± 33.8 vs 22 ± 23, p = 0.03), but not apnea index. HAR was significantly higher in Group B regardless of race, gender, or presence of OHS. The BMI was the only significant predictor of HAR (adjusted r(2) = 0.138; p = 0.002) in a linear regression model with natural log transformation of the HAR performed for age, gender, race, BMI, and PetCO2. CONCLUSION: Extremely obese patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas. CITATION: Mathew R; Castriotta RJ. High hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR) in extreme obesity.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common and serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops during sleep, is associated with excess weight and obesity. Little is known about the co-occurrence of OSA among pregnant women from low and middle-income countries.Methods: We examined the extent to which maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity status are associated with high risk for OSA, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness in 1032 pregnant women in Lima, Peru. The Berlin questionnaire was used to identify women at high risk for OSA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to examine sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were employed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for putative confounding factors.Results: Compared with lean women (<25 kg/m(2)), overweight women (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) had 3.69-fold higher odds of high risk for OSA (95% CI 1.82-7.50). The corresponding aOR for obese women (≥30 kg/m(2)) was 13.23 (95% CI: 6.25-28.01). Obese women, as compared with their lean counterparts had a 1.61-fold higher odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.00-2.63).Conclusion: Overweight or obese pregnant women have increased odds of sleep disorders, particularly OSA. OSA screening and risk management may be indicated among pregnant women in low and middle income countries, particularly those undergoing rapid epidemiologic transitions characterized by increased prevalence of excessive adult weight gain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS) and related functional outcomes in infancy remain unexplored. Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the functional integrity of the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether CNS integrity in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA. DESIGN: Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at parturition. On postpartum day 1 (P1) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to measure sleep and wake states. RESULTS: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2 groups: high DHA (> 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (</= 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on P1 was inversely associated with QS and positively associated with arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS, sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS. CONCLUSION: The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity. Copyright © 2002 American Society for Clinical Nutrition

AB  - Objective:The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of home care practices in very to moderately preterm (VPT), late preterm (LPT) and term infants born in Massachusetts.Study Design:Using 2007 to 2010 Massachusetts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data, births were categorized by gestational age (VPT: 23 to 33 weeks; LPT: 34 to 36 weeks; term: 37 to 42 weeks). Home care practices included breastfeeding initiation and continuation, and infant sleep practices (supine sleep position, sleeping in a crib, cosleeping in an adult bed). We developed multivariate models to examine the association of infant sleep practices and breastfeeding with preterm status, controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics.Results:Supine sleep position was more prevalent among term infants compared with VPT and LPT infants (77.1%, 71.5%, 64.4%; P=0.02). In the adjusted model, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position compared with term infants (adjusted prevalence ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.97). Breastfeeding initiation and continuation did not differ among preterm and term groups. Nearly 16% of VPT and 18% of LPT and term infants were not sleeping in cribs and 14% of LPT and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed.Conclusion:Compared with term infants, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position after hospital discharge. A significant percent of preterm and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed. Hospitals may consider improving their safe sleep education, particularly to mothers of LPT infants.

AB  - Postpartum psychosis has long-lasting consequences for mother and child. Beside depression, sleep and eating disturbances, exhaustion, social withdrawal, and anxiety, postpartum depression can also interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect child development. Recent reports show that most affected pregnant women are hesitant about taking antidepressant drugs, with a high percentage discontinuing their use. Some authors suggest that the reluctance of pregnant women to take antidepressant drugs should encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients the use of psychological interventions or alternative forms of treatment. In this article, a case of severe postpartum depression, treated successfully with homeopathic therapy, is presented. Considering the high noncompliance of women suffering from postpartum depression with conventional antidepressant medication, research in safe complementary medical methods is justified. One of these methods should be homeopathy.

AB  - In hospitals, women of reproductive age do a range of work tasks, some of which are known to carry potential risks. Tasks such as working with radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents, as well as performing heavy lifting or tasks requiring erratic sleep patterns have been reported to increase the risk of reproductive failures. Our aim was to study pregnancy outcomes in female hospital workers in Denmark. We performed a cohort study of 5976 female hospital workers and used as a reference group 60,890 women employed outside of hospitals. The reproductive health of hospital workers working during pregnancy is comparable to those of non-hospital workers for the majority of reproductive failures studied. However, an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities was noted in some subgroups of hospital workers, which may indicate that some hospital work still entails fetotoxic hazards.

AB  - Unlabelled: Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with significant maternal and infant morbidity are on the rise in Western society despite advances of medical technology. Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Leaning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to outline data linking sleep disturbances with an increased risk of some systemic disorders, recall characteristics of pregnancy complications which support the hypothesis that sleep disturbances may be related to these pregnancy outcomes, and summarize the likelihood and types of sleep disturbances that are common in pregnant women.

AB  - Background.True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia.Method.Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias.Results.High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent.Conclusions.We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited.

AB  - This article discusses some precautions that a pregnant women can take for a restful sleep. These include finding best sleep position, easing a stuffy nose, getting help for heartburns, and avoiding sleep medicines. It is also advised that as the pregnancy progresses older, continue giving a pregnant woman opportunities to self-soothe whenever possible.

AB  - Objectives: To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight, height, age and sex. Design: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE-BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc). Results: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated. Conclusions: There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.

AB  - A total of 14 healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to determine the effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on human fetal behavioral states. Fetal behavioral state observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. During the first episode of behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep state) greater than or equal to 10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged less than or equal to 3 minutes after stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial larynx.

AB  - Objective: To assess the frequency of obstructive sleep apnoea among women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Design: Cohort study.Setting: Obstetric clinics at an academic medical centre.Population: Pregnant women with hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia) and women who were normotensive.Methods: Women completed a questionnaire about habitual snoring and underwent overnight ambulatory polysomnography.Main Outcome Measures: The presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnoea.Results: Obstructive sleep apnoea was found among 21 of 51 women with hypertensive disorders (41%), but in only three of 16 women who were normotensive (19%, chi-square test, P=0.005). [Author correction added on 16 June 2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers than in non-snorers (19.9±34.1 versus 3.4±3.1, P=0.013), and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4±6.6 versus 90.2±3.5, P=0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8).Conclusions: Pregnant women with hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or promote hypertension.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify factors that influenced stress, healthy eating and physical activity among low-income overweight or obese pregnant women. We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women's pregnancy concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the woman's safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions. They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult, e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier, some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan effective ways to manage negative feelings.

AB  - Immunonutrition is an emergent and interdisciplinary subject, since it comprises several aspects related to Nutrition, Immunity, Infection, Inflammation, and Injury or tissue damage, what is known as Nutrition and 4 “Is”. Within these interactions the endocrine, nervous and immune systems are involved, microbiota being a part of the last one. Nowadays, gut microbiota has been shown to play an essential role, not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also into the nervous system, because of its bilateral connection. There are several methods to study Immunonutrition, which allow measuring different immunological biomarkers to provide information about the nutritional status. However, it should be taken into account that there is not a single gold standard parameter to evaluate the cause- effect relationship between nutrition and the immune system. On the contrary, a combination of biomarkers have to be assessed depending on the different nutritional situations. Since Immunonutrition is a multidisciplinary matter as mentioned above, the study on the interactions between nutrition and the immune system has not been exclusively focused as such, but bearing in mind other systems of the organisms as well as a wide range of confounding factors and determinants coming from idiosyncratic features, genes and lifestyle of each individual. Therefore, Immunonutrition allows to study the following research fields: 1) Evaluation of nutritional status in presumably healthy people with risk of malnutrition (children, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, elderly, and sportspeople); 2) Assessment of the evolution and progress of patients with nutrition and immune-related diseases, such as food allergies, eating and metabolic disorders; 3) Evaluation of the effects of nutrients, bioactive compounds and both conventional and functional foods on the immune system; 4) Evaluation of impact of lifestyle determinants on the immune system, such as diet, food behaviour, physical activity, sedentariness, sleep quality and quantity, and as a key factor, stress.

AB  - Objective: Pregnant women often suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD symptoms are known to influence the quality of life; however, there is a lack of data in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of GERD symptoms on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during pregnancy.Participants and Methods: A prospective longitudinal cohort study to investigate the impact of GERD symptoms on the HRQOL was carried out in 510 pregnant women and 330 nonpregnant women as controls. Two validated questionnaires, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire, were used.Results: The study showed a significant negative impact on HRQOL in pregnant women with GERD symptoms. All five areas, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, vitality, food/drink problems, and physical/social functioning, were significantly reduced, but the most significant impact was on sleep (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire score -35%). Overall, quality of life in women with GERD worsened throughout pregnancy.Conclusion: GERD is frequently seen in pregnant women and has a negative impact on HRQOL, especially in late pregnancy. Therefore, there is a need for adequate therapy of GERD in pregnant women and HRQOL could be an adequate monitoring tool in this population.
