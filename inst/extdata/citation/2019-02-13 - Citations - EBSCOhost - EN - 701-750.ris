AB  - Objective: To explore relationships among sleep disturbances, glucose tolerance, and pregnancy outcomes.Research Design and Methods: Four validated sleep questionnaires were administered to 169 pregnant women at the time of 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).Results: Of the participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19% had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction. Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4% increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI). Among NGT subjects, preterm delivery was more frequent in those with increased ESS (P = 0.02), poor sleep quality (P = 0.02), and SS (P = 0.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admissions were associated with increased ESS (P = 0.03), SDB/SS (P = 0.03), and daytime dysfunction (P < 0.01) in mothers.Conclusions: Pregnant women experience significant sleep disturbances that are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with increased SDB risk, frequent snoring, and sleep duration of <7 h/night have increased risk of developing GDM.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of sleep disturbances during pregnancy with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Methods: In this prospective study, 688 healthy women with singleton pregnancy were selected from three hospitals in Chengdu, China 2013–2014. Self-report questionnaires, including the sleep quantity and quality as well as exercise habits in a recent month were administered at 12–16, 24–28, and 32–36 weeks’ gestation. Data on type of delivery, gestational age, and the neonates’ weight were recorded after delivery. After controlling the potential confounders, a serial of multi-factor logistic regression models were performed to evaluate whether sleep quality and quantity were associated with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Results: There were 382 (55.5%) women who had cesarean deliveries and 32 (4.7%) who delivered preterm. Women with poor sleep quality during the first (OR: 1.87, 95% CI [1.02–3.43]), second (5.19 [2.25–11.97]), and third trimester (1.82 [1.18–2.80]) were at high risk of cesarean delivery. Women with poor sleep quality during the second (5.35 [2.10–13.63]) and third trimester (3.01 [1.26–7.19]) as well as short sleep time (<7 h) during the third trimester (4.67 [1.24–17.50]) were at high risk of preterm birth. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery and preterm birth throughout pregnancy. Obstetric care providers should advise women with childbearing age to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.

AB  - In a prospective study of 247 pregnant Chinese women, the prevalence of sleep disturbances across pregnancy has been assessed using a set of validated questionnaires including the Sleep and Health Questionnaire (SHQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The frequency of self-reported snoring increased from 29.7% in the first trimester to 40.5% and 46.2% in the second and third trimesters, respectively, with an increase in the prevalence of moderate or severe snoring from 1% in the first trimester to 7.2% in the third trimester (P < 0.01). There was a higher frequency of moderate to severe snoring intensity among subjects with BMI >or=25 compared with those with BMI <25 kg/m(2) in the third trimester (20.8%vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Subjective sleepiness, as determined by the ESS, increased significantly from 8.6 to 9.4 and 9.6 in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy.Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained.Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values≤.05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values≤.05).Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms.

AB  - Self-reported sleep disturbances and levels of vitality and fatigue were studied in a secondary analysis of 25 pregnant and 29 postpartum employed women. Results indicate that pregnant women have problems initiating and maintaining sleep, and postpartum women have problems maintaining sleep, but not falling asleep. The primary reason for midsleep awakenings was urinary frequency among the pregnant women, and child care responsibilities among the postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women who fell asleep easily, very few who felt highly energetic at work, and most who perceived a high level of fatigue during the past week. Even with these sleep disruptions, no differences occurred in the mean scores for perception of fatigue and vitality between the two groups. Clinicians can use these findings to educate women about some changes they may anticipate and how they might manage them during pregnancy and postpartum.

AB  - Descriptions of dreams of women during pregnancy have appeared in the literature for more than a century. Daydreams and sleep dreams are differentiated. A review of the literature published during the last four decades uncovered a limited number of empirical articles. The general consensus is that the sleep dreams of pregnant women are indicative of their concerns regarding safety for self and for the expected child. The most recent information focuses on the use of groups to help pregnant women explore the content of their dreams.

AB  - Objective: To describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep and blood glucose in a prospective cohort of women recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Methods: Women with GDM were enrolled immediately after attending a GDM education class. All patients were recruited during their first week of attempted dietary management of GDM. They were instructed on the use of a glucometer and on the principles of a GDM diet. Women wore an actigraph and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data. Linear mixed model analysis was used to estimate the association of sleep duration on morning fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations.Results: Thirty-seven participants provided data for 213 sleep intervals that corresponded to at least one glucose reading. Sleep duration was negatively associated with fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations In analyses adjusted for age, gestational age, and body mass index, a 1-hour increase in sleep time was associated with statistically significant reductions in fasting glucose (-2.09 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.98 to -0.20) as well as postprandial glucose concentrations (lunch -4.62 mg/dL, 95% CI -8.75 to -0.50; dinner -6.07 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.40 to -2.73).Conclusion: Short sleep durations are associated with worsened glucose control in women with gestational diabetes. Educating women on healthy sleep and screening for and treating sleep disorders during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in gestational diabetes.Level Of Evidence: II.

AB  - Objective Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. The association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. We examined diet quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of childbirth. Methods Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20-44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012. Self-reported weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (≤6 h), adequate (7-8 h), or long (≥9 h). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0-100) estimated overall and components of diet quality. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (β = −4.3; 95 % CI −8.1 to −0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.1), whole fruit (β = −0.9; 95 % CI −1.6 to −0.2), and total protein (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (β = 2.2; 95 % CI −4.3 to −0.1). Conclusions for practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.

AB  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed.

AB  - Aims To examine the association between sleep disturbances during pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods From 2010 to 2012, 12 506 women in Tianjin, China, were screened using a 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Those with glucose challenge test values of ≥ 7.8 mmol/l were invited to further undergo a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was determined according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group's definition. Self-reported sleep duration and sleep quality during pregnancy was documented using a modified questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% CIs. Results A total of 919 women (7.3%) had gestational diabetes. Sleep duration was found to have an approximate J-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk after adjusting for covariates. Compared with a sleep duration of 7-9 h/day (43% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios for sleep duration of ≥ 9 h/day (55%) and < 7 h/day (2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.42) and 1.36 (95% CI 0.87-2.14), respectively. Compared with good sleep quality (37.9% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios of moderate (59.9%) and poor sleep quality (2.2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.19 (95% CI 1.01-1.41) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.04-2.50), respectively. Conclusion In pregnant Chinese women, poor sleep quality, and shorter and longer duration of sleep during pregnancy were independently associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

AB  - Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors, depression, automobile and workplace accidents, and prospective mortality. Little is known, however, about sleep patterns in the US population. The 2004-2007 National Health Interview Survey-Sample Adult Files provide nationally representative data for 110,441 noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18 years or older, and multinomial logistic regression examines whether variables in 5 domains-demographic, family structure, socioeconomic, health behavior, and health status-are associated with long or short sleep duration. Being older, non-Hispanic black, or a current or former smoker; having low levels of education, income, or few income sources; consuming few or numerous drinks in a week; or reporting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, underweight, or activity limitations is associated with increased odds of both long and short sleep duration. Other variables are associated with shorter (e.g., living with young children, being unmarried, working long hours, more frequent binge drinking) or longer (e.g., being younger, Mexican American, pregnant, or having low levels of physical activity) sleep hours. The authors identify numerous risk factors for long and short sleep; many of those variables are potential confounders of the relation between sleep hours and other health outcomes.

AB  - Background: Migraine has been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant migraineurs.Methods: A cohort of 1,334 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of migraine.Results: Approximately 19.4% of the cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26). Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight migraineurs.Conclusions: These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep disorders among migraineurs; and extends the literature to include pregnant women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent migraine-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB  - Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was composed by 143 depressed (n = 77) and non-depressed (n = 66) pregnant women who completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep during the night and the entire 24 h period. Present findings point out the effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety.

AB  - Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1-4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6-16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0-16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p < .01). The score was positively correlated with sleep SWA in a cluster of 15 electrodes over frontal and negatively in a cluster of 14 electrodes over central brain regions after controlling for age at assessment and correcting for multiple comparisons. Within the frontal cluster, sleep SWA was higher in very preterm compared to term-born participants when controlling for executive function performance and age at assessment (p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based cognitive-behavioral training program for sleep during late pregnancy.Methods: A nonrandomized quasiexperimental sample of nulliparous women who received the intervention during pregnancy (n=25) was compared with two control groups (n=76 and n=48) from other intervention studies at similar postintervention time points: approximately 1 month before childbirth and 1-2 months after childbirth. The home-based Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy consisted of 4 weeks of sound-enhanced audio relaxation programs, readings, and daily sleep diaries. Both control groups received dietary recommendations for improving sleep. Sleep duration (total sleep time) and sleep disruption (wake after sleep onset) were measured using wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 48 hours on consecutive weekdays.Results: The intervention group had significantly longer sleep duration and less sleep disruption than both control groups, particularly at the postpartum assessment. Intervention participants slept an average of 430 (95% confidence interval [CI] 397-464) minutes during pregnancy compared with 420 (95% CI 403-438) and 417 (95% CI 395-439) minutes for the two control groups. At the postpartum assessment, the intervention group slept 446 (95% CI 415-478) minutes compared with 390 (95% CI 373-408) and 370 (95% CI 348-393) minutes for those in the control groups. In terms of sleep disruption, women in the intervention group had 16.1% (95% CI 11.9-20.2%) wake after sleep onset during pregnancy, whereas women in the control groups had 13.4% (95% CI 11.2-15.5%) and 20.4% (95% CI 17.7-23.0%). Postpartum, the intervention group had 20.3% (95% CI 16.4-24.1%) wake after sleep onset compared with 26.6% (95% CI 24.5-28.8%) and 28.7% (95% CI 26.0-31.5%) among women in the control groups. Participant feedback about the intervention was generally positive, although intervention adherence was variable.Conclusion: This study provides evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of the Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy intervention for enhancing sleep that typically worsens during late pregnancy and after childbirth.

AB  - For many women, pregnancy can be a time of sleep disturbance. Physiological, hormonal, and emotional changes associated with pregnancy often lead to sleep disturbance. Women who develop antepartum complications frequently are prescribed bed rest and hospitalization. Both pregnancy and hospitalization can influence sleep. This study examined the sleep experience of hospitalized antepartum women. The purposes of this descriptive correlational study were to determine whether being in the hospital affects sleep in pregnant women, gestational age influences sleep while hospitalized, and patient's usual sleep patterns influence sleep during hospitalization. A conceptual model of impaired sleep for the childbearing family provided theoretical guidance.A convenience sample of 24 pregnant women, 18-39 years of age, participated in the study. Most participants were unmarried minority women with annual incomes of less than $30,000. Difficulties in retaining participants to Day 4 were encountered; only 9 participants completed the study to Day 4.Most participants had existing sleep disturbances, according to PSQI and GSDS scores on admission. Women self-reported both internal and external factors that interrupted their sleep during hospitalization. There was a moderate, inverse relationship between the weeks of gestation and how well the participants slept the previous night on Day 3. Perceptions of sleep depth and sleep quality increased significantly over time. Self-reported difficulty in falling asleep the previous night significantly decreased over time.Recommendations for future research are modification of the design to include all women admitted and discharged prior to Day 4, larger sample size, and the use of objective and subjective measures in data collection.

AB  - Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common condition among pregnant women, particularly during late gestation. Gestational perturbations promote the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic consequences in the next generation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV--related sleep disruption is a common complaint of persons with HIV infection. With the demographical shifts, African American women have now emerged as one of the fastest growing HIV populations today, yet they remain a vulnerable and underrepresented population in the sleep literature.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the dynamics of HIV--related sleep disruption and wellbeing in asymptomatic HIV--seropositive AA women of childbearing age within the context of a holistic, theoretical substruction from Myra Levine's Conservation Model (1967). The rationale for the proposed study was to provide a foundation of both the objective and subjective experience of HIV--related sleep disruption, which as a stressor can affect wellbeing.METHODS: A descriptive correlational design was used to examine the immunological integrity, sleep/wake rhythm, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, IL--6 rhythm, and quality of life in 20 asymptomatic HIV--seropositive African American women receiving care at Wayne State University Physicians Group Infectious Diseases Clinic in Detroit, MI. In this 4--day protocol, measures included CD4+ cell count, HIV RNA viral load, wrist actigraphy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Subjective Sleep Quality Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, plasma IL--6, Quality of Life Index, and Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale.RESULTS: Both the objective and subjective experience of sleep demonstrated severe sleep disruption and disorganized sleep patterns. Nearly half (45%) of the sample slept < 6 hours per night, usually not falling asleep until sometime after 12 midnight. Objective daytime functioning was also disrupted with frequent dozing (> 9 sleep episodes) noted throughout the day. Self--reported daytime sleepiness was inconsistent with the objective assessment and was within normal limits. The sample's mean IL--6 level was 2.03 pg/mL, which is much lower than that reported in other asymptomatic samples or normal controls. Quality of life measures indicated a positive sense of wellbeing, but the daily pattern of quality of life was not associated with the daily pattern of sleep efficiency, subjective sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, or IL--6 levels when controlling for CD4+ cell count and HIV RNA viral load. And lastly, the 1--item quality of life scale showed agreement with the 66--item quality of life index using Bland--Altman agreement analysis, which may help in decreasing participant burden in clinical trials enrolling this population.CONCLUSION: This sample suffered from severe HIV-related sleep disruption, as evidenced by an average sleep time of 6.4 hours per night and frequent dozing throughout the day. Despite this disruption, the sample perceived a positive sense of quality of life. These results provide further evidence that future studies exploring efforts to improve sleep and daytime functioning in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive African American women are essential in order to maintain quality of life and wellbeing in this population.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the associations of sleep hygiene and actigraphy measures of sleep with self‐reported sleep quality in 197 pregnant women in northern Taiwan. Third‐trimester pregnant women completed the Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies‐Depression Scale (CES‐D), and wore an actigraph for 7 consecutive days. Student's t‐test was used to compare the SHPS scores and means as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score >5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score ≤5). Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported significantly worse sleep hygiene, with higher SHPS scores and higher sleep schedule, arousal‐related behavior, and sleep environment subscale scores. Poor sleepers had significantly greater intra‐individual variability of sleep onset latency, total nighttime sleep, and wake after sleep onset than good sleepers. In stepwise linear regression, older maternal age (p = .01), fewer employment hours per week (p = .01), higher CES‐D total score (p < .01), and higher SHPS arousal‐related behavior subscale scores (p < .01) predicted self‐reported global sleep quality. Findings support avoiding physically, physiologically, emotionally, or cognitively arousing activities before bedtime as a target for sleep‐hygiene intervention in women during pregnancy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigue and sleep disturbance in late pregnancy are associated with labor duration and delivery type. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective observational study of 131 women in their ninth month of pregnancy, objective (48-hour wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep logs and questionnaires) measures were used to predict labor outcomes using analysis of variance and logistic regression. RESULTS: Controlling for infant birth weight, women who slept less than 6 hours at night had longer labors and were 4.5 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Women with severely disrupted sleep had longer labors and were 5.2 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Fatigue was unrelated to labor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should prescribe 8 hours of bed time during pregnancy to assure adequate sleep and should include sleep quantity and quality in prenatal assessments as potential predictors of labor Copyright © 2004 by Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - The article examines relationships between pregnancy and maternal sleep. Specifically, sleep as a restorative process is considered with regard for the metabolic and arousal demands of childbearing. The analysis draws attention to the limited number of studies in the area and the need for greater research interest in pregnancy sleep phenomena. The available evidence indicates that maternal slow-wave and rapid eye movement which are key to anabolic activity and neural-cerebral recharge, are protected throughout pregnancy until perhaps the last 3 to 4 weeks before delivery. The sleep disturbances about which term gravidas complain appear to be based on increased periods of wakefulness after sleep onset.

AB  - There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders, as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

AB  - Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age-related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post-partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post-partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well-being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi-factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well-being.

AB  - Objective Greater acculturation is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in Mexican-American women, but the mechanisms by which acculturation influences perinatal outcomes are unclear. Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women. Methods Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep, acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social support. Results Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. These findings have implications for prevention and treatment of maternal mental health disorders, which may adversely affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable Mexican-American population.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep patterns and fatigue of both mothers and fathers before and after childbirth. The authors used wrist actigraphy and questionnaires to estimate sleep and fatigue in 72 couples during their last month of pregnancy and 1st month postpartum. Both parents experienced more sleep disruption at night during the postpartum period as compared to the last month of pregnancy. Compared to fathers, with their stable 24-h sleep patterns over time, mothers had less sleep at night and more sleep during the day after the baby was born. Sleep patterns were also related to parents' work status and type of infant feeding. Both parents self-reported more sleep disturbance and fatigue during the 1st month postpartum than during pregnancy. Mothers reported more sleep disturbance than fathers, but there was no gender difference in ratings of fatigue. At both time points, fathers obtained less total sleep than mothers when sleep was objectively measured throughout the entire 24-h day. Further research is needed to determine the duration of sleep loss for both mothers and fathers, to evaluate the effect of disrupted sleep and sleep loss on psychosocial functioning and job performance, and to develop interventions for improving sleep patterns of new parents.

AB  - Objective: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. Design: Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. Setting: Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents' homes. Participants: Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation. Methods: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables. Results: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time. Conclusion: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in a large sample of women across all months of pregnancy.Methods: A total of 2427 women completed an Internet-based survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Berlin questionnaire, International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) question set, and a short version of the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI).Results: Across all months of pregnancy, women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient nighttime sleep (38%), and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent nighttime awakenings (100%), and most women took daytime naps (78%). Symptoms of insomnia (57%), sleep-disordered breathing (19%), and restless legs syndrome (24%) were commonly endorsed, with no difference across the month of pregnancy for insomnia, sleep-disorder breathing, daytime sleepiness, or fatigue. In addition, high rates of pregnancy-related symptoms were found to disturb sleep, especially frequent urination (83%) and difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position (79%).Conclusions: Women experience significant sleep disruption, inadequate sleep, and high rates of symptoms of sleep disorder throughout pregnancy. These results suggest that all women should be screened and treated for sleep disturbances throughout pregnancy, especially given the impact of inadequate sleep and sleep disorders on fetal, pregnancy, and postpartum outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother-infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum.Methods: The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants' sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms.Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months.Conclusion: Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping.

AB  - Prematurity, delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the primary cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Extensive research on its prevention and management reveals that corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and cytokines play significant roles in the development of preterm labor. These substances also influence sleep, suggesting a possible, but previously unexplored, association between sleep pattern changes and preterm labor. Thus, in order to begin a systematic examination of this potentially important relationship, this study explored subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women.The Bi-Dimensional Stress Model, which describes the influence of physiological and psychosocial stress in stimulating the immune and endocrine responses associated with preterm birth, provided the theoretical framework for this study. The design consisted of a convenience sample of 220 subjects participating in a descriptive, prospective, comparative study. Subjects completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during routine antenatal visits in the second trimester of pregnancy. Delivery outcome data identified those subjects who delivered preterm.Sleep latency, a component of the PSQI and a measure of the period from 'lights out' to sleep onset, was longer in those who delivered preterm compared to those who delivered at term. The daytime dysfunction score, a component of the PSQI and a measure of problems with maintenance of alertness, was higher in those who experienced a term delivery. No differences were detected between the preterm and term groups in the total scores of the other primary variables (PSQI, ESS, and PSS), in the other sleep variables measured by the PSQI (sleep efficiency, total sleep time), or in the other component scores of the PSQI. The preterm group reported more cigarette smoking, previous preterm births, and experienced more twin gestations than the term group. However, only previous preterm birth and sleep latency were predictive of preterm birth.This study represents the first investigation to explore the potential relationship between sleep and preterm labor. Outcomes from this research suggest a possible, relationship between sleep onset insomnia and preterm birth. In addition, recommendations for further research are identified.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based study. SETTING: Passo Fundo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 2,285 newborns. INTERVENTIONS: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age < or = 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women ( n = 245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed.

AB  - Studies indicate that sleep is disturbed throughout the maternity cycle. The sleep disturbance, leading to reduced sleep time, has been associated with a variety of physical, behavioral, and psychological problems. When these are superimposed on the normal pregnancy and child birth, the potential for altered health is increased. Nursing intervention to identify sleep deficit and promote sleep is required at all stages of the maternity cycle. A knowledge of sleep structure and the role of each stage of sleep is a prerequisite in understanding the value of sleep in health.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality of life in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional design, 492 women (292 pregnant and 200 non-pregnant healthy controls) were included in this study between November 2014 and June 2015. Participants completed a survey on sociodemographic characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The PSQI total and EQ-5D scores of pregnant women were significantly worse than the controls (P= .017 and P < .001, respectively). Linear regression analysis showed that only pregnancy status was related to PSQI scores (/5 = .117; P = .009). Compared with the first trimester, the risk of poor sleep quality increased 2.11-fold in the second trimester (P= .048) and 1.86-fold in the third trimester (P= .054). Compared with the first trimester, EQ-5D scores significantly decreased in the second (P= .038) and third (P < .001) trimesters. Sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women were worse than those of nonpregnant healthy controls. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of deteriorations in sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women.

AB  - Background: Sleep is one of the most basic human requirements. This research aims at determining the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life among high-risk pregnant women in Tabriz, Iran, in 2015.Materials and Methods: This research was a sectional study done on 364 qualified women in 28-36 weeks of pregnancy suffering from mild preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The sampling was done as convenience. Personal-social-midwifery questionnaire, Pittsburg sleep quality, and quality of life in pregnancy (QOL-ORAV) were used for gathering data. Multivariate linear regression model was used for determining the relationship between sleep quality and its subsets with quality of life and controlling confounders.Findings: In the current study, the prevalence of sleep disturbance was 96.4%. Mean (SD) of the total score of sleep quality was 10.1 (4.1) and the total score of quality of life was 61.7 (17.3). According to Pearson's correlation test, there was statistically significant relationship between quality of life and sleep quality and all its subsets except sleep duration and use of sleep medication (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, according to the multivariate linear regression model, sleep latency, day time dysfunction, health status, and home air-conditioning were related with quality of life.Discussion: The findings of current research show that sleep quality is low among high-risk pregnant women and quality of life is medium. So, it is necessary that required training is given by health cares for improving sleep quality and quality of life to mothers.

AB  - Sleep disorders are a common problem during pregnancy and may affect quality of life. This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2-stage cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015. About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

AB  - PurposeBecause sleep is essential for normal pregnancy-associated physiological changes and healthy fetal development it is important to provide advice to first trimester expectant mothers in order to enhance self-care. Therefore, the aims of the present study are to clarify first trimester sleep quality and sleepiness characteristics, and to elucidate the affects of stress on sleep and sleepiness characteristics.MethodsSelf-administered questionnaires were distributed to 46 first trimester expectant mothers who were recruited from outpatient departments of two hospitals in Hiroshima, Japan between April 2007 and January 2008. The questionnaire was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a sleep log, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).ResultsThe average global score of the PSQI (PSQIG) was 6.67 (+/-3.20), and 65.2% of participants exceeded the cut-off score. Participants with higher perceived stress had significantly higher PSQIG scores (r=0.38, n=46, p<0.01). There was a positive correlation with PSQIG (r=0.40, n=46, p<0.01) and regularity of bedtime, indicating that participants with well-regulated daily habits have lower PSQIG scores. The average ESS score was 10.1 (+/-4.3), with 50.0% of participants scoring 11 points or higher. Moreover, primipara had higher scores than multipara (un-paired t (44)=2.52, p <0.05), and those participants with more children had lower scores (r=-0.32, n=46, p<0.05). Sleepiness duration and nap duration were not significantly different for parity. For employment (employed or not-employed), nap duration was significantly different (un-paired t (27)=2.27, p<0.05), however, there was no significant difference in sleepiness duration.ConclusionThis study has shown that first trimester expectant mothers have markedly poor sleep quality and higher levels of sleepiness when compared to women of the same age in the general population. In addition, this study suggests that sleep quality is improved by controlling stress and by having well regulated sleep habits.

AB  - Background Pregnant women with complications including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during the second and third trimesters. Methods We enrolled 56 women in their second or third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations were measured as a biological indicator of stress. Results PSS scores and subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the second and third trimesters, respectively). Mean one-day values for SIgA were 168.3 and 205.7 μg/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester. Discussion This investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared with the second trimester.

AB  - Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24) that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) ≥ 5 were included, with a total of 11,002 participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality. Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M = 5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of PSQI scores ≥5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet underdiagnosed and under-investigated. We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms.Material and Methods: A total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.Results: Poor general sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per night, and too-early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared with mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow up. In late pregnancy, depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy.Conclusions: We found deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were only cross-sectionally associated. Our study calls for further research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

AB  - Hypothesis. Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was investigated. Study Design. In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland], dosage at physician’s consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). Methods. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Results. Patients were 61 ± 10.4 years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 ± 3.62 to 9.1 ± 3.61 (P < .01), and ESS changed from 8.4 ± 3.18 to 7.1 ± 3.98 (P < .05). There was no change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6 patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion. B pinnatum may be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.
