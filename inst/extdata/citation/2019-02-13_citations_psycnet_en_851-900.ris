N2  - Compared ultrasound behavioral recordings of 18 low-risk fetuses of at least 37 completed weeks gestation and recordings of the same variables at 3–5 days postnatally. Comparison of the frequency of eye, limb, and body movements revealed that the fetal states 1F and 2F were comparable to quiet sleep (Sl) and REM sleep (S2). The heart rate in each of the 3 states in the fetus was about 20 beats per min higher than in the corresponding post-natal (PN) state, although the states were similar. States 1F and 2F accounted for a higher observation of the fetus than states S1 and S2 in the neonatal observations. State S3 (quiet awake) always and only occurred in the PN observations in association with feeding. Movements observed in S5 (crying) were not significantly different from 2F.

N2  - Reviews the pharmacologic properties of cocaine (COC) as related to a model of mechanisms for developmental injury secondary to COC exposure and the published literature on the adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes associated with COC use during pregnancy. The literature suggests both acute and possible long-term sequelae of in utero COC exposure. There may be moderate to severe developmental sequelae secondary to structural malformations in the CNS and to perinatal conditions presenting risk to the CNS. There may also be transient and long-term problems in more subtle dimensions of developmental functioning, such as motor skills or language development. Difficulties with behavioral regulation may manifest as irritability, sleep, and feeding problems, and difficult temperament in the young infant.

N2  - Recorded Doppler velocity waveforms from atrioventricular valves in the hearts of 20 healthy human fetuses at 36–38 wks of gestation during 2 behavioral states: 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). Behavioral states were identified by simultaneous recording of fetal heart rate, gross body movements, and eye movements. No significant changes were found in the ratios between the velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active ventricular filling at the level of mitral and tricuspid valves when measurements obtained during 1F and 2F were compared. During 2F, left ventricular output increased and right ventricular output decreased, resulting in a marked modification of the right to left cardiac output ratio. Data suggest that behavioral states influence fetal cardiac hemodynamics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Fetal lambs in 9 ewes were prepared for chronic intrauterine recording of behavioral states and breathing movements during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Pilocarpine (0.5, 1, 2, 4, mg iv) administered directly to the fetus produced an immediate change from quiet sleep to arousal and a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of fetal breathing movements. These effects on behavioral states and breathing movements were blocked by atropine sulfate but not by methylatropine. It is concluded that the increased incidence of breathing movements are due, in part, to increased arousal at the expense of quiet sleep. The fetus alternates between arousal and REM sleep, which results in sustained breathing movements. These effects of pilocarpine are mediated primarily via central muscarinic sites of action.

N2  - Reviews the development of circadian rhythms and the neuronal mechanisms underlying their generation (particularly the suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN] of the hypothalamus). Based on perinatal animal studies and data from human fetuses and/or preterm infants it was concluded that although human circadian rhythms are present as early as 29 wks of gestation, maternal circadian rhythms (generated by the mother's SCN) are important for the optimal functioning of the endogenous fetal biological clock. The significance of environmental cues for entrainment is also discussed; a longer duration of exposure to the cyclic environment (including light–dark cycle and periodic maternal care) leads to earlier entrainment in infants as young as 35 wks of conceptional age.

N2  - Records the impact of childbearing on EEG sleep in women with a previous history of affective disorders. Women who were psychiatrically asymptomatic for at least 1 yr, and who had an absence of known psychological risk factors were used in this sample. 34 Ss (mean age of 28.8 yrs) participated. It was hypothesized that disrupted sleep would precede the onset of affective dysregulation in Ss with a lifetime history of depression during the childbearing period. All-night EEG sleep recordings were obtained in Ss' homes. The sleep systems of Ss with a history of depression were more fragile and showed some of the stigmata of depression, even in the absence of mood disturbance. This supports the association between sleep abnormalities and vulnerability to mood disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep problems can tear a family apart. Basing her work on more than ten years' experience in the baby clinic of a family medical practice and the Tavistock Clinic, London, Dilys Daws looks beyond the symptom of sleep disturbance in babies to the underlying family dynamics. Her form of brief psychoanalytic therapy, which is proving to be very successful, combines attention to the individual baby's daily patterns, the parents' memories of the pregnancy and birth and their thoughts about their relationship with each other. Daws offers a space for linking the meaning of not sleeping to deeper problems of separation and individuation between mother and baby, and illustrates her work with rich clinical vignettes. The book is not only theoretically illuminating but will be of practical help to professionals and parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, REM sleep deprivation, or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for feminine (FSB) and masculine sexual behavior (MSB). Immobilization induced an impairment of MSB and a facilitation of FSB. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in MSB when compared with intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REM deprivation group displayed a major impairment of MSB, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. Water immersion seemed to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of MSB; Ss did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. Changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress seem to be linked to the nature of the stressor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Investigated changes in sleep quality during pregnancy, using the sleep EEG, in 9 healthy women on 2 consecutive nights during each trimester of pregnancy. Waking after sleep onset increased from the 2nd (TR2) to the 3rd (TR3) trimester, whereas REM sleep decreased from the 1st trimester (TR1) to TR2. Spectral analysis of the EEG in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep revealed a progressive reduction of power density in the course of pregnancy. In REM sleep, the spindle frequency range was not affected, and a minor reduction of power density in some frequency bins below 12 Hz was present only in TR3. Results document major alterations of the pregnancy sleep EEG that are not evident from the sleep scores and that may be associated with pregnancy hormonal changes. Findings confirm the need to complement sleep recordings with analysis of the EEG. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This book covers the history of dream interpretation, not only in Europe, but also in Asia, Africa, and ancient America. It shows and documents that the workings of the dynamic unconscious on dreams was not the discovery of Freud, but that the ancient Kemetic Egyptians of 3000 BC knew of it and used it in therapy and religious practices. [This book] explores . . . the profound influence of family life and family consciousness on dream dynamics and material.  Along with chapters on modern dream studies, author Bruce Bynum explores dreams and the clinical problems associated with sleep; various kinds of unusual or anomalous dreams that include precognitive, telepathic, and psychokinetic dreams . . . ; family dreams and family dynamics that are associated with ACOA [adult children of alcoholics] families; and pregnancy and family dreams. The last section of the book explores the further reaches of dreaming in family life—dreams and healing, lucid dreaming, dreams and death, and how an understanding of dreams, both ancient and contemporary, deepens our insight into philosophy and life.

Pregnant long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice were exposed to 3 or 4 g/kg ethanol or maltose-dextrin twice per day for Days 7–28 of pregnancy. Offspring temperatures were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7 through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each day of testing, compared with all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from those of controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Seven of the original women returned for a 2nd study 3–5 mo postpartum. During late pregnancy, Ss showed increased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a lower sleep efficiency (SE) in comparison with the control group. The percentage of REM sleep was significantly decreased and the pecentage of Stage 1 significantly increased compared with the nonpregnant Ss. At 3–5 mo postpartum, a significant reduction in WASO and increased SE was noted. Women in late pregnancy exhibit primarily sleep maintenance difficulties as a result of the discomfort, aches, and pains that are associated with pregnancy.

N2  - Reviews data on developmental disorders occurring in the fetus in diabetic pregnancy, focusing on the functional development of the CNS and on the techniques for studying this during the embryonic and fetal periods. Techniques for fetal behavioral teratogenicity testing in general are described, with maternal diabetes as an example. Maternal diabetes increases the risk for structural malformations of the fetal CNS. Abnormal functional development of the fetal nervous system exists also in diabetic pregnancy, even when well controlled. Indicative of this are a delayed emergence of fetal movement patterns in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, altered regulation of fetal breathing movements and delayed and/or disturbed emergence of fetal behavioral states (sleep–wake cycles) in the 3rd trimester, and continuity of poor behavioral state organization, immature EEG patterns, and a high incidence of periodic breathing in the neonatal period.

N2  - Explored the range of possible sleep-inducing techniques that are foreseen by pregnant women for their unborn infants. 120 primiparous women (19–42 yrs old) were interviewed about their sources of information about infant sleep, whether infant sleep could or should be induced, how this might be done, and why infants wake. Results show that most Ss believed that sleep is a spontaneous phenomenon, nevertheless they foresaw using sleep- inducing techniques. Caressing was preferred as a sleep-inducing technique, followed by rocking, talking and singing. Awakenings were mostly ascribed to malaise and hunger; sufficient sleep was rarely cited. The wide range of sleep-inducing techniques expectant mothers were willing to use, together with the contradictory belief about sleep spontaneity; suggests that they did not have a consistent concept of infant sleep.

N2  - Addressed the use of behaviorally defined sleep and wake states for detecting or predicting abnormal development in high risk newborn infants. One case of a relatively low risk 32-wk gestation infant is used to illustrate that immediate subjective impressions by a trained observer may reveal information useful to the medical staff without having to wait for the lengthy computer analyses usually performed with this assessment technique. A 2nd case illustrates a situation in which sleep/wake assessment by a trained observer assisted the medical team in confirming their diagnosis of massive brain damage and loss of function in an anencephalic newborn. The use of sleep variables in evaluating other behavioral and medical conditions in the young infant is also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In Exp I, the diurnal temperature rhythm (DTR) of 20 female rats was measured through gestation, lactation, and the postlactational period, with the finding that rhythm amplitude decreased during gestation and increased during lactation. Phase changes were also common features of the DTR during these states. In Exp II, drinking rhythms in 12 females were measured during lactation and postlactation, with the finding that phase and amplitude changes were similar to the DTR changes seen in Exp I. In Exp III, the behavior of lactating females was correlated with their DTR, and there was a consistent internal organization between behavior and body temperature regardless of the degree of change in the DTR.

N2  - 57 infants exposed to PCP in utero were followed for the first year of life. 36 (65%) of the 55 Ss for whom birth records were available manifested symptoms of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome, including 16 (52%) of those whose mothers denied opiate abuse during pregnancy. Temperament problems were noted in 47% of the Ss and sleep problems in 14%. The majority of Ss grew normally, but a larger than expected number started out small and remained small. Attachment behavior was abnormal in 17%. Most Ss were cared for by their natural mother. PCP toxicity needs to be considered when evaluating babies with signs of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Discusses the assessment of cortisol in saliva as a proven and reliable reflection of the respective unbound hormone in blood. An overview of methods of salivary cortisol assessment is presented, including RIAs and liquid chromatography. A comparison of cortisol levels in saliva and serum suggests that salivary cortisol assessment is closely correlated with cortisol levels in blood. The circadian rhythm of cortisol and cortisol responses during pregnancy is examined, and the use of saliva samples for the clinical evaluation of Cushing's disease and melancholic depression is discussed. The effects of psychological stress, physical exercise, and relaxation on salivary cortisol are also described. Possible future applications of salivary cortisol assessment include the investigation of a correlation between stress, cortisol, and disease relapse.

N2  - Investigated the development of sleep-cycle and sleep-state characteristics in premature and full-term newborns. Polygraph recordings were done on 38 normal, appropriate for gestational age newborns, born at 30 to 41 wks of gestation. All infants fell asleep in active sleep (AS). Postwaking AS was significantly shorter than the next AS. Mean sleep-cycle duration increased from approximately 46 min at 31–34 wks of conceptional age (CNA) to 70 min at 35–36 wks CNA. In all infants stable, >5 min AS and quiet sleep (QS) periods, as defined by EEG and REM criteria were observed. Indeterminate sleep was about 30% of the total sleep cycle at 31–34 wks; it decreased to 12% at 35–36 wks. Both duration and percentage of AS and QS significantly increased at 35–36 wks and remained stable up to 39–41 wks CNA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Investigated fetal behavior in 12 normal pregnancies after 41 wks of gestation as compared to 12 control term fetuses. Ss underwent a behavioral study using cardiotocography to record the heart rate, and 2 ultrasound scanners to observe body and eye movements. Fetuses in both groups clearly exhibited fetal behavior states (FBS) 1F–4F. The median percentage of FBS 3F and 4F (awake states) increased significantly from 6% in the term group to 21.5% in fetuses after 41 wks. FBS 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) decreased from 92% to 78% at the expense of FBS 2F which decreased from 78% to 58%. The fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP) associated with FBS 3F and 4F were impressive. For example, in FBS 4F, the FHRP showed large amplitude, prolonged accelerations that fused into a sustained tachycardia with only short periods of return to the baseline, resembling tachycardia with decelerations.

N2  - Examines the effects of childbearing on psychiatric symptoms and EEG sleep in the context of a personal history of affective disorder. Only women who were psychiatrically asymptomatic for at least 1 yr and who had an absence of known psychological risk factors were used in the sample. 34 Ss (mean age 28.8 yrs) participated. Clinical ratings were examined for the 2 groups stratified by history of affective disorder at 12, 24, and 36 wks' gestation and at 1, 4, and 8 mo postpartum. Ss with a positive history reported more depressive symptoms from 24 wks gestation through 1 mo postpartum. The findings support current views of diathesis stress in the etiology of childbearing-related disturbances. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Studied the affection of fetal music on the fetus from the aspects of the fetus' response, memory, and the principle factors in a double-blind research. Human Ss: 31 normal female Chinese adults (aged 23–35 yrs) (educated beyond junior high school) (Exp group). 29 normal female Chinese adults (aged 23–35 yrs) (educated beyond junior high school) (Control group). Ss with 28-wk pregnancy in Exp group were asked to let the fetus listen to a 30-min music tape before getting up in the morning and going to sleep at night and to record the moving time of the fetus (moving, frequency, continued time) while Ss in the control group were asked to record the moving time of the fetus only. After birth, the Exp Ss' babies listened to the music again and were stimulated by touch, light, and human voice; the fetus' responses were recorded and scored. The moving times and the responses of the fetuses in the 2 groups were compared. The relationships of the responses of the fetus and related factors—mother's age, attitude to pregnancy, education level, parents relationship, father's smoking, sex of the fetus, and types of neuroactivation—were studied using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).

N2  - Pregnant rats were given an ethanol-containing (6.7% v/v) liquid diet ad libitum between gestational day (GD) 6 and GD 18, pair-fed an isocaloric liquid control diet, or fed chow and water. Throughout the experiments, the Ss were fed either at 8 or 17 hrs. Ss were given a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine on GD 17 at one point during a 24-hr period. Pair-fed control Ss (fed at 8 or 17 hrs) consumed their food within 4 hrs of presentation. The ratio of cells passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle changed diurnally; the ratio was highest during the day and lowest during the night. In contrast, the ethanol-fed rats grazed on their food throughout the dark cycle regardless of when the food was presented. The elimination of the fetal circadian rhythm in cell proliferation during prenatal exposure to ethanol shows the resiliency of the developing system.

N2  - Maintained pregnant rats on a standard light–dark (LD) cycle or on fixed LD cycles with periods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hrs after Day 8 of gestation. At the end of gestation, activity was manifested at moments corresponding to the night of the standard regimen in most groups; it was delayed in the 2 groups lit up exclusively at evening (PM) hrs. In groups receiving light exclusively at morning (AM) hrs, birth times were delayed compared to the deliveries in groups receiving light at PM hrs only. An intermediate distribution of birth times was observed when AM and PM hrs were stimulated every 12 hrs. The apparent stability of the diurnal rhythm of activity and the difference in birth time distributions due to the period of light phase indicate that the regulation of birth time by photoperiod is due to a circadian mechanism in the rats. This mechanism implicates at least 2 endogenous systems which are apparently antagonists with regard to birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined pregnancy outcome and offspring development in alcohol-sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice following prenatal exposure to a high dose of ethanol or sucrose. Untreated controls were maintained for each line. Mortality at 10 days of age was greater for LS litters that received prenatal ethanol than for the LS sucrose or control litters. Prenatal ethanol did not affect mortality in SS litters. Thus, genetically based alcohol sensitivity seems to influence severity of alcohol-related birth defects.

N2  - Examined the course of physiological delivery in 170 normal female Ss (aged 16–39 yrs), to demonstrate the existence of a specific class of accompanying psychic states. Ss were compared with a control group of 12 women (aged 19��30 yrs) who had disclaimed pregnancy in their anamnesis. Structured interviews were supplemented with an examination of medical documents, opinion of the doctor in charge, and observation data, on the 2nd–4th day post-delivery. Ss were administered a specially devised questionnaire to assess their psychic status during the course of pre- and post-delivery. Results show presence of unusual psychic phenomena of varied content in 83.5% of Ss during gestation, which increased to 87.6% post-delivery. These phenomena occurred both during sleep and wakefulness periods. Findings implicate these as a distinct new class of altered psychic states.

N2  - Subjected pregnant rats to REM sleep deprivation during different stages of pregnancy to examine whether stress induces alterations in the emotional response of adult offspring. Ss whose mothers had been stressed during the 1st trimester showed a reduction in ambulatory behavior measured in the open field and a reduction in adrenal weight after open-field exposure. Ss exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) during the 2nd trimester showed an increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced clonic convulsions, and a reduction in adrenal weight after PTZ administration and open-field exposure. Ss exposed to PNS during the third trimester showed a reduction in susceptibility to PTZ. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Monitored the extent of disruption in the daily rhythm of core body temperature, nest attendance, activity, and wheel running in 7 Djungarian and 6 Siberian hamster females implanted intraperitoneal/ly (ip) with biotelemetric thermistors. The amplitude of each rhythm decreased during late gestation, culminating in a substantial disruption at parturition, and did not begin a recovery until the latter 3rd of lactation. In each species, the change in the core body temperature rhythm was primarily the result of an elevation in light phase body temperature to approximate the normally occurring dark phase temperature, although the disruption was more extensive in Siberian than in Djungarian Ss. As this maternal hyperthermia is associated with the provision of essential heat to the altricial litter, these species differences in the vulnerability to hyperthermia may constrain the reproductive success of these extreme cold adapted small mammals.

PTs of shortest gestation had longer time awake (concentrated in the daytime) than other Ss. It is concluded that PTs have accelerated development in terms of diurnal sleep–awake rhythm and decelerated development in terms of the content of sleep manifested by the amount of State 1.

These periods represent different hormonal conditions in the reproductive cycle. Infant-directed behavior increased in frequency during early and middle pregnancy, decreased around the time of parturition, and increased again during lactation. The frequency of infant-directed behavior also increased significantly in the 2 wks after infant loss during lactation. Results indicate that maternal responsiveness in nonhuman primates develops during pregnancy and it is probably hormonally regulated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined a pair of preterm, opposite-sex twins (aged 27–29 days old) during the lying-in period for behavioral and morphological effects of maternal alcohol and pentazocine abuse during pregnancy. The male's behavioral scores were more likely to be deviant from the standardized mean than the female's. The male was more irritable, both spontaneously and in response to specific stimuli; highly active while awake and handled for the presentation of stimuli; more active than average during sleep; and low on ratings that reflect the attitude of the examiner toward the infant. Findings imply individual and gender differences in behavioral susceptibility to teratogens. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Studied the relationship between sleep disruption prior to the birth, during labor, and in the early postpartum period and the subsequent development of the postnatal blues in 63 women. Results suggest that 2 factors, a night-time labor and a history of sleep disruption in the latter stages of pregnancy, may have etiological importance in the development of postnatal blues. Sleep disruption on the nights following the birth, the 3rd sleep factor studied, had little impact on the expression of the blues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined 96 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 wks of gestation to determine the relationship between the duration of the active state following a single vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) and the time spent in quiet sleep (QS). All fetuses were observed to enter QS prior to testing. After remaining in this state for 3 min, each fetus was randomized into 1 of 3 groups: no stimulation (Group I), a single 1 sec VAS delivered after 3–5 min of QS (Group II), and a single 1 sec VAS delivered after 18–20 min of QS (Group III). There was no effect of QS duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Group III fetuses behaved similarly to Group I fetuses. Group II fetuses remained in a more active state for a shorter length of time than did Group I or Group III fetuses. The mean duration of the active period was significantly less for Group II fetuses than for fetuses in either Groups I or III. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Identifies cocaine (COC) abuse, through all methods of administration, as a significant risk factor for stroke in people under 45 yrs. A stroke may follow COC use by as little as a few seconds or as long as 12 hrs. Persons with genetic pseudocholinesterase deficiency could be particularly susceptible to stroke or transient ischemic attack following COC use. COC use has been correlated with exacerbation of movement disorders and malignant hyperthermia characterized by hyperpyrexia, agitation, and profound hemodynamic instability. In addition, COC exerts a significant influence on the outcome of pregnancy and on neonatal behavior. Less commonly reported complications include optic neuropathy, brain abscess, migraine-like headaches, and cerebral atrophy. Psychiatric complications related to the abuse of COC include intoxication, withdrawal, delirium, delusional disorders, panic attacks, and impact on sleep and sexuality.

N2  - Instantaneous observations were made with video every 6 min for 3 days following the introduction of pregnant sows into one of the following 3 environments: loose housing (20 sows); semi-confinement (16 sows); and confinement (16 sows). Direct observations of straw-directed behavior after feeding were made. Bar-biting was most frequent in confinement and least in loose housing. Differences in frequencies of stereotypies apparently depended on the housing system. Many movements in the stereotyped sequences of the confined sows resembled elements in the nesting sequences of loose-housed sows, supporting the hypothesis that a thwarted movement pattern can develop into a stereotypy, which then may bear resemblance to normal movements.

N2  - At a full-term age, 24 channel recordings were obtained from 18 healthy preterm neonates of <32 wks gestation and were compared with those of 22 healthy full-term neonates. 34 Ss were followed for at least 18 mo; neurodevelopmental status of all Ss was assessed to be normal. Six mean spectral values were calculated from each corresponding minute of digitized data. Each group displayed significant differences among sleep-state segments for all spectral values. Significant differences in EEG spectral values were noted among states of sleep for both preterm and full-term Ss of similar postconceptional term ages. Mean EEG spectral values per minute in preterm Ss differed from those of full-term Ss during specific segments of the neonatal EEG sleep cycle, with preterm Ss demonstrating lower spectral values in the alpha, beta, delta, and theta frequency ranges, depending on the segment of the sleep cycle.

N2  - A reciprocal cross study was conducted in an animal model using C57BL/6J (B6) and long-sleep (LS) mice. B6 and LS dams were reciprocally mated to B6 or LS males producing 4 embryonic genotype groups: the true-bred B6B6 and LSLS genotypes, and the genetically similar B6LS and LSB6 genotypes (the F₁ genotype). Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of sucrose on Day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on Gestation Day 18, weighed, and assessed for soft tissue or skeletal malformations. Results showed a greater litter weight deficit and increased total malformation rate in ethanol-exposed F₁ litters carried by B6 mothers compared to ethanol-exposed F₁ litters carried by LS mothers. Maternal genetic factors were important determinants of susceptibility to prenatal alcohol effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Exp 1 examined the effects of periodic feeding (food cue) on circadian rhythmicity in pups from pregnant rats with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The phase of drinking behavior rhythm was examined in pups reared in constant darkness beginning at weaning. In 2 of the uncued control litters, pup phases at weaning were scattered. In the 4 control litters where within-litter coordination of phase was observed, the average litter phase was unpredictable. In contrast, Ss' drinking rhythms were synchronized within and between litters, suggesting that prenatal food cue entrained fetuses. Similar results were obtained when offspring of SCN-lesioned cued dams were fostered to lesioned, uncued dams on day of birth (Exp 2), indicating that the effects of food cue occur prenatally. Redundant mechanisms appeared to communicate time-of-day information to the fetus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

The preterm group was comprised of children who were born between 32 and 37 wks gestation and weighed between 1,500 and 2,500 g at birth, making it a "low-risk" group. Behavior was measured with the Behaviour Questionnaire of N. Richman et al (1982) and maternal mental health was measured with the Malaise Inventory of M. Rutter et al (1970). The preterm group showed significantly more problems when certain individual behaviors were considered, namely sleep related problems, tempers and dependence. The preterm group had also had significantly more accidents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Prenatal treatment with the D₁-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 or cocaine induces expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the fetal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Weaver et al., 1992). Because the induction of c-fos gene expression in the SCN has been implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light in mature animals, the present study investigated whether prenatal dopaminergic activation entrains the fetal circadian pacemaker. Injections of SKF 38393 (8 mg/kg) were given to pregnant, SCN-lesioned hamsters during the last 5 d of gestation and the phases of the offspring’s wheel-running activity rhythms were measured on postnatal day 20. Pregnant hamsters were each given two injections/day 12 hr apart, but only one of the injections each day contained SKF 38393. One group of hamsters received the drug at 0800 hr while another group received the drug at 2000 hr. The offspring from these treatment groups showed average phases that differed by 11.3 hr, demonstrating that prenatal SKF 38393 set the phase of the offspring’s circadian rhythms. These results suggest that the fetal circadian pacemaker can be entrained by dopaminergic activation. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes demonstrated that a single injection of SKF 38393 on the last day of gestation induced c-fos gene expression in the fetal hamster SCN and that mRNA for the D₁-dopamine receptor was present in the SCN at that time. It is possible that maternal entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker, which normally occurs during development, is mediated by dopaminergic activation within the fetal hypothalamus.

N2  - [book section covering several chapters]  "The Detection of Deception: Some Scientific, Societal, and Cultural Considerations" / John J. Furedy / focus . . . on the specific-issue version of the polygraph, where the aim is to detect deception concerning a particular event (usually a crime)  "Visual Evoked Potentials to Stimuli in Apparent Motion" / M. L. Manning and D. C. Finlay / spatial response patterns associated with visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from 8 subjects to a continuously cycling (3Hz) two stimulus apparent motion (AM) display are reported  "Habituation of the P300 to Target Stimuli: Are Arousal and Attention Factors?" / Pietro Badia, William J. Lammers, John Harsh and Nancy Wesensten / two experiments using an "oddball" task were performed to assess the conditions leading to a P300 decrement in amplitude with repeated testing (habituation) and the conditions leading to a recovery of amplitude (dishabituation)  "Effect of Noise on the Mismatch Negativity of the Event-Related Potential of the Human Brain" / Sirkka Mäntysalo and Tapani Salmi / suggest that under active attention a neuronal trace left by a standard tone frequency can survive weak, but not a loud environmental noise  "Topographical Mapping of Event Related Potentials in Dementia" / M. Hunter / attempted to . . . use a topographic mapping technique to . . . describe ERP [event-related potential] data in dementing subjects  "Event-Related Potentials in Attention-Deficit and Learning Disabled Children" / Steven Schwartz, Tracey Adams and Annette C. Hall / event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from attention deficit disordered, learning disabled and normal children as well as from a group of normal adults  "The 1/F Frequency-Fluctuation of Background EEG During Children's TV Watching" / Tomoyuki Yoshida and Takayoshi Kaneko / investigated the influence of TV-watching on children's brain activity from the standpoint of frequency fluctuations of EEGs  "Arousal from Sleep and the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome" / John Trinder, Neville Newman, Amanda Kay, Felicity Whitworth, Michael Le Grande and Kerry Jordan / respiratory failure during sleep is generally accepted as the cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) / argued that this hypothesis is not a sufficient explanation / reports three studies which have investigated the responsiveness of infants to vibrotactile and auditory stimuli  "Laboratory Studies on a Potential Stress Indicator in Field Research: The Palmar Sweat Index" / Thomas Koehler and Claus Voegele  "Influence of Psychological Stress and Oxytocin Treatment on Central and Hormonal Response Systems in Rattus Norvegicus" / Janice L. Muir / investigate manipulation of pregnant females and the subsequent effects of this treatment on hormonal and central response systems during lactation  "Mechanism of Emotional Blushing" / Peter D. Drummond / the relationship between ratings of embarrassment and changes in facial blushing and sweating was investigated  "Revision of the Baroreceptor Hypothesis on the Basis of a New Cardiac Cycle Effect" / Christoph Wölk and Manfred Velden / modulation of the CNS by the cardiovascular system: revision of the baroreceptor hypothesis / cardiac cycle experiments  "Psychobiological Study of 3 Groups of Subjects Performing a Polar Expedition" / G. Deklunder, J. Rivolier and G. Cazes / a follow up study of hormonal responsiveness in a stressful environment was performed in the members of 3 polar expeditions (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
