AB  - INTRODUCTION: Placental histologic examination can assist in revealing the
      mechanism leading to preterm birth. Accumulating evidence suggests an association
      between intrauterine pathological processes, morbidity and mortality of premature
      infants, and their long term outcome. Neonatal brain activity is increasingly
      monitored in neonatal intensive care units by amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) and
      indices of background activity and sleep cycling patterns were correlated with
      long term outcome. We hypothesized an association between types of placental
      lesions and abnormal neonatal aEEG patterns. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      association between the placental lesions observed in extreme preterm deliveries,
      and their neonatal aEEG patterns and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This
      prospective cohort study included extreme premature infants, who were born </= 28
      weeks of gestation, their placentas were available for histologic examination,
      and had a continues aEEG, soon after birth)n = 34). Infants and maternal clinical
      data were collected. aEEG data was assessed for percentage of depressed daily
      activity in the first 3 days of life and for sleep cycling. Associations of
      placental histology with clinical findings and aEEG activity were explored using 
      parametric and non-parametric statistics. RESULTS: Twenty two out of the 34
      newborns survived to discharge. Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) or 
      chorioamnionitis were associated with placental lesions consistent with fetal
      amniotic fluid infection (AFI) or maternal under perfusion (MUP) (P < 0.05).
      Lesions consistent with fetal response to AFI were associated with absence of SWC
      pattern during the 1st day of life. Fetal-vascular-thrombo-occlusive lesions of
      inflammatory type were negatively associated with depressed cerebral activity
      during the 1st day of life, and with aEEG cycling during the 2nd day of life
      (P<0.05). Placental lesions associated with MUP were associated with depressed
      neonatal cerebral activity during the first 3 days of life (P = 0.007).
      CONCLUSIONS: Depressed neonatal aEEG patterns are associated with placental
      lesions consistent with maternal under perfusion, and amniotic fluid infection of
      fetal type, but not with fetal thrombo-oclusive vascular disease of inflammatory 
      type. Our findings highlight the association between the intrauterine mechanisms 
      leading to preterm parturition and subsequent depressed neonatal cerebral
      function early after birth, which eventually may put premature infants at risk
      for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has been proposed as a major
      contributor of glucocorticoid-mediated programming of the fetal
      hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, with later adverse health
      consequences. However, evidence linking maternal stress to maternal cortisol
      values during pregnancy is inconclusive. A possible explanation for this is that 
      other maternal factors overshadow any potential effects of stress on cortisol
      levels. We studied a large cohort of pregnant women with extensive data on
      pregnancy characteristics to determine the respective contributions of
      biological, environmental and psychosocial stress factors to cortisol levels in
      pregnancy. METHODS: We used data from 3039 women from the Amsterdam Born Children
      and their Development-study cohort. Serum cortisol was measured in blood,
      collected at the first prenatal visit, at different gestational ages
      (median=91days, range=40-256days), and at various time points during the day
      (median=11:45h, range=08:00-18:30h). We assessed associations between maternal
      serum cortisol in pregnancy and biological factors, lifestyle factors and stress 
      factors, including depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, work stress,
      parenting stress and fatigue. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, variables that 
      were associated with higher cortisol levels in pregnancy were lower maternal age 
      [1.5nmol/l, 95%CI (0.6-2.4)], being nulliparous [21.5 nmol/l (15.9-27.1)], lower 
      pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) [1.3nmol/l (0.3-2.4)], higher C-reactive
      protein (CRP) [1.0nmol/l (0.4-1.5)], carrying a female fetus [9.2nmol/l
      (1.8-16.5)], non-smoking [14.2nmol/l (0.6-27.7)], sufficient sleep [8.5nmol/l
      (0.9-16.1)], and being unemployed [12.7nmol/l (2.2-23.2)]. None of the
      psychosocial stressors was significantly associated with serum cortisol levels in
      pregnancy. A total of 32% of all variance in cortisol was explained by
      gestational age, maternal age, time of day, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, CRP, fetal
      sex, smoking behavior, self-reported sleep sufficiency, and employment.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that maternal cortisol during pregnancy is mainly
      affected by biological and lifestyle factors, but not by psychosocial factors. We
      suggest that psychosocial stress in pregnancy might program the fetus through
      other mechanisms than through altering maternal cortisol levels.

PG  - R280-R289

AB  - The long-term consequences of early life nicotine exposure are poorly defined.
      Approximately 8-10% of women report smoking during pregnancy, and this may
      promote aberrant development in the offspring. To this end, we investigated
      potential enduring effects of perinatal nicotine exposure on murine sleep and
      affective behaviors in adulthood (~13-15 wk of age) in C57Bl6j mice. Mothers
      received a water bottle containing 200 microg/ml nicotine bitartrate dihydrate in
      2% wt/vol saccharin or pH-matched 2% saccharin with 0.2% (vol/vol) tartaric acid 
      throughout pregnancy and before weaning. Upon reaching adulthood, offspring were 
      tested in the open field and elevated plus maze, as well as the forced swim and
      sucrose anhedonia tests. Nicotine-exposed male (but not female) mice had reduced 
      mobility in the open field, but no differences were observed in anxiety-like or
      depressive-like responses. Upon observing this male-specific phenotype, we
      further assessed sleep-wake states via wireless EEG/EMG telemetry. Following
      baseline recording, we assessed whether mice exposed to nicotine altered their
      homeostatic response to 5 h of total sleep deprivation and whether nicotine
      influenced responses to a powerful somnogen [i.e., lipopolysaccharides (LPS)].
      Males exposed to perinatal nicotine decreased the percent time spent awake and
      increased time in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, without changes to REM
      sleep. Nicotine-exposed males also displayed exaggerated responses (increased
      time asleep and NREM spectral power) to sleep deprivation. Nicotine-exposed
      animals additionally had blunted EEG slow-wave responses to LPS administration.
      Together, our data suggest that perinatal nicotine exposure has long-lasting
      effects on normal sleep and homeostatic sleep processes into adulthood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal,
      obstetric and post partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will
      present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum,
      and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9
      months. METHODS: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were
      extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children.
      Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale,
      the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal
      Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form
      12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications,
      obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also
      collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers
      and fathers Results: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than
      fathers (p < 0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own
      health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very
      rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health
      status. DISCUSSION: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased
      risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these
      factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for
      predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders.

PG  - 863-870
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.6654 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and
      its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances in pregnancy. METHODS: A cohort of
      1,563 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were recruited from prenatal
      clinics between March 2007 and December 2010. Demographic, pregnancy, and
      delivery data were extracted from medical records and sleep information was
      collected with questionnaires. To diagnose RLS, we used standardized criteria of 
      RLS symptoms and frequency that were developed by the International Restless Legs
      Study Group. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate the
      association of RLS and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances (poor sleep
      quality, daytime sleepiness, poor daytime function) and delivery outcomes.
      RESULTS: Overall 36% of the pregnant women had RLS, and half had moderate to
      severe symptoms. Compared to women without RLS, those with RLS were more likely
      to have poor sleep quality (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.7-2.9), poor daytime function (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.4), and excessive daytime
      sleepiness (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0). A dose-response relationship also was
      evident between RLS frequency and each of the sleep-wake disturbances. There was 
      no evidence for any association between RLS and delivery outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
      RLS is a significant contributor to poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and
      poor daytime function, all common and often debilitating conditions in pregnancy.
      Obstetric health care providers should be aware of these associations and screen 
      women for RLS. COMMENTARY: A commentary on this article appears in this issue on 
      page 857.

TI  - Soluble (Pro)renin Receptor and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome: Oxidative
      Stress in Brain?
LID - E1313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms18061313 [doi]
AB  - (Pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) is a multi-functional molecule that is related to
      both the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (v-ATPase), an
      ATP-dependent multi-subunit proton pump. Soluble (P)RR (s(P)RR), which consists
      of the extracellular domain of (P)RR, is present in blood and urine. Elevated
      plasma s(P)RR concentrations are reported in patients with chronic kidney disease
      and pregnant women with hypertension or diabetes mellitus. In addition, we have
      shown that plasma s(P)RR concentrations are elevated in patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Interestingly, the levels are elevated in parallel
      with the severity of OSAS, but are not related to the presence of hypertension or
      the status of the circulating RAS in OSAS. It is known that v-ATPase activity
      protects cells from endogenous oxidative stress, and loss of v-ATPase activity
      results in chronic oxidative stress. We hypothesize that hypoxia and subsequent
      oxidative stress, perhaps in the brain, may be one of the factors that elevate
      plasma s(P)RR levels in OSAS.

AB  - AIMS: To explore the experiences of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, and the 
      relationships between perceptions of glucose control, attitudes to technology and
      glycaemic responses with regard to closed-loop insulin delivery. METHODS: We
      recruited 16 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes [mean +/- sd age 34.1 +/- 4.6
      years, duration of diabetes 23.6 +/- 7.2 years, baseline HbA1c 51+/-5 mmol/mol
      (6.8 +/- 0.6%)] to a randomized crossover trial of sensor-augmented pump therapy 
      vs automated closed-loop therapy. Questionnaires (Diabetes Technology
      Questionnaire, Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey) were completed before and after each
      intervention, with qualitative interviews at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS:
      Women described the benefits and burdens of closed-loop systems during pregnancy.
      Feelings of improved glucose control, excitement and empowerment were
      counterbalanced by concerns about device visibility, obsessive data checking and 
      diminished attentiveness to hyper- and hypoglycaemia symptoms. Responding to
      questionnaires, eight participants felt less worry about overnight hypoglycaemia 
      and that diabetes 'did not run their lives'; however, five reported that
      closed-loop increased time thinking about diabetes, and three felt it made sleep 
      and preventing hyperglycaemia more problematic. Women slightly overestimated
      their glycaemic response to closed-loop therapy. Most became more positive in
      their technology attitudes throughout pregnancy. Women with more positive
      technology attitudes had higher degrees of overestimation, and poorer levels of
      glycaemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Women displayed complex psychosocial responses to
      closed-loop therapy in pregnancy. Perceptions of glycaemic response may diverge
      from biomedical data.

AB  - Major depression occurs in 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with many
      negative effects for mother and child, yet treatment options are scarce. To our
      knowledge, this is the first published randomised controlled trial on Internet
      delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this group. OBJECTIVE: To test
      the efficacy of a pregnancy adapted version of an existing 10-week ICBT-program
      for depression as well as assessing acceptability and adherence DESIGN:
      Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Online and telephone. POPULATION OR SAMPLE:
      Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10-28 at intake) currently
      suffering from major depressive disorder. METHODS: 42 pregnant women (gestational
      week 12-28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual
      (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with 
      the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used.
      Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed. RESULTS:
      The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post
      treatment (p < 0.001, Hedges g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e.
      achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of
      treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable
      to implemented ICBT for depression. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and no
      long-term evaluation. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression
      is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in
      larger trials to validate these promising findings.

      Management.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a common neurological sensorimotor disorder in
      western countries, has gained more and more attention in Asian countries. The
      prevalence of RLS is higher in older people and females. RLS is most commonly
      related to iron deficiency, pregnancy and uremia. The RLS symptoms show a
      significant circadian rhythm and a close relationship to periodic limb movements 
      (PLMs) in clinical observations, while the pathophysiological pathways are still 
      unknown. The diagnostic criteria have been revised in 2012 to improve the
      validity of RLS diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested an important role of
      iron decrease of brain in RLS pathophysiology. Dopaminergic (DA) system
      dysfunction in A11 cell groups has been recognized long ago from clinical
      treatment and autopsy. Nowadays, it is believed that iron dysfunction can affect 
      DA system from different pathways and opioids have a protective effect on DA
      system. Several susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms such as BTBD9 and
      MEIS1, which are thought to be involved in embryonic neuronal development, have
      been reported to be associated with RLS. Several pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological treatment are discussed in this review. First-line treatments
      of RLS include DA agents and alpha2delta agonists. Augmentation is very common in
      long-term treatment of RLS which makes prevention and management of augmentation 
      very important for RLS patients. A combination of different types of medication
      is effective in preventing and treating augmentation. The knowledge on RLS is
      still limited, the pathophysiology and better management of RLS remain to be
      discovered.

PG  - 321-327
LID - 10.1538/expanim.17-0035 [doi]
AB  - Daily torpor is a physiological adaptation in mammals and birds characterized by 
      a controlled reduction of metabolic rate and body temperature during the resting 
      phase of circadian rhythms. In laboratory mice, daily torpor is induced by
      dietary caloric restriction. However, it is not known which nutrients are related
      to daily torpor expression. To determine whether dietary protein is a key factor 
      in inducing daily torpor in mice, we fed mice a protein-restricted (PR) diet that
      included only one-quarter of the amount of protein but the same caloric level as 
      a control (C) diet. We assigned six non-pregnant female ICR mice to each group
      and recorded their body weights and core body temperatures for 4 weeks. Body
      weights in the C group increased, but those in the PR group remained steady or
      decreased. Mice in both groups did not show daily torpor, but most mice in a
      food-restricted group (n=6) supplied with 80% of the calories given to the C
      group exhibited decreased body weights and frequently displayed daily torpor.
      This suggests that protein restriction is not a trigger of daily torpor; torpid
      animals can conserve their internal energy, but torpor may not play a significant
      role in conserving internal protein. Thus, opportunistic daily torpor in mice may
      function in energy conservation rather than protein saving.

TI  - Survey of maternal sleep practices in late pregnancy in a multi-ethnic sample in 
      South Auckland, New Zealand.
PG  - 190
LID - 10.1186/s12884-017-1378-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Auckland Stillbirth study demonstrated a two-fold increased risk 
      of late stillbirth for women who did not go to sleep on their left side. Two
      further studies have confirmed an increased risk of late stillbirth with supine
      sleep position. As sleep position is modifiable, we surveyed self-reported late
      pregnancy sleep position, knowledge about sleep position, and views about
      changing going-to-sleep position. METHODS: Participants in this 2014 survey were 
      pregnant women (n = 377) in their third trimester from South Auckland, New
      Zealand, a multi-ethnic and predominantly low socio-economic population. An
      ethnically-representative sample was obtained using random sampling.
      Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently
      associated with non-left sided going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy.
      RESULTS: Respondents were 28 to 42 weeks' gestation. Reported going-to-sleep
      position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%),
      either side (39%) and other (6%). Two thirds (68%) reported they had received
      advice about sleep position. Non-left sleepers were asked if they would be able
      to change to their left side if it was better for their baby; 87% reported they
      would have little or no difficulty changing. Women who reported a non-left
      going-to-sleep position were more likely to be of Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI
      1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity; had a lower body
      mass index (BMI) (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89-0.96); and were less likely to sleep on
      the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 
      going-to-sleep position in the last week was side-lying in 91% of participants.
      The majority had received advice to sleep on their side or avoid supine sleep
      position. Sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed was associated with
      going-to-sleep on the left side. Most non-left sleepers reported their sleeping
      position could be modified to the left side suggesting a public health
      intervention about sleep position is likely to be feasible in other multi-ethnic 
      communities.

TI  - Does preterm period sleep development predict early childhood growth
      trajectories?
PG  - 1047-1052
LID - 10.1038/jp.2017.91 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the relationship between sleep state
      development across the preterm and early post-term periods and subsequent growth 
      trajectories from 1 to 27 months corrected age. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
      analysis of data collected prospectively from 111 preterm infants (34 weeks
      gestation) who participated in a multi-site longitudinal study. Separate
      longitudinal parallel process models were calculated for each sleep state (active
      and quiet sleep) and growth (weight, length and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores)
      variable to estimate the associations between their developmental trajectories.
      RESULTS: Significant associations were identified between the trajectories of
      quiet sleep and weight, active sleep and weight, quiet sleep and BMI, and active 
      sleep and BMI. No statistically meaningful associations were identified between
      the trajectories of early childhood length and the preterm sleep states.
      CONCLUSION: Faster preterm period sleep development appears to predict more
      favorable early childhood growth trajectories, particularly for weight,
      indicating preterm sleep may be an important biomarker for subsequent growth
      outcomes.

AB  - Exercise contributes significantly to the maternal and fetal wellbeing during
      pregnancy. Traditionally women were advised to refrain from exercise during
      pregnancy, but newer evidence has shown this to be false. Theoretically, there
      were concerns of premature labor and risks of delivering smaller infants to women
      who exercised during pregnancy. A recent meta-analysis which included over 2000
      women showed that aerobic exercise and strength/toning exercise of moderate
      intensity that was performed 3-4 days per week throughout the pregnancy were not 
      associated with an increased risk for preterm births or low birth weight infants 
      for normal-weight women with singleton, uncomplicated pregnancies. Despite
      recommendations from physicians to begin or maintain an exercise program during
      pregnancy, only about 40% of the patients exercise. A pregnant patient can be
      easily motivated to improve her health as well as the health of her unborn child,
      but these recommendations need to be practical, with persistent follow-up by the 
      physician. Physical exercise can help with some common discomforts and even
      prepare one's body for labor and delivery.[1][2][3] A sedentary lifestyle during 
      pregnancy is associated with significant health risk of deep venous thrombosis
      which threatens the lives of the infant and mother. A sedentary lifestyle can
      lead to obesity or at least significantly contribute to persistent obesity.
      Obesity is of epidemic proportions in the U.S., and obesity during pregnancy
      carries elevated risks for major complications. The obese patients are also more 
      likely to suffer spontaneous abortions. Also, they have a higher risk of neural
      tube defects which include cleft palate, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus. Obesity
      also put the pregnant patient at risk for gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,
      sleep apnea, macrosomia, preterm birth and even stillbirth. The higher the
      women's BMI, the greater the risk of stillbirth. Exercise is safe in these women 
      and is encouraged. Even the previously sedentary patient is encouraged to start
      an exercise program early in pregnancy. It is also considered safe in some
      high-risk pregnancies such as those with chronic hypertension and gestational
      diabetes. Contraindications will be discussed later.

AB  - The placenta is important in providing a healthy environment for the fetus and
      plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Fetal and
      placental developments are influenced by epigenetic programming. There is some
      evidence that PE is controlled to an altered circadian homeostasis. In a nested
      case-control study embedded in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, we obtained
      placental tissue, umbilical cord leukocytes (UCL), and human umbilical venous
      endothelial cells of 13 early-onset PE, 16 late-onset PE and 83 controls
      comprising 36 uncomplicated and 47 complicated pregnancies, i.e. 27 fetal growth 
      restricted and 20 spontaneous preterm birth. To investigate the associations
      between PE and the epigenetics of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes in
      placental and newborn tissues, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed
      using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip and a candidate-gene approach
      using ANCOVA was applied on 939 CpGs of 39 circadian clock and clock-controlled
      genes. DNA methylation significantly differed in early-onset PE compared with
      spontaneous preterm birth at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (3.73(E-5) </= p </=
      0.016) and at 21 CpGs in UCL (1.09(E-5)</= p </= 0.024). In early-onset PE
      compared with fetal growth restriction 2 CpGs in placental tissue (p < 0.05) and 
      8 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (4.78(E-5)</= p </= 0.049) were significantly
      different. Moreover, significantly different DNA methylation in early-onset PE
      compared with uncomplicated controls was shown at 6 CpGs in placental tissue
      (1.36(E-4)</= p </= 0.045) and 11 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (2.52(E-6)</= p 
      </= 0.009). No significant associations were shown with late-onset PE between
      study groups or tissues. The most differentially methylated CpGs showed
      hypomethylation in placental tissue and hypermethylation in uncomplicated
      controls. In conclusion, DNA methylation of circadian clock and clock-controlled 
      genes demonstrated most differences in UCL of early-onset PE compared with
      spontaneous preterm birth. Implications of the tissue-specific variations in
      epigenetic programming for circadian performance and long-term health need
      further investigation.

TI  - Going to sleep in the supine position is a modifiable risk factor for late
      pregnancy stillbirth; Findings from the New Zealand multicentre stillbirth
      case-control study.
PG  - e0179396
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0179396 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test the primary hypothesis that maternal
      non-left, in particular supine going-to-sleep position, would be a risk factor
      for late stillbirth (>/=28 weeks of gestation). METHODS: A multicentre
      case-control study was conducted in seven New Zealand health regions, between
      February 2012 and December 2015. Cases (n = 164) were women with singleton
      pregnancies and late stillbirth, without congenital abnormality. Controls (n =
      569) were women with on-going singleton pregnancies, randomly selected and
      frequency matched for health region and gestation. The primary outcome was
      adjusted odds of late stillbirth associated with self-reported going-to-sleep
      position, on the last night. The last night was the night before the late
      stillbirth was thought to have occurred or the night before interview for
      controls. Going-to-sleep position on the last night was categorised as: supine,
      left-side, right-side, propped or restless. Multivariable logistic regression
      adjusted for known confounders. RESULTS: Supine going-to-sleep position on the
      last night was associated with increased late stillbirth risk (adjusted odds
      ratios (aOR) 3.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 7.78) with a population
      attributable risk of 9.4%. Other independent risk factors for late stillbirth
      (aOR, 95% CI) were: BMI (1.04, 1.01 to 1.08) per unit, maternal age >/=40 (2.88, 
      1.31 to 6.32), birthweight <10th customised centile (2.76, 1.59 to 4.80), and <6 
      hours sleep on the last night (1.81, 1.14 to 2.88). The risk associated with
      supine-going-to-sleep position was greater for term (aOR 10.26, 3.00 to 35.04)
      than preterm stillbirths (aOR 3.12, 0.97 to 10.05). CONCLUSIONS: Supine
      going-to-sleep position is associated with a 3.7 fold increase in overall late
      stillbirth risk, independent of other common risk factors. A public health
      campaign encouraging women not to go-to-sleep supine in the third trimester has
      potential to reduce late stillbirth by approximately 9%.

TI  - The Safety of Ingested Caffeine: A Comprehensive Review.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00080 [doi]
AB  - Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world. Natural
      sources of caffeine include coffee, tea, and chocolate. Synthetic caffeine is
      also added to products to promote arousal, alertness, energy, and elevated mood. 
      Over the past decade, the introduction of new caffeine-containing food products, 
      as well as changes in consumption patterns of the more traditional sources of
      caffeine, has increased scrutiny by health authorities and regulatory bodies
      about the overall consumption of caffeine and its potential cumulative effects on
      behavior and physiology. Of particular concern is the rate of caffeine intake
      among populations potentially vulnerable to the negative effects of caffeine
      consumption: pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents, young
      adults, and people with underlying heart or other health conditions, such as
      mental illness. Here, we review the research into the safety and safe doses of
      ingested caffeine in healthy and in vulnerable populations. We report that, for
      healthy adults, caffeine consumption is relatively safe, but that for some
      vulnerable populations, caffeine consumption could be harmful, including
      impairments in cardiovascular function, sleep, and substance use. We also
      identified several gaps in the literature on which we based recommendations for
      the future of caffeine research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to test the efficacy of a family-based, multi-component
      intervention focused on infants of African-American (AA) mothers and families, a 
      minority population at elevated risk for pediatric obesity, versus a child safety
      attention-control group to promote healthy weight gain patterns during the first 
      two years of life. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND METHODS: The design is a two-group
      randomized controlled trial among 468 AA pregnant women in central North
      Carolina. Mothers and study partners in the intervention group receive
      anticipatory guidance on breastfeeding, responsive feeding, use of non-food
      soothing techniques for infant crying, appropriate timing and quality of
      complementary feeding, age-appropriate infant sleep, and minimization of
      TV/media. The primary delivery channel is 6 home visits by a peer educator, 4
      interim newsletters and twice-weekly text messaging. Intervention families also
      receive 2 home visits from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant.
      Assessments occur at 28 and 37weeks gestation and when infants are 1, 3, 6, 9,
      12, and 15months of age. RESULTS: The primary outcome is infant/toddler growth
      and likelihood of overweight at 15months. Differences between groups are expected
      to be achieved through uptake of the targeted infant feeding and care behaviors
      (secondary outcomes) and change in caregivers' modifiable risk factors
      (mediators) underpinning the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: If successful in
      promoting healthy infant growth and enhancing caregiver behaviors, "Mothers and
      Others" will have high public health relevance for future obesity-prevention
      efforts aimed at children younger than 2years, including interventional research 
      and federal, state, and community health programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Objectively measured short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint in pregnancy
      are associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that among nonpregnant
      adults, sleep duration may be an important risk factor for chronic disease.
      Although pregnant women commonly report poor sleep, few studies objectively
      evaluated the quality of sleep in pregnancy or explored the relationship between 
      sleep disturbances and maternal and perinatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Our objective 
      was to examine the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration,
      timing, and continuity (measured via wrist actigraphy) and maternal
      cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity specific to pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This 
      was a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women. Women were recruited between
      16 0/7 and 21 6/7 weeks' gestation. They were asked to wear a wrist actigraphy
      monitor and complete a daily sleep log for a period of 7 consecutive days. The
      primary sleep exposure variables were the averages of the following over the
      total valid nights (minimum 5, maximum 7 nights): short sleep duration during the
      primary sleep period (<7 h/night), late sleep midpoint (midpoint between sleep
      onset and sleep offset >5 am), and top quartile of minutes of wake time after
      sleep onset and sleep fragmentation index. The primary outcomes of interest were 
      a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed
      preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational 
      diabetes mellitus. We used chi(2) tests to assess associations between sleep
      variables and categorical baseline characteristics. Crude odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals were estimated from univariate logistic regression models to
      characterize the magnitude of the relationship between sleep characteristics and 
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. For associations
      significant in univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was used to
      explore further the association of sleep characteristics with pregnancy outcomes.
      RESULTS: In all, 901 eligible women consented to participate; 782 submitted valid
      actigraphy studies. Short sleep duration and a later sleep midpoint were
      associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.11-4.53; and odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval,
      1.24-5.36, respectively) but not of hypertensive disorders. A model with both
      sleep duration and sleep midpoint as well as their interaction term revealed that
      while there was no significant interaction between these exposures, the main
      effects of both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational
      diabetes remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.01-4.19; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval,
      1.13-4.97, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting separately for age, body 
      mass index, and race/ethnicity, both short sleep duration and later sleep
      midpoint remained associated with gestational diabetes. No associations were
      demonstrated between the sleep quality measures (wake after sleep onset, sleep
      fragmentation) and hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes. CONCLUSION:
      Our results demonstrate a relationship between short sleep duration and later
      sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes. Our data suggest independent
      contributions of these 2 sleep characteristics to the risk for gestational
      diabetes in nulliparous women.

TI  - [Effect of Sleep in Early Pregnancy on Gestational Diabetes: a Prospective
      Study.]
PG  - 964-968
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of sleep status in early pregnant women 
      on the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: In this
      prospective study,542 pregnant women in early pregnancy were selected as
      subjects.The sleep time,insomnia,pre-gestational body mass and basic information 
      of the subjects were collected by the trained investigators through
      questionnaire.At the 24(th) to 28(th) pregnant week,the body mass of each subject
      was measured and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted.The diagnosis
      of GDM was followed the guidelines of diagnose and treatment of gestational
      diabetes mellitus in China (2014).A non-conditional logistic regression method
      was adopted to analyze the correlation between sleep status of early pregnant
      women and the occurrence of GDM. RESULTS: The numbers of subjects in sleep
      deficiency group,sleep sufficiency group and sleep excessive group were 16
      (2.95%),268 (49.45%) and 258 (47.60%),respectively.The incidences of GDM for
      sleep deficiency group,sleep sufficient group,and sleep excessive group were
      62.50%(10/16),25.75%(69/268) and 22.09% (57/258),respectively,the difference was 
      statistically significant (chi(2)=11.280,P<0.05).Compared with either sleep
      sufficiency or sleep excessive group,sleep deficiency group had higher GDM
      occurrence rate with statistically significant
      (chi(2)=8.410,11.218,P<0.017).Insomnia subjects in early pregnancy were 137
      (25.28%).The incidences of GDM in insomnia group and normal group were 32.12% and
      22.72% respectively,the difference was statistically significant (chi(2)=4.813,
      P<0.05).After adjusting the confounding factors [age,education,pre-pregnant body 
      mass index (BMI),gained body mass in early and medium pregnancy,family history of
      type-2 diabetes,gravidity,parity,smoke,drink,exercise and
      occupation],non-conditional logistic regression results show that sleep
      deficiency for early pregnant women was an independent risk factor for the
      occurrence of GDM [odds ratio (OR)=7.38,95% confidence interval (CI):
      2.25-24.17].However,the association between insomnia and the occurrence of GDM
      was not found. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep deficiency in early pregnancy may be a risk
      factor for the occurrence of GDM.

TI  - Acute cocaine exposure elicits rises in calcium in arousal-related laterodorsal
      tegmental neurons.
PG  - e00282
LID - 10.1002/prp2.282 [doi]
AB  - Cocaine has strong reinforcing properties, which underlie its high addiction
      potential. Reinforcement of use of addictive drugs is associated with rises in
      dopamine (DA) in mesoaccumbal circuitry. Excitatory afferent input to
      mesoaccumbal circuitry sources from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT).
      Chronic, systemic cocaine exposure has been shown to have cellular effects on LDT
      cells, but acute actions of local application have never been demonstrated. Using
      calcium imaging, we show that acute application of cocaine to mouse brain slices 
      induces calcium spiking in cells of the LDT. Spiking was attenuated by
      tetrodotoxin (TTX) and low calcium solutions, and abolished by prior exhaustion
      of intracellular calcium stores. Further, DA receptor antagonists reduced these
      transients, whereas DA induced rises with similar spiking kinetics. Amphetamine, 
      which also results in elevated levels of synaptic DA, but via a different
      pharmacological action than cocaine, induced calcium spiking with similar
      profiles. Although large differences in spiking were not noted in an animal model
      associated with a heightened proclivity of acquiring addiction-related behavior, 
      the prenatal nicotine exposed mouse (PNE), subtle differences in cocaine's effect
      on calcium spiking were noted, indicative of a reduction in action of cocaine in 
      the LDT associated with exposure to nicotine during gestation. When taken
      together, our data indicate that acute actions of cocaine do include effects on
      LDT cells. Considering the role of intracellular calcium in cellular
      excitability, and of the LDT in addiction circuitry, our data suggest that
      cocaine effects in this nucleus may contribute to the high addiction potential of
      this drug.

TI  - Maternal Night-Fasting Interval during Pregnancy Is Directly Associated with
      Neonatal Head Circumference and Adiposity in Girls but Not Boys.
PG  - 1384-1391
LID - 10.3945/jn.117.250639 [doi]
AB  - Background: Synchrony between daily feeding-fasting signals and circadian rhythms
      has been shown to improve metabolic health in animals and adult humans, but the
      potential programming effect on fetal growth is unknown.Objective: We examined
      the associations of the maternal night-fasting interval during pregnancy with
      offspring birth size and adiposity.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of
      mother-offspring dyads within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy
      Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. For 384 mothers aged 30.8 +/- 4.8 y (mean +/- SD), the
      night-fasting interval at 26-28 wk of gestation was determined from a 3-d food
      diary based on the average of the fasting duration at night (1900-0659).
      Offspring birth weight, length, and head circumference were measured and
      converted to weight-for-gestational age (GA), length-for-GA, and head
      circumference-for-GA z scores, respectively, by using local customized percentile
      charts. The percentage of neonatal total body fat (TBF) was derived by using a
      validated prediction equation. Multivariable general linear models, stratified by
      child sex, were performed.Results: The mean +/- SD maternal night-fasting
      interval was 9.9 +/- 1.3 h. In infant girls, each 1-h increase in the maternal
      night-fasting interval was associated with a 0.22-SD (95% CI: 0.05-, 0.40-SD; P =
      0.013) increase in birth head circumference-for-GA and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.19%,
      1.49%; P = 0.012) increase in TBF at birth, after adjustment for confounders. In 
      infant boys, no associations were observed between the maternal night-fasting
      interval and birth size or TBF.Conclusions: An increased maternal night-fasting
      interval in the late second trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased
      birth head circumference and TBF in girls but not boys. Our findings are in
      accordance with previous observations that suggest that there are sex-specific
      responses in fetal brain growth and adiposity, and raise the possibility of the
      maternal night-fasting interval as an underlying influence. This trial was
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between residential road traffic noise and
      fecundity estimated by time to pregnancy (TTP). DESIGN: We identified 65,201
      mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort with self-reported information on
      TTP collected through computer assisted telephone interviews. Road traffic noise 
      was modelled at all historical addresses and expressed as time-weighted means for
      periods corresponding to individual TTP. Associations were analyzed using
      logistic regression for analyses of dichotomous outcomes and ordinal logistic
      regression for TTP in four categories, adjusting for maternal age at conception, 
      disposable household income, education and air pollution (NOx). RESULTS: Ordinal 
      logistic regression showed a 10dB increase in road traffic noise to be associated
      with a 8% increased risk of 6-12month TTP (95% CI:1.03; 1.12) whereas we found no
      statistically significant associations for >/=12months TTP (OR=1.04, 95% CI:
      0.99; 1.09) when compared to 0-2months TTP. Similarly, when exploring TTP as a
      binary outcome we found a 10dB higher road traffic noise to be associated with a 
      5% higher risk of TTP of 6months or more (95% CI: 1.01; 1.08) as compared with
      <6months TTP, whereas when the cut-point was 12months TTP no association was
      found. CONCLUSION: Road traffic noise was associated with an increased risk of
      6-12month TTP, but not with risk of longer TTP, indicating that noise may have a 
      small impact on sub-fecundity.

TI  - The regulations and role of circadian clock and melatonin in uterine receptivity 
      and pregnancy-An immunological perspective.
LID - 10.1111/aji.12715 [doi]
AB  - During normal pregnancy, the mechanism by which the fetus escapes immunological
      rejection by the maternal womb remains elusive. Given the biological
      complexities, the immunological mechanism is unlikely to be simply an allograft
      response in acceptance or rejection of the early pregnancy. Circadian clock
      responsible for the mammalian circadian rhythm is an endogenously generated
      rhythm associated with almost all physiological processes including reproduction.
      There is now growing evidence to suggest that the circadian clocks are
      intricately linked to the immune system and pregnancy. When perturbed, the role
      of immune cells can be affected on maintaining the enriched vascular system
      needed for placentation. This alteration can be triggered by the irregular
      production of maternal and placental melatonin. Hence, the role of circadian
      rhythm modulators such as melatonin offers intriguing opportunities for therapy. 
      In this review, we evaluate the complex interaction between the circadian clock
      and melatonin within the immune system and their roles in the circadian
      regulation and maintenance of normal pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse factors associated with the susceptibility of early
      childhood caries (ECC), populations with a high risk of ECC were screened and
      guidance for ECC prevention was proposed. METHODS: A total of 392 children aged
      24 to 71 months were selected for oral examination in Qingdao. Parents or
      guardians of the participants completed the questionnaires and decayed missing
      filled surface (dmfs) were recorded. Differences in caries condition and oral
      health behaviour in different families were compared. Risk factors related to ECC
      were screened. The subjects were finally grouped based on the obtained dmfs into 
      three groups: caries-free, ECC and S-ECC (severe ECC). Association of risk
      factors with the caries status was analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, the
      chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There were significant
      differences among the caries-free, ECC and S-ECC groups in three parameters:
      eating too many sweets each day, brushing before and after sleeping, and whether 
      parents helped to brush (P<0.01). Combined factors such as the parents' level of 
      education, oral health knowledge, attitudes, the family's annual income, the age 
      of children when they start to brush and not brushing regularly were also
      significantly related to ECC (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed
      among the three groups for these factors, including birth condition and nursing
      state, physical condition of the mother during pregnancy, feeding situation, if a
      pacifier was used during sleep, duration of brushing, frequency of mouth rinsing 
      after meals each day and brushing with fluoride toothpaste (P >0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Eating a lot of sweets, an incorrect brushing method, starting brushing at a
      later stage and not brushing regularly are susceptible factors for ECC.
      Emphasising oral health knowledge to parents and guardians, conducting proper
      brushing methods, limiting the frequency of sweets being eaten and avoiding an
      inappropriate habit of eating sweets are very important factors in the prevention
      of ECC.

TI  - Narcolepsy with cataplexy and pregnancy: a case-control study.
PG  - 268-272
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12567 [doi]
AB  - This was a retrospective case-control study in 25 patients with narcolepsy with
      cataplexy and 75 women in the control group. Patients completed the questionnaire
      by Maurovich-Horvat et al. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496-512). We personally
      interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered
      questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and
      breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59
      pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease
      before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control
      group (P < 0.001); among them, extrinsic asthma was reported 11 times in the
      narcolepsy with cataplexy group (P < 0.005). Patients with narcolepsy with
      cataplexy more often had a single pregnancy compared with controls (P < 0.05).
      Gestational diabetes was more frequent in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy
      (P < 0.05). Induced deliveries were higher in controls (P < 0.009). No
      differences were found between the groups in terms of duration of pregnancies and
      complications during and after delivery, as during the puerperium. Neonates from 
      patients had heavier birth weight (P < 0.015). The breastfeeding period was
      longer in patients (P < 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs
      administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during 
      pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is
      the first case-control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to
      pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have
      pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes
      was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Caesarean sections,
      complications during delivery and normal perinatal period for infants were
      similar in both groups. Breastfeeding was longer in patients.

TI  - The effects of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation during late pregnancy on
      newborns' sleep.
PG  - 197-205
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12564 [doi]
AB  - Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is an emerging concern, as it can adversely
      affect the development of the offspring brain. This study was conducted to
      evaluate the effects of deprivation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the 
      third term of pregnancy on the sleep-wake profiles of neonates in the Wistar rat 
      model. Sleep-wake patterns were assessed through electrophysiological measures
      and behavioural observations during postnatal days 1-21 on pups born to REM
      sleep-deprived dams and control rats. Pups of REM sleep-deprived dams had active 
      sleep that was not only markedly higher in percentage during all the days
      studied, but also had reduced latency during later postnatal days 15-21. Quiet
      sleep and wake periods were lower. These factors, along with less frequent but
      longer sleep-wake cycles, indicated maturational delay in the sleep-wake neural
      networks. The disruption of time-bound growth of sleep-wake neural networks was
      substantiated further by the decreased slope of survival plots in the sleep
      bouts. Examination of altered sleep-wake patterns during early development may
      provide crucial information concerning deranged neural development in the
      offspring. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that maternal
      sleep deprivation during pregnancy can delay and impair the development of
      sleep-wake profile in the offspring.

TI  - Friedreich Ataxia
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is characterized by slowly
      progressive ataxia with onset usually before age 25 years (mean age at onset:
      10-15 yrs). FRDA is typically associated with dysarthria, muscle weakness,
      spasticity particularly in the lower limbs, scoliosis, bladder dysfunction,
      absent lower limb reflexes, and loss of position and vibration sense.
      Approximately two thirds of individuals with FRDA have cardiomyopathy, up to 30% 
      have diabetes mellitus, and approximately 25% have an "atypical" presentation
      with later onset or retained tendon reflexes. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of
      FRDA is established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in
      FXN. The most common type of variant, which is observed on both alleles in
      approximately 96% of individuals with FRDA, is an abnormally expanded GAA repeat 
      in intron 1 of FXN. The remaining individuals with FRDA are compound
      heterozygotes for an abnormally expanded GAA repeat in the disease-causing range 
      on one allele and another intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Clinical management guidelines have been
      published. Prostheses; walking aids and wheelchairs for mobility; speech,
      occupational, and physical therapy; pharmacologic agents for spasticity;
      orthopedic interventions for scoliosis and foot deformities; hearing devices for 
      auditory involvement; dietary modifications and placement of a nasogastric tube
      or gastrostomy for dysphagia; antiarrhythmic agents, anti-cardiac failure
      medications, anticoagulants, and pacemaker for cardiac disease; dietary
      modification, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin for diabetes mellitus;
      antispasmodics for bladder dysfunction; continuous positive pressure for
      obstructive sleep apnea; psychological support, both pharmacologic and
      counseling. Prevention of secondary manifestations: Active management of
      spasticity to prevent permanent contractures; aggressive treatment of scoliosis
      to prevent cardiopulmonary complications; treatment of diabetes to avoid
      complications related to inadequate treatment; treatment of cardiac complications
      to avoid arrhythmias; treatment of sleep apnea to present neurologic and
      cardiopulmonary complications of untreated sleep apnea. Surveillance: At least
      annual assessment of overall status; examination for complications including
      spasticity, scoliosis, and foot deformity; annual ECG, echocardiogram, and
      fasting blood sugar to monitor for diabetes mellitus; hearing assessment every
      two to three years; a low threshold for sleep study to investigate for
      obstructive sleep apnea. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Environments that place
      an individual at risk for falls such as rough surfaces for ambulant individuals; 
      excessive use of alcohol, which can increase ataxia; medications (e.g.,
      isoniazid, nitrofurantoin) that are known to cause nerve damage. Therapies under 
      investigation: Idebenone, histone deacetylase inhibitors, EPI-743, PPAR gamma
      agonists, nicotinamide, resveratrol, thiamine. GENETIC COUNSELING: FRDA is
      inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual
      has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic
      carrier, and a 25% chance of having no pathogenic variant. Carrier testing of
      at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if both FXN pathogenic variants
      have been identified in an affected family member.

LID - 10.1055/s-0043-106349 [doi]
AB  - Sleep related breathing disorders include central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA), sleep-related hypoventilation, and sleep-related hypoxia.
      These disorders are frequent and growing in clinical relevance. The related
      chapter of the S3 guideline "Non-restorative sleep/Sleep disorders", published by
      the German Sleep Society (DGSM), has recently been updated in November 2016.
      Epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutic procedures, and classification of sleep
      related disorders have been revised. Concerning epidemiology, a considerably
      higher mortality rate among pregnant women with OSA has been emphasized. With
      regards to diagnostics, the authors point out that respiratory polygraphy may be 
      sufficient in diagnosing OSA, if a typical clinical condition is given. For CSA, 
      recommendations were changed to diagnose CSA with low apnea rates present.
      Significant changes for treating CSA in patients with left ventricular
      dysfunction have been introduced. In addition, there is now to be differentiated 
      between sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxaemia. Obesity
      hypoventilation syndrome is discussed in more detail. This article sums up and
      comments on the published changes.

TI  - A Social Media Peer Group for Mothers To Prevent Obesity from Infancy: The
      Grow2Gether Randomized Trial.
PG  - 356-368
LID - 10.1089/chi.2017.0042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income
      families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook
      peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting
      healthy infant growth. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant 
      women (Medicaid insured, BMI >/=25 kg/m(2)) were randomized to the Grow2Gether
      intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants
      joined a private Facebook group of 9-13 women from 2 months before delivery until
      infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of 
      weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being.
      Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and
      acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth
      were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth
      between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using 
      quasi-least-squares regression. RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of
      intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported
      the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9
      months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors
      (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group (p = 0.01,
      effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to
      pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. 
      Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding
      beliefs or infant weight-for-length. CONCLUSIONS: A social media peer-group
      intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in
      families with infants at high risk of obesity.

TI  - Screening methods for obstructive sleep apnoea in severely obese pregnant women.
PG  - 239-244
LID - 10.1111/cob.12196 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an often-overlooked diagnosis, more prevalent
      in the obese population. Screening method accuracy, uptake and hence diagnosis is
      variable. There is limited data available regarding the obese pregnant
      population; however, many studies highlight potential risks of apnoeic episodes
      to mother and foetus, including hypertension, diabetes and preeclampsia. A total 
      of 162 women with a body mass index (BMI) >/= 35 were recruited from a tertiary
      referral hospital in the northwest of England. They were invited to attend three 
      research antenatal clinics, completing an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)
      questionnaire at each visit. A monitor measuring the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI)
      was offered at the second visit. Data taken from consent forms, hospital notes
      and hospital computer records were collated and anonymized prior to statistical
      analysis. A total of 12.1% of women had an ESS score of >10, suggesting possible 
      OSA. Rates increased throughout pregnancy, although unfortunately, the attrition 
      rate was high; 29.0% of women used the RUSleeping (RUS) meter, and only one
      (2.1%) met pre-specified criteria for OSA (AHI >/= 15). This individual had OSA
      categorized as severe and underwent investigations for preeclampsia, eventually
      delivering by emergency caesarean section due to foetal distress. The accuracy of
      the ESS questionnaire, particularly the RUS monitor, to screen for OSA in the
      pregnant population remains unclear. Further research on a larger sample size
      using more user-friendly technology to confidently measure AHI would be
      beneficial. There are currently no guidelines regarding screening for OSA in the 
      obese pregnant population, yet risks to both mother and foetus are well
      researched.

TI  - Hyperprolactinaemia - a problem in patients from the reproductive period to the
      menopause.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.5114/pm.2017.67364 [doi]
AB  - Hyperprolactinaemia especially affects women in reproductive age (90/100,000) but
      also often is diagnosed in menopause age and leads to disturbances in functioning
      of LH-RH neurons and, as a consequence, to a decrease of FSH and LH, which causes
      inhibition of oestradiol production. Prolactin is a peptide hormone,
      phylogenetically one of the oldest, stimulating cells of various organs, which is
      produced and secreted mainly by lactotrophic acidophilic cells of the anterior
      lobe of the pituitary. It influences the increase in the mass of the mammary
      glands, and stimulation and maintenance of lactation after delivery. There are a 
      number of factors apart of pregnancy, delivery, and lactation than can influence 
      secretion of the hormone in other physiological and pathological circumstances,
      like high-protein diet, stress, REM sleep, or neoplastic tumours, inflammatory
      diseases, chronic systematic diseases, thyroid hormonal changes, and drug intake.
      The purpose of this review is to summarise the current knowledge regarding the
      proper diagnosis and possible influence of hyperprolactinaemia on fertility and
      menopause symptoms and current treatment methods.

TI  - Associations between quality of life, physical activity, worry, depression and
      insomnia: A cross-sectional designed study in healthy pregnant women.
PG  - e0178181
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0178181 [doi]
AB  - Health-related quality of life (QOL) is reported to be reduced during pregnancy. 
      Associations between QOL, physical activity (PA), insomnia, depression and worry 
      are insufficiently investigated among pregnant women. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate QOL and PA patterns among healthy pregnant women, and to examine how 
      QOL might correlate to PA, sleep, worry and depression. This is an observational 
      cross-sectional study, conducted among a convenient sample of 141 healthy
      pregnant women using five questionnaires: WHOQOL-brief (WHO quality of life
      questionnaire, brief version, ISI (Insomnia Severity Index), PSWQ (Penn State
      Worry Questionnaire), ZSRDS (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale), and Pregnancy
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ). Pre-gestational BMI was inversely
      correlated to overall health while education was positively correlated to
      psychological health, social relationships and environment domains. Smoking
      before and during pregnancy significantly impacted the general health and
      psychological health. Total and light PA were positively correlated to
      psychological health and social relationships. Sports/exercise showed positive
      correlations with several QOL domains. Insomnia and depression were significantly
      associated with a decrease in all domains of QOL, while worries were associated
      with a decrease in physical, psychological and environmental domains. There were 
      significant negative correlations between ZSRDS scores and total activity. PA,
      worries, depression and insomnia affected QOL during pregnancy. Furthermore,
      pregnant women presenting depression had a reduced total PA. Sleep and mental
      health as well as encouraging PA during pregnancy are necessary to improve the
      quality of life of pregnant women.

TI  - Effect of a Counseling Session Bolstered by Text Messaging on Self-Selected
      Health Behaviors in College Students: A Preliminary Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e67
LID - 10.2196/mhealth.6638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The college experience is often the first time when young adults live
      independently and make their own lifestyle choices. These choices affect dietary 
      behaviors, exercise habits, techniques to deal with stress, and decisions on
      sleep time, all of which direct the trajectory of future health. There is a need 
      for effective strategies that will encourage healthy lifestyle choices in young
      adults attending college. OBJECTIVE: This preliminary randomized controlled trial
      tested the effect of coaching and text messages (short message service, SMS) on
      self-selected health behaviors in the domains of diet, exercise, stress, and
      sleep. A second analysis measured the ripple effect of the intervention on health
      behaviors not specifically selected as a goal by participants. METHODS: Full-time
      students aged 18-30 years were recruited by word of mouth and campuswide
      advertisements (flyers, posters, mailings, university website) at a small
      university in western Pennsylvania from January to May 2015. Exclusions included 
      pregnancy, eating disorders, chronic medical diagnoses, and prescription
      medications other than birth control. Of 60 participants, 30 were randomized to
      receive a single face-to-face meeting with a health coach to review results of
      behavioral questionnaires and to set a health behavior goal for the 8-week study 
      period. The face-to-face meeting was followed by SMS text messages designed to
      encourage achievement of the behavioral goal. A total of 30 control subjects
      underwent the same health and behavioral assessments at intake and program end
      but did not receive coaching or SMS text messages. RESULTS: The texting app
      showed that 87.31% (2187/2505) of messages were viewed by intervention
      participants. Furthermore, 28 of the 30 intervention participants and all 30
      control participants provided outcome data. Among intervention participants, 22
      of 30 (73%) showed improvement in health behavior goal attainment, with the whole
      group (n=30) showing a mean improvement of 88% (95% CI 39-136). Mean improvement 
      in any behavioral domains was not seen in the control group. Intervention
      participants also increased their exercise significantly compared with controls, 
      regardless of their self-selected goal category. The increased exercise was
      paralleled by significantly lower fasting glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: The health
      coaching session plus tailored SMS text messages improved self-selected health
      behaviors with a modest ripple effect to include unselected health behaviors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between sleep duration in early pregnancy 
      and fetal growth in a prospective cohort study of 3567 Chinese women. METHODS:
      Pregnant women at 8-16 weeks of gestation were interviewed using a
      semi-quantitative questionnaire to assess sleep duration. Birth weight and birth 
      length were measured by a midwife in the delivery room at birth; low birth weight
      (LBW) was defined as birth weight <2500 g and small for gestational age (SGA) was
      defined as <10th customized centile. RESULTS: The average age of participants was
      28.21 +/- 3.38 years old. The mean sleep duration was 8.39 +/- 1.13 h/day. A
      total of 1290 women sleeping >/=9 h/day, 1563 sleeping 8 to <9 h/day, 550
      sleeping 7 to <8 h/day, and 164 sleeping <7 h/day. Compared to the sleeping 8 to 
      <9 h/day group, birth length and birth weight of the sleeping <7 h/day group
      decreased by 2.42 mm (95% CI: -4.27, -0.58, p = 0.010) and 42.70 g (95% CI:
      -103.02, 17.62, p = 0.165), respectively; and risk of LBW and SGA of the sleeping
      <7 h/day group increased by 83% (95% CI: 0.59, 5.73, p = 0.297) and 56% (95% CI: 
      0.84, 2.92, p = 0.159), respectively; birth length of the sleeping <7 h/day group
      was decreased more in male babies, and among mothers without a midday napping
      habit or with a history of abortion (all p for interaction <0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Shorter sleep duration in early pregnancy was associated with birth length. Our
      findings indicate that midday napping may be a protective factor for birth length
      among pregnant women with shorter sleep duration.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.23645 [doi]
AB  - The organization of functional brain networks changes across human lifespan. The 
      present study analyzed functional brain networks in healthy full-term infants (N 
      = 139) within 1-6 days from birth by measuring neural synchrony in EEG recordings
      during quiet sleep. Large-scale phase synchronization was measured in six
      frequency bands with the Phase Lag Index. Macroscopic network organization
      characteristics were quantified by constructing unweighted minimum spanning tree 
      graphs. The cortical networks in early infancy were found to be significantly
      more hierarchical and had a more cost-efficient organization compared with MST of
      random control networks, more so in the theta and alpha than in other frequency
      bands. Frontal and parietal sites acted as the main hubs of these networks, the
      topological characteristics of which were associated with gestation age (GA).
      This suggests that individual differences in network topology are related to
      cortical maturation during the prenatal period, when functional networks shift
      from strictly centralized toward segregated configurations. Hum Brain Mapp

      depression.
PG  - 621-632
LID - 10.1007/s00737-017-0726-9 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality, and
      depression severity from pregnancy through 6-month postpartum in women with and
      without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Women (N = 215) were interviewed 
      during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to
      examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying
      variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression
      severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use
      antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements
      in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression
      severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout.
      Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using
      antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use
      significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on
      depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When
      prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more
      highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore,
      antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women 
      or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant
      negative mental and physical health outcomes.

TI  - Tyrosine Hydroxylase Deficiency
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency is associated with
      a broad phenotypic spectrum. Based on severity of symptoms/signs as well as
      responsiveness to levodopa therapy, clinical phenotypes caused by pathogenic
      variants in TH are divided into (1) TH-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (the
      mild form of TH deficiency), (2) TH-deficient infantile parkinsonism with motor
      delay (the severe form), and (3) TH-deficient progressive infantile
      encephalopathy (the very severe form). In individuals with TH-deficient
      dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5b, DYT-TH), onset is between age 12 months and 12
      years; initial symptoms are typically lower-limb dystonia and/or difficulty in
      walking. Diurnal fluctuation of symptoms (worsening of the symptoms toward the
      evening and their alleviation in the morning after sleep) may be present. In most
      individuals with TH-deficient infantile parkinsonism with motor delay, onset is
      between age three and 12 months. In contrast to TH-deficient DRD, motor
      milestones are overtly delayed in this severe form. Affected infants demonstrate 
      truncal hypotonia and parkinsonian symptoms and signs (hypokinesia, rigidity of
      extremities, and/or tremor). In individuals with TH-deficient progressive
      infantile encephalopathy, onset is before age three to six months. Fetal distress
      is reported in most. Affected individuals have marked delay in motor development,
      truncal hypotonia, severe hypokinesia, limb hypertonia (rigidity and/or
      spasticity), hyperreflexia, oculogyric crises, ptosis, intellectual disability,
      and paroxysmal periods of lethargy (with increased sweating and drooling)
      alternating with irritability. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of TH deficiency 
      is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in
      TH by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: All
      individuals with TH-deficient DRD demonstrate complete responsiveness of symptoms
      to levodopa (with a decarboxylase inhibitor). Individuals with TH-deficient
      infantile parkinsonism with motor delay demonstrate a marked response to
      levodopa. However, in contrast to TH-deficient DRD, the responsiveness is
      generally not complete and/or it takes several months or even years before the
      full effects of treatment become established. Some individuals are hypersensitive
      to levodopa and prone to side effects (i.e., dopa-induced dyskinesias which
      develop at initiation of levodopa treatment). Individuals with TH-deficient
      progressive infantile encephalopathy are extremely sensitive to levodopa therapy.
      In this very severe form, treatment with levodopa is often limited by intolerable
      dyskinesias. Prevention of primary manifestations: Levodopa therapy from early
      infancy may prevent manifestations of some symptoms and signs in TH-deficient
      infantile parkinsonism with motor delay; however, no levodopa trials in the early
      postnatal period of infants with this type of TH deficiency and biallelic TH
      pathogenic variants have been reported. Prevention of secondary complications:
      Side effects associated with levodopa (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting,
      significant suppression of appetite) may be ameliorated with dose adjustment and 
      supportive intervention. Surveillance: Examination by a movement disorder
      specialist in pediatric or adult neurology at least several times yearly.
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: The prokinetic agent Reglan((R)) and other related
      antidopaminergic agents. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Sibs of affected
      individuals should be examined for mild dystonic and/or parkinsonian symptoms or 
      unexplained gait disorders. It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger
      sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would
      benefit from treatment. GENETIC COUNSELING: TH deficiency is inherited in an
      autosomal recessive manner. Heterozygotes (carriers) are generally asymptomatic. 
      At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being
      affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of
      being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and
      prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both TH
      pathogenic variants in a family are known.

TI  - Effect of supervised exercise in groups on psychological well-being among
      pregnant women at risk of depression (the EWE Study): study protocol for a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 210
LID - 10.1186/s13063-017-1938-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with depression and/or anxiety prior to pregnancy are 
      at higher risk of preterm birth, breastfeeding problems, postpartum depression,
      and disruption of the mother-infant attachment. It is well documented that
      exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms 
      of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the
      effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize
      that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of
      antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper
      describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a
      supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or
      previous history of depression and/or anxiety. METHODS/DESIGN: The RCT is being
      carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen
      University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant
      women >/=18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a 
      psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of
      antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The 
      women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single
      fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the 
      intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the
      five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are
      symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability
      (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group
      exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard
      antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women
      will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a
      ratio of 1:1. DISCUSSION: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of
      knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of
      depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02833519 . Registered on

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women often suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD). GERD symptoms are known to influence the quality of life; however, there 
      is a lack of data in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to establish the
      impact of GERD symptoms on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during
      pregnancy. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study to
      investigate the impact of GERD symptoms on the HRQOL was carried out in 510
      pregnant women and 330 nonpregnant women as controls. Two validated
      questionnaires, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and the Quality of Life in
      Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire, were used. RESULTS: The study showed a
      significant negative impact on HRQOL in pregnant women with GERD symptoms. All
      five areas, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, vitality, food/drink problems,
      and physical/social functioning, were significantly reduced, but the most
      significant impact was on sleep (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia
      Questionnaire score -35%). Overall, quality of life in women with GERD worsened
      throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSION: GERD is frequently seen in pregnant women and
      has a negative impact on HRQOL, especially in late pregnancy. Therefore, there is
      a need for adequate therapy of GERD in pregnant women and HRQOL could be an
      adequate monitoring tool in this population.

TI  - Preterm infants at discharge: nap polysomnography versus 24-hour oximetry.
PG  - 1754-1759
LID - 10.1111/apa.13900 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia
      derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from
      modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge.
      METHODS: Infants born </=32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal
      intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their
      respiratory stability once they were >/=35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants
      were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or 
      any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry
      performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index
      (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive
      apnoea indices and correlations tested. RESULTS: Twenty-four infants completed
      the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified
      polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were
      significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants
      correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the
      modified polysomnography. CONCLUSION: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour
      oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in
      preterm infants ready for discharge.

TI  - Pulse Rate Measurement During Sleep Using Wearable Sensors, and its Correlation
      with the Menstrual Cycle Phases, A Prospective Observational Study.
PG  - 1294
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-01433-9 [doi]
AB  - An affordable, user-friendly fertility-monitoring tool remains an unmet need. We 
      examine in this study the correlation between pulse rate (PR) and the menstrual
      phases using wrist-worn PR sensors. 91 healthy, non-pregnant women, between 22-42
      years old, were recruited for a prospective-observational clinical trial.
      Participants measured PR during sleep using wrist-worn bracelets with
      photoplethysmographic sensors. Ovulation day was estimated with "Clearblue
      Digital-Ovulation-urine test". Potential behavioral and nutritional confounders
      were collected daily. 274 ovulatory cycles were recorded from 91 eligible women, 
      with a mean cycle length of 27.3 days (+/-2.7). We observed a significant
      increase in PR during the fertile window compared to the menstrual phase (2.1
      beat-per-minute, p < 0.01). Moreover, PR during the mid-luteal phase was also
      significantly elevated compared to the fertile window (1.8 beat-per-minute, p <
      0.01), and the menstrual phase (3.8 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01). PR increase in
      the ovulatory and mid-luteal phase was robust to adjustment for the collected
      confounders. There is a significant increase of the fertile-window PR (collected 
      during sleep) compared to the menstrual phase. The aforementioned association was
      robust to the inter- and intra-person variability of menstrual-cycle length,
      behavioral, and nutritional profiles. Hence, PR monitoring using wearable sensors
      could be used as one parameter within a multi-parameter fertility awareness-based
      method.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allostatic load (AL) measures the cumulative impact of chronic stress
      and is associated with adverse health outcomes. A novel scoring system has
      previously been developed for AL in early pregnancy that is associated with
      pre-eclampsia. It was hypothesized that AL, as identified by the present model,
      is associated with psychosocial stressors and, specifically, poor sleep quality. 
      METHODS: Women were selected from a low-risk, community-dwelling study population
      who enrolled at <15 weeks gestation. Nine physiologic components were divided
      among the domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function.
      Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association of AL with age,
      income, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Inventory of
      Depressive Symptoms (IDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare AL by race and educational attainment.
      RESULTS: A total of 103 women were identified, with: a mean age of 29.8 +/- 5.0
      years, 17.5% black, and mean gestational age 12.2 +/- 1.1 weeks. Allostatic load 
      was positively correlated with the PSQI (rho = 0.23, p = 0.018). There were no
      associations with age, income, prenatal distress, race, or depression scores.
      College-educated women had lower AL compared with those with less education (0.57
      +/- 0.43 vs 0.81 +/- 0.55, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Higher AL, measured by the
      pregnancy-specific model, was associated with poorer sleep quality and lower
      educational attainment, both of which were considered to be chronic stressors.
      These relationships were consistent with previous findings in non-pregnant
      populations, and suggest that AL may be useful for capturing the physiologic
      impact of chronic stress in early pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate medical
      comorbidity patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United
      States. PATIENTS/METHODS: This was a retrospective medical claims data analysis. 
      Truven Health Analytics MarketScan(R) Research Databases were accessed to
      identify individuals >/=18 years of age with >/=1 diagnosis code for narcolepsy
      (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 
      347.10, or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls
      without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, gender, region, and payer. Narcolepsy and 
      control subjects were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified
      by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification
      System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific
      subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) and depression. RESULTS: The final study group included 9312 subjects
      with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59%
      female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a
      statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories,
      the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and
      pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the
      narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds
      ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of
      the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and
      nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR
      3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy
      diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at
      significantly higher rates than matched controls.

TI  - Stress and its predictors in pregnant women: a study in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 97-102
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S131474 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although stress during pregnancy has negative effects on children's
      development and pregnant women's health, no study has assessed stress and its
      predictors among pregnant Saudi women. The aim of this study was to assess stress
      and identify its predictors in a sample of pregnant Saudi women. METHODS: A
      correlational study was carried out at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh,
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 438 pregnant women who attended the
      obstetrics/gynecology clinic. We collected data on their sociodemographic and
      oral health status. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
      RESULTS: The sample mean age was 30.6+/-5.4 years, and 33.4% of the sample
      reported high stress levels (PSS >/=20). The study revealed significantly high
      stress levels in women with no or low income, chronic disease, sleep deprivation,
      no teeth brushing, irregular eating patterns, gestational diabetes, and no family
      support (P<0.05). Self-reported oral health problems were significantly
      associated with high stress levels (P<0.05). A multiple linear regression model
      showed that no teeth brushing, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, gestational
      diabetes, and gingival redness predicted an increase in stress by a score of 3.6,
      2.4, 2.1, 1.4, and 1.4, respectively. CONCLUSION: It was estimated that three in 
      ten pregnant women in King Abdulaziz Medical City reported high stress levels.
      Our study shed light on the relationship between healthy habits, oral health
      status, and perceived stress in pregnant women. This research may help health
      care practitioners who provide care to pregnant women, to educate them in regard 
      to healthy habits, and to develop a program to reduce stress.

TI  - Early-Life Obesity Prevention: Critique of Intervention Trials During the First
      One Thousand Days.
PG  - 127-133
LID - 10.1007/s13679-017-0255-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critique the evidence from recent and ongoing obesity
      prevention interventions in the first 1000 days in order to identify evidence
      gaps and weaknesses, and to make suggestions for more informative future
      intervention trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Completed and ongoing intervention trials
      have had fairly modest effects, have been limited largely to high-income
      countries, and have used relatively short-term interventions and outcomes.
      Comparison of the evidence from completed prevention trials with the evidence
      from systematic reviews of behavioral risk factors shows that some life-course
      stages have been neglected (pre-conception and toddlerhood), and that
      interventions have neglected to target some important behavioral risk factors
      (maternal smoking during pregnancy, infant and child sleep). Finally, while
      obesity prevention interventions aim to modify body composition, few intervention
      trials have used body composition measures as outcomes, and this has limited
      their sensitivity to detect intervention effects. The new WHO Healthy Lifestyles 
      Trajectory (HeLTI) initiative should address some of these weaknesses. Future
      early obesity prevention trials should be much more ambitious. They should,
      ideally: extend their interventions over the first 1000 days; have longer-term
      (childhood) outcomes, and improved outcome measures (body composition measures in
      addition to proxies for body composition such as the BMI for age); have greater
      emphasis on maternal smoking and child sleep; be global.

      Chemicals.
PG  - 208-222
LID - 10.1007/s40572-017-0137-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Environmental toxicants are increasingly implicated in the
      global decline in metabolic health. Focusing on diabetes, herein, the molecular
      and cellular mechanisms by which metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs) impair
      energy homeostasis are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging data implicate MDC
      perturbations in a variety of pathways as contributors to metabolic disease
      pathogenesis, with effects in diverse tissues regulating fuel utilization.
      Potentiation of traditional metabolic risk factors, such as caloric excess, and
      emerging threats to metabolism, such as disruptions in circadian rhythms, are
      important areas of current and future MDC research. Increasing evidence also
      implicates deleterious effects of MDCs on metabolic programming that occur during
      vulnerable developmental windows, such as in utero and early post-natal life as
      well as pregnancy. Recent insights into the mechanisms by which MDCs alter energy
      homeostasis will advance the field's ability to predict interactions with
      classical metabolic disease risk factors and empower studies utilizing targeted
      therapeutics to treat MDC-mediated diabetes.

TI  - Timing for the Introduction of Cycled Light for Extremely Preterm Infants: A
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 294-310
LID - 10.1002/nur.21797 [doi]
AB  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best 
      time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that 
      extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health
      and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born
      at </=28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL)
      starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting
      at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary
      outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes 
      were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24
      months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis.
      Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across
      time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in 
      the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight
      were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group
      went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference 
      was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on
      neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically
      important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were
      observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during
      hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with
      extremely preterm infants. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate benefit and risk of low dose growth hormone treatment (GHT,
      4.5mg/m(2)/week) in very young children with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). DESIGN:
      Prospective longitudinal clinical intervention. METHODS: We evaluated 31 infants 
      (aged 2-12months) and 42 toddlers (13-24months) from the PWS-OZGROW database for 
      height, weight and BMI using the World Health Organization standard deviation
      scores (SDSWHO) and PWS specific BMI (SDSPWS), bone age, insulin-like growth
      factor 1 (IGF-I) levels and adverse events over 3years of GHT. RESULTS: At
      commencement of GHT infants had a lower BMI SDSWHO (-0.88 vs 0.40) than toddlers,
      while toddlers had a lower height SDSWHO (-1.44 vs -2.09) (both P<0.05). All
      increased height SDSWHO (2year delta height infants +1.26 SDS, toddlers+1.21
      SDS), but infants normalised height sooner, achieving a height SDS of -0.56
      within 1year, while toddlers achieved a height SDS of -0.88 in two years. BMI
      SDSWHO increased, while BMI SDSPWS decreased (both P<0.0001) and remained
      negative. The GHT response did not differ with gestation (preterm 23%) or genetic
      subtype (deletion vs maternal uniparental disomy). Bone age advancement
      paralleled chronological age. All children had low serum IGF-I at baseline which 
      increased, but remained within the age-based reference range during GHT (for 81% 
      in first year). Four children had spinal curvature at baseline; two improved, two
      progressed to a brace and two developed an abnormal curve over the observation
      period. Mild to severe central and/or obstructive sleep apnoea were observed in
      40% of children prior to GHT initiation; 11% commenced GHT on positive airway
      pressure (PAP), oxygen or both. Eight children ceased GHT due to onset or
      worsening of sleep apnoea: 2 infants in the first few months and 6 children after
      6-24months. Seven resumed GHT usually after adjusting PAP but five had
      adenotonsillectomy. One child ceased GHT temporarily due to respiratory illness. 
      No other adverse events were reported. Two children substantially improved their 
      breathing shortly after GHT initiation. CONCLUSION: Initiation of GHT in infants 
      with 4.5mg/m(2)/week was beneficial and comparable in terms of auxological
      response to a dose of 7mg/m(2)/week. Regular monitoring pre and post GH
      initiation assisted in early detection of adverse events. IGF-I levels increased 
      with the lower dose but not excessively, which may lower potential long-term
      risks.

TI  - Childhood maltreatment and adulthood poor sleep quality: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 879-888
LID - 10.1111/imj.13459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Available evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that
      childhood maltreatment may be associated with a range of sleep disorders.
      However, these studies have not controlled for potential individual-, familial-
      and environmental-level confounders. AIM: To determine the association between
      childhood maltreatment and lower sleep quality after adjusting for potential
      confounders. METHODS: Data for the present study were obtained from a pre-birth
      cohort study of 3778 young adults (52.6% female) of the Mater Hospital-University
      of Queensland Study of Pregnancy follow up at a mean age of 20.6 years. The Mater
      Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a prospective Australian 
      pre-birth cohort study of mothers consecutively recruited during their first
      obstetric clinic visit at Brisbane's Mater Hospital in 1981-1983. Participants
      completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the 21-year follow up. We linked 
      this dataset to agency-recorded substantiated cases of childhood maltreatment. A 
      series of separate logistic regression models was used to test whether childhood 
      maltreatment predicted lower sleep quality after adjustment for selected
      confounders. RESULTS: Substantiated physical abuse significantly predicted lower 
      sleep quality in males. Single and multiple forms of childhood maltreatment,
      including age of maltreatment and number of substantiations, did not predict
      lower sleep quality in either gender in both crude and adjusted models. Not being
      married, living in a residential problem area, cigarette smoking and
      internalising were significantly associated with lower sleep quality in a fully
      adjusted model for the male-female combined sample. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood
      maltreatment does not appear to predict young adult poor sleep quality, with the 
      exception of physical abuse for males. While childhood maltreatment has been
      found to predict a range of mental health problems, childhood maltreatment does
      not appear to predict sleep problems occurring in young adults. Poor sleep
      quality was accounted for by concurrent social disadvantage, cigarette smoking
      and internalising.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The quality and quantity of sleep represent important health issues in
      pregnant women. Sleep disturbances could be associated, beyond alteration of
      quality of life, with poor pregnancy outcome. Our aim was to investigate the
      effect of a regular, specific, medium-term physical training program on sleep
      characteristics in healthy pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 132 
      healthy pregnant women, with gestational age between 18 weeks and 22 weeks, were 
      enrolled in a prospective study. They were allocated into two groups; the first
      group involved 79 women (average age, 29.4 years) who performed a specific
      gymnastics program of 10 weeks, and the second group involved 53 pregnant women
      (average age, 27.9 years) who did not perform gymnastics. All participants
      completed a comprehensive questionnaire at baseline and after 10 weeks concerning
      general data, sleep characteristics, and psycho-emotional status. The changes
      arising within a diverse set of characteristics were followed and compared for
      the two groups using parametric and nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: In the
      control group, we observed significant worsening of 12 out of the 14 studied
      parameters during the 10-week period. In comparison with the women who did not
      perform gymnastics, women who performed specific gymnastics showed the following 
      characteristics: (1) significantly less deterioration of psycho-emotional status 
      (stress and anxiety levels); (2) the same general pattern of decrease in sleep
      quality, which is related to the progression of pregnancy; and (3) a significant 
      attenuation of the worsening of several sleep characteristics, such as restless
      sleep, snoring, diurnal tiredness, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Nocturnal
      and diurnal sleep quantity increased significantly in both groups. CONCLUSION:
      The 10-week training program designed for pregnant women has an overall
      beneficial effect on sleep characteristics, not by improving them but by
      attenuating their general deterioration related to the progression of pregnancy. 
      Our data strengthen the general recommendation regarding participation of
      pregnant women in specific exercise programs, mainly for maintaining their
      psycho-emotional and general well-being.

TI  - Detrimental effect of maternal and post-weaning high-fat diet on the reproductive
      function in the adult female offspring rat: roles of insulin-like growth factor 2
      and the ovarian circadian clock.
PG  - 817-826
LID - 10.1007/s10815-017-0915-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluate the impact of maternal and post-weaning high-fat (HF) diet
      on ovarian follicular population, steroidogenesis, and gene expression with a
      focus on the circadian clock system and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) in
      adult offspring ovaries, and to elucidate whether a maternal and post-weaning
      diet confers similar risks. METHODS: Virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with
      normal chow (C) diet or HF diet for 5 weeks before mating, during gestation, and 
      lactation. Female offspring were fed with the C or HF diet from weaning to 6
      months of age, resulting in four study groups (n = 6 per group): C/C, C/HF, HF/C,
      and HF/HF. RESULTS: Ovaries from offspring exposed to post-weaning HF diet (i.e.,
      the C/HF and HF/HF groups) had a decrease in small follicle numbers, but with
      similar numbers of antral follicles and corpora lutea. Offspring from HF-fed dams
      (i.e., the HF/C and HF/HF groups) had increased plasma estradiol concentrations
      and decreased luteinizing hormone levels at 6 months of age. In addition, Igf2
      and each of the circadian rhythm core genes Clock, Per1, Per2, and Per3 were
      increased in the ovaries of offspring exposed to maternal HF diet (both HF/C and 
      HF/HF groups). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and post-weaning HF diet programs the
      reproductive profile of the female offspring in adult life through different
      manners. Post-weaning HF intake resulted in the reduction of small follicles in
      adulthood, whereas maternal HF diet had long-term deleterious consequences on
      female offspring steroidogenesis and coincided with alteration of the
      upregulation of the imprinted gene Igf2 and changes in ovarian circadian rhythms.

TI  - Infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - CD011147
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD011147.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been most recently defined as
      the sudden unexpected death of an infant less than one year of age, with onset of
      the fatal episode apparently occurring during sleep, that remains unexplained
      after a thorough investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy
      and a review of the circumstances of death and clinical history. Despite the
      success of several prevention campaigns, SIDS remains a leading cause of infant
      mortality. In 1994, a 'triple risk model' for SIDS was proposed that described
      SIDS as an event that results from the intersection of three factors: a
      vulnerable infant; a critical development period in homeostatic control (age
      related); and an exogenous stressor. The association between pacifier (dummy) use
      and reduced incidence of SIDS has been shown in epidemiological studies since the
      early 1990s. Pacifier use, given its low cost, might be a cost-effective
      intervention for SIDS prevention if it is confirmed effective in randomised
      controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the use of pacifiers during
      sleep versus no pacifier during sleep reduces the risk of SIDS. SEARCH METHODS:
      We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to
      search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue
      2), MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to 16 March 2016. We also searched
      clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of
      retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Published and unpublished controlled trials using random and 
      quasi-random allocations of infants born at term and at preterm (less than 37
      weeks' gestation) or with low birth weight (< 2500 g). Infants must have been
      randomised by one month' postmenstrual age. We planned to include studies
      reported only by abstracts, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed studies from
      searches. We found no eligible studies. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no randomised
      controlled trials examining infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of SIDS.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no randomised control trial evidence on which to
      support or refute the use of pacifiers for the prevention of SIDS.

TI  - Sleep During Pregnancy: The nuMoM2b Pregnancy and Sleep Duration and Continuity
      Study.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsx045 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To characterize sleep duration, timing and continuity measures 
      in pregnancy and their association with key demographic variables. Methods:
      Multisite prospective cohort study. Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b study
      (nulliparous women with a singleton gestation) were recruited at the second study
      visit (16-21 weeks of gestation) to participate in the Sleep Duration and
      Continuity substudy. Women <18 years of age or with pregestational diabetes or
      chronic hypertension were excluded from participation. Women wore a wrist
      activity monitor and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Time in bed,
      sleep duration, fragmentation index, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset,
      and sleep midpoint were averaged across valid primary sleep periods for each
      participant. Results: Valid data were available from 782 women with mean age of
      27.3 (5.5) years. Median sleep duration was 7.4 hours. Approximately 27.9% of
      women had a sleep duration of <7 hours; 2.6% had a sleep duration of >9 hours. In
      multivariable models including age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, insurance
      status, and recent smoking history, sleep duration was significantly associated
      with race/ethnicity and insurance status, while time in bed was only associated
      with insurance status. Sleep continuity measures and sleep midpoint were
      significantly associated with all covariates in the model, with the exception of 
      age for fragmentation index and smoking for wake after sleep onset. Conclusions: 
      Our results demonstrate the relationship between sleep and important demographic 
      characteristics during pregnancy.

TI  - Sleep Duration and Adiposity in Early Childhood: Evidence for Bidirectional
      Associations from the Born in Bradford Study.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsw054 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To examine independent associations of sleep duration with
      total and abdominal adiposity, and the bidirectionality of these associations, in
      a young biethnic sample of children from a disadvantaged location. Methods: Child
      sleep duration (h/day) was parent-reported by questionnaire and indices of total 
      (body weight, body mass index, percent body fat (%BF), sum of skinfolds) and
      abdominal adiposity (waist circumference) were measured using standard
      anthropometric procedures at approximately 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age in
      1,338 children (58% South Asian; 42% White). Mixed effects models were used to
      quantify independent associations (expressed as standardised beta-coefficients
      (95% confidence interval (CI)) of sleep duration with adiposity indices using
      data from all four time-points. Factors considered for adjustment in models
      included basic demographics, pregnancy and birth characteristics, and lifestyle
      behaviours. Results: With the exception of the sum of skinfolds, sleep duration
      was inversely and independently associated with indices of total and abdominal
      adiposity in South Asian children. For example, one standard deviation (SD)
      higher sleep duration was associated with reduced %BF by -0.029 (95% CI: -0.053, 
      -0.0043) SDs. Higher adiposity was also independently associated with shorter
      sleep duration in South Asian children (for example, %BF: beta = -0.10 (-0.16,
      -0.028) SDs). There were no significant associations in White children.
      Conclusions: Associations between sleep duration and adiposity are bidirectional 
      and independent among South Asian children from a disadvantaged location. The
      results highlight the importance of considering adiposity as both a determinant
      of decreased sleep and a potential consequence.

TI  - Sleep Quality and Nocturnal Sleep Duration in Pregnancy and Risk of Gestational
      Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsw058 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: To examine the influence of maternal sleep quality and
      nocturnal sleep duration on risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a
      multiethnic Asian population. Methods: A cohort of 686 women (376 Chinese, 186
      Malay, and 124 Indian) with a singleton pregnancy attended a clinic visit at
      26-28 weeks of gestation as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy
      Outcomes mother-offspring cohort study. Self-reported sleep quality and sleep
      duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). GDM was
      diagnosed based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test administered after an
      overnight fast (1999 WHO criteria). Multiple logistic regression was used to
      model separately the associations of poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) and
      short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 h) with GDM, adjusting for age, ethnicity,
      maternal education, body mass index, previous history of GDM, and anxiety
      (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score). Results: In the cohort 296 women (43.1%)
      had poor sleep quality and 77 women (11.2%) were categorized as short sleepers;
      131 women (19.1%) were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality and short nocturnal
      sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of GDM (poor
      sleep, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to
      2.76; short sleep, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66). Conclusions: During 
      pregnancy, Asian women with poor sleep quality or short nocturnal sleep duration 
      exhibited abnormal glucose regulation. Treating sleep problems and improving
      sleep behavior in pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk and burden of GDM.

TI  - Family Income and Material Deprivation: Do They Matter for Sleep Quality and
      Quantity in Early Life? Evidence From a Longitudinal Study.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsw066 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The aim of this article is to investigate the determinants of
      sleeping patterns in children up to age 9 on a large and geographically
      homogeneous sample of British children and parents, focusing in particular on the
      role of economic and social factors, specifically on income. Aims and Methods:
      The data of this study come from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
      Children, a long-term health research project that recruited over 14000 pregnant 
      women who were due to give birth between April 1991 and December 1992 in Bristol 
      and its surrounding areas, including some of Somerset and Gloucestershire.
      Logistic regression models for the sleep problem dummies and log-linear models
      for the sleep quantity. Results: One additional item in the material deprivation 
      index is associated to an increase of around 10-20% in the odds of having at
      least 1 sleep problem. Similarly, children from the richest families are less
      likely to have any sleep problem up to 115 months (around 20% reduction in the
      odds). Mother's characteristics (i.e., education and mental health in the
      pregnancy period) are also significant predictors. Sleep quantity does not vary
      much and is not sensitive to socioeconomic factors. Conclusion: Exposure to
      income-related inequalities affects child sleep. Further research is needed to
      understand if sleep in early life influences future health and economic
      trajectories.

TI  - SUCLG1-Related Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome, Encephalomyopathic Form with
      Methylmalonic Aciduria
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: SUCLG1-related mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion
      syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with methylmalonic aciduria is characterized in
      the majority of affected newborns by hypotonia, muscle atrophy, feeding
      difficulties, and lactic acidosis. Affected infants commonly manifest
      developmental delay / cognitive impairment, growth retardation / failure to
      thrive, hepatopathy, sensorineural hearing impairment, dystonia, and hypertonia. 
      Notable findings in some affected individuals include hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, myoclonus, microcephaly, sleep disturbance,
      rhabdomyolysis, contractures, hypothermia, and/or hypoglycemia. Life span is
      shortened, with median survival of 20 months. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of
      SUCLG1-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is established in a proband by the
      identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SUCLG1 on molecular genetic
      testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Management is supportive and is
      best provided by a multidisciplinary team. Treatment may include physical therapy
      to help maintain muscle function and prevent joint contractures, nutritional
      support by a dietitian, use of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube feedings,
      chest physiotherapy, and aggressive antibiotic treatment of chest infections.
      When present, seizures are treated using standard antiepileptic drugs.
      Surveillance: The suggested evaluations (with frequency varying according to the 
      needs of the child) can include developmental and neurologic assessment,
      nutritional and growth assessment, echocardiogram, liver function tests, hearing 
      evaluation, and ophthalmologic examination. GENETIC COUNSELING: SUCLG1-related
      mtDNA depletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At
      conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being
      affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of
      being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SUCLG1 pathogenic variants have been
      identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at
      increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

TI  - Plasma Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated With Poor Sleep Quality and Night-Time 
      Eating at Mid-Pregnancy in Singapore.
LID - E340 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu9040340 [doi]
AB  - Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency, poor sleep quality, and night-time
      eating, have been independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but
      their inter-relationships are yet to be evaluated. We aimed to investigate the
      associations between maternal plasma 25OHD status and sleep quality and circadian
      eating patterns during pregnancy. Data on pregnant women (n = 890) from a
      prospective cohort (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) were
      analyzed. Plasma 25OHD concentration was measured, while the Pittsburgh sleep
      quality index (PSQI) and 24-h dietary recall were administered to women at 26-28 
      weeks' gestation. Plasma 25OHD status was defined as sufficient (>75 nmol/L),
      insufficient (50-75 nmol/L), or deficient (<50 nmol/L). Poor sleep quality was
      defined by a total global PSQI score >5. Predominantly day-time (pDT) and
      predominantly night-time (pNT) were defined according to consumption of greater
      proportion of calories (i.e., >50%) from 07:00-18:59 and from 19:00-06:59,
      respectively. After adjustment for confounders, women with plasma 25OHD
      deficiency had higher odds of poor sleep quality (odds ratio (OR) 3.49; 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.84-6.63) and pNT eating (OR: 1.85; 95% CI 1.00-3.41)
      than those who were 25OHD sufficient. Our findings show the association of
      maternal plasma 25OHD deficiency with poor sleep quality and pNT eating at
      mid-pregnancy.

TI  - Is fetal analgesia necessary during prenatal surgery?
PG  - 1241-1245
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2017.1311860 [doi]
AB  - Fetal pain and fetal anesthesia are still matter of debate: some authors
      hypothesize that several intrauterine endocrine neuroinhibitors (ENIn)
      anesthetize the fetus, keeping it in a constant state of sleep, and making
      pharmacological fetal anesthesia useless for fetal surgery, while others argue
      fetal pain is possible and shoud be prevented with fetal anesthesy. AIM: To
      retrieve evidences about fetal pain, fetal arousability and about the level of
      sedation induced by the ENIn, in order to assess the necessity of direct fetal
      anesthesia during prenatal fetal surgery. METHODS: We performed a careful
      literature review (1990-2016) on fetal arousability, and on the possibility that 
      ENIn at the average fetal blood levels induce actual anesthesia. We retrieved the
      papers that fulfilled the research criteria, with particular attention to the
      second half of pregnancy, the period when most fetal surgery is performed.
      RESULTS: Fetuses are awake about 10% of the total time in the last gestational
      weeks, and they can be aroused by external stimuli. ENIn have not an anesthetic
      effect at normal fetal values, but only when they areartificialy injected at high
      doses; their blood levels in the last trimester of average pregnancies are not
      dissimilar either in the fetus or in the mother. CONCLUSIONS: During the second
      half of the pregnancy, external stimuli can awake the fetuses, although they
      spend most of the time in sleeping state; the presence of ENIn is absolutely not 
      enough to guarantee an effective anesthesia during surgery. Thus, direct fetal
      analgesia/anesthesia is mandatory, though further studies on its possible
      drawbacks are necessary.

TI  - KCNK9 Imprinting Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: KCNK9 imprinting syndrome is characterized by
      congenital central hypotonia (manifest as decreased movement, lethargy, and weak 
      cry), severe feeding difficulties (resulting from facial weakness and poor suck),
      delayed development/intellectual disability, and dysmorphic manifestations. Poor 
      feeding can cause failure to thrive during infancy unless managed appropriately. 
      Significant dysphagia of solid foods typically persists until puberty.
      Intellectual disability can be severe. To date 19 individuals with a molecularly 
      confirmed diagnosis have been reported. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of the
      KCNK9 imprinting syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical
      findings and detection of the heterozygous KCNK9 pathogenic variant p.Gly236Arg
      on the maternal allele. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: A
      multidisciplinary team of specialists in clinical genetics, plastic surgery,
      ophthalmology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, feeding, endocrinology, and
      neurology is recommended (depending on the individual's needs). Standard
      treatment for lacrimal duct obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea, scoliosis, and 
      seizures. Feeding problems typically require use of special nipples and/or
      bottles and/or nasogastric/gastrostomy tube feedings. Cleft palate and
      velopharyngeal insufficiency are managed as per standard practice as are
      developmental delay/intellectual disability. Transient neonatal hypoglycemia
      responds to diazoxide treatment. Surveillance: Monitoring of serum glucose levels
      for hypoglycemia in the neonatal period. At least annual ophthalmology
      evaluation, monitoring for the development of scoliosis, and monitoring of
      nutritional status, growth, and feeding. GENETIC COUNSELING: KCNK9 imprinting
      syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant maternally imprinted manner (i.e.,
      a heterozygous pathogenic variant on the maternally derived KCNK9 allele results 
      in disease; a pathogenic variant on the paternally derived KCNK9 allele does not 
      result in disease because normally the paternally derived KCNK9 allele is
      silenced). The KCNK9 pathogenic variant can either be inherited from the mother
      (80%) or arise de novo on the maternally derived KCNK9 allele (20%). The risk to 
      the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of their mother: if she is 
      heterozygous for the KCNK9 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs is 50%; if
      the KCNK9 pathogenic variant cannot be detected in her leukocyte DNA, the risk to
      sibs is presumed to be slightly greater than that of the general population
      (though still <1%) because of the theoretic possibility of maternal germline
      mosaicism. To date, no individual with KCNK9 imprinting syndrome has been known
      to reproduce. Once the KCNK9 pathogenic variant has been identified in an
      affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for
      KCNK9 imprinting syndrome (i.e., one in which the mother is heterozygous for a
      KCNK9 pathogenic variant) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

TI  - 'right@home': a randomised controlled trial of sustained nurse home visiting from
      pregnancy to child age 2 years, versus usual care, to improve parent care, parent
      responsivity and the home learning environment at 2 years.
PG  - e013307
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013307 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: By the time children start school, inequities in learning,
      development and health outcomes are already evident. Sustained nurse home
      visiting (SNHV) offers a potential platform for families experiencing adversity, 
      who often have limited access to services. While SNHV programmes have been
      growing in popularity in Australia and internationally, it is not known whether
      they can improve children's learning and development when offered via the
      Australian service system. The right@home trial aims to investigate the
      effectiveness of an SNHV programme, offered to women from pregnancy to child age 
      2 years, in improving parent care of and responsivity to the child, and the home 
      learning environment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Pregnant Australian women (n=722) are
      identified after completing a screening survey of 10 factors known to predict
      children's learning and development (eg, young pregnancy, poor mental or physical
      health, lack of support). Consenting women-surveyed while attending clinics at 10
      hospitals in Victoria and Tasmania-are enrolled if they report having 2 or more
      risk factors. The intervention comprises 25 home visits from pregnancy to 2
      years, focusing on parent care of the child, responsivity to the child and
      providing a good quality home learning environment. The standard, universal,
      Australian child and family health service provides the comparator (control).
      Primary outcome measures include a combination of parent-reported and objective
      assessments of children's sleep, safety, nutrition, parenting styles and the home
      learning environment, including the Home Observation of the Environment Inventory
      and items adapted from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human
      Research Ethics Committees (HREC 32296) and site-specific HRECs. The
      investigators and sponsor will communicate the trial results to stakeholders,
      participants, healthcare professionals, the public and other relevant groups via 
      presentations and publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN89962120,

LID - 10.1159/000448966 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased, amounting to 42
      million overweight or obese children, and there is increasing evidence that the
      origins are within the first 1,000 days: the period of conception through 2
      years. Antecedents of early childhood obesity are multifactorial, and
      associations of varying strength have been documented for genetic/epigenetic,
      biologic, dietary, environmental, social, and behavioral influences. Modifiable
      factors in pregnancy and early infancy associated with childhood obesity include 
      maternal overweight/obesity, maternal smoking, gestational weight gain, infant
      and young child feeding, caregiver responsive feeding practices, as well as sleep
      duration, and physical activity. Promising obesity prevention interventions
      include those beginning during the first 1,000 days, using a multicomponent
      approach, with roots in nutrition education theories or behavior change
      communication that can continue over time. However, the limited number of
      completed interventions to date (within pediatric clinics or in home-based or
      community settings) may not be scalable to the magnitude needed for sustainable
      obesity prevention. Scale-up interventions that can be maintained for the
      durations needed, addressing infant and young child feeding and other modifiable 
      risk factors associated with childhood obesity are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding risk factors that may vary culturally can help improve 
      preventive strategies for obesity. This is the first cross-sectional study aimed 
      to determine the risk factors for overweight/obesity in children aged 2-6 years
      in a central Anatolian city in Turkey. METHODS: A total of 1582 children (1351
      healthy, 231 overweight/obese) aged 2-6 years were included from the
      Anthropometry of Turkish Children aged 0-6 years database. Age, gender, birth
      weight, birth order, mother's age, mother's body mass index (BMI), weight gain of
      mothers during pregnancy, presence of gestational diabetes, breastfeeding
      duration, history of formula feeding, mother's and father's education, mother's
      job, monthly income, smoking at home and physical activity, sleep duration and
      duration of television (TV) watching of the children were evaluated as
      independent risk factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to
      investigate risk factors for overweight/obesity. RESULTS: Having a high family
      income compared to bad [odds ratio (OR)=1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI):
      1.237-3.106], increased the time of watching TV during the weekend (OR=1.094; 95%
      CI: 1.032-1.159), and similar physical activity level according to their peers
      compared to less (OR=2.957; 95% CI: 1.056-8.282) were found to be significantly
      associated with a higher risk of overweight/obesity in children aged 2-6 years
      old. CONCLUSIONS: The early childhood period seems to be important in the
      establishment of healthy behavioral patterns, especially limitation of TV
      watching and encouragement of physical activity. Obesogenic environment in
      families with high incomes need to be revealed.

AB  - We describe the case of a 23-year-old white female, 10-12 weeks pregnant, with a 
      history of intravenous drug use and a recently diagnosed pneumonia, who was found
      deceased in her bed after a night of sleep. Although postmortem serum toxicology 
      tested positive for alprazolam, tetrahydrocannabinol, and morphine, the ultimate 
      cause of death was determined to be cardiac tamponade secondary to an isolated
      abscess in the ascending aorta. The patient had several risk factors for aortic
      rupture and cardiac tamponade including intravenous drug use, pneumonia, and
      pregnancy. However, an autopsy of the patient showed an isolated abscess of the
      ascending aorta without evidence of infective endocarditis, coronary artery
      rupture, aortic aneurysm, or aortic dissection making this an unusual case of
      cardiac tamponade. The aim of this case report is to encourage providers to
      obtain a tissue culture of any aortic abscesses so that the organisms involved
      can be identified. The identification of such organisms may help guide
      antimicrobial treatment in similar presentations in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the potential
      risk factors associated independently with central serous retinopathy (CSR) in a 
      Greek population, using multivariate approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Participants in the study were 183 consecutive patients diagnosed with CSR and
      183 controls, matched for age. All participants underwent complete
      ophthalmological examination and information regarding their sociodemographic,
      clinical, medical and ophthalmological history were recorded, so as to assess
      potential risk factors for CSR. Univariate and multivariate analysis was
      performed. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that male sex, high educational
      status, high income, alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, coronary heart
      disease, obstructive sleep apnea, autoimmune disorders, H. pylori infection, type
      A personality and stress, steroid use, pregnancy and hyperopia were associated
      with CSR, while myopia was found to protect from CSR. In multivariate analysis,
      alcohol consumption, hypertension, coronary heart disease and autoimmune
      disorders lost their significance, while the remaining factors were all
      independently associated with CSR. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to take into
      account the various risk factors for CSR, so as to define vulnerable groups and
      to shed light into the pathogenesis of the disease.

      genes and steroidogenesis-related genes in human luteinized granulosa cells.
PG  - 570-573
LID - 10.1080/09513590.2017.1296423 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been shown in animal models that circadian clock exists in
      corpora luteum which is essential for maintaining pregnancy. However, it is
      unknown whether circadian clock exists in corpora luteum and its relation with
      steroidogenesis in human ovary. STUDY DESIGN: Human luteinized granulosa cells
      from patients who underwent in vitro fertilization treatment were purified and
      cultured in vitro. Accumulation patterns of circadian gene and
      steroidogenesis-related gene mRNAs in human luteinized granulosa cells were
      observed during the 48 hours after treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We found that the circadian genes CLOCK,
      PER2, and BMAL1 were expressed in cultured human luteinized granulosa cells.
      Among these genes, only expression of PER2 displayed oscillating patterns with a 
      16-h period in these cells after stimulation by hCG. Expression of CLOCK and
      BMAL1 did not show significant oscillating patterns. Expression of the steroidal 
      acute regulatory protein (STAR) gene showed an oscillating pattern that was
      similar to that of PER2. Expression of CYP11A1, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 increased
      significantly after hCG stimulation; however, none of these genes displayed
      significant oscillating patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular circadian clock exists
      in human luteinized granulosa cells and may be related with steroidogenesis in
      human ovary.

AB  - Sleep problems during pregnancy impair maternal health and increase the risk for 
      adverse pregnancy outcome. The circadian preference toward eveningness has been
      associated with sleep problems in previous studies. Here, we studied whether
      evening-type women had more sleep problems during their pregnancy, as compared
      with other chronotypes, in a sample consisting of 1653 pregnant women from the
      Finnish CHILD-SLEEP Birth Cohort. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened
      version of the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Pregnant evening-type women
      reported more sleep problems, including troubles of falling asleep (OR = 3.4, p <
      0.0001), poor sleep quality (OR = 2.9, p < 0.01) and daily tiredness (OR = 3.2, p
      < 0.0001) than the morning-type women, even after controlling for sleep duration 
      and sleep deprivation. They had higher scores on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p <
      0.05), Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (p < 0.0001) and Global Seasonality Score
      (p < 0.01) and were also more often smokers, also during pregnancy (p < 0.001)
      and reported poorer general health (p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. They 
      also reported having had more sleep problems during their childhood (OR = 1.5, p 
      < 0.05) and adolescence (OR = 2.0, p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. Our
      results indicate that eveningness is associated with more sleep problems and
      unhealthy life habits during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was an investigation of the association
      between depression and sleep quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study was performed on 360 delivered women that referred to thirty health-care
      centers in Ardabil, Iran. The Standard Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      questionnaire was used to the investigation of sleep quality. We used the
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Questionnaire to assess postpartum depression.
      Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep quality with
      postpartum depression. RESULTS: Chance of depression in women with poor sleep
      quality was 3.34 times higher than those with good sleep quality (odds ratio =
      3.34; 95% confidence interval: 2.04-5.48; P < 0.001). After controlling for some 
      risk factors, an association observed between sleep quality and depression in
      postpartum women. CONCLUSION: we found an association between sleep quality in
      women who had given birth in the last 3 months and symptoms of postpartum
      depression.

TI  - Targeting Sleep, Food, and Activity in Infants for Obesity Prevention: An RCT.
LID - e20162037 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2016-2037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have
      concentrated on nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of
      sleep. METHODS: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802
      pregnant women (>/=16 years, <34 weeks' gestation) to: control, FAB (food,
      activity, and breastfeeding), sleep, or combination (both interventions) groups. 
      All groups received standard well-child care. FAB participants received
      additional support (8 contacts) promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, and
      physical activity (antenatal-18 months). Sleep participants received 2 sessions
      (antenatal, 3 weeks) targeting prevention of sleep problems, as well as a sleep
      treatment program if requested (6-24 months). Combination participants received
      both interventions (9 contacts). BMI was measured at 24 months by researchers
      blinded to group allocation, and secondary outcomes (diet, physical activity,
      sleep) were assessed by using a questionnaire or accelerometry at multiple time
      points. RESULTS: At 2 years, 686 women remained in the study (86%). No
      significant intervention effect was observed for BMI at 24 months (P = .086), but
      there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027).
      Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving 
      the "sleep intervention" (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control:
      odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.82]). No effect was observed
      for the "FAB intervention" (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: 
      odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.81]). CONCLUSIONS: A
      well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children's
      weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running
      sleep interventions is warranted.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Women's Perspective.
LID - 1064 [pii]
AB  - The main characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are airflow
      limitation, chronic intermittent hypoxia, or apnea; which may lead to tissue
      hypoperfusion and recurrent arousal from sleep. These episodes of hypoxia or
      apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep 
      in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns
      differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result
      from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men,
      women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by
      gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as
      pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during
      menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include
      vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm
      abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle
      factors.

TI  - Sleep and Premenstrual Syndrome.
LID - 1061 [pii]
AB  - The etiology of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is unknown; it may be due to the
      normal effect of hormones during the menstrual cycle as it occurs in the late
      luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.PMS affects women of childbearing age and
      remits with the onset of menstruation. The menstrual phase is known to influence 
      stage 2 and REM sleep in women, irrespective of premenstrual dysphoric disorder
      (PMDD). Women with PMDD showed a decreased response to melatonin in their luteal 
      phase as compared to the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. However,
      melatonin duration or timing of offset in the morning has not been reported to
      correlate with the mood. Rather, improvement in mood-related symptoms of PMDD has
      been found to be influenced by sleep deprivation, be it sleep restrictions in
      early or late night. Sleep disturbance and decreased melatonin secretions due to 
      hormonal fluctuations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle could
      explain the sleep complaints of PMDD.

TI  - Oxidative and carbonyl stress in pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea.
PG  - 233-240
LID - 10.1007/s11325-017-1475-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to sleep-disordered
      breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with poor
      pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Oxidative stress caused by intermittent hypoxemia
      and reoxygenation may impact pregnancy health. We hypothesize that pregnant women
      with OSA have a pronounced oxidative stress profile. METHODS: A case-control
      study was performed to study oxidative stress markers in the serum of pregnant
      women with or without OSA. Patients with OSA were identified between 2003 and
      2009. Contemporaneous controls were pregnant subjects without apnea, gasping, or 
      snoring around the time of delivery. Serum markers of oxidative and carbonyl
      stress were measured by spectrophotometric/fluorometric methods. Multiple linear 
      regression analysis was used with a model including age, body mass index at
      delivery, history of diabetes, and gestational age. RESULTS: Serum samples from
      23 OSA cases and 41 controls were identified. Advanced oxidation protein
      products, a marker for oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products
      (AGEs), a marker for carbonyl stress, were significantly lower in women with OSA 
      than in controls (p value <0.0001). Total antioxidant capacity was higher in
      women with OSA in comparison to controls (p value <0.0001). The difference in
      AGEs remained significant even after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION:
      Contrary to our hypothesis, the results of this study suggest that pregnant women
      with OSA have higher antioxidant capacity and lower oxidative and carbonyl stress
      markers compared to controls, suggesting a possible protective effect of
      intermittent hypoxia. Whether OSA in pregnancy impacts oxidative stress
      differently than OSA in the general population remains to be confirmed.

AB  - Objective:To explore the clinical characteristics of obstructive sleep apnea
      hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) diagnosed during pregnancy.To explore the effect on
      maternal and infant after treated with CPAP.Method:Data of 117 patients with
      OSAHS diagnosed by nocturnal blood oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) monitoring and PSG 
      during pregnancy were analyzed retrospectively. All the 117 patients were
      voluntary and divided into intervention group [received continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) treatment with good compliance under informed consent and 
      conventional drug] 70 cases and control group(received conventional drug) 47
      cases. Record the relevant data during the treatment about maternal and
      infant.Result:There was no statistical significance on the difference of cesarean
      delivery and postpartum hemorrhage in the pregnant women with mild OSAHS (P>
      0.05), there was no statistical significance on the difference of cesarean
      delivery and postpartum hemorrhage in the pregnant women with moderate OSAHS (P> 
      0.05) and there were statistical significance on the difference of cesarean
      delivery and postpartum hemorrhage in the pregnant women with severe OSAHS (P<
      0.05 or P< 0.01). There was no statistical significance on the difference of
      asphyxia neonatorum, fetal growth restriction and fetal distress in the pregnant 
      women with mild OSAHS (P> 0.05), there were statistical significance on the
      difference of fetal growth restriction and fetal distress in the pregnant women
      with moderate OSAHS (P< 0.05), and there were statistical significance on the
      difference of asphyxia neonatorum, fetal growth restriction and fetal distress in
      the pregnant women with severe OSAHS (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01).Conclusion:Pregnant
      women who have OSAHS risk factors should be paid attention to during the
      perinatal care and nocturnal SaO(2) monitoring or PSG should be performed in the 
      suspected OSAHS patients. Strongly advise that those serious OSAHS patients
      should be treated by CPAP early before delivery. CPAP was a safe and effective
      treatment to OSAHS patients in pregnancy.

TI  - Sleep disruption and duration in late pregnancy is associated with excess
      gestational weight gain among overweight and obese women.
PG  - 173-180
LID - 10.1111/birt.12277 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with poorer birth
      outcomes. High body mass index (BMI) is often associated with poor sleep, but
      little is known about the relationship between gestational weight gain and sleep 
      in late pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of
      both gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective
      measures of sleep during late pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=128) were
      recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving
      low-income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed 
      in their last month of pregnancy with 72 hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring.
      Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index. Pre-pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by
      self-report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were
      then grouped into standardized categories. RESULTS: Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index score was 6.8 +/- 3.1 (range 2-16). Sixty percent had excess gestational
      weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was
      unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre-pregnancy
      BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction
      of pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight
      gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but
      only among women who were overweight before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is
      an opportunity to promote long-term women's health with a better understanding of
      the relationship between weight management and healthy sleep habits.

TI  - Factors of influence and social correlates of parturition in captive Campbell's
      monkeys: Case study and breeding data.
LID - 10.1002/ajp.22632 [doi]
AB  - How nonhuman primates deal with birth, at the moment of delivery, and during the 
      following days, remains poorly explored because of the unpredictability of this
      event, particularly for forest-dwelling arboreal species. Available studies
      highlight intra- and interspecific variation which suggest flexibility of the
      timing of delivery, of behavior associated with labor contractions and
      parturition, and the social context and ambient noise surrounding delivery. Here,
      we present the findings of a two-decade survey of reproduction in a population of
      captive Campbell's monkeys. Analysis of 34 births (with a female-biased sex
      ratio) showed that deliveries occurred systematically at night and more
      frequently during week-ends and in fall (September-November). This suggests the
      existence of both circadian and infradian biological rhythms. We present the
      first detailed description of a birth for this species and its short-term social 
      consequences. In line with previous findings for other monkeys and apes, labor
      (estimated by unusual stretching postures) and parturition were rapid, and
      delivery occurred in a clear social and vocal context. During the following days,
      the new mother became the center of attention of for young (kin and non-kin)
      females and rose through the hierarchy. We discuss socio-ecological factors,
      notably captivity conditions and the high degree of tolerance in the species'
      social system, and confirm the existence of both "rigidity" and "flexibility" in 
      the primates' adaptive reproductive strategies.

TI  - Protective factors for child development at age 2 in the presence of poor
      maternal mental health: results from the All Our Babies (AOB) pregnancy cohort.
PG  - e012096
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012096 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the combination of factors most protective of
      developmental delay at age 2 among children exposed to poor maternal mental
      health. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Pregnant women were
      recruited from primary healthcare offices, the public health laboratory service
      and community posters in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 1596
      mother-child dyads who participated in the All Our Babies study and who completed
      a follow-up questionnaire when their child was 2 years old. Among participants
      who completed the 2-year questionnaire and had complete mental health data
      (n=1146), 305 women (27%) were classified as high maternal mental health risk.
      PRIMARY MEASURES: Child development at age 2 was described and a resilience
      analysis was performed among a subgroup of families at maternal mental health
      risk. The primary outcome was child development problems. Protective factors were
      identified among families at risk, defined as maternal mental health risk, a
      composite measure created from participants' responses to mental health life
      course questions and standardised mental health measures. RESULTS: At age 2, 18% 
      of children were classified as having development problems, 15% with behavioural 
      problems and 13% with delayed social-emotional competencies. Among children
      living in a family with maternal mental health risk, protective factors against
      development problems included higher social support, higher optimism, more
      relationship happiness, less difficulty balancing work and family
      responsibilities, limiting the child's screen time to <1 hour per day and the
      child being able to fall asleep in <30 min and sleeping through the night by age 
      2. CONCLUSIONS: Among families where the mother has poor mental health, public
      health and early intervention strategies that support interpersonal
      relationships, social support, optimism, work-life balance, limiting children's
      screen time and establishing good sleep habits in the child's first 2 years show 
      promise to positively influence early child development.

TI  - Prenatal Exposure to Snus Alters Heart Rate Variability in the Infant.
PG  - 797-803
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntx035 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Maternal use of smoked tobacco during pregnancy causes significant 
      morbidity and mortality in the human infant including alterations in autonomic
      control with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. We hypothesized that
      maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac 
      regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low
      frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio). Methods: A prospective
      observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes
      (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19).
      The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and
      post-natally. The infants' urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of
      sleep were studied 1-2 months after birth. Results: LF/HF ratio was higher in
      snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78-3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54-4.47) compared to
      controls (2.15; 1.76-2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure "without" 
      any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55-3.84, p = .02).
      Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure "without" postnatal exposure was also
      associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38-5.42, p < .001).
      There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked
      tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac
      regulation. Conclusion: Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed 
      lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and
      similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting
      impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal "re-programing" of the 
      developing autonomic nervous system. Implications: The results indicate that
      smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system 
      during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second
      trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1-2 month-old 
      infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco
      use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance
      to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn.

TI  - Early Term Deliveries and the Risk of Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in the
      Offspring.
PG  - 149-156
LID - 10.1111/ppe.12342 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm delivery may affect the development of the upper airways
      resulting in a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We investigated
      whether children born at early term (37-38 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at an
      increased risk for childhood OSA as compared with those born later. METHODS: In
      this population-based cohort analysis all singleton deliveries occurring between 
      1991-2013 at a single regional tertiary medical centre were included. Gestational
      age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early preterm (<33 6/7 weeks' gestation),
      late preterm (34-36 6/7), early term, full term (39-40 6/7), late term (41-41
      6/7), and post term (>42 0/7). Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the
      offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A survival curve and a Cox
      model were used to assess the association. RESULTS: During the study period 240
      953 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA hospitalization (n = 1320) rates
      decreased as gestational age increased from 1.1% in the early preterm group, 0.8%
      in late preterm, 0.7% at early term, 0.5% in full term, 0.4% in late term, to
      0.3% in post term born children. In the Cox regression, early term delivery
      exhibited an increased risk for paediatric OSA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3
      95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.5) while late and post term deliveries were
      associated with significantly lower OSA risk when compared with full term (HR 0.8
      95% CI 0.6, 0.9 and HR 0.6 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Early
      term deliveries are associated with higher rates of paediatric OSA, which
      decrease gradually as gestational age advances.

TI  - Cohort profile for the Nurture Observational Study examining associations of
      multiple caregivers on infant growth in the Southeastern USA.
PG  - e013939
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013939 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Childcare has been associated with obesity in children in
      cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, although some observed no association. 
      Few studies have focused on care during infancy, a period when children may be
      especially vulnerable. PARTICIPANTS: The Nurture Study is an observational birth 
      cohort designed to assess longitudinal associations of childcare and the presence
      of multiple caregivers on infant adiposity and weight trajectories throughout the
      first year of life. We examine as potential mediators feeding, physical activity,
      sleep and stress. We completed recruitment in 2015. Of the 860 women who enrolled
      during pregnancy, 799 delivered a single live infant who met our inclusion
      criteria. Of those, 666 mothers (77.4%) agreed to participate in the study for
      themselves and their infants. FINDINGS TO DATE: Among the 666 women in the study,
      472 (71%) identified as black, 127 (19%) as white, 7 (1%) as Asian or Asian
      American, 6 (1%) as Native American and 49 (7%) as other race or more than one
      race; 43 (7%) identified as Hispanic/Latina. Just under half (48%) had a high
      school diploma or less, 61% had household incomes <$20 000/year and 59% were
      married or living with a partner. The mean (SD) infant gestational age was 41.28 
      weeks (2.29) and birth weight for gestational age z-score was -0.31 (0.93). Just 
      under half (49%) of infants were females, 69% received some human milk and 40%
      were exclusively breast fed at hospital discharge. Data collection began in 2013,
      is currently underway, and is scheduled to conclude in late 2016. FUTURE PLANS:
      Results will help assess the magnitude of associations between childcare in
      infancy and subsequent obesity. Findings will also inform intervention and policy
      efforts to improve childcare environments and help prevent obesity in settings
      where many infants spend time. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov,
      NCT01788644.

      childbearing age.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Reduced sleep is a strong and independent risk factor for
      weight gain and obesity. Maternal obesity preconception and throughout gestation 
      can increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and impact on offspring
      health in later life. This study investigated the relationship between sleeping
      behaviour and macronutrient intake in childbearing aged women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 
      We used cross-sectional data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's
      Health 1973-78 cohort, aged 31-36 years in 2009 (n=8200). Subjective sleeping
      behaviour was reported and macronutrient intake was measured using a validated
      food frequency questionnaire. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to derive
      sleeping patterns. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate the
      relationships between sleep and macronutrient intake. RESULTS: LCA identified
      three sleep patterns: (LC1) average sleep (~8 h) with no adverse sleep-related
      symptoms (n=3570); (LC2) average sleep (~8 h) with sleeping difficulties and
      severe tiredness (n=2109); and (LC3) short sleep (~6 h) with sleeping
      difficulties and severe tiredness (n=915). In fully adjusted models, LC2 was
      inversely associated with percentage energy as protein (b=-0.24; P=0.01) and the 
      protein-to-carbohydrate ratio (b=-0.01; P<0.05). LC3 was positively associated
      with percentage of energy as fat (b=0.29; P=0.01), saturated fat (b=0.24;
      P=<0.001) and monounsaturated fat (b=0.09; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Sleeping
      behaviour patterns were associated with macronutrient intake in childbearing aged
      women. Improved sleep patterns, together with diet and physical activity
      strategies, may make it easier for women to achieve a balanced diet and optimise 
      their weight status in preparation for pregnancy.

PG  - 577-589
LID - 10.1007/s40618-017-0614-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2007, we published an opinion document to review the role of
      pegvisomant (PEG) in the treatment of acromegaly. Since then, new evidence
      emerged on the biochemical and clinical effects of PEG and on its long-term
      efficacy and safety. AIM: We here reviewed the emerging aspects of the use of PEG
      in clinical practice in the light of the most recent literature. RESULTS: The
      clinical use of PEG is still suboptimal, considering that it remains the most
      powerful tool to control IGF-I in acromegaly allowing to obtain, with a
      pharmacological treatment, the most important clinical effects in terms of signs 
      and symptoms, quality of life and comorbidities. The number of patients with
      acromegaly exposed to PEG worldwide has become quite elevated and the prolonged
      follow-up allows now to deal quite satisfactorily with many clinical issues
      including major safety issues, such as the concerns about possible tumour
      (re)growth under PEG. The positive or neutral impact of PEG on glucose metabolism
      has been highlighted, and the clinical experience, although limited, with sleep
      apnoea and pregnancy has been reviewed. Finally, the current concept of
      somatostatin receptor ligands (SRL) resistance has been addressed, in order to
      better define the acromegaly patients to whom the PEG option may be offered.
      CONCLUSIONS: PEG increasingly appears to be an effective and safe medical option 
      for many patients not controlled by SRL but its use still needs to be optimized.

TI  - PHQ-8 minor depression among pregnant women: association with somatic symptoms of
      depression.
PG  - 405-409
LID - 10.1007/s00737-017-0715-z [doi]
AB  - It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor
      depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale
      (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1-7, 2002), and
      Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1-3):163-173, 2009)) compared to women who were not 
      pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395-400,
      2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy 
      level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were
      responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of
      pregnant women (n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant (n = 6754). 
      Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons
      were based on participants' responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of
      the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for
      the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to
      women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score
      determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to 
      a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional
      symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be
      reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications 
      for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed.

      mechanism underlying persistent breeding-induced endometritis in the mare.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) may have a role in persistent breeding-induced endometritis in 
      mares through an inhibitory effect on uterine contractility. The objectives of
      this study were to test the effect of NO on spontaneous uterine contractility
      in-vitro and to evaluate whether this effect varied between the longitudinal and 
      circular muscle layers of the uterus. Reproductive tracts were collected from
      eight euthanized non-pregnant mares (age 4-19 years; body weight 405-530 kg).
      Transrectal examination of the reproductive tract was performed before euthanasia
      to evaluate stage of the estrous cycle and presence of any apparent abnormality. 
      After euthanasia, one uterine tissue sample was collected for histological
      evaluation and four full-thickness uterine tissue strips (10-12 mm x 2 mm), two
      parallel to each muscle layer, were excised for in-vitro contractility
      evaluation. Strips were suspended in tissue chambers containing Krebs-Henseleit
      solution, with continuous aeration (95% O2-5% CO2; pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. After
      equilibration, spontaneous contractility was recorded (pre-treatment) and strips 
      excised in each direction were randomly allocated to each of two groups: 1) SNAP 
      (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, an NO donor); or 2) NAP
      (N-acetyl-d-penicillamine, vehicle and time-matched control). These were treated 
      at 15 min intervals with increasing concentrations (10(-7) M to 10(-3) M) of SNAP
      and NAP, respectively. Contractility data was recorded throughout the experiment.
      An interaction effect of group-by-concentration was observed (P < 0.0001). The
      mean contractility after treatment with 10(-4) M and 10(-3) M SNAP were
      significantly lower than the pre-treatment contractility and the mean
      contractility after treatment with lower SNAP concentrations. In contrast,
      contractility did not change significantly in the NAP treated controls. The
      effect of treatment on uterine contractility was not influenced by age or weight 
      of the mare, stage of estrous cycle, uterine histology grade, or muscle layer.
      Secondary findings included significant main effects of stage of estrous cycle
      (increased contractility in estrus compared to diestrus), uterine histology grade
      (decreased contractility in grade IIB compared to grade I) and age (decreased
      contractility in mares aged > 8 years compared to mares aged </= 8 years). In
      conclusion, results of this study indicate that NO has a dose-dependent
      inhibitory effect on spontaneous uterine contractility irrespective of the muscle
      layer in the mare.

LID - 10.1262/jrd.2016-097 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the correlation between the body surface temperature
      (BST) and core body temperature of ewes and changes in BST during the prepartum
      stage in pregnant ewes. Four non-pregnant adult ewes were used in the first
      experiment. The BST of the upper neck, vaginal temperature (VT), and ambient
      temperature (AT) were measured every 10 min for seven days and analyzed for
      correlations. The mean (+/- SD) BST and VT of ewes during the study period were
      35.4 +/- 1.7 degrees C and 39.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively, with a
      correlation of r = 0.62, P < 0.001. This finding suggested that the BST was
      associated with core body temperature in ewes. In the subsequent experiment,
      seven pregnant ewes in their third trimester were used to evaluate changes in BST
      measured at the upper neck 72 h before parturition. The mean BST at -24-0 h (0 h 
      = time of parturition) was significantly lower than that at -72- -48 h and -48-
      -24 h (P < 0.05). The BST tended to decrease toward parturition; all BST
      measurements at -16- -3 h were significantly lower than those at -72 h (P <
      0.05). A clear circadian rhythm in the BST was observed at two days and the day
      before parturition and an unclear circadian rhythm was observed on the day of
      parturition. Therefore, these findings indicate that the BST also decreases
      before parturition, as do vaginal and rectal temperatures.

AB  - This article reviews three new and emerging risk factors for stillbirth that may 
      be modifiable or might identify a compromised fetus. We focus on fetal movements,
      maternal sleep, and maternal diet. Recent studies have suggested than a sudden
      increase in vigorous fetal activity may be associated with increased risk of
      stillbirth. We review the papers that have reported this finding and discuss the 
      implications as well as potential future directions for research. There is
      emerging literature to suggest that maternal sleep position may be a risk for
      stillbirth, especially if the woman settles to sleep supine. This risk is
      biologically plausible. How this knowledge may be utilized to assist stillbirth
      reduction strategies is discussed. Finally, we examine the somewhat limited
      literature regarding maternal diet and pregnancy outcome. Introducing probiotics 
      into the diet may prove useful, but further work is required. The possible next
      steps for research are considered, as well as some potential intervention
      strategies that may ultimately lead to stillbirth reduction.

AB  - Objectives To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected
      pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods 750 consecutive pregnant women
      attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14
      were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive
      symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and
      socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three
      groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied,
      somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and
      EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were
      returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially
      unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906,
      0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after
      adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher
      mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m(2), p for linearity =
      0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had
      experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of
      depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% 
      of unsatisfied women scored EPDS >/=10 points suggesting increased risk of
      depression. Conclusions Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with
      HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often
      have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the
      later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy
      appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we 
      evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during
      pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety 
      and environmental stress. METHODS: The study is based on a population based
      sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the
      Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep 
      onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep
      quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined
      as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep
      duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night. RESULTS: We found
      that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8%
      vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5%
      vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either
      significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to
      symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6-5.6 vs. AOR 
      1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women
      (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8-5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number 
      of children among men. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that insomnia and sleep
      insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings
      underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during
      pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent 
      negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

AB  - Most women experience the worse sleep quality of their life during pregnancy and 
      the early postpartum period. Although pregnancy typically accounts for a
      relatively short part of a woman's life, the related sleep disturbances may have 
      a significant and negative impact on her long-term health. Approximately 78-80%
      of pregnant women experience sleep disturbances, including interruptions in deep 
      sleep, decreased total sleep time, poor subjective sleep quality, frequent night 
      waking, and reduced sleep efficacy. Sleep disturbances during pregnancy start
      during the first trimester and become prevalent during the third trimester.
      Related factors include physiological and psychosocial changes and an unhealthy
      lifestyle. As non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to improve
      sleep quality in 70% to 80% of patients with insomnia, this is the main
      approached that is currently used to treat pregnancy-related sleep disturbances. 
      Examples of these non-pharmacological interventions include music therapy,
      aerobic exercise, massage, progressive muscle relaxation, multi-modal
      interventions, and the use of a maternity support belt. The efficacy and safety
      of other related non-pharmacological interventions such as auricular acupressure,
      cognitive therapy, tai chi, and aromatherapy remain uncertain, with more
      empirical research required. Additionally, non-pharmacological interventions do
      not effectively treat sleep disturbances in all pregnant women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Late gestational sleep fragmentation (SF) is highly prevalent
      particularly in obese women, and induces metabolic dysfunction in adult offspring
      mice. SF induces activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), which might 
      be involved in metabolic disorders. We hypothesized that adult offspring of
      double mutant mice (DM) involving the critical ISR genes CHOP and GADD34 would be
      protected from developing obesity and insulin resistance following SF. METHODS:
      Time-pregnant CHOP/GADD34 DM and wild type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to
      sleep control (SC) or SF conditions during the last 5days of gestation. At
      24-weeks of age, body weight, fat mass, and HOMA-IR were assessed in the
      offspring. Tregs lymphocytes, Lyc6c(high), M1 and M2 macrophages were examined in
      visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) using flow cytometry. The effects of plasma
      exosomes on adipocyte cell line proliferation, differentiation and insulin
      sensitivity were also evaluated. RESULTS: SF-WT male showed significant increases
      in body weight, vWAT mass and HOMA-IR compared to SC-WT mice, while SF had no
      effect in SF-DM mice. Inflammatory macrophages (Ly-6c(high)) and the ratio of
      M1/M2 macrophages were increased while FoxP3+ Tregs counts were decreased in
      SF-WT but not in SF-DM mice. Exosomes from SF-WT, but not from the SF-DM
      offspring increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and
      decreased in vitro adipocyte insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Activation of the
      ISR during late gestation, as induced by late gestational SF, appears to underlie
      some of the transgenerational modifications in metabolic genes ultimately
      contributing to a metabolic syndrome phenotype in adult offspring.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Perinatal Risk.
PG  - 281-285
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by total or partial interruptions of
      airflow during sleep, despite ongoing efforts to breathe. These pauses result
      from repeated upper airway obstructions that generate a systemic inflammatory
      condition with consequences for the endothelial function that increase the risk
      of cardiometabolic events. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea during
      pregnancy is greater than that observed in the general population and increases
      in the third trimester. Although limited, the information currently available
      supports the notion that obstructive sleep apnea is an independent, and
      potentially modifiable, risk factor for maternal and perinatal morbidity and
      mortality. Experimental and prospective studies in humans have demonstrated an
      association between obstructive sleep apnea and low birth weight. Endothelial
      dysfunction may be the link that underlies the association of obstructive sleep
      apnea with high perinatal risk. The information reviewed herein suggests that
      treating obstructive sleep apnea with positive-pressure devices could be an
      effective strategy for decreasing perinatal morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Maternal salivary cortisone to cortisol ratio in late pregnancy: An improved
      method for predicting offspring birth weight.
PG  - 10-13
LID - S0306-4530(16)30430-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.12.018 [doi]
AB  - Overexposure to maternal cortisol in utero has been associated with lower birth
      weight of offspring. In order to regulate fetal exposure to this hormone,
      placental expression of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, an enzyme that
      converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, increases across pregnancy.
      Because of this increase in 11-betaHSD2 activity, measuring maternal cortisol in 
      isolation may not reflect actual fetal exposure to the hormone. Previous work by 
      Hellgren et al. (2016) has shown that maternal serum cortisone:cortisol ratio was
      a better predictor of offspring birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation.
      This paper sought to replicate these results when examining maternal salivary
      cortisone:cortisol ratio. Data come from 55 pregnant women from Auckland, New
      Zealand. Cortisol and cortisone were measured in saliva samples collected at
      waking and prior to going to sleep on two consecutive weekdays between 34 and 36 
      weeks of gestation. We found that salivary cortisol and cortisone followed the
      expected diurnal rhythm and that cortisone was higher than cortisol at both times
      of day. Maternal bedtime cortisone:cortisol ratio was significantly and inversely
      related to offspring birth weight. However, waking and bedtime cortisol, as well 
      as waking cortisone:cortisol ratio, were unrelated to birth weight. These results
      show that maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio, like serum
      cortisone:cortisol ratio, is a more sensitive biomarker for predicting infant
      birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This ratio could be a valuable,
      minimally-invasive measurement for future studies interested in understanding the
      relationship between maternal HPA-axis function and offspring birth weight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine if insomnia before and after childbirth predicts the
      development of postpartum bodily pain. METHODS: This study is part of a
      longitudinal cohort study, the Akershus Birth Cohort Study, which targeted all
      women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The current sample 
      is comprised of 1480 women who participated at all three time points, yielding a 
      participation rate of 32% of the 4662 women who originally consented to
      participate. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia and a
      latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify subsets of women who shared a 
      similar pattern of responses on the BIS-scale across the three time points. Pain 
      was measured using the bodily pain scale, derived from the Primary Care
      Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) and symptoms of depression were
      measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: Using a
      latent profile analysis a three class model showed the best fit and identified
      one major group (55.6%) with a low BIS scores across all three time points, one
      group with intermediate BIS scores (32.9%), and a smaller group (11.5%) with
      higher BIS scores across all three times. The chronic high insomnia group had a
      2.8-fold increased risk of reporting high levels of bodily pain. The chronic
      intermediate group was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of bodily pain
      at two years postpartum. Adjusting for demographics and lifestyle behaviors did
      not reduce any of the associations, while adjusting for depression significantly 
      attenuated the associations. Additional adjustment for pain at eight weeks
      postpartum further reduced the magnitude of the associations, but both chronic
      intermediate insomnia and chronic high insomnia remained strongly associated with
      the onset of bodily pain in the fully adjusted models (RR=1.75, 95% CI:
      1.37-2.23) and RR=1.63, 95% CI: 1.15-2.32, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The high
      prevalence of insomnia among women during and after childbirth, in combination
      with the strong prospective association with impaired physical health, emphasizes
      the importance of adequately identifying, preventing and treating insomnia for
      this population.

PG  - 405-417
LID - 10.1097/GRF.0000000000000279 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is unknown during pregnancy, but the
      syndrome is likely underdiagnosed and rising in frequency along with the obesity 
      epidemic. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse outcomes, including 
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm, and cesarean 
      delivery. Obese pregnant women should be screened and referred to a sleep
      medicine specialist for evaluation. Continuous positive airway pressure is the
      treatment of choice with demonstrated safety and compliance in pregnancy. Early
      anesthesia consultation allows for preparation and implementation of a peripartum
      plan that includes early labor analgesia, avoidance of respiratory depressants,
      and closer monitoring of oxygenation.

TI  - Sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant
      women.
LID - 10.1111/ijn.12518 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disorders are a common problem during pregnancy and may affect quality of
      life. This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its
      relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross-sectional
      study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2-stage cluster sampling
      methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of
      life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015.
      About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations
      between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual 
      sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to
      the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep
      quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

TI  - Consequences of violence across the lifespan: Mental health and sleep quality in 
      pregnant women.
PG  - 587-595
LID - 10.1037/tra0000252 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has 
      negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep 
      health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence
      exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are
      especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the 
      direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to
      violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to
      examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year 
      intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant 
      women. METHOD: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed.
      Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was
      used to evaluate direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Findings indicated that
      while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had
      stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however,
      indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV.
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory
      stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma.
      That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood
      adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of
      childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term
      mental health difficulties associated with early trauma. (PsycINFO Database

TI  - Nutrition, infection and stunting: the roles of deficiencies of individual
      nutrients and foods, and of inflammation, as determinants of reduced linear
      growth of children.
PG  - 50-72
LID - 10.1017/S0954422416000238 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of linear growth by nutritional and inflammatory influences is
      examined in terms of growth-plate endochondral ossification, in order to better
      understand stunted growth in children. Linear growth is controlled by complex
      genetic, physiological, and nutrient-sensitive endocrine/paracrine/autocrine
      mediated molecular signalling mechanisms, possibly including sleep adequacy
      through its influence on growth hormone secretion. Inflammation, which
      accompanies most infections and environmental enteric dysfunction, inhibits
      endochondral ossification through the action of mediators including
      proinflammatory cytokines, the activin A-follistatin system, glucocorticoids and 
      fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In animal models linear growth is
      particularly sensitive to dietary protein as well as Zn intake, which act through
      insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins,
      triiodothyronine, amino acids and Zn2+ to stimulate growth-plate protein and
      proteoglycan synthesis and cell cycle progression, actions which are blocked by
      corticosteroids and inflammatory cytokines. Observational human studies indicate 
      stunting to be associated with nutritionally poor, mainly plant-based diets.
      Intervention studies provide some support for deficiencies of energy, protein, Zn
      and iodine and for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, at least during
      pregnancy. Of the animal-source foods, only milk has been specifically and
      repeatedly shown to exert an important influence on linear growth in both
      undernourished and well-nourished children. However, inflammation, caused by
      infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, which may be widespread in the
      absence of clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and endogenous
      inflammation associated with excess adiposity, in each case contributes to
      stunting, and may explain why nutritional interventions are often unsuccessful.
      Current interventions to reduce stunting are targeting WASH as well as nutrition.

PG  - 150-157
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2016.1277704 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is one of the most basic human requirements. This research aims
      at determining the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of
      life among high-risk pregnant women in Tabriz, Iran, in 2015. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This research was a sectional study done on 364 qualified women in 28-36
      weeks of pregnancy suffering from mild preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The
      sampling was done as convenience. Personal-social-midwifery questionnaire,
      Pittsburg sleep quality, and quality of life in pregnancy (QOL-ORAV) were used
      for gathering data. Multivariate linear regression model was used for determining
      the relationship between sleep quality and its subsets with quality of life and
      controlling confounders. FINDINGS: In the current study, the prevalence of sleep 
      disturbance was 96.4%. Mean (SD) of the total score of sleep quality was 10.1
      (4.1) and the total score of quality of life was 61.7 (17.3). According to
      Pearson's correlation test, there was statistically significant relationship
      between quality of life and sleep quality and all its subsets except sleep
      duration and use of sleep medication (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, according to the
      multivariate linear regression model, sleep latency, day time dysfunction, health
      status, and home air-conditioning were related with quality of life. DISCUSSION: 
      The findings of current research show that sleep quality is low among high-risk
      pregnant women and quality of life is medium. So, it is necessary that required
      training is given by health cares for improving sleep quality and quality of life
      to mothers.

TI  - Transcriptome Profiling of the Lungs Reveals Molecular Clock Genes Expression
      Changes after Chronic Exposure to Ambient Air Particles.
LID - E90 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14010090 [doi]
AB  - The symptoms of asthma, breathlessness, insomnia, etc. all have relevance to
      pulmonary rhythmic disturbances. Epidemiology and toxicology studies have
      demonstrated that exposure to ambient air particles can result in pulmonary
      dysfunction. However, there are no data directly supporting a link between air
      pollution and circadian rhythm disorder. In the present study, we found that
      breathing highly polluted air resulted in changes of the molecular clock genes
      expression in lung by transcriptome profiling analyses in a rodent model.
      Compared to those exposed to filtered air, in both pregnant and offspring rats in
      the unfiltered group, key clock genes (Per1, Per2, Per3, Rev-erbalpha and Dbp)
      expression level decreased and Bmal1 expression level increased. In both rat dams
      and their offspring, after continuous exposure to unfiltered air, we observed
      significant histologic evidence for both perivascular and peribronchial
      inflammation, increased tissue and systemic oxidative stress in the lungs. Our
      results suggest that chronic exposure to particulate matter can induce
      alterations of clock genes expression, which could be another important pathway
      for explaining the feedbacks of ambient particle exposure in addition to
      oxidative stress and inflammation.

TI  - Serum Progesterone Levels in Pregnant Women with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Case 
      Control Study.
PG  - 259-265
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2016.5917 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a risk factor for sleep disordered breathing, including 
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Progesterone, one of the key hormones in
      pregnancy, a known respiratory drive stimulant, increases ventilation and may
      protect against OSA. We aimed to examine the relationship between circulating
      progesterone and OSA, after accounting for body weight and gestational age.
      METHODS: A case control study was conducted of pregnant women with OSA and those 
      at low risk for the disorder. Cases were identified by ICD-9 code and review of
      medical record. Controls were identified if they scored zero (never) for snoring,
      apnea, and gasping on the multivariable apnea prediction index questionnaire
      immediately following delivery. Subjects with available stored first and/or
      second trimester residual serum samples were then included in this study and
      serum analyzed for progesterone. Raw progesterone levels were adjusted for the
      effects of gestational age and maternal weight. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cases and
      64 controls with available serum were identified. Women with OSA had greater
      maternal weight and higher rates of related comorbidities, compared to controls. 
      Progesterone levels correlated positively with gestational age and negatively
      with greater weight. Progesterone levels, adjusted for gestational age and
      maternal weight and expressed as multiples of median (MoM), were significantly
      lower in OSA cases compared to controls in both the first trimester (MoM = 0.71, 
      confidence interval [95% CI] 0.60-0.83) relative to the MoM in controls of 1.00. 
      In the second trimester levels were also lower in OSA cases (MoM = 0.84, 95% CI
      0.73-0.96) compared to the MoM of 1.00 in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Progesterone
      levels, after accounting for weight and gestational age, were lower in women with
      OSA than controls. Progesterone may play a protective role against OSA.

TI  - Transcutaneous Carbon Dioxide Measurements in Women Receiving Intrathecal
      Morphine for Cesarean Delivery: A Prospective Observational Study.
PG  - 872-878
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000001751 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuraxial morphine is the most commonly used analgesic technique
      after cesarean delivery. The incidence of respiratory depression is reported to
      be very low (0%-1.2%) in this patient population as measured by pulse oximetry
      and respiratory rates. However, hypercapnia may be a more sensitive measure of
      respiratory depression. In the current study, the incidence of hypercapnia events
      (transcutaneous CO2 [TcCO2] >50 mm Hg) for >/=2-minute duration was evaluated
      using the Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical Analysis monitor in
      women who received intrathecal morphine for postcesarean delivery analgesia.
      METHODS: Healthy women (>37 weeks of gestation) scheduled for a cesarean delivery
      with spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine were recruited. Baseline
      STOP-BANG sleep apnea questionnaire and TcCO2 readings were obtained. Spinal
      anesthesia was initiated with 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, 15 microg fentanyl,
      and 150 microg morphine. The Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical
      Analysis monitor was reapplied in the postanesthesia care unit and TcCO2
      measurements obtained for up to 24 hours. Supplemental opioid administration and 
      adverse respiratory events were recorded. The primary outcome was the incidence
      of hypercapnia events, defined as a TcCO2 reading >50 mm Hg for >/=2 minutes in
      the first 24 hours after delivery. RESULTS: Of the 120 women who were recruited, 
      108 completed the study. Thirty-five women (32%; 99.15% confidence interval,
      21%-45%) reached the primary outcome of a sustained hypercapnia event. The median
      time (interquartile range [IQR]) from intrathecal morphine administration to the 
      hypercapnia event was 300 (124-691) minutes. The median (IQR) number of events
      was 3 (1-6) and longest duration of an event was 25.6 (8.4-98.7) minutes.
      Baseline median (IQR) TcCO2 measurements were 35 (30-0) mm Hg and
      postoperatively, median (IQR) TcCO2 measurements were 40 (36-43) mm Hg, a
      difference of 5 mm Hg (99.15% confidence interval of the difference 2-8 mm Hg, P 
      < .001). The incidence of hypercapnia events was 5.4% in women with a baseline
      TcCO2 value </=31 mm Hg, 22.5% with a baseline TcCO2 between 32 and 38 mm Hg, and
      77.4% with a baseline TcCO2 >38 mm Hg (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypercapnia events
      (>50 mm Hg for >/=2-minute duration) occurred frequently in women receiving 150
      mug intrathecal morphine for postcesarean analgesia. Higher baseline TcCO2
      readings were observed in women who had hypercapnia events.

TI  - Late gestational intermittent hypoxia induces metabolic and epigenetic changes in
      male adult offspring mice.
PG  - 2551-2568
LID - 10.1113/JP273570 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Late gestation during pregnancy has been associated with a relatively
      high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent hypoxia, a
      hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long-term effects on somatic growth,
      energy homeostasis and metabolic function in offspring. Here we show that late
      gestation intermittent hypoxia induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by
      increased body weight and adiposity index in adult male offspring that is
      paralleled by epigenomic alterations and inflammation in visceral white adipose
      tissue. Fetal perturbations by OSA during pregnancy impose long-term detrimental 
      effects manifesting as metabolic dysfunction in adult male offspring. ABSTRACT:
      Pregnancy, particularly late gestation (LG), has been associated with a
      relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent
      hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long-term effects on
      somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring. We
      hypothesized that IH during late pregnancy (LG-IH) may increase the propensity
      for metabolic dysregulation and obesity in adult offspring via epigenetic
      modifications. Time-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to LG-IH or room
      air (LG-RA) during days 13-18 of gestation. At 24 weeks, blood samples were
      collected from offspring mice for lipid profiles and insulin resistance, indirect
      calorimetry was performed and visceral white adipose tissues (VWAT) were assessed
      for inflammatory cells as well as for differentially methylated gene regions
      (DMRs) using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on chip (MeDIP-chip). Body
      weight, food intake, adiposity index, fasting insulin, triglycerides and
      cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in LG-IH male but not female
      offspring. LG-IH also altered metabolic expenditure and locomotor activities in
      male offspring, and increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages emerged in
      VWAT along with 1520 DMRs (P < 0.0001), associated with 693 genes. Pathway
      analyses showed that genes affected by LG-IH were mainly associated with
      molecular processes related to metabolic regulation and inflammation. LG-IH
      induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by increased body weight and adiposity
      index in adult male offspring that is paralleled by epigenomic alterations and
      inflammation in VWAT. Thus, perturbations to fetal environment by OSA during
      pregnancy can have long-term detrimental effects on the fetus, and lead to
      persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

TI  - Factors influencing outcomes of the treatment of positional plagiocephaly in
      infants: a 7-year experience.
PG  - 273-281
LID - 10.3171/2016.9.PEDS16275 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE Following institution of the Back to Sleep Campaign, the incidence of
      sudden infant death syndrome decreased while the prevalence of positional skull
      deformation increased dramatically. The management of positional deformity is
      controversial, and treatment recommendations and outcomes reporting are variable.
      The authors reviewed their institutional experience (2008-2014) with the
      treatment of positional plagiocephaly to explore factors associated with measured
      improvement. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted with risk factors
      and treatment for positional head shape deformity recorded. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were used to assess the impact of these variables on the
      change in measured oblique diagonal difference (ODD) on head shape surface
      scanning pre- and posttreatment. RESULTS A total of 991 infants aged less than 1 
      year were evaluated for cranial positional deformity in a dedicated clinical
      program. The most common deformity was occipital plagiocephaly (69.5%), followed 
      by occipital brachycephaly (18.4%) or a combination of both deformities (12.1%). 
      Recommended treatment included repositioning (RP), physical therapy (PT) if
      indicated, or orthotic treatment with a customized cranial orthosis (CO)
      according to an age- and risk factor-dependent algorithm that the authors
      developed for this clinic. Of the 991 eligible patients, 884 returned for at
      least 1 follow-up appointment. A total of 552 patients were followed to
      completion of their treatment and had a full set of records for analysis: these
      patients had pre- and posttreatment 2D surface scanner evaluations. The average
      presenting age was 6.2 months (corrected for prematurity for treatment
      considerations). Of the 991 patients, 543 (54.8%) had RP or PT as first
      recommended treatment. Of these 543 patients, 137 (25.2%) transitioned to helmet 
      therapy after the condition did not improve over 4-8 weeks. In the remaining
      cases, RP/PT had already failed before the patients were seen in this program,
      and the starting treatment recommendation was CO. At the end of treatment, the
      measured improvements in ODD were 36.7%, 33.5%, and 15.1% for patients receiving 
      CO, RP/PT/CO, and RP/PT, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that sex, race,
      insurance, diagnosis, sleep position preference, torticollis history, and
      multiple gestation were not significantly associated with magnitude of ODD change
      during treatment. On multivariate analysis, corrected age at presentation and
      type of treatment received were significantly associated with magnitude of ODD
      change. Orthotic treatment corresponded with the largest ODD change, while the
      RP/PT group had the least change in ODD. Earlier age at presentation corresponded
      with larger ODD change. CONCLUSIONS Earlier age at presentation and type of
      treatment impact the degree of measured deformational head shape correction in
      positional plagiocephaly. This retrospective study suggests that treatment with a
      custom CO can result in more improvement in objective measurements of head shape.

AB  - Introduction To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with
      overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods Data from the 2011 and 2012 
      Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n =
      2951) of childbearing age (18-44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all
      fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included.
      Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status.
      Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results Total
      daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration
      among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [beta = -0.03, (-0.07, 0.00)]. 
      Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep 
      duration [beta = -0.19, (-0.38, -0.01) and beta = -0.20, (-0.33, -0.08)
      respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or
      exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase
      in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every
      unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who
      exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional
      sleep compared to those who did not [beta = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment
      status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep
      duration. Discussion Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with
      exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and
      vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of
      additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and
      other medications as potential confounders.

TI  - Sleep Trajectories Among Pregnant Women and the Impact on Outcomes: A
      Population-Based Cohort Study.
PG  - 1139-1146
LID - 10.1007/s10995-016-2212-9 [doi]
AB  - Objectives Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy,
      particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or
      focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify
      sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated
      factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods We studied 200 women
      from a mother-child cohort recruited in 2009-2011 from the French general
      population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through
      questionnaires. Results We detected three sleep duration trajectories during
      pregnancy: short-decreasing (<6.5h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing
      (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (>8h/night, 31.6%) trajectories.
      Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the
      medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13
      [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working > 28 weeks of gestational age
      (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10-0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this
      trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression
      coefficient/trimester = -0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression
      coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor 
      associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration
      (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e.
      cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were
      more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing
      trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with
      the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the
      short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the
      long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion We identified sleep trajectories
      among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy 
      and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal
      and child health.

TI  - Mechanotransduction as an Adaptation to Gravity.
PG  - 140
LID - 10.3389/fped.2016.00140 [doi]
AB  - Gravity has played a critical role in the development of terrestrial life. A key 
      event in evolution has been the development of mechanisms to sense and transduce 
      gravitational force into biological signals. The objective of this manuscript is 
      to review how living organisms on Earth use mechanotransduction as an adaptation 
      to gravity. Certain cells have evolved specialized structures, such as otoliths
      in hair cells of the inner ear and statoliths in plants, to respond directly to
      the force of gravity. By conducting studies in the reduced gravity of spaceflight
      (microgravity) or simulating microgravity in the laboratory, we have gained
      insights into how gravity might have changed life on Earth. We review how
      microgravity affects prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells at the cellular and
      molecular levels. Genomic studies in yeast have identified changes in genes
      involved in budding, cell polarity, and cell separation regulated by Ras, PI3K,
      and TOR signaling pathways. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis of late pregnant
      rats have revealed that microgravity affects genes that regulate circadian
      clocks, activate mechanotransduction pathways, and induce changes in immune
      response, metabolism, and cells proliferation. Importantly, these studies
      identified genes that modify chromatin structure and methylation, suggesting that
      long-term adaptation to gravity may be mediated by epigenetic modifications.
      Given that gravity represents a modification in mechanical stresses encounter by 
      the cells, the tensegrity model of cytoskeletal architecture provides an
      excellent paradigm to explain how changes in the balance of forces, which are
      transmitted across transmembrane receptors and cytoskeleton, can influence
      intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression.

      placenta affect fetal size.
PG  - 1698-1708
LID - 10.1096/fj.201601032R [doi]
AB  - Maternal metabolic adaptations are essential for successful pregnancy outcomes.
      We investigated how metabolic gestational processes are coordinated, whether
      there is a functional link with internal clocks, and whether disruptions are
      related to metabolic abnormalities in pregnancy, by studying day/night metabolic 
      pathways in murine models and samples from pregnant women with normally grown and
      large-for-gestational age infants. In early mouse pregnancy, expression of
      hepatic lipogenic genes was up-regulated and uncoupled from the hepatic clock. In
      late mouse pregnancy, rhythmicity of energy metabolism-related genes in the
      muscle followed the patterns of internal clock genes in this tissue, and
      coincided with enhanced lipid transporter expression in the fetoplacental unit.
      Diurnal triglyceride patterns were disrupted in human placentas from pregnancies 
      with large-for-gestational age infants and this overlapped with an increase in
      BMAL1 expression. Metabolic adaptations in early pregnancy are uncoupled from the
      circadian clock, whereas in late pregnancy, energy availability is mediated by
      coordinated muscle-placenta metabolic adjustments linked to internal clocks.
      Placental triglyceride oscillations in the third trimester of human pregnancy are
      lost in large-for-gestational age infants and may be regulated by BMAL1. In
      summary, disruptions in metabolic and circadian rhythmicity are associated with
      increased fetal size, with implications for the pathogenesis of
      macrosomia.-Papacleovoulou, G., Nikolova, V., Oduwole, O., Chambers, J.,

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of 
      "apple body type" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance 
      of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Sleep center setting. PATIENTS: Two hundred and
      eight subjects who were referred for an evaluation of possible OSA at Tulane
      Comprehensive Sleep Center. The exclusion criteria were age<18years old,
      incomplete or absent questionnaire, incomplete body type identification,
      polysomnography (PSG) refusal, and pregnant women. INTERVENTIONS: STOP-BANG items
      and body type data were collected on the initial clinic visit. An overnight PSG
      was performed on every participant. MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive analyses of the
      demographic data and PSG variables were performed. The predictive parameters of
      STOP and STOP-BANG without and with body type score (STOP-Apple and
      STOPBANG-Apple) were compared. MAIN RESULTS: The STOP questionnaire's
      sensitivity/specificity/positive likelihood ratio (+LR) (cut-off=2) was
      96%/11%/1.1, respectively whereas the STOP-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=3) was
      88%/39%/1.5. The STOP-BANG's sensitivity/specificity/+LR (cut-off=3) was
      96%/19%/1.2, respectively whereas the STOP-BANG-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=4)
      was 90%/39%/1.5. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
      of STOP-Apple was comparable to the STOP-BANG (P=0.25). The addition of the apple
      body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire in participants with a score>/=3
      led to increased specificity (67.4%), increased the odds ratio of having OSA of
      2.5 (95% CI, 1.2-5.3) and odds ratio of having moderate-severe OSA of 4.7 (95%
      CI, 2.5-8.7). CONCLUSION: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item 
      to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG
      confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.

AB  - The patient is a 1-week-old boy born at 37+2 weeks' gestational age through
      spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal
      gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia. The Apgar score was 9 at both 1 
      minute and 5 minutes after birth. Because of hypoglycemia at delivery that
      required IV dextrose, he was admitted to the local neonatal intensive care unit. 
      His blood glucose levels quickly stabilized, dextrose administration was
      discontinued, and the patient began breast-feeding. On day 2 of life, the patient
      began having intermittent oxygen desaturation, with oxygen saturation as measured
      by pulse oximetry down to 70% while sleeping; he was transferred to a
      tertiary-care NICU for further management. Aside from the hypoxia, he was
      otherwise asymptomatic. He was breast-feeding without difficulty and had no
      vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux; no cyanosis, stridor, or snoring; and no
      seizure-like activity or hypertonicity.

TI  - Poor Sleep Quality, Psychological Distress, and the Buffering Effect of
      Mindfulness Training During Pregnancy.
PG  - 611-624
LID - 10.1080/15402002.2016.1266488 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality is common in pregnancy and associated
      with increased psychological distress, which has adverse consequences for
      families. Emerging theory suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may help 
      reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity to stressful events. The current study 
      examines the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on the relationship
      between poor sleep quality and increased depression symptom severity and
      perceived stress during pregnancy. Additionally, we explored the prevalence of
      poor sleep quality in this unique sample and the impact of intervention on sleep 
      quality. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 215 ethnically diverse, overweight and
      obese, predominantly low-income pregnant women drawn from a study examining the
      impact of an 8-week mindfulness-based program (Mindful Moms Training; MMT) to
      reduce excessive gestational weight gain, stress, and depression compared to
      treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: Participants reported global sleep quality,
      depressive symptoms, and perceived stress at baseline and postintervention.
      RESULTS: Most participants (63%) were categorized as poor sleepers at baseline.
      MMT participants did not experience significantly greater improvement in sleep
      quality compared to TAU participants. Baseline poor global sleep quality
      predicted increased depression symptom severity for all participants. Baseline
      poor global sleep quality predicted increased perceived stress for the TAU group 
      only; this association was not evident in the MMT group. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep 
      quality is prevalent in overweight and obese predominantly low-income pregnant
      women. Poor sleep quality was associated with worsening psychological distress,
      but mindfulness training significantly attenuated the influence of poor sleep on 
      perceived stress.

AB  - Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal
      health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the
      effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal
      physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two 
      high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) >/= 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening
      Scale (PDSS) >/= 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 176)
      and control group (n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session
      couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual
      care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy
      (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group
      had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor (p <
      .05). At 42 days after delivery, only 5.1% of participants were lost to
      follow-up, and the intervention group had significantly less minor and major
      depression, more sleep time, more satisfaction with their husband and other
      family members, less concern about taking care of baby, and less breast milk
      insufficiency than the control group (p < .05). A prenatal psychological
      intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive
      program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Eveningness as a risk for behavioral problems in late adolescence.
PG  - 225-234
LID - 10.1080/07420528.2016.1267739 [doi]
AB  - Circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with increased risk
      for mental health problems both in early adolescence and in adulthood. However,
      in late adolescence, when circadian rhythm naturally shifts to later, its
      significance for mental health is not clear. Accordingly, we studied how
      circadian rhythm estimated both by self-reported chronotype and by
      actigraph-defined midpoint of sleep was associated with self-reported psychiatric
      problems based on Youth Self Report (YSR). The study builds on a community cohort
      born in 1998, Helsinki, Finland. At age 17 years (mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1
      years), 183 adolescents (65.6% of the invited) participated in the study. We used
      the shortened version of the Horne-Ostberg morningness-eveningness Questionnaire 
      to define the chronotype, and actigraphs to define the naturally occur circadian 
      rhythm over a 4 to 17 days' period (mean nights N = 8.3, SD = 1.8). The Achenbach
      software was used to obtain T-score values for YSR psychiatric problem scales.
      The analyses were adjusted for important covariates including gender,
      socioeconomic status, body mass index, pubertal maturation, mother's licorice
      consumption during pregnancy, and actigraph-defined sleep duration and quality.
      Eveningness was associated with higher scores in rule-breaking behavior and
      conduct problems (as assessed either by midpoint of sleep or by self-reported
      chronotype, p-values <0.05), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (by
      self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), with affective problems (by midpoint
      of sleep and by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05) and somatic complaints 
      (by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), as compared to circadian tendency 
      toward morningness. Our results suggest that the association between eveningness 
      and externalizing problem behavior, present in children and younger adolescents, 
      is also present in late adolescence when circadian rhythms shift toward evening.

TI  - Wahakura Versus Bassinet for Safe Infant Sleep: A Randomized Trial.
LID - e20160162 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2016-0162 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare an indigenous sleep device (wahakura) for infants at high 
      risk for sudden unexpected death with a bassinet, for measures of infant sleep
      position, head covering, breastfeeding, bed-sharing, and maternal sleep and
      fatigue. METHODS: A total of 200 mainly Maori pregnant women were recruited from 
      deprived areas of New Zealand. They were randomized to receive a bassinet or
      wahakura and asked to sleep the infant in this device from birth. Questionnaires 
      at 1, 3, and 6 months and an overnight infrared video in the home at 1 month were
      completed. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat and an "as-used" analysis of
      questionnaires showed no group differences at 1, 3, and 6 months in infant-adult 
      direct bed-sharing (7% vs 12%, P = .24 at 1 month), and at the 6-month interview,
      the wahakura group reported twice the level of full breastfeeding (22.5% vs
      10.7%, P = .04). Maternal sleep and fatigue were not significantly different
      between groups. Video identified no increase in head covering, prone/side sleep
      position, or bed-sharing in the wahakura group, either from intention-to-treat
      analysis, or when analyzed for actual sleep location. CONCLUSION: There were no
      significant differences in infant risk behaviors in wahakura compared with
      bassinets and there were other advantages, including an increase in sustained
      breastfeeding. This suggests wahakura are relatively safe and can be promoted as 
      an alternative to infant-adult bed-sharing. Policies that encourage utilization
      are likely to be helpful in high-risk populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality in non-obstetrical and obstetrical patients. OBJECTIVES: 
      To estimate the prevalence of OSA and its relationship with pregnancy-related
      complications in a general obstetric population of Department of Defense
      beneficiaries receiving direct-care at military treatment facilities. STUDY
      DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of all women (N=305,001) who gave birth at a
      military treatment facility from 2008 to 2014. OSA cases were randomly selected
      and matched on age (3:1 ratio) to non OSA cases. Multivariable logistic
      regression was used to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean 
      delivery, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia,
      postoperative wound complications, hospital stay greater than five days, acute
      renal failure, pulmonary edema, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and
      stillbirth) between pregnant women with and without a diagnosis of OSA. Cases
      were identified using ICD-9 codes, while controlling for demographics, obesity,
      and medical comorbidities associated with OSA and the outcomes of interest.
      RESULTS: We identified 266 cases of OSA (OSA rate=8.7 per 10,000; increased from 
      6.4 to 9.9 per 10,000 from 2009 to 2013). OSA was associated with a higher odds
      of cesarean delivery (AOR,1.60; 95% CI, 1.06-2.40), gestational hypertension,
      (AOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.30-4.68), preeclampsia (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.43-4.09), and 
      preterm delivery (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.30). CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep
      apnea is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

TI  - [THE EFFECT OF MOTION SICKNESS ON THE SLEEP-WAKE CYCLE IN RATS EXPOSED TO
      PRENATAL HYPOXIA].
PG  - 41-48
AB  - This study is a continuation of our research of phenomenology and mechanisms of
      motion sickness (MS) and the relation of this phenomenon to features of
      sleep-wake cycle (SWC) changes. It presents data about the effect of MS on SWC in
      30-day-old intact rats and rats exposed previously to prenatal hypoxia on days 13
      and 19 of gestation. In all groups of animals MS was shown to reduce
      significantly the waking time and to increase the time of paradoxical sleep (PS).
      For the first time it became possible to reveal a connection between hypothalamic
      mechanisms controlling MS and SWC and to suggest the role of this connection in
      mechanisms of development of the sopite syndrome which may be the only
      manifestation of MS in some animals and man. The results obtained demonstrate
      that hypoxia on day 19 of gestation has a greater damaging effect on the
      thalamocortical sleep-regulating structures than hypoxia on day 13 when only
      hypothalamic-hippocampal systems controlling slow-wave sleep were found
      disturbed. Against this background MS substantially suppresses the activity of
      the brain excitatory systems which provide wake- fulness maintenance (it appears 
      to be the ascending reticular activating system) and enhances the work of those
      activating systems that control PS. It is in rats exposed to preliminary hypoxia 
      on day 19 of gesta- tion, where it was possible to show the role of the
      evolutionary young thalamocortical system in the control of PS.

TI  - Circadian behavior of adult mice exposed to stress and fluoxetine during
      development.
PG  - 793-804
LID - 10.1007/s00213-016-4515-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women of child-bearing age are the population at greatest risk for 
      depression. The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated
      antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is 
      among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously 
      demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian
      rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress
      during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the
      circadian behavior of mice as adults. METHODS: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic
      unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12),
      a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age,
      male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of
      wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were
      assessed. RESULTS: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced
      phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment 
      to an 8-h phase advance of their light-dark cycle. Mice subjected to either
      perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase 
      advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase
      shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their
      combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems 
      as adults.

AB  - This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis 
      was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate
      meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 
      4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) 
      and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used
      screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy
      was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I(2) = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair
      with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I(2) =
      78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I(2) = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance
      was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity 
      increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory
      disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was
      performed in early pregnancy (</=20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk
      pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and
      specificity of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.56; I(2) = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48,
      0.75; I(2) = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor
      performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed.

TI  - Pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications as determinants of postpartum
      depression: the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece.
PG  - 244-255
LID - 10.1017/S2045796016001062 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Few epidemiological studies evaluated associations between perinatal
      complications and maternal mood at the early postpartum period and the findings
      are inconsistent. We aimed at investigating a wide range of complications during 
      pregnancy, at delivery, and at the early postpartum period as determinants of
      postpartum depression (PPD) at 8 weeks postpartum. METHODS: A total of 1037 women
      who enrolled in the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece participated in the
      present study. Information on pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications
      was obtained from clinical records or by questionnaires. Postpartum depressive
      symptoms were assessed at 8 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were
      fit to estimate the association between pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum
      complications and maternal depressive symptoms, adjusting also for potential
      confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of women with probable depression (EPDS
      score >/= 13) was 13.6% at 8 weeks postpartum. Gestational hypertension and/or
      preeclampsia (beta coefficient 1.86, 95% CI: 0.32, 3.41) and breastfeeding
      difficulties (beta coefficient 0.77, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.53) were significantly
      associated with higher PPD symptoms. Sleep patterns during pregnancy, such as
      sleep deprivation (OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.91, 6.67) and snoring (OR = 1.81, 95% CI:
      1.11, 2.93), and breastfeeding duration less than 2 months (OR = 1.77, 95% CI:
      1.19, 2.64) were significantly associated with increase in the odds for PPD. Some
      other complications, such as unplanned pregnancy and hospitalisation during
      pregnancy were also associated with EPDS score, but these associations were
      explained by socio-demographic characteristics of the mother. CONCLUSIONS: We
      found that several pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications may have an 
      adverse effect on maternal mood at the early postpartum period. These findings
      have considerable implications for developing effective prevention and early
      psychoeducational intervention strategies for women at risk of developing PPD.

TI  - Semilobar holoprosencephaly in a 12-month-old baby boy born to a primigravida
      patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a case report.
PG  - 358
LID - 10.1186/s13256-016-1141-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Holoprosencephaly is a rare spectrum of cephalic disorders resulting 
      from a failure or incomplete division of the embryonic forebrain into distinct
      cerebral hemispheres. It is the most common brain malformation with an incidence 
      of 1:250 during embryogenesis; however, owing to the associated high rates of
      spontaneous abortion the incidence is 1:16,000 among live deliveries.
      Pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly is complex and heterogeneous involving genetic 
      abnormalities, teratogenic exposures, and syndromic associations. Among the
      teratogenic exposures, maternal diabetes is a well-established risk factor
      associated with a 200-fold increased incidence of holoprosencephaly. CASE
      PRESENTATION: We report a case of a delayed diagnosis of semilobar
      holoprosencephaly in a 12-month-old baby boy of African descent who presented to 
      us with a history of global developmental delay, erratic sleep patterns, and poor
      weight gain. He was born to a type 1 diabetes mellitus mother at 39+ weeks by
      emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and breech presentation. The
      baby weighed 2315 g and had Apgar scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes
      respectively. A physical examination done at 12 months of age revealed a
      small-for-age child with a developmental age of 2 months. He had normal facies
      but a neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all four limbs. The rest of 
      systemic examination was unremarkable. Hematological and biochemical
      investigations revealed normal findings except for iron deficiency anemia. The
      child also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of his brain which revealed
      distinctive features of semilobar holoprosencephaly. He was treated for iron
      deficiency anemia with Hemovit syrup (ferric ammonium citrate, folic acid,
      pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin, and zinc sulfate) 10 ml thrice daily,
      ferrous sulfate 10 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, and multivitamin
      syrup 5 ml once daily. Furthermore, nutritional and genetic counseling was
      offered to his parents. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, although rare,
      holoprosencephaly is the commonest structural anomaly of the brain with a complex
      and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. It is prudent to diagnose it prenatally,
      classify its severity, and forge its prognosis so that parents are counseled
      early enough to make informed decisions especially where termination of pregnancy
      may be implicated.

TI  - Spinal Muscular Atrophy
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by
      muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from progressive degeneration and loss of
      the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (i.e., lower motor neurons) and the
      brain stem nuclei. The onset of weakness ranges from before birth to adolescence 
      or young adulthood. The weakness is symmetric, proximal > distal, and
      progressive. Before the genetic basis of SMA was understood, it was classified
      into clinical subtypes; however, it is now apparent that the phenotype of
      SMN1-associated SMA spans a continuum without clear delineation of subtypes. Poor
      weight gain with growth failure, restrictive lung disease, scoliosis, joint
      contractures, and sleep difficulties are common complications. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      The diagnosis of SMA is established in a proband with a history of motor
      difficulties, evidence of motor unit disease on physical examination, and
      identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1 on molecular genetic
      testing. Increases in SMN2 copy number often modify the phenotype. MANAGEMENT:
      Treatment of manifestations: When nutrition is a concern in SMA, placement of a
      gastrostomy tube early in the course of the disease is appropriate. Formal
      consultation with a pulmonologist familiar with SMA is indicated. As respiratory 
      function deteriorates, tracheotomy or noninvasive respiratory support is offered.
      Surgical repair for scoliosis should be considered based on progression of the
      curvature, pulmonary function, and bone maturity. Surveillance: Evaluation every 
      six months or more frequently for weaker children to assess nutritional state,
      respiratory function, and orthopedic status. GENETIC COUNSELING: SMA is inherited
      in an autosomal recessive manner. Each pregnancy of a couple who have had a child
      with SMA has an approximately 25% chance of producing an affected child, an
      approximately 50% chance of producing an asymptomatic carrier, and an
      approximately 25% chance of producing an unaffected child who is not a carrier.
      These recurrence risks deviate slightly from the norm for autosomal recessive
      inheritance because about 2% of affected individuals have a de novo SMN1 variant 
      on one allele; in these instances, only one parent is a carrier of an SMN1
      variant, and thus the sibs are not at increased risk for SMA. Carrier testing for
      at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are
      possible if the diagnosis of SMA has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing 
      in an affected family member.

TI  - Effect of regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy on pregnancy outcome of
      high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients.
PG  - 5013-5016
LID - 11871 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of 100 mg/d regular
      oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy on high-risk pregnancy-induced
      hypertension syndrome patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We consecutively selected
      98 cases high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients. After
      obtaining the informed consent of the patients, we randomly divided the patients 
      into aspirin group (50 cases) and placebo group (48 cases). The oral intake of
      aspirin lasted from the final diagnosis of pregnancy to antepartum time, and was 
      taken before sleep. The bleeding index was closely detected and we stop taking
      aspirin when necessary. RESULTS: The comparison of clinical outcome showed that
      the incidents of pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome, pre-eclampsia and
      eclampsia of aspirin group were significantly lower than that of the placebo
      group (p<0.05). Comparing the complications of fetus perinatal period, the
      difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 100 mg/d
      regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy is safe, effective and worthy of 
      generalization to high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients.

AB  - Clinicians should take initiatives to establish ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM) services in their own practice, or to ensure that they have
      access to such services elsewhere. Whenever possible, ABPM should be performed in
      suitable cases, where it is likely to deliver clinically useful information for
      making a correct diagnosis, or for tailoring the anti-hypertensive treatment
      regimen for each individual patient. ABPM is clinically useful, among others, for
      identifying people with "masked normotension", "masked hypertension", "sleep-time
      hypertension", and "reduced decline of sleep-time blood pressure". This review
      briefly outlines the rationales for the use of ABPM, interpretations of the
      ABPM-derived parameters, and the advantages of ABPM in decision making in the
      management of hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between maternal birth country and adherence
      to the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations in a national
      sample of Hispanic mothers, given that data assessing the heterogeneity of infant
      care practices among Hispanics are lacking. STUDY DESIGN: We used a stratified,
      2-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers
      from 32 US intrapartum hospitals. A total of 907 completed follow-up surveys
      (administered 2-6 months postpartum) were received from mothers who
      self-identified as Hispanic/Latina, forming our sample, which we divided into 4
      subpopulations by birth country (US, Mexico, Central/South America, and
      Caribbean). Prevalence estimates and aORs were determined for infant sleep
      position, location, breastfeeding, and maternal smoking. RESULTS: When compared
      with US-born mothers, we found that mothers born in the Caribbean (aOR 4.56) and 
      Central/South America (aOR 2.68) were significantly more likely to room share
      without bed sharing. Caribbean-born mothers were significantly less likely to
      place infants to sleep supine (aOR 0.41). Mothers born in Mexico (aOR 1.67) and
      Central/South America (aOR 2.57) were significantly more likely to exclusively
      breastfeed; Caribbean-born mothers (aOR 0.13) were significantly less likely to
      do so. Foreign-born mothers were significantly less likely to smoke before and
      during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Among US Hispanics, adherence to American Academy 
      of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations varies widely by maternal birth country.
      These data illustrate the importance of examining behavioral heterogeneity among 
      ethnic groups and have potential relevance for developing targeted interventions 
      for safe infant sleep.

TI  - Negative Life Events and Antenatal Depression among Pregnant Women in Rural
      China: The Role of Negative Automatic Thoughts.
PG  - e0167597
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0167597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have looked at the relationship between psychological and
      the mental health status of pregnant women in rural China. The current study aims
      to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between 
      negative life events and antenatal depression. METHODS: Data were collected in
      June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive
      symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of
      pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic
      thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life
      events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used
      logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the
      only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to
      antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated 
      with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the
      eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 
      0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of
      negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative
      automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events
      which might lead to antenatal depression.

TI  - Hemodynamic Response to Upper Airway Obstruction in Hypertensive and Normotensive
      Pregnant Women.
PG  - 9816494
AB  - Background. Mild obstructive sleep apnea is common in pregnancy and may have an
      exacerbating role in gestational hypertension, although currently the interaction
      between these two diseases is uncertain. Methods. We analyzed 43 pregnant
      subjects, 28 with gestational hypertension (GH) and 15 with normal healthy
      pregnancy, by level I polysomnography. Additionally, diastolic and systolic blood
      pressure changes in response to obstructive respiratory events were measured by
      noninvasive beat-by-beat monitoring. We also assessed a subgroup (n = 27) of
      women with respiratory disturbance indexes <5, for blood pressure responses to
      very subtle obstructive respiratory disturbances ("airflow reductions"). Results.
      The mean +/- standard deviation respiratory disturbance index of our 28 GH women 
      and 15 healthy pregnant women was 10.1 +/- 9.9 mmHg and 3.0 +/- 3.8 mmHg,
      respectively. Systolic and diastolic pressure responses to these events were 30.1
      +/- 12.8 mmHg and 16.0 +/- 6.1 mmHg for GH women and 29.1 +/- 14.2 mmHg and 14.3 
      +/- 7.7 mmHg for healthy women. For the 27 women in whom we assessed for airflow 
      reduction events, the hemodynamic responses were 27.1 +/- 12.3 mmHg systolic and 
      14.4 +/- 6.7 mmHg diastolic. Interpretation. Upper airway obstructive events of
      any severity are associated with a substantial transient blood pressure response 
      in both healthy pregnant and GH women. Whether or not these events have a
      clinically significant impact on women with GH remains uncertain.

TI  - Publication Trends in Acupuncture Research: A 20-Year Bibliometric Analysis Based
      on PubMed.
PG  - e0168123
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168123 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acupuncture has become popular and widely practiced in many countries 
      around the world. Despite the large amount of acupuncture-related literature that
      has been published, broader trends in the prevalence and scope of acupuncture
      research remain underexplored. The current study quantitatively analyzes trends
      in acupuncture research publications in the past 20 years. METHODS: A
      bibliometric approach was used to search PubMed for all acupuncture-related
      research articles including clinical and animal studies. Inclusion criteria were 
      articles published between 1995 and 2014 with sufficient information for
      bibliometric analyses. Rates and patterns of acupuncture publication within the
      20 year observational period were estimated, and compared with broader
      publication rates in biomedicine. Identified eligible publications were further
      analyzed with respect to study type/design, clinical condition addressed, country
      of origin, and journal impact factor. RESULTS: A total of 13,320
      acupuncture-related publications were identified using our search strategy and
      eligibility criteria. Regression analyses indicated an exponential growth in
      publications over the past two decades, with a mean annual growth rate of 10.7%. 
      This compares to a mean annual growth rate of 4.5% in biomedicine. A striking
      trend was an observed increase in the proportion of randomized clinical trials
      (RCTs), from 7.4% in 1995 to 20.3% in 2014, exceeding the 4.5% proportional
      growth of RCTs in biomedicine. Over the 20 year period, pain was consistently the
      most common focus of acupuncture research (37.9% of publications). Other top
      rankings with respect to medical focus were arthritis, neoplasms/cancer,
      pregnancy or labor, mood disorders, stroke, nausea/vomiting, sleep, and
      paralysis/palsy. Acupuncture research was conducted in 60 countries, with the top
      3 contributors being China (47.4%), United States (17.5%), and United Kingdom
      (8.2%). Retrieved articles were published mostly in complementary and alternative
      medicine (CAM) journals with impact factors ranging between 0.7 and 2.8 in the
      top 20 journals, followed by journals specializing in neuroscience, pain,
      anesthesia/analgesia, internal medicine and comprehensive fields. CONCLUSION:
      Acupuncture research has grown markedly in the past two decades, with a 2-fold
      higher growth rate than for biomedical research overall. Both the increases in
      the proportion of RCTs and the impact factor of journals support that the quality
      of published research has improved. While pain was a consistently dominant
      research focus, other topics gained more attention during this time period. These
      findings provide a context for analyzing strengths and gaps in the current state 
      of acupuncture research, and for informing a comprehensive strategy for further
      advancing the field.

TI  - Evaluating acupuncture and standard care for pregnant women with back pain: the
      EASE Back pilot randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN49955124).
PG  - 72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) during pregnancy are
      common and often accepted as a 'normal' part of pregnancy. Many women receive
      little in the way of treatment, and yet pain interferes with sleep, daily
      activities and work and leads to increasing requests for induction of labour or
      elective caesarean section. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility
      of a full RCT evaluating the benefit of acupuncture for pregnancy-related back
      pain. METHODS: This study is a single-centre, three-arm pilot RCT in one large
      maternity unit and associated antenatal and physiotherapy clinics. Women were
      eligible if they had pregnancy-related LBP with or without PGP. Exclusions
      included a history of miscarriage, high risk of early labour or pre-eclampsia,
      PGP only and previous acupuncture. Interventions were standard care (SC): a
      self-management booklet with physiotherapy if needed. SC+TA: the booklet and
      physiotherapy comprising true (penetrating) acupuncture, advice and exercise.
      SC+NPA: the booklet and physiotherapy comprising non-penetrating acupuncture,
      advice and exercise. Remote telephone randomisation used a 1:1:1 allocation ratio
      stratified by gestational weeks. Three measures of pain/function were compared to
      inform the primary outcome measure in a full RCT: the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire
      (PGQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and 11-point 0-10 numerical rating scale
      for pain. Analysis focused on process evaluation of recruitment, retention,
      descriptive information on outcomes, adherence to treatment, occurrence of
      adverse events and impact of physiotherapist training. RESULTS: One hundred
      twenty-five women were randomised (45% of those eligible) between April and
      October 2013; 73% (n = 91) provided 8-week follow-up data. Three of six
      recruitment methods accounted for 82% of total uptake: screening questionnaire at
      the 20-week scan, community midwives issuing study cards, and self-referral
      following local awareness initiatives. Physiotherapists' self-confidence on
      managing pregnancy-related LBP improved post training. The PGQ is suitable as the
      primary outcome in a full trial. The average number of treatment sessions in both
      SC+TA and SC+NPA was six (in line with treatment protocols). No serious adverse
      events attributable to the trial treatments were reported. CONCLUSIONS: A full
      RCT is feasible and would provide evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture
      and inform treatment choices for women with pregnancy-related LBP. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both short and prolonged sleep duration have been linked to impaired 
      glucose metabolism. Sleep patterns change during pregnancy, but prospective data 
      are limited on their relation to gestational diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to
      prospectively examine the trimester-specific (first and second trimester)
      association between typical sleep duration in pregnancy and subsequent risk of
      gestational diabetes, as well as the influence of compensatory daytime napping on
      this association. STUDY DESIGN: In the prospective, multiracial Eunice Kennedy
      Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth
      Studies-Singleton Cohort, 2581 pregnant women reported their typical sleep
      duration and napping frequency in the first and second trimesters. Diagnosis of
      gestational diabetes (n = 107; 4.1%) was based on medical records review.
      Adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for gestational diabetes
      were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy 
      body mass index, and other risk factors. RESULTS: From the first and second
      trimester, sleep duration and napping frequency declined. Sleeping duration in
      the second but not first trimester was significantly related to risk of
      gestational diabetes. The association between second-trimester sleep and
      gestational diabetes differed by prepregnancy obesity status (P for interaction =
      .04). Among nonobese but not obese women, both sleeping >8-9 hours or <8-9 hours 
      were significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes: 5-6 hours (adjusted
      relative risk, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.99); 7 hours (adjusted
      relative risk, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68); or >/=10 hours
      (adjusted relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.67). Significant
      effect modification by napping frequency was also observed in the second
      trimester (P for interaction = .03). Significant and positive association between
      reduced sleep (5-7 hours) and gestational diabetes was observed among women
      napping rarely/never (adjusted relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval,
      1.20-5.13), whereas no comparable associations were observed among women napping 
      most/sometimes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a U-shaped association between sleep
      duration and gestational diabetes, and that napping and prepregnancy obesity
      status may modify this association.

AB  - Preconception health refers to the health of males and females at any point in
      time prior to a potential pregnancy. A goal of preconception health research is
      to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future
      offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper
      briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health
      behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health
      behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours,
      and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a
      scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the
      past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified
      and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours,
      (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d)
      no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over
      40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on
      folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been
      topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and 
      sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of 
      men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included
      male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are
      provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of 
      behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the
      relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.

AB  - Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in 
      cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. 
      Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early
      childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking
      trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with
      those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN,
      which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's
      night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential
      confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires.
      Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling
      on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the "2-5
      rare night-waking" (77% of the children) and the "2-5 common night-waking"
      pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated
      with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the "2-5 common
      night-waking" trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a 
      collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at
      night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification
      of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and
      laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep 
      patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that
      prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this
      population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal
      self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation
      during the third trimester METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among
      1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal
      clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed 
      using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate
      logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders. RESULTS: 
      Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined
      using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs. </=5). Further, the
      prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%,
      respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including
      depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of 
      suicidal ideation (OR=2.81; 95% CI 1.78-4.45). When assessed as a continuous
      variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28%
      increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression
      (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high 
      among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR=13.56 95% CI 7.53-24.41) as
      compared with women without either risk factor. LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional
      study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may 
      not be fully generalizable. CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting 
      for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings
      support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy is a
      risk factor for the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study,
      nulliparous women underwent in-home sleep-disordered breathing assessments in
      early (6-15 weeks of gestation) and midpregnancy (22-31 weeks of gestation).
      Participants and health care providers were blinded to the sleep test results. An
      apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or greater was used to define sleep-disordered
      breathing. Exposure-response relationships were examined, grouping participants
      into four apnea-hypopnea index groups: 0, greater than 0 to less than 5, 5 to
      less than 15, and 15 or greater. The study was powered to test the primary
      hypothesis that sleep-disordered breathing occurring in pregnancy is associated
      with an increased incidence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were rates of
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, defined as preeclampsia and antepartum
      gestational hypertension, and GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from univariate and multivariate
      logistic regression models. RESULTS: Three thousand seven hundred five women were
      enrolled. Apnea-hypopnea index data were available for 3,132 (84.5%) and 2,474
      (66.8%) women in early and midpregnancy, respectively. The corresponding
      prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%. The prevalence of
      preeclampsia was 6.0%, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 13.1%, and GDM 4.1%.
      In early and midpregnancy the adjusted odds ratios for preeclampsia when
      sleep-disordered breathing was present were 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.51) and 1.95 (95%
      CI 1.18-3.23), respectively; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 1.46 (95% CI
      0.91-2.32) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.52); and GDM 3.47 (95% CI 1.95-6.19) and 2.79 
      (95% CI 1.63-4.77). Increasing exposure-response relationships were observed
      between apnea-hypopnea index and both hypertensive disorders and GDM. CONCLUSION:
      There is an independent association between sleep-disordered breathing and
      preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and GDM.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) which includes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
      and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), has emerged as a risk factor for
      adverse maternal-foetal outcomes in pregnancy. Physiological changes of pregnancy
      predispose a woman 'at risk' towards developing SDB. The increasing incidence of 
      OSA in pregnancy closely correlates with the population trends of obesity. Common
      screening tools validated in non-pregnant subjects including Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS) and Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) are poor predictors of SDB in
      pregnancy. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) are linked with SDB. Preeclampsia and OSA share common
      pathological associations. It is unclear if one predisposes the other. Foetal
      morbidity includes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, low 
      birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and Apgar score of
      less than seven at one minute. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a
      well-documented treatment of SDB in pregnancy and has been shown to reverse some 
      of the adverse events. It becomes imperative to diagnose and manage this
      condition as OSA causes substantial morbidity in the untreated pregnant patient
      and foetus. Three short clinical cases and a literature review on SDB on
      pregnancy are presented.

AB  - To develop an animal model for studies on peri-partum sleep disorders, sleep
      patterns in female Wistar rats during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning,
      were assessed and associated adaptive changes in their anxiety were examined.
      Adult nulliparous female rats, maintained in standard laboratory conditions with 
      ad libitum food and water, were surgically implanted with electroencephalogram
      and electromyogram electrodes under anaesthesia for objective assessment of
      sleep-wakefulness (S-W). After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings
      of S-W were taken for 24h before the animals were kept for mating. After
      confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of 
      pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. Their
      anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze. During pregnancy, sleep
      increased primarily due to increase in light non-REM sleep during dark period.
      There was an increase in non-REM sleep delta power after parturition, though the 
      sleep was fragmented, especially during daytime. Simultaneous behavioural
      recording showed increased anxiety during third trimester of pregnancy and
      gradual reversal of it after parturition. This is the first report where diurnal 
      and nocturnal variations in S-W and delta power, along with adaptive changes in
      anxiety, were studied before, during and after pregnancy. This study also
      provides an animal model for drug trials and studies on sleep disorders during
      peri-partum window.

AB  - We investigated the regulation of hepatic ER stress in healthy liver and adult or
      perinatally programmed diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
      Female mice were fed either obesogenic or control diet before mating, during
      pregnancy and lactation. Post-weaning, offspring from each maternal group were
      divided into either obesogenic or control diet. At six months, offspring were
      sacrificed at 4-h intervals over 24 h. Offspring fed obesogenic diets developed
      NAFLD phenotype, and the combination of maternal and offspring obesogenic diets
      exacerbated this phenotype. UPR signalling pathways (IREalpha, PERK, ATF6) and
      their downstream regulators showed different basal rhythmicity, which was
      modified in offspring exposed to obesogenic diet and maternal programming. The
      double obesogenic hit increased liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL staining,
      active caspase-3 and phospho-JNK and GRP78 promoter methylation levels. This
      study demonstrates that hepatic UPR is rhythmically activated. The combination of
      maternal obesity (MO) and obesogenic diets in offspring triggered altered UPR
      rhythmicity, DNA methylation and cellular apoptosis.

TI  - Effect of maternal position on fetal behavioural state and heart rate variability
      in healthy late gestation pregnancy.
PG  - 1213-1221
LID - 10.1113/JP273201 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Fetal behavioural state in healthy late gestation pregnancy is
      affected by maternal position. Fetal state 1F is more likely to occur in maternal
      supine or right lateral positions. Fetal state 4F is less likely to occur when
      the woman lies supine or semi-recumbent. Fetal state change is more likely when
      the woman is supine or semi-recumbent. Fetal heart rate variability is affected
      by maternal position with variability reduced in supine and semi-recumbent
      positions. ABSTRACT: Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal
      wellbeing. In acute hypoxaemia, the human fetus adapts to a lower oxygen
      consuming state with changes in the cardiotocograph and reduced fetal activity.
      Recent studies of late gestation stillbirth described the importance of sleep
      position in the risk of intrauterine death. We designed this study to assess the 
      effects of different maternal positions on FBS in healthy late gestation
      pregnancies under controlled conditions. Twenty-nine healthy women had continuous
      fetal ECG recordings under standardized conditions in four randomly allocated
      positions, left lateral, right lateral, supine and semi-recumbent. Two blinded
      observers, assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate
      variability were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Compared to state 2F,
      state 4F was less likely to occur when women were semi-recumbent [odds ratio (OR)
      = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.55], and supine (OR = 0.27, 95% 
      CI 0.07, 1.10). State 1F was more likely on the right (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.11,
      5.04) or supine (OR = 4.99, 95% CI 2.41, 10.43) compared to the left. State
      change was more likely when the mother was semi-recumbent (OR = 2.17, 95% CI
      1.19, 3.95) or supine (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.46, 4.85). There was a significant
      association of maternal position to mean fetal heart rate. The measures of heart 
      rate variability (SDNN and RMSSD) were reduced in both semi-recumbent and supine 
      positions. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position affects FBS and
      heart rate variability. These effects are likely fetal adaptations to positions
      which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

AB  - Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm
      birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used
      high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess
      alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents 
      born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity
      (SWA; 1-4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and
      is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal
      networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at
      assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6-16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 
      (2.0), 10.0-16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite 
      score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 
      electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated.
      Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the
      term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p < .01). The score was
      positively correlated with sleep SWA in a cluster of 15 electrodes over frontal
      and negatively in a cluster of 14 electrodes over central brain regions after
      controlling for age at assessment and correcting for multiple comparisons. Within
      the frontal cluster, sleep SWA was higher in very preterm compared to term-born
      participants when controlling for executive function performance and age at
      assessment (p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born
      participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate
      a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive
      processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing
      term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for
      executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy.
      It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high
      prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is
      well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor
      new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying
      predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime
      sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal
      outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics
      associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant
      women. DESIGN: A longitudinal, prospective cohort design. SETTING: One medical
      center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women's homes. PARTICIPANTS: A total
      of 204 pregnant women. METHODS: First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an 
      outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and
      health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep,
      mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the
      women were in the second and third trimester. RESULTS: Thirty-one (15.2%) women
      experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three
      trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were
      2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime
      sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first
      trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime
      sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset 
      daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR=1.04, p<0.001), if
      they reported snoring (OR=6.75, p<0.001), and if they had elevated depressive
      symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy (OR=1.09, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset 
      of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset
      daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention
      strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on
      managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special
      attention to nulliparous and employed women.

TI  - Sleep quality during pregnancy: associations with depressive and anxiety
      symptoms.
PG  - 198-206
LID - 10.1111/aogs.13056 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet underdiagnosed 
      and under-investigated. We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed 
      associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: A total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort
      Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and
      late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep
      Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale,
      and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS: Poor general 
      sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per 
      night, and too-early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared with
      mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and
      sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep
      duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but 
      apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and
      daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow up. In
      late pregnancy, depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to
      sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not 
      associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found
      deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative
      daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity
      against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep
      disturbances were only cross-sectionally associated. Our study calls for further 
      research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed sleep and circadian rhythms across the perinatal
      period in new mothers with and without postpartum weight retention (PPWR).
      METHODS: Weight was measured at 2 and 16 weeks postpartum in 21 women with
      previous major depression or bipolar disorder (mean age 29.5+/-4.7 years) who
      self-reported pre-pregnancy weight during third trimester. Wrist actigraphy was
      acquired at 33 weeks gestation and postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 16. Circadian phase
      was measured at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum. The Horne-Ostberg
      Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory were
      completed during third trimester. Women were classified as PPWR+ if weight at 16 
      weeks postpartum exceeded pre-pregnancy weight by >/=5kg. RESULTS: Compared to
      pre-pregnancy, average weight gain (+/-SD) was 6.3+/-8.8 kg at 2 weeks postpartum
      and 5.2+/-8.5 kg at 16 weeks postpartum. ANOVA showed that PPWR+ women (n=8, 38%)
      had later sleep offset times and lower sleep efficiencies than PPWR- women at all
      time points and were more likely to report snoring during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Data from this small sample showed that women with PPWR had more disturbed sleep 
      and later wake times and were more likely to report symptoms of sleep-disordered 
      breathing. Future work in larger samples should examine whether interventions to 
      improve sleep during pregnancy decreases PPWR.

TI  - The role of the multidisciplinary health care team in the management of patients 
      with Marfan syndrome.
PG  - 587-614
AB  - Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare, severe, chronic, life-threatening disease with
      multiorgan involvement that requires optimal multidisciplinary care to normalize 
      both prognosis and quality of life. In this article, each key team member of all 
      the medical disciplines of a multidisciplinary health care team at the Hamburg
      Marfan center gives a personal account of his or her contribution in the
      management of patients with MFS. The authors show how, with the support of health
      care managers, key team members organize themselves in an organizational
      structure to create a common meaning, to maximize therapeutic success for
      patients with MFS. First, we show how the initiative and collaboration of patient
      representatives, scientists, and physicians resulted in the foundation of Marfan 
      centers, initially in the US and later in Germany, and how and why such centers
      evolved over time. Then, we elucidate the three main structural elements; a team 
      of coordinators, core disciplines, and auxiliary disciplines of health care.
      Moreover, we explain how a multidisciplinary health care team integrates into
      many other health care structures of a university medical center, including
      external quality assurance; quality management system; clinical risk management; 
      center for rare diseases; aorta center; health care teams for pregnancy, for
      neonates, and for rehabilitation; and in structures for patient centeredness. We 
      provide accounts of medical goals and standards for each core discipline,
      including pediatricians, pediatric cardiologists, cardiologists, human
      geneticists, heart surgeons, vascular surgeons, vascular interventionists,
      orthopedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, and nurses; and of auxiliary disciplines
      including forensic pathologists, radiologists, rhythmologists, pulmonologists,
      sleep specialists, orthodontists, dentists, neurologists, obstetric surgeons,
      psychiatrist/psychologist, and rehabilitation specialists. We conclude that a
      multidisciplinary health care team is a means to maximize therapeutic success.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome mimicking S1 radiculopathy.
PG  - 222-226
AB  - Alpha case of a chronic idiopathic form of a severe type of Restless Legs
      Syndrome (RLS), which developed during pregnancy and persisted after this,
      misdiagnosed for 34 years as radiculopathy S1, is reported. In spite of the
      thorough clinical and laboratory investigation, in addition to constant changes
      of the therapeutic approach, the diagnosis of S1 radiculopathy could not be
      confirmed, resulting in a chronic clinical course; the latter was characterized
      by relapses and remissions not attributed or linked in any way to the treatment
      (various types of). In fact, it was due to a routine workup in a sleep clinic,
      where the patient was referred because of a coincident chronic insomnia (Restless
      Legs Syndrome is a known and important cause of insomnia/chronic insomnia), which
      resulted in a proper diagnosis and treatment of this case. With the use of
      Restless Legs Syndrome appropriate treatment (Pramipexole 0.18 mg taken at
      bedtime, a dopaminergic agent and Level A recommended drug for Restless Legs
      Syndrome) an excellent response and immediate elimination of symptoms was
      achieved. Restless Legs Syndrome may present with a variety of symptoms (with the
      most prominent shortly being reported with the acronym URGE: Urge to move the
      legs usually associated with unpleasant leg sensations, Rest induces symptoms,
      Getting active brings relief, Evening and night deteriorate symptoms); given the 
      fact that Restless Legs Syndrome presents with a great variety and heterogeneity 
      of symptoms (mostly pain, dysesthesia and paresthesia), which may occur in
      several other diseases (the so called "RLS mimics"), proper diagnosis of Restless
      Legs Syndrome usually fails. Restless Legs Syndrome misinterpreted as S1
      radiculopathy, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported yet in the
      literature. Here, case history, clinical course and common RLS mimics are
      presented. Different forms of Restless Legs Syndrome manifestations, which are
      commonly -as in this case- misinterpreted due to their mimicking several
      pathological conditions, Restless Legs Syndrome prevalence on general population 
      according to various large epidemiological studies and pathogenic hypotheses on
      the issue of Restless Legs Syndrome are discussed. Finally, by presenting another
      possible "RLS-mimic" our aim is to highlight the common misdiagnosis of Restless 
      Legs Syndrome, which can mimic a variety of disorders, some of which are very
      common, such as an S1 radiculopathy, thus raising concern among doctors of
      various specialties addressed to by Restless Legs Syndrome sufferers, on the
      importance of proper diagnosis of the syndrome.

TI  - Sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy: Food for thought.
PG  - 153-155
AB  - The last few years have witnessed a number of publications linking sleep
      disordered breathing to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in various
      populations. Associations with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and growth
      restriction have been consistent across many studies. Though the manuscripts
      reviewed here consist mostly of preliminary data and need further confirmation,
      the studies have highlighted new directions in the assessment of the impact of
      sleep disordered breathing and pregnancy, and paved the way for new fields of
      research in this area.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between prenatal maternal stress,
      resilience, and sleep quality, and to determine whether resilience plays a
      mediating role in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep
      quality among pregnant women. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one pregnant women 
      in their second trimester participated in the study. They completed
      questionnaires, including: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the
      Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience 
      Scale (CD-RISC-10). A structural equation model was used to analyze the
      relationships among prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, with
      resilience as a mediator. RESULTS: Prenatal maternal stress was negatively
      associated with sleep quality in pregnant women (p < 0.01), whereas resilience
      was positively associated with sleep quality (p < 0.01). Furthermore, resilience 
      mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality, and
      the mediation effect ratio was 22.0% (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for
      disturbed sleep was pregnancy-specific stress; however, the protective factor for
      sleep quality was resilience. This finding could provide scientific evidence for 
      the development of intervention strategies with which to improve sleep quality in
      pregnant women.

TI  - 'I've Changed My Mind', Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) for
      pregnant women with a high level of fear of childbirth and their partners: study 
      protocol of the quasi-experimental controlled trial.
PG  - 377
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 25 % of pregnant women suffer from a high level of Fear
      of Childbirth (FoC), as assessed by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire
      (W-DEQ-A, score >/=66). FoC negatively affects pregnant women's mental health and
      adaptation to the perinatal period. Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting
      (MBCP) seems to be potentially effective in decreasing pregnancy-related anxiety 
      and stress. We propose a theoretical model of Avoidance and Participation in
      Pregnancy, Birth and the Postpartum Period in order to explore FoC and to
      evaluate the underlying mechanisms of change of MBCP. METHODS/DESIGN: The 'I've
      Changed My Mind' study is a quasi-experimental controlled trial among 128
      pregnant women (week 16-26) with a high level of FoC, and their partners. Women
      will be allocated to MBCP (intervention group) or to Fear of Childbirth
      Consultation (FoCC; comparison group). Primary outcomes are FoC, labour pain, and
      willingness to accept obstetrical interventions. Secondary outcomes are anxiety, 
      depression, general stress, parental stress, quality of life, sleep quality,
      fatigue, satisfaction with childbirth, birth outcome, breastfeeding self-efficacy
      and cost-effectiveness. The total study duration for women is six months with
      four assessment waves: pre- and post-intervention, following the birth and
      closing the maternity leave period. DISCUSSION: Given the high prevalence and
      severe negative impact of FoC this study can be of major importance if
      statistically and clinically meaningful benefits are found. Among the strengths
      of this study are the clinical-based experimental design, the extensive
      cognitive-emotional and behavioural measurements in pregnant women and their
      partners during the entire perinatal period, and the representativeness of study 
      sample as well as generalizability of the study's results. The complex and
      innovative measurements of FoC in this study are an important strength in
      clinical research on FoC not only in pregnant women but also in their partners.

TI  - Bright light therapy in pregnant women with major depressive disorder: study
      protocol for a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 381
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression during pregnancy is a common and high impact disease.
      Generally, 5-10 % of pregnant women suffer from depression. Children who have
      been exposed to maternal depression during pregnancy have a higher risk of
      adverse birth outcomes and more often show cognitive, emotional and behavioural
      problems. Therefore, early detection and treatment of antepartum depression is
      necessary. Both psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, first choice
      treatments in a non-pregnant population, have limitations in treating depression 
      during pregnancy. Therefore, it is urgent and relevant to investigate alternative
      treatments for antepartum depression. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a promising
      treatment for pregnant women with depressive disorder, for it combines direct
      availability, sufficient efficacy, low costs and high safety, taking the safety
      for the unborn child into account as well. METHODS: In this study, 150 pregnant
      women (12-18 weeks pregnant) with a DSM-V diagnosis of depressive disorder will
      be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms: treatment 
      with BLT (9.000 lux) or treatment with dim red light therapy (100 lux). Both
      groups will be treated for 6 weeks at home on a daily basis for 30 min, within 30
      min of habitual wake-up time. Follow-up will take place after 6 weeks of therapy,
      3 and 10 weeks after end of therapy, at birth and 2, 6 and 18 months postpartum. 
      Primary outcome will be the average change in depressive symptoms between the two
      groups, as measured by the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression
      Scale - Seasonal Affective Disorder version and the Edinburg Postnatal Depression
      Scale. Changes in rating scale scores of these questionnaires over time will be
      analysed using generalized linear mixed models. Secondary outcomes will be the
      changes in maternal cortisol and melatonin levels, in maternal sleep quality and 
      gestational age, birth weight, infant behaviour, infant cortisol exposure and
      infant cortisol stress response. DISCUSSION: If BLT reduces depressive symptoms
      in pregnant women, it will provide a safe, cheap, non-pharmacological and
      efficacious alternative treatment for psychotherapy and antidepressant medication
      in treating antepartum depression, without any expected adverse reactions for the
      unborn child. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NTR5476 . Registered

TI  - Chronobiology, sleep-related risk factors and light therapy in perinatal
      depression: the "Life-ON" project.
PG  - 374
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of
      roughly 12 %. Untreated PND has significant negative consequences not only on the
      health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive
      development of their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PND
      and no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and
      breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly related to each other because of
      a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a
      well-tested and safe treatment, effective in both depression and circadian/sleep 
      disorders. METHODS: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicentre study,
      about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10-15
      gestational week) until 12 months after delivery. The primary aim of the present 
      study is to systematically explore and characterize risk factors for PND by
      prospective sleep assessment (using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various
      sleep questionnaires) and bloodbased analysis of potential markers during the
      perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore the relationship 
      between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to
      investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to
      test whether a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy
      Life-ON3). DISCUSSION: The characterization of specific predictive and risk
      factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and
      social strategies for the affected women. The study results are expected to
      promote a better understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and
      the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and
      efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent associations between 
      nausea, vomiting, fatigue and health-related quality of life of women in early
      pregnancy in the Generation R study, which is a prospective mother and child
      cohort. Analyses were based on 5079 women in early pregnancy in the Rotterdam
      area, the Netherlands. The information on nausea, vomiting and fatigue in the
      previous three months was measured in the questionnaire at enrollment, as well as
      potential confounders (i.e., maternal/gestational age, ethnic background,
      educational level, parity, marital status, body mass index, tobacco and alcohol
      use, chronic/infectious conditions, uro-genital conditions/symptoms, sleep
      quality, headache, anxiety, and depression). Health-related quality of life was
      assessed by the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and physical and mental
      component summary scores were calculated. Multivariate regression models were
      performed to evaluate the independent associations of the presence of nausea,
      vomiting and fatigue with health-related quality of life, adjusting for potential
      confounders. 33.6% of women experienced daily presence of nausea, 9.6% for
      vomiting and 44.4% for fatigue. Comparing with women who never reported nausea,
      vomiting and fatigue, women with daily presence of at least one of these symptoms
      had significantly lower scores of physical component summary and mental component
      summary, after adjusting for potential confounders. Our study shows how common
      nausea, vomiting and fatigue are among women in early pregnancy and how much each
      of these symptoms negatively impact on health-related quality of life. We call
      for awareness of this issue from health care professionals, pregnant women and
      their families.

      in preeclampsia.
PG  - 2510-2515
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2016.1254185 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to investigate the psychopathological
      symptoms, psycho-emotional state, dream anxiety, and insomnia in healthy, mild
      and severe preeclamptic postpartum women and their relation to the severity of
      preeclampsia (PE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study included 45
      healthy, 41 mild preeclamptic and 44 severe preeclamptic postpartum women. The
      90-item Symptom Checklist Revised, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,
      Insomnia Severity Index, and Van Dream Anxiety Scale (VDAS) were used to evaluate
      the psychopathological symptoms, psycho-emotional state, insomnia, and dream
      anxiety of the participants after delivery. RESULTS: Severe preeclamptic women
      had higher VDAS scores than mild preeclamptic and healthy postpartum women (p:
      0.001). The psychopathological symptoms were more frequent in preeclamptic women 
      than in healthy controls (p: 0.001). Severe preeclamptic women had the highest
      scores in Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale and Insomnia Severity Index (p:
      0.001, p: 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Preeclampsia negatively affects the
      psycho-emotional state, psychopathological symptoms and sleep patterns. Further, 
      disturbed dreaming was more frequent in PE and also, all of these conditions
      became worse with the severity of PE. We speculated that the obstetricians should
      offer their preeclamptic patients an appropriate mental health care at bedside
      and postpartum period as needed.

TI  - Gestational Chronodisruption Impairs Circadian Physiology in Rat Male Offspring, 
      Increasing the Risk of Chronic Disease.
PG  - 4654-4668
AB  - Chronic exposure to light at night, as in shift work, alters biological clocks
      (chronodisruption), negatively impacting pregnancy outcome in humans. Actually
      the interaction of maternal and fetal circadian systems could be a key factor
      determining a fitting health in adults. We propose that chronic photoperiod shift
      (CPS) during pregnancy alter maternal circadian rhythms and impair circadian
      physiology in the adult offspring, increasing health risks. Pregnant rats were
      exposed to normal photoperiod (12 h light, 12 h dark) or to CPS until 85% of
      gestation. The effects of gestational CPS were evaluated on the mother and adult 
      offspring. In the mother we measured rhythms of heart rate, body temperature, and
      activity through gestation and daily rhythms of plasma variables (melatonin,
      corticosterone, aldosterone, and markers of renal function) at 18 days of
      gestation. In adult offspring, we measured rhythms of the clock gene expression
      in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), locomotor activity, body temperature, heart
      rate, blood pressure, plasma variables, glucose tolerance, and corticosterone
      response to ACTH. CPS altered all maternal circadian rhythms, lengthened
      gestation, and increased newborn weight. The adult CPS offspring presented normal
      rhythms of clock gene expression in the SCN, locomotor activity, and body
      temperature. However, the daily rhythm of plasma melatonin was absent, and
      corticosterone, aldosterone, renal markers, blood pressure, and heart rate
      rhythms were altered. Moreover, CPS offspring presented decreased glucose
      tolerance and an abnormal corticosterone response to ACTH. Altogether these data 
      show that gestational CPS induced long-term effects on the offspring circadian
      system, wherein a normal SCN coexists with altered endocrine, cardiovascular, and
      metabolic function.

TI  - Maternal Circadian Eating Time and Frequency Are Associated with Blood Glucose
      Concentrations during Pregnancy.
PG  - 70-77
LID - 10.3945/jn.116.239392 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synchronizing eating schedules to daily circadian rhythms may improve
      metabolic health, but its association with gestational glycemia is unknown.
      OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association of maternal night-fasting
      intervals and eating episodes with blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy.
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study within a prospective cohort in
      Singapore. Maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose
      concentrations were ascertained at 26-28 wk gestation for 1061 women (aged 30.7
      +/- 5.1 y). Night-fasting intervals were based on the longest fasting duration
      during the night (1900-0659). Eating episodes were defined as events that
      provided >50 kcal, with a time interval between eating episodes of >/=15 min.
      Multiple linear regressions with adjustment for confounders were conducted.
      RESULTS: Mean +/- SD night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day were 9.9
      +/- 1.6 h and 4.2 +/- 1.3 times/d, respectively; fasting and 2-h glucose
      concentrations were 4.4 +/- 0.5 and 6.6 +/- 1.5 mmol/L, respectively. In adjusted
      models, each hourly increase in night-fasting intervals was associated with a
      0.03 mmol/L decrease in fasting glucose (95% CI: -0.06, -0.01 mmol/L), whereas
      each additional daily eating episode was associated with a 0.15 mmol/L increase
      in 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.03, 0.28 mmol/L). Conversely, night-fasting intervals
      and daily eating episodes were not associated with 2-h and fasting glucose,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increased maternal night-fasting intervals and reduced
      eating episodes per day were associated with decreased fasting glucose and 2-h
      glucose, respectively, in the late-second trimester of pregnancy. This points to 
      potential alternative strategies to improve glycemic control in pregnant women.

TI  - Sleep restriction during pregnancy and its effects on blood pressure and renal
      function among female offspring.
LID - e12888 [pii]
AB  - The influence of sleep restriction (SR) during pregnancy on blood pressure and
      renal function among female adult offspring was investigated. Pregnant Wistar
      rats were distributed into control and SR groups. The SR was performed between
      the 14th and 20th days of pregnancy (multiple platforms method for 20 h/day). At 
      2 months of age, half of the offspring from both groups were subjected to an
      ovariectomy (ovx), and the other half underwent sham surgery. The groups were as 
      follows: control sham (Csham), control ovx (Covx), SR sham (SRsham), and SR ovx
      (SRovx). Renal function markers and systolic blood pressure (BPi, indirect
      method) were evaluated at 4, 6, and 8 months. Subsequently, the rats were
      euthanized, kidneys were removed, and processed for morphological analyses of
      glomerular area (GA), number of glomeruli per mm(3) (NG), and kidney mass (KM).
      Increased BPi was observed in the Covx, SRsham, and SRovx groups compared to
      Csham at all ages. Increased plasma creatinine concentration and decreased
      creatinine clearance were observed in the SRsham and SRovx groups compared to the
      Csham and Covx groups. The SRovx group showed higher BPi and reduced creatinine
      clearance compared to all other groups. The SRovx group showed reduced values of 
      GA and KM, as well as increased NG, macrophage infiltration, collagen deposit,
      and ACE1 expression at the renal cortex. Therefore, SR during pregnancy might be 
      an additional risk factor for developing renal dysfunction and increasing BP in
      female adult offspring. The absence of female hormones exacerbates the changes
      caused by SR.

TI  - MBD5 Haploinsufficiency
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MBD5 haploinsufficiency is a neurodevelopmental
      disorder characterized by global developmental delay/intellectual disability
      (ID), severe speech impairment, seizures, sleep disturbances, and abnormal
      behaviors. Most children lack speech entirely or have single words, short
      phrases, or short sentences. Seizures are present in about 80%; onset is usually 
      around age two years. Sleep disturbances, present in about 80% can result in
      excessive daytime drowsiness. Abnormal behaviors can include autistic-like
      behaviors (80%) and self-injury and aggression (60%). DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Most
      commonly the diagnosis of MBD5 haploinsufficiency is established in a proband by 
      detection of one of the following alterations on molecular genetic testing:
      Deletion of 2q23.1 that encompasses all or part of MBD5 (~90% of affected
      individuals). Intragenic deletion involving one or more exons of MBD5 (~5%). A
      heterozygous pathogenic sequence variant in MBD5 (~5%). Rarely, an apparently
      balanced complex chromosome rearrangement of the 2q23.1 region involving MBD5 is 
      causative. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: A multidisciplinary approach 
      that typically includes specialists in clinical genetics, neurology, child
      development, behavioral therapy, nutrition/feeding, speech and language therapy, 
      and occupational and physical therapy is recommended. Infants benefit from
      enrollment in an early-intervention program, and school-age children benefit from
      an individualized educational program. Speech therapy (including nonverbal
      methods of communication) should be introduced early. Seizures, behavior
      problems, and sleep disturbances are treated in a routine manner. Surveillance:
      Periodic neurodevelopmental and behavioral evaluations to assist in the
      management of cognitive and behavioral problems. GENETIC COUNSELING: MBD5
      haploinsufficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Typically,
      deletion of 2q23.1 is de novo; in some instances, an MBD5 pathogenic deletion or 
      MBD5 sequence variant is inherited from a parent who is mildly affected. Rarely, 
      parent-to-child transmission of an unbalanced derivative chromosome involving the
      2q23.1 region occurs. Once the genetic alteration resulting in MBD5
      haploinsufficiency has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal
      testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis
      are possible.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to very severe maternal obesity is associated with adverse
      neuropsychiatric outcomes in children.
PG  - 353-362
LID - 10.1017/S0033291716002452 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood
      neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems,
      affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied 
      neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or
      assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress.
      METHOD: We evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3-5 years
      whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy
      (50 very severe obesity, BMI 40 kg/m2, obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5-25
      kg/m2). The mothers completed the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic
      Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire
      (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess
      child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age,
      birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age,
      parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal
      concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of
      Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire
      (GHQ), respectively. RESULTS: Children exposed to prenatal maternal very severe
      obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale;
      ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and
      total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems,
      anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and
      higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal
      maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child
      neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic
      factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong
      predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood.

TI  - Sleep Enhancement Training for Pregnant Women.
PG  - 964-971
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based
      cognitive-behavioral training program for sleep during late pregnancy. METHODS: A
      nonrandomized quasiexperimental sample of nulliparous women who received the
      intervention during pregnancy (n=25) was compared with two control groups (n=76
      and n=48) from other intervention studies at similar postintervention time
      points: approximately 1 month before childbirth and 1-2 months after childbirth. 
      The home-based Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy consisted of 4
      weeks of sound-enhanced audio relaxation programs, readings, and daily sleep
      diaries. Both control groups received dietary recommendations for improving
      sleep. Sleep duration (total sleep time) and sleep disruption (wake after sleep
      onset) were measured using wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 48 hours on
      consecutive weekdays. RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly longer
      sleep duration and less sleep disruption than both control groups, particularly
      at the postpartum assessment. Intervention participants slept an average of 430
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 397-464) minutes during pregnancy compared with 420
      (95% CI 403-438) and 417 (95% CI 395-439) minutes for the two control groups. At 
      the postpartum assessment, the intervention group slept 446 (95% CI 415-478)
      minutes compared with 390 (95% CI 373-408) and 370 (95% CI 348-393) minutes for
      those in the control groups. In terms of sleep disruption, women in the
      intervention group had 16.1% (95% CI 11.9-20.2%) wake after sleep onset during
      pregnancy, whereas women in the control groups had 13.4% (95% CI 11.2-15.5%) and 
      20.4% (95% CI 17.7-23.0%). Postpartum, the intervention group had 20.3% (95% CI
      16.4-24.1%) wake after sleep onset compared with 26.6% (95% CI 24.5-28.8%) and
      28.7% (95% CI 26.0-31.5%) among women in the control groups. Participant feedback
      about the intervention was generally positive, although intervention adherence
      was variable. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the feasibility and
      efficacy of the Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy intervention for 
      enhancing sleep that typically worsens during late pregnancy and after
      childbirth.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality
      of life in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional design, 492 women (292 pregnant and
      200 nonpregnant healthy controls) were included in this study between November
      2014 and June 2015. Participants completed a survey on sociodemographic
      characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the European
      Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The PSQI total and EQ-5D scores of pregnant
      women were significantly worse than the controls (P = .017 and P < .001,
      respectively). Linear regression analysis showed that only pregnancy status was
      related to PSQI scores (beta = .117; P = .009). Compared with the first
      trimester, the risk of poor sleep quality increased 2.11-fold in the second
      trimester (P = .048) and 1.86-fold in the third trimester (P = .054). Compared
      with the first trimester, EQ-5D scores significantly decreased in the second (P =
      .038) and third (P < .001) trimesters. Sleep quality and health-related quality
      of life of pregnant women were worse than those of nonpregnant healthy controls. 
      Healthcare professionals need to be aware of deteriorations in sleep quality and 
      health-related quality of life of pregnant women.

TI  - Maternal abuse history and reduced fetal heart rate variability: Abuse-related
      sleep disturbance is a mediator.
PG  - 1023-1034

AB  - The consequences of childhood maltreatment are profound and long lasting. Not
      only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence
      that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for significant
      psychopathology. Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this
      intergenerational transmission of trauma. However, emerging evidence suggests
      that part of this risk may be transmitted before birth, passed on via
      abuse-related alterations in the in utero environment that are as yet largely
      unidentified. To date, no study has directly assessed the influence of pregnant
      women's abuse history on fetal neurobehavioral development, nor considered
      trauma-associated poor sleep quality as a mediator reflecting established
      physiological dysregulation. Using data from 262 pregnant adolescents (ages
      14-19), a population at elevated risk for childhood maltreatment, the current
      study examined maternal emotional abuse history and sleep quality in relation to 
      third-trimester fetal resting heart rate variability, an index of parasympathetic
      nervous system functioning. The results indicate that maternal emotional abuse
      history is indirectly associated with lower fetal heart rate variability via
      abuse-related sleep disturbances. These data demonstrate an association between
      maternal abuse histories and fetal development, showing that at least part of the
      intergenerational transmission of risk occurs during pregnancy.

TI  - The relationship between sleep problems and working memory in children born very 
      preterm.
PG  - 124-144
LID - 10.1080/09297049.2016.1235144 [doi]
AB  - In two studies, the relationship between sleep and working memory performance was
      investigated in children born very preterm (i.e., gestation less than 32 weeks)
      and the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. In Study 1,
      parent-reported measures of snoring, night-time sleep quality, and daytime
      sleepiness were collected on 89 children born very preterm aged 6 to 7 years. The
      children completed a verbal working memory task, as well as measures of
      processing speed and verbal storage capacity. Night-time sleep quality was found 
      to be associated with verbal working memory performance over and above the
      variance associated with individual differences in processing speed and storage
      capacity, suggesting that poor sleep may have an impact on the executive
      component of working memory. Snoring and daytime sleepiness were not found to be 
      associated with working memory performance. Study 2 introduced a direct measure
      of executive functioning and examined whether sleep problems would differentially
      impact the executive functioning of children born very preterm relative to
      children born to term. Parent-reported sleep problems were collected on 43
      children born very preterm and 48 children born to term (aged 6 to 9 years).
      Problematic sleep was found to adversely impact executive functioning in the very
      preterm group, while no effect of sleep was found in the control group. These
      findings implicate executive dysfunction as a possible mechanism by which
      problematic sleep adversely impacts upon cognition in children born very preterm,
      and suggest that sleep problems can increase the cognitive vulnerability already 
      experienced by many of these children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep beginning in early
      pregnancy. Among nonpregnant populations, exercise has been associated with
      improved sleep; however, research in pregnant samples has been equivocal. We
      examined whether varying degrees of exercise were associated with better
      nocturnal sleep among pregnant women during early gestation. PARTICIPANTS: 172
      pregnant women. METHODS: Self-reported sleep and exercise and objective sleep
      were collected during early gestation: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks), and T3
      (18-20 weeks) from 172 pregnant women. Exercise was categorized into three
      time-varying groups: 0 metabolic equivalent minutes per week (MET-min/week), 1 to
      < 500 MET-min/week, or >/= 500 MET-min/week. Linear mixed-effects models were
      employed to test hypotheses. RESULTS: A significant main effect for Time
      (F[2,254] = 9.77, p < 0.0001) and Time*Exercise group interaction were observed
      for actigraphic sleep efficiency (aSE) (F[4,569] = 2.73, p = 0.0285). At T2,
      women who reported >/= 500 MET-min/week had higher aSE than those who reported 0 
      MET-min/week. Significant main effects for Exercise Group and Time were observed 
      for actigraphic wake after sleep onset (aWASO; F[2,694] = 3.04, p = 0.0483 and
      F[2,260] = 3.21, p = 0.0419). aWASO was lowest for those reporting 1 to < 500
      MET-min/week (t[701] = 2.35, adjusted p = .0489) and aWASO decreased from T1 to
      T3 (t[258] = 2.53, adjusted p value = 0.036). Lastly, there was a main effect for
      Time for the PSQI (F[2,689] = 52.11, p < 0.0001), indicating that sleep quality
      improved over time. CONCLUSIONS: Some level of exercise among pregnant women
      appears to be more advantageous than no exercise at all. Moderate exercise, while
      still unclearly defined, may be a worthwhile adjunct treatment to combat sleep
      disturbances during pregnancy.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for psychological distress in pregnancy:
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 498
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically significant psychological distress in pregnancy is common,
      with epidemiological research suggesting that between 15 and 25 % of pregnant
      women experience elevated symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Untreated 
      psychological distress in pregnancy is associated with poor obstetrical outcomes,
      changes in maternal physiology, elevated incidence of child physical and
      psychological disorders, and is predictive of maternal postpartum mood disorders.
      Despite the wide-ranging impact of antenatal psychological distress on mothers
      and their children, there is a gap in our knowledge about the most effective
      treatments that are available for psychological distress experienced in
      pregnancy. Additionally, no trials have focused on potential physiological
      changes that may occur as a result of receiving mindfulness training in
      pregnancy. The proposed trial will determine the effectiveness of an 8-week
      modified Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention delivered during
      pregnancy. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated
      measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT to treat
      psychological distress in pregnancy. A sample of 60 consenting pregnant women
      aged 18 years and above will be enrolled and randomized to the experimental
      (MBCT) or control (treatment as usual) condition. Primary (e.g., symptoms of
      stress, depression, and anxiety), secondary (cortisol, blood pressure (BP), heart
      rate variability (HRV), and sleep) and other outcome data (e.g., psychological
      diagnoses) will be collected via a combination of laboratory visits and at-home
      assessments from both groups at baseline (T1), immediately following the
      intervention (T2), and at 3 months postpartum (T3). Descriptive statistics will
      be used to describe sample characteristics. Data will be analyzed using an
      intention-to-treat approach. Hierarchical linear models will be used to test
      intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: The trial is 
      expected to improve knowledge about evidence-based treatments for psychological
      distress experienced in pregnancy and to evaluate the potential impact of
      mindfulness-based interventions on maternal physiology. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02214732 , registered on 7 August 2014. Protocol Version

TI  - Maternal and obstetrical predictors of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
PG  - 2315-2323

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Public Health initiatives, such as the "Safe to Sleep" campaign, have 
      traditionally targeted infants' risk factors for the prevention of Sudden Infant 
      Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, controversy remains regarding maternal and
      obstetrical risk factors for SIDS. In our study, we sought out to determine both 
      modifiable and non-modifiable obstetrical and maternal risk factors associated
      with SIDS. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the CDC's 
      Linked Birth-Infant Death data from the United States for the year 2010. The
      impact of several obstetrical and maternal risk factors on the risk of overall
      infant mortality and SIDS was estimated using unconditional regression analysis, 
      adjusting for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 4,007,105
      deliveries and 24,174 infant deaths during the first year of life, of which 1991 
      (8.2%) were due to SIDS. Prominent risk factors for SIDS included (OR [95% CI]): 
      black race, 1.89 [1.68-2.13]; maternal smoking, 3.56 [3.18-3.99]; maternal
      chronic hypertension, 1.73 [1.21-2.48]; gestational hypertension, 1.51
      [1.23-1.87]; premature birth <37 weeks, 2.16 [1.82-2.55]; IUGR, 2.46 [2.14-2.82];
      and being a twin, 1.81 [1.43-2.29], p < 0.0001. Relative to a cohort of infants
      who died of other causes, risk factors with a predilection for SIDS were maternal
      smoking, 2.48 [2.16-2.83] and being a twin, 1.52 [1.21-1.91], p < 0.0001.
      Conclusions for practice: While certain socio-demographic and gestational
      characteristics are important risk factors, maternal smoking remains the
      strongest prenatal modifiable risk factor for SIDS. We recommend the continuation
      of Public Health initiatives that promote safe infant sleeping practices and
      smoking cessation during and after pregnancy.

AB  - Circadian clocks influence virtually all physiological processes, including
      lactation. Here, we investigate the role of the CLOCK gene in regulation of
      mammary epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Comparison of mammary
      morphology in late-pregnant wild-type and ClockDelta19 mice, showed that gland
      development was negatively impacted by genetic loss of a functional timing
      system. To understand whether these effects were due, in part, to loss of CLOCK
      function in the gland, the mouse mammary epithelial cell line, HC11, was
      transfected with short hairpin RNA that targeted Clock (shClock). Cells
      transfected with shClock expressed 70% less Clock mRNA than wild-type (WT) HC11
      cultures, which resulted in significantly depressed levels of CLOCK protein (P < 
      0.05). HC11 lines carrying shClock had four-fold higher growth rates (P < 0.05), 
      and the percentage of cells in G1 phase was significantly higher (90.1 +/- 1.1%
      of shClock vs. 71.3 +/- 3.6% of WT-HC11) following serum starvation.
      Quantitative-PCR (qPCR) analysis showed shClock had significant effects (P <
      0.0001) on relative expression levels of Ccnd1, Wee1, and Tp63 qPCR analysis of
      the effect of shClock on Fasn and Cdh1 expression in undifferentiated cultures
      and cultures treated 96 h with dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin
      (differentiated) found levels were reduced by twofold and threefold, respectively
      (P < 0.05), in shClock line relative to WT cultures. Abundance of CDH1 and TP63
      proteins were significantly reduced in cultures transfected with shClock These
      data support how CLOCK plays a role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and
      differentiation in the mammary gland.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the use of nursing diagnoses and interventions proposed
      for women in labour and high-risk pregnancies. Method: This is a descriptive,
      retrospective study with documentary analysis of 1000 medical records and a
      checklist conducted from July to September 2014, at a maternity hospital in
      Paraiba, Brazil. It consisted of analysing descriptive measures and comparing the
      relationship between nursing diagnoses and interventions using NANDA -
      International and the Nursing Interventions Classification. Results: The most
      common diagnoses in labour were acute pain (62%), fatigue (24.7%), and anxiety
      (22%). For high-risk pregnant women they were impaired sleep and rest (100%),
      risk of infection (81.8%), and anxiety (77.2%). The interventions were hand
      washing (80.8%) and identify and accommodate patient in the bed (78%).
      Conclusion: The diagnoses express needs during parturition and the
      psychobiological changes in high-risk pregnancy. The interventions are
      disconnected from the diagnoses and should therefore be reviewed and altered.

TI  - Diagnosis and Treatment of Childhood Migraine.
PG  - 48
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: While the diagnosis of migraine in children is generally
      straightforward, treatment can seem complex with a number of medication choices, 
      many of which are used "off label." Patients with intermittent migraines can
      often be managed with ibuprofen or naproxen taken as needed. Unfortunately, by
      the time that children present to our practice, they have often tried these
      medications without improvement. Triptans are frequently prescribed to these
      patients with good success. It is important to make the patient aware of the
      possible associated serotonergic reactions. If the patient is having more than
      one headache per week or the headaches are prolonged, prophylactic treatment is
      indicated. In our practice, the overwhelming majority of these patients will be
      treated with amitriptyline or topiramate. We generally allow side effect
      tolerability to guide our choice of medication. Cyproheptadine is often used in
      younger patients as it comes in a liquid form. There is evidence supporting the
      use of propranolol, though the potential worsening of underlying asthma symptoms 
      may limit its use, and sodium valproate, which must be used with caution in
      female patients of childbearing age due to significant teratogenicity risks.
      Other prophylactic treatments with less robust evidence include the antiepileptic
      drugs gabapentin, zonisamide, and levetiracetam; calcium channel blockers such as
      verapamil and amlodipine; and the angiotensin receptor blocking agent candasartin
      (not available in the USA). Almost all patients in our practice are advised to
      take magnesium supplementation. Magnesium is a supplement with relatively few
      adverse effects and good evidence for improvement of migraine symptoms. We
      evaluate lifestyle issues and comorbidities in all our patients. Ignoring these
      will make successful treatment near impossible. Good sleep, adequate hydration,
      appropriate diet, and exercise are vitally important. Finally, most of our
      patients benefit from a psychology evaluation with cognitive behavioral therapy. 
      Stress management and biofeedback are tremendously helpful in improving quality
      of life in migraineurs.

TI  - Women with bipolar disorder and pregnancy: factors influencing their
      decision-making.
PG  - 294-300
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of having a severe 
      episode of illness associated with childbirth. AIMS: To explore the factors that 
      influence the decision-making of women with bipolar disorder regarding pregnancy 
      and childbirth. METHOD: Qualitative study with a purposive sample of women with
      bipolar disorder considering pregnancy, or currently or previously pregnant,
      supplemented by data from an online forum. Data were analysed using thematic
      analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one women with bipolar disorder from an NHS
      organisation were interviewed, and data were used from 50 women's comments via
      the online forum of the UK's national bipolar charity. The centrality of
      motherhood, social and economic contextual factors, stigma and fear were major
      themes. Within these themes, new findings included women considering an elective 
      Caesarian section in an attempt to avoid the deleterious effects of a long labour
      and loss of sleep, or trying to avoid the risks of pregnancy altogether by means 
      of adoption or surrogacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the information
      needs of women with bipolar disorder, both pre-conception and when childbearing, 
      and the need for improved training for all health professionals working with
      women with bipolar disorder of childbearing age to reduce stigmatising attitudes 
      and increase knowledge of the evidence base on treatment in the perinatal period.

TI  - GRIN2A-Related Speech Disorders and Epilepsy
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy are
      characterized by speech disorders in all affected individuals and a range of
      epilepsy syndromes present in about 90%. Severe speech disorders observed can
      include dysarthria and speech dyspraxia, and both receptive and expressive
      language delay/regression; more mildly affected individuals may display subtly
      impaired intelligibility of conversational speech. Epilepsy features include
      seizure onset usually between ages three and six years, focal epilepsy with
      language and/or global developmental regression, and electroencephalogram (EEG)
      showing continuous spike-and-wave discharges in sleep or very active
      centrotemporal discharges. Seizure types include seizures associated with aura of
      perioral paresthesia, focal or focal motor seizures (often evolving to
      generalized tonic-clonic), and atypical absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can 
      include: Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous
      spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS), childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal
      spikes (CECTS), atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS), 
      autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD), and
      infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of a
      GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy is established in a proband by the
      identification of a GRIN2A heterozygous pathogenic variant on molecular genetic
      testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Significant speech/language
      deficits require therapy from a speech pathologist. Seizures should be treated
      with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Many different AEDs may be effective, and no one
      medication has been demonstrated to be effective specifically for these
      disorders. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitoring for possible adverse
      effects of AEDs. Surveillance: Developmental surveillance in all affected
      children; routine monitoring of speech and language by a speech pathologist
      should be considered for all children, particularly those diagnosed before
      reaching school age. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In individuals with ECSWS,
      phenytoin, barbiturates and carbamazepine should be avoided as they are rarely
      effective, may worsen the EEG, and have negative effects on neuropsychological
      outcomes. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the
      genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify 
      as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for speech
      disorders and/or seizures and institution of treatment. GENETIC COUNSELING:
      GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy are inherited in an autosomal
      dominant manner. The proportion of GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy
      caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual
      with a GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy has a 50% chance of inheriting
      the GRIN2A pathogenic variant. Once the GRIN2A pathogenic variant has been
      identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at
      increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible options.

TI  - Effects of supervised aerobic and strength training in overweight and grade I
      obese pregnant women on maternal and foetal health markers: the GESTAFIT
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 290
AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, a sedentary lifestyle may have negative
      consequences on maternal and foetal health status. The main objective of this
      project is to assess the effects of an exercise intervention in overweight and
      grade I obese pregnant on maternal and foetal health markers. METHODS/DESIGN: The
      present study aims to recruit 60 overweight and grade I obese women interested in
      participating in an exercise intervention program from the 17th gestational week 
      until delivery. Women will be randomized to either an exercise (three 60-min
      sessions/week of combined aerobic and strength training and pelvic floor
      exercises), or usual care (control) group (30 women per group). The primary
      outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic
      profile. Secondary outcome measures are: i) perinatal obstetric records; i) body 
      composition; iii) dietary patterns; iv) physical fitness; v) low-back pain; vi)
      objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; vii) haematology 
      and biochemical analyses; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory 
      markers; x) bone health biomarkers; xi) sleep quality; xii) mental health,
      quality of life and positive health. DISCUSSION: The findings of this project
      will help to identify strategies for primary prevention and health promotion
      based on this exercise-based intervention program among overweight and grade I
      obese pregnant women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02582567 ; Date of registration:

AB  - AIM: To transcultural adapt and analyze the reliability of Spanish version of
      Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI) and assess the prevalence of pregnancy
      symptoms in Spanish pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subsample of 120
      healthy pregnant women answered the PSI twice and a sample of 280 report the
      prevalence and limitation of pregnancy symptoms. The reliability was examined by 
      means of percent agreement and weighted Kappa coefficients. The prevalence of
      pregnancy symptoms was evaluated by the frequency of answers. RESULTS: Perfect
      and perfect-acceptable agreement was observed in 82% and 96% of the pregnant
      women, respectively. Weighted Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.589 to 0.889,
      indicating a good reliability. The most frequent symptoms perceived by Spanish
      pregnant women were urinary frequency, poor sleep, increased vaginal discharge
      and tiredness. CONCLUSION: Spanish Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory is a brief,
      conceptually equivalent and satisfactory reliable tool that allows an early
      assessment of the wide range of pregnancy symptoms in the health care practices.

TI  - Differences in brain functional connectivity at resting state in neonates born to
      healthy obese or normal-weight mothers.
PG  - 1931-1934
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2016.166 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown associations between maternal obesity at pre- or early 
      pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopment in children, suggesting in utero effects
      of maternal obesity on offspring brain development. In this study, we examined
      whether brain functional connectivity to the prefrontal lobe network is different
      in newborns from normal-weight or obese mothers. Thirty-four full-term healthy
      infants from uncomplicated pregnancies were included, with 18 born to
      normal-weight and 16 born to obese mothers. Two weeks after delivery, the infants
      underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during natural sleep,
      which included structural imaging and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans. 
      Independent component analysis was used to identify the prefrontal lobe network, 
      and dual regression was used to compare functional connectivity between groups.
      Infants born to normal-weight mothers had higher recruiting (P<0.05, corrected)
      of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex regions to the prefrontal network after
      adjusting for maternal intelligence quotient, gestational weight gain and infant 
      postmenstrual age, gender, birth weight/length, head circumference and neonatal
      diet. The functional connectivity strength in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
      negatively correlated (P<0.05) with maternal fat mass percentage measured at
      early pregnancy. This preliminary study indicates that exposure to maternal
      obesity in utero may be associated with changes in resting-state functional
      connectivity in the newborn offspring's brain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Considering that changes in the maternal environment may result in
      changes in progeny, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of
      sleep restriction during the last week of pregnancy on renal function and
      autonomic responses in male descendants at an adult age. METHODS: After
      confirmation of pregnancy, female Wistar rats were randomly assigned to either a 
      control or a sleep restriction group. The sleep-restricted rats were subjected to
      sleep restriction using the multiple platforms method for over 20 hours per day
      between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy. After delivery, the litters were
      limited to 6 offspring that were designated as offspring from control and
      offspring from sleep-restricted mothers. Indirect measurements of systolic blood 
      pressure (BPi), renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, glomerular area
      and number of glomeruli per field were evaluated at three months of age. Direct
      measurements of cardiovascular function (heart rate and mean arterial pressure), 
      cardiac sympathetic tone, cardiac parasympathetic tone, and baroreflex
      sensitivity were evaluated at four months of age. RESULTS: The sleep-restricted
      offspring presented increases in BPi, glomerular filtration rate and glomerular
      area compared with the control offspring. The sleep-restricted offspring also
      showed higher basal heart rate, increased mean arterial pressure, increased
      sympathetic cardiac tone, decreased parasympathetic cardiac tone and reduced
      baroreflex sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that reductions in sleep
      during the last week of pregnancy lead to alterations in cardiovascular autonomic
      regulation and renal morpho-functional changes in offspring, triggering increases
      in blood pressure.

TI  - Insomnia during pregnancy: Diagnosis and Rational Interventions.
PG  - 1030-7
LID - 10.12669/pjms.324.10421 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy. Insomnia is a frequent
      sleep disturbance experienced by pregnant women which can be primary or due to
      co-morbid conditions. The differential diagnosis of insomnia in pregnancy
      includes anxiety disorders, mood disorders, breathing related sleep disorders and
      restless legs syndrome. Early interventions to treat the sleep disturbance are
      recommended to avoid adverse pregnancy outcomes. Management strategies include
      improving sleep hygiene, behavioral therapies, and pharmacotherapy. The risks of 
      pharmacotherapy must be weighed against their benefits due to the possible risk
      of teratogenicity associated with some medications. METHODS: We searched PubMed
      and Google Scholar employing a combination of key words: pregnancy, sleep
      disturbances, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Sleep disorders and insomnia. We included 
      original studies, review articles, meta-analysis and systematic reviews in our
      search prioritizing articles from the last 10-15 years. Articles older than 15
      years were only included if their findings had not been superseded by more recent
      data. Further selection of articles was done from bibliographies and references
      of selected articles. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy are common and 
      cause considerable morbidity. Management includes a combination of
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments carefully weighing the risks
      and benefits of each for the expectant mother and fetus.

TI  - Self-reported short sleep duration and insomnia symptoms as predictors of
      post-pregnancy weight change: Results from a cohort study.
PG  - 465-474
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether change in sleep duration and insomnia
      symptoms in the postpartum period is related to change in body mass index from
      before to 2 years after pregnancy. This study is based on self-report data from a
      Norwegian cohort, the AHUS Birth Cohort Study. Data were collected at 8 weeks
      (T1) and 2 years (T2) postpartum. Data from 812 women were analyzed. The results 
      showed that only women with symptoms of insomnia at both T1 and T2 (persistent
      symptoms) had a greater increase in body mass index compared to women with no
      insomnia symptoms at T1 or T2.The results indicate that persistent insomnia
      symptoms are related to a greater increase in body mass index.

      population-based study.
PG  - e010925
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010925 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the circadian rhythm disruption following the
      transition into and out of daylight saving time (DST) is associated with an
      increased risk of spontaneous delivery. DESIGN: We compared the number of
      spontaneous deliveries in the Swedish Medical Birth Register during the week
      after the change to and the week after the change from DST (exposure periods)
      with the average number of spontaneous deliveries in the control period, defined 
      as the week before and the week after each exposure period. SETTING: Sweden,
      1993-2006. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the 
      weekly and the daily number of spontaneous deliveries in the exposure and the
      control periods. In secondary analyses we also compared the mean length of
      pregnancy of the women with spontaneous deliveries in the exposure and control
      periods. RESULTS: The number of deliveries during the week after the transition
      into or out of DST was similar to that in the comparison period (18 519 observed 
      vs 18 434 expected in case of the spring shift and 19 073 observed vs 19 122
      expected in case of the autumn shift); the corresponding incidence ratio and 95% 
      CIs were 1.005 (0.990 to 1.019) and 0.997 (0.983 to 1.012), respectively. There
      were no differences in the length of gestation of the deliveries in the exposure 
      and the control periods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis
      that a minor circadian rhythm disruption is associated with an increased
      short-term risk of spontaneous delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the level of serum cystatin C 
      (s-CC) and reverse-dipper blood pressure (BP) pattern. DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      study. SETTING: Single centre. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 718 hypertensive patients
      were eventually recruited from cardiac clinics between 2012 and 2014 in the
      Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. They were diagnosed as
      essential hypertension according to their casual office records of systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Patients were excluded if
      they were <18 or >90 years old, under antihypertensive treatment, night workers, 
      suffering from acute stroke or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,
      diagnosed as secondary hypertension, sleep apnoea or other sleep disorders, renal
      failure, cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, women during
      pregnancy or intolerant to the ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). MEASUREMENT: The 
      selected patients were evaluated with 24 hours ABPM. Peripheral venous blood
      samples were collected to evaluate the s-CC levels by ELISA. METHODS: The
      distribution of hypertensive patients with different levels of s-CC among each
      circadian BP pattern group was analysed using analysis of variance. Multinomial
      logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between the 
      relevant variables and ABPM results. RESULTS: S-CC level in reverse-dipper group 
      (1.19+/-0.53 mg/L) was increased significantly when compared with dipper group
      (1.06+/-0.36 mg/L) (p=0.021). In addition, after multinomial logistic regression 
      analysis, s-CC (OR 1.717; 95% CI 1.033 to 2.854; p=0.037) and diabetes (OR 2.313;
      95% CI 1.401 to 3.821; p=0.01) were significantly different between the
      reverse-dipper group and dipper group. On the other hand, the decline rate of
      nocturnal SBP (r=-0.117; p=0.002) and DBP (r=-0.089; p=0.018) was negatively
      correlated with the s-CC level. CONCLUSIONS: The s-CC level was significantly
      higher in the reverse-dipper group than the dipper group and that s-CC was
      associated with the reverse-dipper pattern of BP examined with 24 hour ABPM.

TI  - The Association between Hair Cortisol and Self-Reported Symptoms of Depression in
      Pregnant Women.
PG  - e0161804
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161804 [doi]
AB  - Depression has been linked to an imbalance in cortisol. Until recently, cortisol 
      has been studied by measuring concentrations at single time points in blood or
      saliva samples. Cortisol concentrations vary with circadian rhythm and
      experiences, from time point to time point. The measurement of hair cortisol
      concentration (HCC) is a new method of accessing mean, long-term cortisol
      concentrations. Recent studies show positive associations between depression and 
      HCC, and prenatal maternal cortisol is thought to influence the developing fetus.
      We therefore examined the association between HCC and self-reported symptoms of
      depression in second trimester pregnant women. Participants were 181 women,
      recruited between September 2011 and October 2013 to the Little-in-Norway
      (LiN)-study. These women answered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Rating Scale
      (EPDS) on self-reported symptoms of depression, and one cm maternal scalp hair
      was collected and analyzed for cortisol concentrations. Multiple regression
      analyses did not show depressive symptoms as a predictor for HCC in our selection
      of pregnant women, while gestational age was significantly related. In
      conclusion, our study indicated that symptoms of depression during pregnancy did 
      not predict HCC, but further studies of clinically depressed, pregnant women
      using gestational age as an adjustment variable are warranted.

TI  - Sleep disorders in Pregnancy: Glycaemic implications.
PG  - S60-4
AB  - Sleep is one of the essential biorhythms of the body that helps in optimum
      restoration of many body functions. The sleep-wake cycle is determined by the
      circadian centre and is responsible for the anabolic functions in the body.
      Infants require about 14 to 18 hours of sleep per day, which reduces gradually to
      about 8 hours in adults. Urbanization and evolutionary changes have altered the
      sleep hygiene and shortened the sleep duration. This lead to various sleep
      disorders like sleep disordered breathing, insomnia and narcolepsy. Sleep
      disorders lead to adverse cardio-metabolic consequences, including insulin
      resistance and hyperglycaemia. Pregnancy poses an enormous burden on the
      homeostasis of the women with alteration in many physiological functions. The
      sleep disorders during pregnancy lead to adverse foeto-maternal outcomes with
      long term cardiovascular implications. In this article, I review the
      pathophysiology of sleep disorders during pregnancy and their glycaemic
      implications.

TI  - Epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram of 6-year-old children of women
      with epilepsy.
PG  - 318-22

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the epileptiform discharges (EDs) in the electroencephalogram
      (EEG) of 6-8-year-old children of women with epilepsy (WWE). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: All children born to women with epilepsy and prospectively followed up
      through the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP), aged 6-8 years,
      were invited (n = 532). Out of the 254 children who responded, clinical
      evaluations and a 30-min digital 18 channel EEG were completed in 185 children.
      RESULTS: Of the 185 children examined, 37 (20%) children (19 males, 18 females)
      had ED in their EEG. The EDs were generalized in 7 children, and focal in 30
      children. The EDs were present in the sleep record only of 16 (43%) children and 
      in the awake record only of 6 (16%) children. Out of the 94 children for whom
      seizure history was available, 7 children (7.4%) had seizures (neonatal seizures:
      4, febrile seizure: 1, and single nonfebrile seizure: 2) and none had history of 
      epilepsy or recurrent nonfebrile seizures. The odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of 
      ED in the EEG was significantly higher for children of WWE [OR = 3.5, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 2.3-6.0] when compared to the published data for
      age-matched children of mothers without epilepsy. There was no association
      between the occurrence of ED and the children's maternal characteristics
      [epilepsy syndrome, seizures during pregnancy, maternal intelligence quotient
      (IQ)] or the children's characteristics [antenatal exposure to specific
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), birth weight, malformations, IQ]. CONCLUSION:
      Children of WWE have a higher risk of epileptiform activity in their EEG when
      compared to healthy children in the community though none had recurrent seizures.

AB  - Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy leads to behavioral
      changes and diseases in the adult offspring. To explore the influence of prenatal
      continuous light exposure (PCLE) on the adult offspring, we exposed pregnant
      Wistar rats to constant light during late gestation. Adult PCLE offspring showed 
      an anxiety-like behavior and impairment of short-term memory in different tests. 
      Measurements in the whole brain homogenates from newborn and adult offspring
      indicated decreased melatonin and serotonin levels and increased reactive oxygen 
      species level in PCLE offspring. Further, we determined melatonin-, serotonin-,
      oxidative stress-, apoptosis-, and circadian system-related genes expression in
      different brain areas of adult offspring. The serotonin reuptaker Slc6a4
      displayed a decreased expression in the prefrontal cortex of PCLE group. The
      circadian rhythm-related gene Rora was upregulated in the amygdala of PCLE
      offspring. Our results point to adverse behavioral effects of PCLE on adult
      offspring, involving serotonin and melatonin signaling dysregulation, increased
      chronic oxidative stress, and altered gene expression.

TI  - Relationship between fatigue and sleepiness with general health of mothers in the
      postpartum period.
PG  - 385-90
LID - 10.4103/1735-9066.185580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue and changes in sleep patterns are one of the impressive
      features in the first year after birth, which have negative effects on work,
      family life, and social relationships. Therefore, the objective of this research 
      was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and Stanford sleepiness with 
      the general health of mothers in the postpartum period. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      The current research is a descriptive correlational study which was performed on 
      190 mothers between 2 and 24 postpartum weeks, referring to the health centers of
      Isfahan in 2014. All mothers meeting the inclusion criteria were selected through
      cluster purposive sampling. Data were collected by use of four questionnaires
      including profile and fertility, fatigue, Stanford sleepiness, and general
      health. Data were analyzed by statistical tests at a significance level of
      </=0.05. RESULTS: The results showed that 5.3%, 59.5%, and 35.3% of subjects had 
      mild, moderate, and severe fatigue, respectively. In addition, 26.3% of women
      showed a public health disorder, and according to Stanford sleepiness, 20.5% of
      subjects had sleepiness. The statistical results indicated that there were
      significant relationships between fatigue (P </= 0.001, r = 0.52) and Stanford
      sleepiness (P = 0.04, r = 0.14), and mothers' general health. CONCLUSIONS:
      According to prevalence of fatigue and sleepiness in the postpartum period and
      its relationship with maternal health, application of sleep health education and 
      appropriate counseling during pregnancy and after delivery is recommended to
      prevent mothers' mental complications in order to achieve a safe pregnancy.

TI  - SCN8A-Related Epilepsy with Encephalopathy
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy is
      characterized by developmental delay, seizure onset in the first 18 months of
      life (mean 4 months), and intractable epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure 
      types (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, infantile spasms, and absence and focal
      seizures). Epilepsy syndromes can include Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, West syndrome,
      and epileptic encephalopathies (e.g., Dravet syndrome). Hypotonia and movement
      disorders including dystonia, ataxia, and choreoathetosis are common. Psychomotor
      development varies from normal prior to seizure onset (with subsequent slowing or
      regression after seizure onset) to abnormal from birth. Intellectual disability, 
      present in all, ranges from mild to severe (in ~50% of affected individuals).
      Autistic features are noted in some. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) 
      of unknown cause has been reported in approximately 10% of published cases. To
      date SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy has been reported in the
      literature in about 50 individuals. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is
      established in a proband with encephalopathy and epilepsy and identification of a
      de novo pathogenic variant in SCN8A on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT:
      Treatment of manifestations: Seizure control should be managed by a pediatric
      neurologist with expertise in epilepsy management who is familiar with the
      pharmacotherapy for SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy and aware of how
      it differs from treatment of similar disorders. Vigorous attempts to control
      seizures are warranted. Several studies suggest a favorable response to sodium
      channel blockers. Surveillance: Periodic evaluation for neurologic, cognitive,
      and/or behavioral deterioration; monitoring with EEG and other modalities such as
      video EEG telemetry or ambulatory EEG when new or different seizure types are
      suspected. Because of the increased risk of SUDEP, some families use oxygen
      monitoring during sleep. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Several families of
      affected individuals report worsening of seizures with levetiracetam. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy is expressed in an
      autosomal dominant manner. Most affected individuals have a de novo pathogenic
      variant and typically do not reproduce. While the risk to future pregnancies is
      presumed to be low, some parents of an affected child may wish to consider
      prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in future pregnancies as
      the risk may be slightly greater than in the general population because of the
      possibility of parental germline mosaicism.

TI  - Medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder.
PG  - 13-26
LID - 10.1007/s40519-016-0313-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of
      binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity. METHOD: We
      reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically 
      significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED
      in specific medical conditions. RESULTS: Three broad study categories of medical 
      comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in
      BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in
      specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED 
      is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes,
      hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and
      that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and
      co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be
      associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating
      behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and
      disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications,
      intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: BED is
      associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of 
      the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and
      co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

AB  - We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the
      Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 (FOSQ-10) in pregnant women. A
      total of 228 first-trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was 
      conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei,
      Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 demonstrated satisfactory internal
      consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item-total correlations
      (from .40 to .67), and acceptable test-retest reliability over 7 days (ICC =
      .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a
      one-factor structure with item loadings between .49 and .77. Significant
      associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey 12 version 
      2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion-related and convergent
      validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 total
      scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness
      and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects
      were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total
      scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 is a valid and
      reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep-related impairment in 
      Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse
      pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep
      disorders. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Stressful Events in the Onset of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
PG  - e1-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex and multifactorial
      disease. Stressful situations experienced could be related to the presentation of
      the disease. Few studies have determined which factors could trigger CFS. The
      main objective of this study was to explore the stressful situations which can be
      associated with CFS presentation. METHODS: Retrospective observational
      case-control study with CFS diagnosed patients according to the Fukuda's
      criteria. Controls were matched to cases by sex, age and educational level with a
      1:1 ratio. Participants aged between 18 and 75 years from the province of Lleida.
      Information was obtained through personal questionnaires. The measure of
      association was the odds ratio. RESULTS: In total, 77 cases and 77 controls were 
      included. Association found between stressful life events and presentation of
      disease were pregnancy ORa=31.7 (CI95%:2.2-456.7), spousal abuse ORa= 10.2
      (CI95%:1.2-88.4) and mobbing ORa=6.9 (CI95%:1.3-36.9), eating disorders=7.5
      (CI95%:1.3-42.1), car accident ORa=5.5 (CI95%:1.7-17 9), economic problems
      ORa=5.1 (CI95%:2.1-12.6) and changes in sleep habits ORa=2.8 (CI95%:1.1-7.5).
      CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life events as pregnancy, spousal abuse, mobbing, eating
      disorders, car accident, economic problems and changes in sleep habits felt by
      those affected must be taken into consideration when compiling background
      information related to the onset of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Adequate
      identification of these stressful life events in risk people could contribute to 
      early diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

TI  - [Peripartum management plan for patients with mental illnesses : Strategies to
      reduce the risk of postpartum relapse].
PG  - 980-8
LID - 10.1007/s00115-016-0182-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transition to parenthood is challenging but for women with a history 
      of recurrent psychiatric disorders becoming a mother has a number of additional
      issues. Women with a history of mood disorders or psychoses are at increased risk
      for exacerbation in the vulnerable postpartum period and fear the potential risk 
      of medication during pregnancy for the unborn child as much as they fear a
      relapse. In these difficult situations women and their families seek advice and
      support from mental health providers and obstetricians. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Based on the treatment of 420 mentally ill women with a desire to have children
      and pregnancy and prospective documentation of 196 pregnancies over the last 10
      years (2006-2016) the authors developed the Bonn concept of peripartum management
      (BKPM). The plan was designed to reduce the incidence and severity of postpartum 
      relapses in women suffering from psychiatric disorders. Factors to be considered 
      include antenatal and postpartum medication as well as reduction of stress and
      stimuli, sleep preservation, social support and help from the partner in caring
      for the baby. Of the 196 women in the BKPM only 4.6 % (n = 9) experienced a
      severe postpartum relapse with hospitalization. Additionally, the informed
      consent discussion with patient and partner as part of the peripartum management 
      plan showed positive effects on how women and their families experienced autonomy
      and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. DISCUSSION: Careful planning and
      monitoring with a structured perinatal management plan can reduce the risk of
      relapse in the perinatal period and thus support women with a history of mental
      disorder in the transition to motherhood. Therefore, the management concept
      employed in Bonn contributes to the major goal of current peripartum psychiatric 
      care in developing effective prevention strategies for women at high risk.

TI  - Prevalence and incidence of domestic violence during pregnancy and associated
      risk factors: a longitudinal cohort study in the south of Sweden.
PG  - 228
LID - 10.1186/s12884-016-1017-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Domestic violence during pregnancy is not only a severe public health
      issue that jeopardizes maternal and foetal health but also violates human rights.
      The aim was to explore the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence among
      pregnant women, in the southwestern region of Scania in Sweden, and their
      experience of a history of violence. In addition, to explore the association
      between domestic violence during pregnancy and possible risk factors. METHODS:
      This is a longitudinal cohort-study including pregnant women >/=18 years of age, 
      registered at antenatal care when pregnant. A cohort of 1939 pregnant women
      answered Questionnaire I (QI) in gestational week 13 (mean 12.8 week, SD 5.11).
      Response rate of Questionnaire II (QII) in gestation week 34 (mean 33.9 week, SD 
      2.2) was 78.8 % (n = 1527). Statistical analysis was descriptive statistics,
      logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95 %
      confidence intervals (95 % CI). RESULTS: Both QI and QII were completed by 77.8 %
      (n = 1509) of the women and 44.3 % (n = 668) reported a lifetime experience of
      abuse irrespective of type, severity or perpetrator. Also, 5.1 % (n = 77)
      reported some experience of abuse past year. Prevalence of domestic violence
      during pregnancy was 2.0 % (n = 29) and the incidence was 7.3 new cases per 1000 
      women. The strongest risk factor for domestic violence, during early and late
      pregnancy, was history of violence whereby all women who disclosed exposure had
      also reported history of violence (p < 0.001). To be single/living apart gave 8.4
      times more risk associated with domestic violence during pregnancy (AOR 8.4; 95 %
      CI: 2.2-32.6). Having several symptoms of depression and lack of sleep gave 3.8
      times more risk respectively (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI: 1.1-13.6) and (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI
      1.1-12.9). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with a history of violence as well as
      being single/living apart and/or having several symptoms of depression during
      pregnancy should be alerts for clinical working midwives and obstetricians.
      Further, this is important knowledge for health care providers to develop or
      upgrade guidelines and plans of action for pregnant women exposed to violence.

AB  - The maternal mortality rate for parturients with severe pulmonary hypertension is
      30% to 50%. General, epidural, and combined low-dose spinal-epidural anesthesia
      have been used successfully for cesarean deliveries in patients with pulmonary
      hypertension. We describe a cesarean delivery performed using an intrathecal
      catheter in a 25-year-old morbidly obese (body mass index, 82 kg/m) woman
      (gravida 3, para 2 at 32 weeks of gestation) who had severe pulmonary
      hypertension, right ventricular failure, pulmonary emboli, and obstructive sleep 
      apnea. We discuss the anesthetic considerations for parturients with severe
      pulmonary hypertension undergoing cesarean delivery including the selection of
      anesthetic technique, vasopressors, and uterotonic agents.

TI  - Insomnia and sleep deficiency in pregnancy.
PG  - 168-71
LID - 10.1177/1753495X15600572 [doi]
AB  - Insomnia and sleep deficiency in pregnancy are very common with most women
      reporting sleep disturbances during pregnancy. Insomnia and sleep deficiency are 
      also more prevalent as pregnancy progresses, possibly related to
      pregnancy-related physical symptoms or discomfort. There is increasing evidence
      indicating that these sleep problems may be associated with adverse maternal and 
      fetal outcomes such as depressive symptoms, increased pain during labor, more
      Caesarean sections, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Treatment of insomnia
      remains challenging as some of the more commonly used sleep inducing medications 
      such as benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be
      associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Nonpharmacological treatments such as 
      cognitive behavioral therapy are available but the data in pregnancy is often
      lacking.

AB  - Restless leg syndrome, more recently renamed Willis-Ekbom disease, is a condition
      that disrupts sleep and occurs more frequently in the pregnant population. We
      present a 39-year-old woman with restless legs syndrome in the third trimester
      and discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic options in the
      pregnant population while highlighting the challenges posed by the lack of safety
      data of approved drugs.

TI  - The Safety, Tolerability and Risks Associated with the Use of Newer Generation
      Antidepressant Drugs: A Critical Review of the Literature.
PG  - 270-88
LID - 10.1159/000447034 [doi]
AB  - Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of 
      treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than
      tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse
      events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
      serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone,
      agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects
      are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation,
      but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass
      gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia),
      hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular
      disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic
      hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual
      dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central 
      nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side
      effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective
      disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations
      (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may
      persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas 
      of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes,
      risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus,
      the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks,
      likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse
      events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully
      review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to
      consider alternative treatments if available.

TI  - Fetal programming of blood pressure in a transgenic mouse model of altered
      intrauterine environment.
PG  - 7015-7025
LID - 10.1113/JP272602 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Nitric oxide is essential in the vascular adaptation to pregnancy, as
      knockout mice lacking nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) have abnormal utero-placental 
      perfusion, hypertension and growth restriction. We previously showed with ex vivo
      studies on transgenic animals lacking NOS3 that adverse intrauterine environment 
      alters fetal programming of vascular reactivity in adult offspring. The current
      research shows that altered vascular reactivity correlates with higher blood
      pressure in vivo. Our data suggest that higher blood pressure depends on both
      genetic background (NOS3 deficiency) and uterine environment, becomes more
      evident with age (> 7 postnatal weeks), activity and stress, is gender specific
      (preponderant among males), and can be affected by the sleep-awake cycle. In
      utero or early postnatal life (< 7 weeks), before onset of hypertension, may
      represent a potential window for intervention to prevent future cardiovascular
      disorders. ABSTRACT: Nitric oxide is involved in the vascular adaptation to
      pregnancy. Using transgenic animals, we previously showed that adverse
      intrauterine environment alters vascular reactivity in adult offspring. The aim
      of our study was to determine if altered vascular programming is associated with 
      abnormal blood pressure (BP) profiles in vivo. Mice lacking a functional
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (KO, NOS3(-/-) ) and wild-type mice (WT,
      NOS3(+/+) ) were crossbred to generate homozygous NOS3(-/-) (KO), maternally
      derived heterozygous NOS3(+/-) (KOM: mother with adverse intrauterine environment
      from NOS3 deficiency), paternally derived heterozygous NOS3(+/-) (KOP: mother
      with normal in utero milieu) and NOS3(+/+) (WT) litters. BP was measured in vivo 
      at 7, 14 and 21 weeks of age. After univariate analysis, multivariate
      population-averaged linear regression models were used to identify factors
      affecting BP. When compared to WT offspring, systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and 
      mean (MAP) BP progressively increased from KOP, to KOM, and peaked among KO (P < 
      0.001), although significance was not reached for KOP. Higher BP was also
      associated with male gender, older age (> 7 postnatal weeks), higher locomotor
      activity, daytime recordings, and recent blood pressure transducer insertion (P <
      0.001). Post hoc analysis showed that KOM had higher SBP than KOP (P < 0.05). Our
      study indicates that adverse intrauterine environment contributes, along with
      multiple other factors, to account for hypertension; moreover, in utero or early 
      postnatal life may represent a possible therapeutic window for prevention of
      cardiovascular disease later in life.

TI  - Circadian Rhythm Regulates Development of Enamel in Mouse Mandibular First Molar.
PG  - e0159946
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159946 [doi]
AB  - Rhythmic incremental growth lines and the presence of melatonin receptors were
      discovered in tooth enamel, suggesting possible role of circadian rhythm. We
      therefore hypothesized that circadian rhythm may regulate enamel formation
      through melatonin receptors. To test this hypothesis, we examined expression of
      melatonin receptors (MTs) and amelogenin (AMELX), a maker of enamel formation,
      during tooth germ development in mouse. Using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, we
      found that mRNA and protein levels of both MTs and AMELX in normal mandibular
      first molar tooth germs increased gradually after birth, peaked at 3 or 4 day
      postnatal, and then decreased. Expression of MTs and AMELX by immunocytochemistry
      was significantly delayed in neonatal mice raised in all-dark or all-light
      environment as well as the enamel development. Furthermore, development of tooth 
      enamel was also delayed showing significant immature histology in those animals, 
      especially for newborn mice raised in all daylight condition. Interestingly,
      disruption in circadian rhythm in pregnant mice also resulted in delayed enamel
      development in their babies. Treatment with melatonin receptor antagonist 4P-PDOT
      in pregnant mice caused underexpression of MTs and AMELX associated with
      long-lasting deficiency in baby enamel tissue. Electromicroscopic evidence
      demonstrated increased necrosis and poor enamel mineralization in ameloblasts.
      The above results suggest that circadian rhythm is important for normal enamel
      development at both pre- and postnatal stages. Melatonin receptors were partly
      responsible for the regulation.

AB  - Poor sleep in pregnancy is related to adverse neonatal health. Elevated maternal 
      cortisol has been proposed as a pathway, yet the association in pregnancy is not 
      well understood. The goals of the current study were to examine associations
      between (a) sleep and cortisol, (b) sleep, cortisol, and neonatal outcomes, and
      (c) variables that could explain these associations. Two hundred pregnant women
      completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse, Reynolds, Monk,
      Berman, & Kupfer, 1989) and provided diurnal salivary cortisol samples at two
      times over pregnancy. Poor sleep quality was associated with greater evening
      cortisol concentrations at 36 weeks' gestation. This association was mediated by 
      anxiety symptoms. Higher evening cortisol at 36 weeks' gestation was associated
      with shorter gestation.

TI  - A Pharmacist-Physician Collaboration to Optimize Benzodiazepine Use for Anxiety
      and Sleep Symptom Control in Primary Care.
PG  - 425-433
LID - 10.1177/0897190016660435 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Benzodiazepines are prescribed inappropriately in up to 40% of
      outpatients. The purpose of this study is to describe a collaborative team-based 
      care model in which clinical pharmacists work with primary care providers (PCPs) 
      to improve the safe use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleep disorders and to
      assess the preliminary results of the impact of the clinical service on patient
      outcomes. METHODS: Adult patients were eligible if they received care from the
      academic primary care clinic, were prescribed a benzodiazepine chronically, and
      were not pregnant or managed by psychiatry. Outcomes included baseline PCP
      confidence and knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine use, patient symptom
      severity, and medication changes. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 57 PCPs responded to
      the survey. PCPs reported greater confidence in diagnosing and treating
      generalized anxiety and panic disorders than sleep disorder and had variable
      knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Twenty-nine patients had at 
      least 1 visit. Over 44 total patient visits, 59% resulted in the addition or
      optimization of a nonbenzodiazepine medication and 46% resulted in the
      discontinuation or optimization of a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety symptom 
      severity scores significantly improved (-2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): -3.57
      to -0.43). CONCLUSION: Collaborative team-based models that include clinical
      pharmacists in primary care can assist in optimizing high-risk benzodiazepine
      use. Although these findings suggest improvements in safe medication use and
      symptoms, additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

TI  - The impact of prenatal circadian rhythm disruption on pregnancy outcomes and
      long-term metabolic health of mice progeny.
PG  - 1171-1181
AB  - Animal studies demonstrate that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy can 
      be deleterious to reproductive capacity and the long-term health of the progeny. 
      Our previous studies in rats have shown that exposure of pregnant dams to an
      environment that significantly disrupts maternal circadian rhythms programs
      increased adiposity and poor glucose metabolism in offspring. In this study, we
      used mice with a ClockDelta19 mutation to determine whether foetal development
      within a genetically disrupted circadian environment affects pregnancy outcomes
      and alters the metabolic health of offspring. Ten female ClockDelta19+MEL mutant 
      mice were mated with 10 wildtype males, and 10 wildtype females were mated with
      10 ClockDelta19+MEL mutant males. While genetically identical, the heterozygote
      foetuses were exposed to either a normal (wildtype dams) or disrupted
      (ClockDelta19+MEL mutant dams) circadian environment during gestation. Pregnancy 
      outcomes including time to mate, gestation length, litter size and birth weight
      were assessed. One male and one female offspring from each litter were assessed
      for postnatal growth, body composition, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test
      and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test at 3 and 12 months of age. There was
      no effect of maternal genotype on pregnancy outcomes, with days to plug,
      gestation length, litter size and perinatal mortality not significantly different
      between wildtype and ClockDelta19+MEL mutant dams. Similarly, there was no effect
      of maternal genotype on weight of the offspring at birth or at any stage of
      postnatal growth. While there was an effect of sex on various tissue weights at 3
      and 12 months of age, there were minimal effects of maternal genotype. Relative
      adrenal weight was significantly reduced (-32%) in offspring from
      ClockDelta19+MEL mutant dams, whereas gastrocnemius muscle was significantly
      increased (+16%) at 3 months of age only. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests
      at 3 months of age revealed female offspring from ClockDelta19+MEL mutant dams
      had significantly reduced area under the curve following glucose administration
      (-25%), although no differences were found at 12 months of age. There was no
      effect of maternal genotype on intraperitoneal insulin tolerance at 3 or 12
      months of age for either sex. These results demonstrate that foetal growth within
      a genetically disrupted circadian environment during gestation has no effect on
      pregnancy success, and only marginal impacts upon the long-term metabolic health 
      of offspring. These results do not support the hypothesis that circadian rhythm
      disruption during pregnancy programs poor metabolic homeostasis in offspring.
      However, when maintained on a 12L:12D photoperiod, the ClockDelta19+MEL mutant
      dams display relatively normal patterns of activity and melatonin secretion,
      which may have reduced the impact of the mutation upon foetal metabolic
      programming.

TI  - Effects of Gestational and Postnatal Exposure to Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia on 
      Diaphragm Muscle Contractile Function in the Rat.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2016.00276 [doi]
AB  - Alterations to the supply of oxygen during early life presents a profound
      stressor to physiological systems with aberrant remodeling that is often
      long-lasting. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a feature of apnea of
      prematurity, chronic lung disease, and sleep apnea. CIH affects respiratory
      control but there is a dearth of information concerning the effects of CIH on
      respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm-the major pump muscle of breathing. 
      We investigated the effects of exposure to gestational CIH (gCIH) and postnatal
      CIH (pCIH) on diaphragm muscle function in male and female rats. CIH consisted of
      exposure in environmental chambers to 90 s of hypoxia reaching 5% O2 at nadir,
      once every 5 min, 8 h a day. Exposure to gCIH started within 24 h of
      identification of a copulation plug and continued until day 20 of gestation;
      animals were studied on postnatal day 22 or 42. For pCIH, pups were born in
      normoxia and within 24 h of delivery were exposed with dams to CIH for 3 weeks;
      animals were studied on postnatal day 22 or 42. Sham groups were exposed to
      normoxia in parallel. Following gas exposures, diaphragm muscle contractile, and 
      endurance properties were examined ex vivo. Neither gCIH nor pCIH exposure had
      effects on diaphragm muscle force-generating capacity or endurance in either sex.
      Similarly, early life exposure to CIH did not affect muscle tolerance of severe
      hypoxic stress determined ex vivo. The findings contrast with our recent
      observation of upper airway dilator muscle weakness following exposure to pCIH.
      Thus, the present study suggests a relative resilience to hypoxic stress in
      diaphragm muscle. Co-ordinated activity of thoracic pump and upper airway dilator
      muscles is required for optimal control of upper airway caliber. A mismatch in
      the force-generating capacity of the complementary muscle groups could have
      adverse consequences for the control of airway patency and respiratory
      homeostasis.

TI  - Associations Between Maternal-Foetal Attachment and Infant Developmental
      Outcomes: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 540-553
LID - 10.1007/s10995-016-2138-2 [doi]
AB  - Objectives Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal
      maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that
      maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, 
      there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research
      and clinical practice. Methods Five electronic databases were systematically
      scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were
      included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2)
      the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome
      (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3)
      they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE
      checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results Of the 968 papers
      identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low
      quality (<60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined
      included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n 
      = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that
      lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes.
      However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and 
      low quality studies available. Conclusions Although maternal-foetal attachment
      may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required
      which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased
      scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and
      postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

TI  - Assessing the effective use of mosquito nets in the prevention of malaria in some
      parts of Mezam division, Northwest Region Cameroon.
PG  - 390
LID - 10.1186/s12936-016-1419-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Cameroon, malaria continues to be endemic and the first major
      cause of morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable groups-children under 
      5 years of age, pregnant women, people living with HIV/AIDS and the poor. The use
      of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) is one of the recommended
      measures to prevent malaria. The present study was aimed at accessing the
      acceptability and effective use of LLINs on the prevalence of malaria in PMI
      Nkwen, Bambui and its environs. METHODS: Hospital-based diagnosis consisted of
      476 blood samples that were screened using the rapid diagnostic kits to determine
      the prevalence of malaria among users and non-users of LLINs. A structured
      questionnaire was also administered to pregnant women and children less than 5
      years of age (476 hospital-based and 350 from the community) which consisted of
      demographic information, availability, accessibility affordability,
      acceptability, effective use and problems encountered with the use of LLINs.
      RESULTS: Result obtained showed that out of the 476 hospital-based patients, 29
      tested positive for malaria giving an overall prevalence of 6.09 %. Equally,
      results of the questionnaire showed that 743 (89.9 %) of the respondents owned
      LLINs with up to 649 (87.3 %) having been given to them free-of-charge, and that 
      578 (77.8 %) were using their LLINs to sleep, even though 18.2 % of the
      respondents used their LLINs for other purposes, such as fishing, nursing seeds
      and footfall nets. Malaria was minimal among users of LLINs than non-users and
      the results were significant at P </= 0.05. Also 71.9 % of the respondents said
      that their nets were in good condition while 52.2 % of them said the major
      problem with the usage of LLINs was heat and the feeling of suffocation.
      CONCLUSION: These results indicate that LLINs have significantly reduced the
      prevalence of malaria among the studied population, and so the government should 
      not relent its efforts in the distribution of these nets especially to the
      vulnerable groups in order eliminate malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.
      Utilization of LLINs needs to be encouraged to match ownership, while free
      distribution of ITNs to vulnerable groups needs to be continuous and consistent.

TI  - RISK FACTORS OF THYROID PATHOLOGY FORMATION IN OUTPATIENT PREGNANT POPULATION.
PG  - 40-5
AB  - Several medical - biological and social - hygienic factors have been found to
      account for the definite increase in the incidence of thyroid gland disorders in 
      reproductive age and pregnant women. Aim of our study was to identify the risk
      factors for development of thyroid gland pathology in outpatient pregnant women. 
      Observational study - "case - control" study has been conducted at the base of
      David Gagua Hospital Ltd. Main (study) group involved 292 pregnant patients with 
      established thyroid pathology. Control group included 58 conditionally healthy
      pregnant participants without any demonstrated thyroid pathology. Study of risk
      factors was performed by initial interviewing and specialized questionnaire
      recording process (so-called two-stage model of interviewing). Characteristics of
      diet, sleep, physical activity, including harmful habits, socio-economic and
      hereditary factors were studied; quantitative indices of risk for each component 
      were calculated: odds ratio (OR) and attributable risk (AR), taking into account 
      95% confidence interval (CI). The Pearson's criterion chi2 with respective P
      value and the calculator developed by International Society of Evidence-based
      Medicine were used to obtain the final results. Statistically significant risk
      factors for development of thyroid pathology were identified, which included:
      Thyroid gland diseases and hereditary history of diabetes mellitus; low economic 
      income, unfavorable living conditions, unhealthy dietary habits. Despite of the
      difficulty of assessment of causative relationship between above mentioned
      components, their strong correlation should be taken into account when defining
      the strategy of preventive measures, moreover the most part of identified risk
      factors are manageable.
