N2  - Two groups of pregnant rats were administered methadone hydrochloride by oral intubation during the last two weeks of gestation. Both a 10 mg/kg and a 15 mg/kg group initially received 5 mg/kg on Days 8 through 11 of gestation followed by 10 mg/kg on Days 12 through 15. The 10 mg/kg group was maintained at this level whereas the higher dose-level group was increased to 15 mg/kg on Day 16 of gestation. An intubation control group received sterile water alone on the same gestation days and a nontreated control group was left undisturbed. All experimental and control litters were fostered at birth to untreated mothers. Groups of 3 littermates from each of the treated and control groups were tested for an 8 hr observation period on electronic activity monitors at 17, 22 and 30 days of age. Compared with controls, the 10 mg/kg offspring were more active at 17 and 22 days of age and, in addition, showed more frequent shifts from low to high activity. Only an attenuated effect was observed among the 15 mg/kg group and by 30 days of age, one of the methadone treated offspring differed from the controls. The findings are discussed in relation to clinical reports on hyperactivity, sleep disturbance and increased lability of state observed among opiate exposed infants.

N2  - The developmental sequence of sleep cycles has been found to be a useful index of central nervous system maturation in premature infants. To determine the effects of severe reversible stress on the maturation of sleep cycles, 6- to 8-hour sleep studies were done on 10 premature infants with severe hyaline membrane disease (HMD) and 10 healthy premature babies. The studies were done in the neonatal intensive care unit and included patients from 30 weeks' gestation to term and in all stages of the disease. Prior studies were confirmed showing that percentage of quiet sleep increases, transitional sleep changes little, and active sleep decreases from 30 weeks' gestation to term. In infants with severe HMD, the percentage of quiet sleep was less and active sleep higher than in unstressed infants of similar age who acted as controls. Once the infants recovered from HMD, sleep patterns became similar to those found in the control group. These data suggest that when respiratory distress occurs in the premature infant, there is a transient delay in central nervous system maturation as measured by sleep cycle analysis.

N2  - HS/Ibg (heterogeneous stock) mice dams were fed milled mouse food containing 3g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) in acid form and water as their only nutritional source from gestation days 9-19. Control females received milled food and water. Blood PhB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40-200 μg/ml blood. At the age of 50 days, male offspring were injected with C14-sodium pentobarbital (PenB) (50mg/kg). Sleep time and temperature loss were monitored and, in randomly selected individuals, brain PenB levels were determined upon wakening. The experiment was repeated on the same animals for 3 consecutive days. All offspring developed functional (central nervous system) tolerance during the 3 testing days as evidenced by the decrease of sleep time while brain levels of PenB upon wakening increased (P<0.001). Offspring who received PhB prenatally had generally shorter sleep times, less temperature loss, and higher brain PenB levels upon wakening than controls. The differences were most pronounced on the second day (sleep time reduced 27%, P<0.001; temperature loss 47%, P<0.001; brain PhB levels increased 23%, P<0.01).

N2  - Fetal effects of maternal bacterial and viral infections (measles, cytomegalic, herpes, etc.) are well documented. However, drug and chemical effects are less recognized and understood, and actually there was very little in the literature about these effects until recently. Evidence is overwhelming that the nonbarbiturate, sleep-inducing drug thalidomide produced severe malformations of the extremities (phocomelia - 'seal extremities') in numerous newborns in Germany and other parts of Western Europe in the early 1960s. The only medications known definitely and absolutely to be teratogenic in the human are folic-acid antagonists (primarily aminopterin), thalidomide, and masculinizing steroids. Cortisone and its analogues, suspect in cleft palate, should be avoided if possible, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy. Oral anticoagulants pass readily through the placental barrier and can have teratogenic effects. Heparin should be used instead, since it cannot cross the placental barrier. Drugs suspected or associated with increased risk to the fetus and neonate are listed. Chronic alcoholism in the mother can produce fetal abnormalities (the'fetal alcohol syndrome'). Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and goes directly into the fetus. Assorted heavy metals are probably the leading and most serious environmental pollutants affecting the fetus.

N2  - The laboratory assessment of prolactin status was evaluated by detailed study of 921 subjects (587 normal subjects and 334 patients with pathological conditions). The effect on serum prolactin levels of age, sex, circadian rhythm, pulsatility of secretion, stress, drug ingestion, and pregnancy was defined in normal subjects. The normal prolactin responses to stimulation (TRH, metoclopramide) and suppression (L-dopa, bromocriptine) were also determined. Basal prolactin levels were measured in patients with defined pathological conditions including prolactinoma, idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia, acromegaly, Cushing's disease, chronic renal failure, primary hypothyroidism, pituitary ablation, Kallman's syndrome, Nelson's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, gonadotrophin deficiency, craniopharyngioma, panhypopituitarism, and chronic progressive arthropathy. Based on these data, a strategy for the routine laboratory assessment of prolactin status is outlined.

N2  - The time of paturition in rats is determined in part by the photoperiod, and an 8 hr advance in the timing of the light-dark cycle before mid-pregnancy delays parturition by about 12 hr. This effect of the photoperiod was eliminated by lesions placed in the anterior hypothalamus, whereas pinealectomy had no effect. In a cross-sectional study, rats under control and time-advanced photoperiods were killed at 3 hr intervals up to the predicted time of parturition. The decline in plasma progesterone, the rise in prolactin and the appearance of 20αOHSDHase activity in the ovaries were correlated with the time of parturition. All three events were delayed in rats subjected to the 8 hr advance in the photoperiod. Plasma levels of LH and FSH, and the prepartum fetal growth spurt, were more closely related to gestational age than the predicted hour of birth. There was a marked circadian rhythm in plasm corticosterone reaching peak levels shortly before the onset of darkness. Parturition occurred when the plasma levels of corticosterone were low. Various pharmacological treatments designed to influence the levels or actions of prolactin, oestrogen and corticosterone in pregnant rats under both control and time-advanced photoperiods were investigated. These studies indicate that a sequence of three key endocrine events leads to parturition in the rat: luteal regression, creating basal levels of progesterone for the last 24 hr of pregnancy; a phase during which the uterus is prepared for parturition under the influence of oestrogen and relaxin; and, a delivery phase during which the uterus is stimulated to contract, possibly by the production of a time-dependent signal.

N2  - Small rodents are the animals most utilized in investigating the effects of acute and long-term carbon monoxide intoxications. These animals can be used in sufficient numbers to produce statistically significant results. Furthermore, the 2- to 3-year life span of rats and mice enable life-long exposures and make possible studies of several subsequent generations in controlled environmental conditions. Experimental investigations of acute toxicity show differences related to age, sex, pregnancy, and adrenal factors. Differences in strains, body size, respiratory parameters, span of life, carboxyhemoglobin dissociation, endogen carbon monoxide production, and circadian rhythms must be taken into consideration when comparing results obtained with different animal models. Experiments of the effects of tobacco smoke and automotive exhaust are of great interest for they associate carbon monoxide with other toxic components that constitute a risk for human health.

N2  - Serotonin has a strong vasoconstrictor action, able to produce necrotic lesions in placenta. 5-HT increases during hypoxia and pregnancy. For this reason it seemed interesting to study the excretion of 5-HIAA in pregnant women with anemia (Hb≤9.8). Twelve pregnant women with anemia 49 pregnant women without anemia, 6 non-pregnant women with anemia, and 53 non-pregnant women with normal Hb were studied. The circadian rhythm of 5-HIAA excretion was studied in 12 hour periods. (8.20 hr and 20.8 hr). In the pregnant women with normal Hb, 5-HIAA excretion was 1.66 μg/min during the day and 1.21 μg/min during the night. The day/night (d/n) relation was 1.37. In the non-pregnant women with anemia the diurnal excretion was 2.07 μg/min and the nocturnal 1.54 μg/min; the d/n relation was 1.34. In the pregnant women without anemia the diurnal excretion was 2.84 μg/min and the nocturnal 1.63 μg/min; the d/n relation was 1.74. In the pregnant women with anemia the diurnal excretion was 3.21 μg/min, the nocturnal 1.85 and the d/n relation 1.74. It seems anemia produces an increase in 5-HIAA excretion that is additive to the increase produced by gestation.

N2  - Biorhythm of sleep, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep was studied in unanesthetized, freely moving, female rats. A concentric bipolar stainless steel electrode for EEG recording was placed in the dorsal hippocampus and monopolar EEG recording electrodes were placed in the frontal cortex. One week after surgery, and the resumption of consecutive 4 days estrous cycles, EEG patterns were recorded for 7 consecutive days. Female rats subjected to light and dark schedule (LD) during the period of gestation and through puberty exhibited a diurnal rhythm of sleep, and paradoxical sleep; a circadian rhythm with peaks of sleep during the light phase. When these rats were transferred from LD to continuous illumination (CI), circadian rhythm was annihilated and indeed all rhythms disappeared. It seems likely that light serves as synchronizer or oscillator for regulation of circadian rhythm of sleep, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep. However, in female rats subjected to CI during the period of gestation and puberty, light apparently does not serve as synchronizer or oscillator for the regulation of circadian rhythm. Further, these rats exhibit a nocturnal rhythm (12 hr shift of acrophase of circadian rhythm of sleep and paradoxical sleep from rats born and reared in LD) of sleep, and paradoxical sleep; a circadian rhythm with peaks of sleep during midnight. The evidence illustrates the nature of oscillatory phenomena controlling circadian rhythm of sleep, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep in rats.

N2  - Sleep-awake state distribution during inter-feed intervals over a 24-hour period on the third day of life was investigated by means of a continuous non-intrusive bassinet sleep monitor. 31 infants were studied: 14 born to mothers who drank heavily throughout pregnancy (group A), eight whose mothers modified their heavy drinking (group B) and nine whose mothers never were heavy drinkers (group C). Over the 24-hour period, group A infants slept less than those in group B. In comparison with group C, group A infants had a larger proportion of quiet sleep episodes interrupted by awake or unclassified epochs, and were more restless, with more frequent major body movements. These pilot observations suggest that heavy maternal consumption of alcohol, when continued throughout pregnancy, is associated with a disturbance of sleep-awake state distribution. Successful therapy of heavy drinking during pregnancy may improve the physiological competence of the newborn to regulate sleep-awake states and facilitate interaction between mother and infant.

N2  - The present study investigates the diurnal variations of free plasma oestradiol levels in late human pregnancy. The oestradiol levels are correlated to the maternal adrenal function as reflected by the plasma levels of cortisol. According to the half life of oestradiol, blood samples were collected at short time intervals of 30 and 60 min, respectively. Three pregnant women volunteered in the study. Free oestradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay and cortisol was quantitated by a protein binding method. All patients exhibited a circadian rhythm for free oestradiol with significantly higher values in the early morning (28.3 ± 7.2 ng/ml) than in the afternoon and early night (21.2 ± 3.6 ng/ml, P<0.001). The course of oestradiol followed in a moderate but significant correlation plasma cortisol (r=0.34, P<0.001). During the period of increasing cortisol the oestradiol levels demonstrated the phenomenon of episodic secretion. The results obtained suggest that the maternal adrenals predominantly regulate the diurnal rhythm of free oestradiol in late human pregnancy.

N2  - Total Oe3 concentration was determined on serial plasma specimens over 24 hr in 8 gravids in the last three months of pregnancy with no signs of maternal of fetal disease, using a direct radioimmunological method preceded by enzymatic hydrolysis. The results suggested that no circadian rhythm exists for total Oe3. Values varied from one subject to another. Stress is laid on the advantages of measuring total plasma as opposed to urinary values, and as opposed to the free form.

N2  - Diurnal variations in plasma unconjugated and total estriol were assessed in 11 third-trimester subjects with uncomplicated pregnancies. Commercially available 125I-labeled radioimmunoassay kits were used. Total plasma estriols reach a nadir during the hours of sleep (400 and 700 hours) which exceeds the episodic fluctuations seen from day to day or during a given 90-minute period. Plasma unconjugated estriol fluctuations over 24 hours did not significantly exceed our previously reported episodic fluctuation of 15.6 ± 8.2%. The data are interpreted as showing no circadian rhythm, but reflecting, in the case of total plasma estriols, an effect of improved renal clearance during hours of rest. Plasma unconjugated estriol emerges as the test of choice in the monitoring of high-risk pregnancies.

N2  - The sleep-waking behavior of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first 4 mth of life. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule and was fed only if his behavior could be judged as a feeding demand. Using several methods of computerized analysis it could be demonstrated that the spontaneous sleep-waking behavior was mainly driven by 2 endogenous rhythms, an ultradian cycle and a circadian one. While the ultradian rhythm was already established at term showing a mean period of 4 hr, the circadian variation developed during the first 3 mth of life. So far the authors' results support earlier studies. The present paper, however, gives further evidence that both rhythms do not run independently, but seem to constitute a system of connected oscillators. As soon as the circadian rhythm is manifestly developed, the period of the ultradian rhythm seems to be modulated according to circadian variations. More specifically, during the nocturnal phase of the circadian rhythm the ultradian rhythm decelerated. By contrast, during the diurnal phase the ultradian cycle was accelerated. Using circadian frequency modulation of the ultradian cycle as the underlying principle, a computerized model of both connected oscillators was developed. The theoretically predicted sleep-waking behavior was compared to the behavior actually observed in the infant of this study. During postnatal development the coupled rhythms cause characteristic periodicities of the sleep-waking pattern. Since the infant experiences his world within a basic framework of sleep and waking spans, the different periodicities may be considered as a structure timing the information process in the developing brain.

N2  - Human embryonic neutrophils (N) in the liver (from 8.5 mm crown-rump length) are alkaline phosphatase (AP) during the first trimester of pregnancy. Early bone marrow granulocytes (from eleventh to sixteenth weeks of gestation) behave similarly. Only a small percentage of slightly AP positive cells could be found. Occasional cells with strong NAP reaction appear in the second trimester. NAP positivity greatly increases in the third trimester and term-babies have a somewhat higher than normal NAP activity in circulating blood. Unlike NAP reaction, naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate esterase and peroxidase reactions are positive even in the earliest (AP negative) neutrophils.

N2  - High levels of steroids during pregnancy may change brain metabolism and cause depression. Estrogens increase the need for pyridoxal phosphate, and its deficiency is related to low brain 5-hydroxytryptamin, which in turn is linked to depression. The present study demonstrates a correlation between the depth of pregnancy depression and serum B6 levels and suggests that the biochemical changes (steroids → vitamin B6) may be a cause, rather than a consequence, of pregnancy depression. The similarity of the clinical features of pregnancy depression and depression in users or oral contraceptives (pessimism, crying and tension with no sleep disturbances or appetite disorders) also supports the concept that pure pregnancy depression may be steroid-induced.

N2  - The short- and long-term effects of surgical procedures and chair restraint on total plasma cortisol were assessed in the chronic rhesus monkey preparation. Three nonpregnant and six pregnant animals were sampled daily, morning and evening. Fetal plasma specimens were obtained simultaneously from the pregnant animals. In the nonpregnant rhesus monkey, a circadian rhythm is present the day following venous catheterization and chair restraint, with individual values similar to those on trained, unanesthetized animals. In the pregnant animals, a postoperative rise in cortisol is followed by gradual decline to a plateau and a return of circadian rhythm. No consistent daily fluctuations are seen in fetal cortisol, and although correlated with maternal cortisol, the exact relationship is uncertain. The data indicate that operation, as expected, is stressful but acclimation to the chair occurs.

N2  - The objective of this study was to identify and quantify fetal and maternal heart rate (FHR, MHR) periodicities and to examine their interrelation as well as the relation of fetal cycles with the maternal REM-NREM sleep cycle. Heart rate periodicities of the same subjects after birth were correlated with the neonatal REM-NREM sleep cycle. Sixteen all-night polygraphic recordings were obtained during the last trimester of pregnancy and the 1st week of life in seven subjects. Abdominal leads were used to obtain continuous fetal heart rates. Maternal and infant sleep states were scored according to standard criteria. Minute-by-minute values for maternal, fetal, and neonatal heart rates were analyzed on a PDP-12 computer and subjected to time series analyses including auto spectral techniques and complex demodulation. Period lengths of less than 1 hr, between 1 and 2 hr, and even longer were present in the tracings of mother, fetus, and neonate. Predictable interaction between maternal and fetal heart rate periodicities could not be established. None of the fetal rhythms bore a consistent relationship with the maternal REM-NREM sleep cycles. Maternal sleep onset or the first sleep cycle was accompanied by an increase in fetal heart rate lasting between 10 and 20 min in six of the nine recordings. Fetal heart rate cycles between 1 and 2 hr are probably early manifestations of the neonatal REM-NREM sleep cycle. The transient rise in fetal heart rate could be an adaptive response to either the fall in blood pressure or the shift in acid-base balance upon maternal sleep onset to which the fetus habituates within a short time.

N2  - The concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion from individual glands of two sows increased significantly (P less than 0.01) between 0 and 24 h after parturition. In six sows studied during the perinatal period there was a negative correlation (r = -0.80; P less than 0.02) at parturition between the concentration of progesterone in the blood and the concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion. Furthermore, the increase in concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion after parturition was related to the timing of the decline of plasma progesterone to low levels. The results indicate that the initiation of lactation occurs within 24 h of parturition in most sows, and the results are consistent with the hypothesis that progesterone withdrawal acts as the 'trigger'. Neither the changes in corticosteroid binding globulin nor the changes in total corticosteroids were temporally related to the initiation of lactation. However, a circadian rhythm was observed for total corticosteroids in the blood of three out of nine lactating and pregnant sows, whereas no circadian rhythm was observed in progesterone of the four pregnant sows. The results are discussed in relation to the disease complex mastitis-metritis-agalactia.

N2  - Periodic sleep apnea, a chronic sleep deprivation state, in which marked changes in the arterial P(O)2 and P(CO)2 tensions have been recorded, is a relatively new syndrome not previously reported in pregnancy. It is characterized by episodes of apnea, prevalently obstructive, during sleep. The majority of patients with this syndrome have snored heavily for years, suggesting a causal relationship between snoring and periodic sleep apnea. The effects of prolonged snoring on alveolar ventilation and systemic pressure(s) suggest that this snoring has physiopathological implications on maternal cardio-respiratory reserve and indirectly upon the fetus, especially as there are recordable changes in fetal heart rate and also a change in the acid-base status of the fetus. The possibility that this syndrome may have an adverse effect upon the fetus is stressed.

N2  - Thirty-three women with PRL secreting pituitary adenomas were studied before, during and after trans-sphenoidal removal of the tumor. Based on neuroradiological evaluation, 2 groups were separated. Group I patients, (18 cases) were characterized by: adenoma confined to the sella turcica; basal plasma PRL concentration of 175 ± 51 ng/ml (mean ± SE); abnormal plasma 24-h PRL profile in contrast to a clear nocturnal rise of GH; variable modifications of plasma PRL under provocative tests; and no pituitary deficiency observed. Group II patients (15 cases) were characterized by: tumor invasion of surrounding structures; basal plasma PRL concentration of 898 ± 441 ng/ml; no nocturnal rise of PRL plasma levels, whereas GH levels increased at the onset of sleep in only 3 of 8 patients; and decrease of somatotropic function in 3 cases and gonadotropic deficiency in 3 other cases. Peri-operative estimation of PRL plasma levels showed a fast return to normal levels in group I patients (13 ± 2 ng/ml) 2 h after surgery. A 50% decrease of pre-operative PRL levels was obtained in group II patients in the same conditions. In all group I patients, an ovulatory cycle was observed 36 ± 5 days after surgery and PRL plasma levels were 9.6 ± 1.2 ng/ml 3-12 months after surgery. Nine group I patients became pregnant, among which 5 were followed-up during pregnancy and lactation. No abnormalities were observed during these periods. Among the 9 remaining patients, the 24-h PRL profiles were normal and, in particular, a clear nocturnal rise was observed in 4 patients. PRL response was normal after bromocriptine suppression and TRH stimulation in 7 of the group I patients explored. No pituitary deficiency was noted in any group I patients. In all group II patients, bromocriptine treatment was necessary to reduce PRL plasma concentration to normal levels. The reported data on circumscribed PRL secreting adenomas emphasize the intrapituitary localization of such tumors. Moreover, the elevated plasma PRL levels immediately fell after selective removal of the adenoma. Post-operative follow-up established the absence of any abnormality in the hypothalamo- hypophyseal axis.

N2  - Clinical responses to peppermint odor were observed in 100 healthy term preterm infants during active sleep on 2 successive days. 36 asphyxiated term infants and 3 infants with holoprosencephaly also were tested. Olfactory reflexes were regularly elicited in normal infants after 32 wks' gestation, but some premature infants as young as 28 wk also responded. Responses included initiation of sucking and arousal-withdrawal. Habituation occurred after 2 or 3 trials. A Moro response was seen only in a few asphyxiated infants; loss of olfactory reflexes appeared to parallel suppression of brainstem reflexes. Olfactory reflexes are useful in excluding cerebral malformations associated with agenesis of the olfactory bulbs.

N2  - The spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first four months of life. Additionally sleep stages were scored by means of polygraphic method during several weeks. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule and was fed if his behaviour could be judged as a feeding demand. Using statistical analysis it could be deomonstrated, that the spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour was mainly driven by three endogenous rhythms: The Basic rest aktivity cycle with periods of about 50 minutes, a circafour-hour rhythm already established at term and a circadian periodicity which developed during the first three months of life. So far our results support earlier studies of Kleitman and Engelmann, Parmelee, Hellbrügge etc. The present study, however, gives further evidence, that these rhythms do not run independently, but constitute a system of interacting oscillators. During postnatal development these connected rhythms cause characteristic periodicities of the spontaneous sleep-waking pattern. Since the newborn experiences his world within a basic framework of sleep and waking epochs, the system of interacting, endogenous rhythms may be considered as a structure timing the information process in the developing brain.

N2  - Five infants born of mothers maintained on methadone HCl (20 to 70 mg daily) were studied at intervals during the first 2 mth of life. One of the children was born prematurely after a 36 wk gestation; the birth weight was 2.36 kg. The remaining 4 were term infants. Their average birth weight was 3.28 kg and the weights ranged from 2.89 to 3.93 kg. Ventilatory response to carbon dioxide inhalation was determined with the use of a steady state technique while the infants were in natural quiet sleep. The slope of the carbon dioxide response curve was markedly below normal on the first day of life and did not reach the normal range for an average of 21.5 days. The decreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide persisted beyond the time when methadone could be detected in serum by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. The elimination half life of methadone in serum, determined in 4 of the infants, averaged 51 hr and ranged from 25 to 69 hr. The decreased ventilatory response to carbon dioxide may contribute to the increased incidence of sudden death which has been reported in infants born of mothers maintained on methadone.

N2  - Serum prolactin was measured in 581 blood samples collected immediately after birth from 568 single new-born and from 9 pairs of twins. Cord serum prolactin is high at birth: the mean level is some 5 times higher than in adults. There is no sex difference in cord serum prolactin concentration in the neonate. Mean serum prolactin is significantly higher at 1.00 and 2.00 a.m. Thus a circadian periodicity in serum prolactin concentration seems to appear already during foetal life well before the organization of sleep rhythm. Cord serum prolactin increases with birth weight ranging from 1500 g to 3500 g. Thus, the control of levels of circulating prolactin changes during foetal life resulting in a progressive increase starting from mid-pregnancy. Mean cord serum prolactin at birth is lower in twins than in single new-borns. There is no significant difference in serum prolactin between the first and second twin.

N2  - Primary sleep disorders include narcolepsy, the Pickwickian syndrome, sleep apnea in infants and other rare conditions. Secondary sleep disorders occur in depression, alcoholism, endocrinopathies, heart failure and pregnancy. Medical symptomatology often increases during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when physiologic activity is high. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, requires careful work-up, attempts at environmental manipulation and judicious short-term pharmacotherapy. Pharmacologic manipulation of sleep is beset with complications. A basic understanding of properties and side effects of the sleep-inducing drugs is needed in order to select the optimal agent.

N2  - Both premature and postmature births among mammals are hazardous to the offspring. Determinants of gestation length are therefore important. Circadian rhythms influence many biologic phenomena. We wondered whether gestation length was determined by the number of light-dark cycles or by an absolute length of time. C57BL mice were bred and raised under conditions of a 21-h light-dark cycle (10 1/2 L:10 1/2 D). Entrainment was demonstrated by measuring running activity. The animals were then used for these experiments. They were bred first (Period 1) under the 10 1/2L:10 1/2 D cycle (21 pregnancies), then (Period 2) for a few weeks under a 12L:12D cycle (10 pregnancies), then again (Period 3) under a 10 1/2L:10 1/2 D cycle (9 pregnancies). Gestation lengths (mode and range in 24-h days) were: Period 1: 20 (19-20), Period 2: 20 (20-21), Period 3: 21 (20-22). The findings indicate that gestation length remained approximately constant in terms of absolute time when the mice were entrained to a shortened light-dark cycle.

N2  - Sleep behavior was studied in 70- to 140-day-old rats subjected to protein malnutrition at various stages of development. Dams of experimental animals were fed one of two isocaloric diets containing either 25% casein or 8% casein for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. After weaning (21 days) the offspring were either maintained on the diet fed their mother or switched to the other diet. Dietary protein restriction, either prior to or following weaning, resulted in a shift of the distribution of rapid eye-movement sleep such that a significantly greater proportion of total rapid eye-movement sleep occurred during the dark phase of the 24 h recording period. Combined preweaning and postweaning restriction produced a somewhat greater effect. None of the malnourished groups differed significantly from the well-nourished control group in amount of waking, slow-wave sleep, or rapid eye-movement sleep in 24 h. A control group fed rat chow did not differ from the well-nourished group in any of these aspects of sleep behavior. These results indicate the possibility of involvement of malnutrition changes in biogenic amine metabolism or endocrine function.

N2  - Twelve rhesus monkeys confined to restraining chairs and maintained in a controlled environment were used to explore the existence and effect of biorhythms in the dynamics of the uterus during the last half of pregnancy. Spontaneous uterine activity, aortic blood pressure, and uterine artery blood flow were monitored continuously for periods of five to 25 days. During a 24 hour period, the variation in hourly average values of all measured functions occurred in repetitive and predictable patterns conforming to highly significant Fourier curves that were entrained by the light-dark cycle. Highest amniotic fluid and blood pressure values were recorded during the periods of light. Amplitudes of the sine curves calculated from intra-amniotic pressure data ranged from 1.8 to 59.4 per cent of the 24 hour mean, and in eight animals, they were positively correlated with blood pressure changes. In general, highest hourly average uterine artery blood flow rates occurred during the periods of darkness when intra-amniotic fluid pressures were minimal. The differences between minimal and maximal average flow rates ranged from 17.0 to 63.6 per cent of mean daily flow and were inversely correlated to amniotic fluid pressure changes. Disparities observed in the chronology and amplitude of the 24 hour periodic functions recorded for intra-amniotic pressure, blood pressure, and uterine blood flow indicate these biorhythms are modulated by factors in addition to those engendered by physiological pressure-flow relationships. The existence of these circadian rhythms should be considered when studying the kinetics and kinematics of the pregnant primate uterus.

N2  - Continuous recording of foetal ECoG, eye and body movements and heart rate were carried out in the same animal during late pregnancy and the perinatal period. Alternation of NREM sleep and REM sleep was recorded in 5 foetal lambs as an ultradian rhythm occupying 90% of the time during the 3 weeks prior to birth. The period of the rhythm was 30 to 40 min with a ratio of NREM/REM of 1/1 from 4 months post conceptional age until 6 to 8 hr before birth. Foetal kinetic behavior was differentiated into simple or complex movements and gross activity. Kinesis, particularly the periods of gross activity which accompanied foetal alert wakefulness, was both more frequent and more intense during the night time. After birth, the total sleep time was reduced to 40% of the recording time, at one week post partum the ratio of NREM/REM was 5/1. In the neonate the NREM REM sleep cycles persisted but the period was reduced by half. Three to five sleep cycles were grouped in episodes of 90 to 120 min, separated by wakefulness and alimentary behavior. Throughout the experiment, the main criterion for distinguishing alert wakefulness from NREM sleep was oculomotor activity. Wakefulness occupied about 10% of each 24 hr period prepartum and 60% postpartum.

N2  - The effects of maternal administration of alpha-methyl-L-DOPA on sleep in utero were studied by polygraphic methods in guinea pig fetus from the 53rd day of gestation. Maternal injection of alpha-methyl-L-DOPA (100 and 200 mg/kg) produces a typical sedative effect on the fetus from the 1st hr after drug administration, but effects appear attenuated in comparison to those of the newborn guinea pig: a paradoxic sleep- deprivation of only 30% is observed during the 12 hr period after drug injection. The causes of the attenuation in utero of these drug effects are discussed.

N2  - The possibility that 24-hour rhythms exist in uterine blood flow (UtBF) and umbilical blood flow (UmBF) was investigated in 5 days postoperative chronically instrumented near-term pregnant sheep acclimated to a controlled environment. UtBF, UmBF and pressure measurements were made at 15-min intervals over 24 hr beginning at 0800 hr. Each data series was examined for the presence of significant rhythms of a 24-hour period using a method of Fourier analysis. UtBF 24-hour rhythms were found in all ewes; UmBF 24-hour rhythms were found in 4 of 5 lambs. A consistent reciprocal phase relationship between UtBF and UmBF was evident within animals. There were no associated rhythms in maternal arterial, fetal arterial or amniotic fluid pressures. The results indicate that the presence of circadian rhythms must be considered as a possible variable when long-term uteroplacental hemodynamic studies are planned.

N2  - The aim of the research was a computer analysis of the EEG after child-birth. Cases unaffected by fatigue, pain or previous medication were considered. Tracings were recorded at the eight month of pregnancy and compared to those obtained 48-72 hrs following delivery, after a regular sleep and with a normal blood sugar level. Subjects also tested by the Hamilton scale for anxiety. Sixty-four sec. artefact-free epochs were stored on magnetic tape from several scalp electrodes by using Common Average Reference derivation. Computer analysis was made by a 16K machine. Peak amplitude, activity and mobility of the α-band were calculated. Following delivery slight increase of both peak amplitude and activity was observed with less mobility. Individual spectral features were nevertheless mantained. Irritability was the most affected psychological parameter, the Hamilton scale showing a clear decrease, which fairly paralleled the slight α-increase. Although a prolactin effect could be suspected, this hormone plays no role, for no relationship exists between α-amplitude and prolactin levels, checked by radioimmunology. High α-peaks were often found in subjects having low blood concentration of that hormone and viceversa. Moreover, bromocriptine given at a dose of 5 mg/day after delivery leaves the EEG unaffected in spite of the inhibition of the prolactin. The fast drop of progesterone is thought to be involved.

N2  - The dose of a drug applied to a patient is determined by his physiological and pathological data, by specific properties of the drug and by the mode of application. The most important physiological data which influence the dose are body weight, sex, age, a pregnancy, genetic variations and circadian rhythm. Pathological findings such as organ insufficiencies (kidneys, heart, liver, endocrinium, transport protein in the blood, etc.) are also to be considered. Particularities of the drug kinetics (insignificant absorption, excessive biological half life, specific affinities to tissues, etc.), of metabolism (first pass effect, toxic metabolites, saturable detoxification, stress, etc.) or a high toxicity are other parameters of consequence. Finally attention has to be paid to the mode of application (p.o., i.v., etc.), to the kind of galenic preparation (liquid or solid, slow releasing preparation, etc.), to interactions if using combinations of drugs and to a long lasting pharmacotherapy. Additional problems are encountered in clinical trials especially in early phases while determining the tolerable therapeutic dose.

N2  - The 24-hr activity patterns of intestinal maltase, lactase, leucylnaphthylamine hydrolyzing activity, γ-glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were determined in pregnant rats maintained on a 12-12 light-dark cycle, with feeding during the dark period (1800-0600 hr, EST). The activities of these enzymes plus those of lysosomal maltase and lactase were followed during the same time period in 19- to 20-day-old fetuses. The activity patterns in the dams followed circadian rhythms, with peak activities occurring during the feeding-dark period. These rhythms are similar to the feeding schedule-cued rhythms observed in male rats and, therefore, are assumed to be feeding schedule cued also. In the fetuses, which obtained nutrients through the placenta, the activities increased in a somewhat nonlinear manner throughout the entire 24-hr period, but did not display a defined rhythm. It is concluded that endogenous intestinal enzyme rhythms do not exist in utero, and that oral and/or intermittent feeding is necessary for these rhythms to occur.

KW  - pneumatization
KW  - snoring
N2  - The nasal fossae with their anterior (nostrils) and posterior (conchae) orifices already formed and leaving a free passage for air in the fourth intrauterine month, cannot be considered a cavity but rather a tube with two free orifices. By a curious morphophysiologic phenomenon of the tongue, the nose is transformed in intrauterine life in a cavity that is pneumatized by hematogenic route with the gases of the pregnant mother's blood. The role of air in the nose in intrauterine life is very important and is described in the author's monograph on 'The Appearance of Hearing before Birth', which unquestionably demonstrates hematogenic pneumatization of all the cephalic cavities (nose, middle ear, antral cell, beginning of pneumatization of the mastoid bones, facial sinuses, etc.). Pneumatization of these cavities, apart from the nose, has been described in all the textbooks as occurring after birth, with atmospheric air. It is shown that in intrauterine life the tongue strongly compresses the soft palate and uvula against the posterior orifices of the nose which it closes hermetically. Water introduced with a syringe into the nose of a 5-6 months fetus does not penetrate in the mouth. By tight closing of the conchae the nose is transformed into a cavity that will be pneumatized, preventing the amniotic fluid from penetrating into the nose from the ear. This closing of the conchae by the soft palate and uvula suggested the idea of investigating the causes of snoring. The author considers that snoring is produced while sleeping on the back, because the uvula and soft palate fall toward the pharynx, acting as a stopper to the conchae, preventing breathing through the nose. Air pressure makes the uvula and soft palate vibrate to the rhythm of respiration, producing snoring. Proof is the snorer who wakes up and continues to sleep on one side when snoring ceases.

N2  - The reactions of babies to aircraft noise were studied by means of electroplethysmography (PLG) and electroencephalography (EEG). It was found that the babies whose mothers had moved to the area around the Osaka International Airport before conception (group I) or during the first five months of pregnancy (group II) showed little or no reaction on PLG and EEG to aircraft noise. In contrast, babies whose mothers had moved closed to the airport during the second half of the pregnancy or after birth (group III or IV) and the babies whose mothers lived in a quiet living area (group V) reacted to the same auditory stimuli. The babies in groups I and II showed differential responses depending on whether the auditory stimuli were aircraft noise or music. Abnormal PLG and EEG were observed in the majority of babies living in an area where noise levels were over 95 dBA. This suggests that the deep sleep of the babies living in such an area was disturbed.

N2  - Respiratory pattern and heart rate were studied in 28 pre-term infants and four full-term infants during the first weeks of life. Sleep state was identified by standard neurological and EEG criteria. Apneic spells lasting 10 seconds or more were most frequent in the least mature infants, and their frequency tended to diminish with increasing maturity. When these apneic attacks were related to sleep state they were found to occur more frequently during non-REM sleep in infants of 30 to 33 weeks gestation. This was the only statistically significant difference found. No over-all pattern relating sleep state to the frequency of apnea could be detected for individual infants. It was also difficult to relate the occurrence of bradycardia to apnea in terms of sleep state or gestational age. It is concluded that no simple relationship between sleep state, apnea, and bradycardia exists and that a complex interrelation between central and peripheral factors is involved in these events.

In 3 cases venous samples were taken every second hr over a 24 hr period; in 20 patients venous samples were taken at 2 fixed times. On the basis of 76 samples it is concluded that there is a circadian rhythm of plasma estriol levels in late pregnancy, characterized by higher levels in the early morning.

N2  - The effect of prenatal exposure to alcohol was studied in two lines of mice selectively bred for different sensitivities to alcohol: the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) lines. LS females took longer than SS females to become pregnant. Fewer LS offspring survived, even when not treated with alcohol. Although LS females tended to consume smaller doses of alcohol, offspring of LS dams consuming alcohol during the second half of gestation survived considerably less than 50% of the time. No such effect was seen in the SS line. These results are in agreement with others, indicating a line difference in several aspects of alcohol sensitivity.

N2  - The development of 40 postterm, postmature infants was compared to that of 40 normal control infants during the first year of life. The postterm, postmature infants had more prenatal complications and received lower Brazelton interaction and motor scores at birth. At four months they scored lower on the Denver developmental scale and were rated 'difficult' babies by their mothers. At eight months their Bayley motor scores were equivalent to those of the control infants, but their mental scores were lower. At this time their mothers reported a higher incidence of illnesses and of feeding and sleep disturbances.

N2  - In order to investigate pituitary adrenal relationships in fetus and pregnant women, plasma ACTH levels were measured in pregnant women and in the umbilical cord using radioimmunoassay. Basal morning plasma ACTH levels of pregnant women were usually within normal limits, but slightly elevated in some cases at the late stage of pregnancy. A normal circadian rhythm was maintained. Negative feedback control mechanism appeared normal when assessed by a dexamethasone suppression test. Plasma ACTH levels of umbilical cord and maternal blood were determined during vaginal and Cesarian delivery. Plasma ACTH levels were remarkably elevated in both cord and maternal blood. In Cesarian delivery, plasma ACTH levels in maternal blood were usually not so high. In some cases, ACTH in the umbilical cord blood was higher than that in maternal blood. ACTH was not detected in the cord blood of an anencephalic child. These results suggest that the fetus can regulate its ACTH secretion independently from that of the mother.

N2  - In the present study, the maturation of states of sleep in kittens from birth to 6 wk of age was evaluated in terms of the developmental emergence of temporal concordance between defining physiological parameters. In addition, periodicity of the earliest alternation of states, the REM-non-REM (rapid eye movement - nonrapid eye movement) or 'basic rest activity cycle', was traced during this same interval. Parameters studied include EEG, eye movements, neck EMG, gross motor activity, and respiration patterns. Kittens were monitored in isolation for periods of 2 to 6 hr, providing for collection of both longitudinal and cross sectional data. Statistical and computer analyses were performed on these data. The most outstanding feature of polygraphic data from kittens between birth and 4 wk of age was the gradual coalescence of initially discordant physiological measures of sleep state. Prior to 3 wk of age, polygraphic patterns differed significantly from those of the adult cat, indicating that individual rates of maturation existed for each physiological system measured. Sleep state periodicity was weak at this time due to marked pattern fragmentation. Detectable cycles were clearly shorter than those observed in the adult cat. These findings suggest that the developmental assessment of polygraphic pattern concordance might be a more useful index of sleep state maturation than evaluation based upon attempted comparisons with stable adult patterns. They suggest further, that sleep state development in the kitten consists of several different stages. The initial maturation of a basic rest activity cycle may begin during gestation, and be disrupted by the transition to extrauterine life. A postnatal period of approximately 3 to 6 wk is required for maturation of sensorimotor and respiratory functions in the completion of this stage. It is proposed that from this time to approximately 3 mth of age, forebrain maturation and environmental influences progressively mediate a mature sleep-wake cycle which is superimposed upon this more basic level of organization.

N2  - Concentrations of 17 free amino acids were measured in the serum of 15 healthy pregnant women at the end of pregnancy in intervals of 4 to 5 hr. A circadian rhythm with its concentration peak at 5 p.m. could be observed for Ser, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, His, Lys and Arg. Exogenic and endogenic synchronizators are being discussed as possible causes for these fluctuations during the day. The rhythm of the free amino acids makes it necessary that only fasting blood is examined and that the time of day is always registered when the blood specimen is taken.

N2  - Total protein and the so called classical blood plasma fractions were examined in hourly intervals over 24 hours in ten clinically intact pregnant Jersey cows. The average total protein values recorded from the plasma samples were 6.9% and thus physiologically normal. The arithmetic mean values within one circadian rhythm did not differ markedly within each of the following fractions: albumin (38.7 ± 5.08), α1-globulin (11.22 ± 2.22), α2-globulin (14.25 ± 1.95), and β-globulins (12.56 ± 0.91). Moderate rises were established only for the γ-globulins at 1 a.m., 7 a.m., and 7 p.m. The protein fractions of blood plasma, consequently, are not subject to any circadian rhythm, and the time of blood sampling, therefore, has no bearings on laboratory diagnosis.

N2  - Small doses of pentobarbitone (4 mg/kg i.v.) administered to sheep in the last third of pregnancy had little overt effect on the mothers. In the foetus they caused arrest of breathing movements, an alteration in the character of the electrocorticogram and cardiovascular changes which varied with gestational age. In contrast, relatively large doses of pethidine (100-200 mg) administered to the mother had no consistent effect on normal foetal breathing movements, though they abolished the foetal response to hypercapnia. The results are discussed in relation to foetal sleep state.

N2  - Continuous monitoring of the foetal electrocorticogram, eye movements and heart rate in ewes during the last month of gestation showed rapid placental transfer from the mother to the foetus of phenothiazine derivatives (acepromazine maleate), short acting barbiturates (thiopental sodium) and narcotic analgesics (meperidine). Acepromazine and thiopental partially disrupted the foetal sleep cycle by synchronization of the ECoG for 1-2 h but increased the heart rate for 2-3 h. The effects of meperidine were similar but lasted only 5-10 min for the ECoG and less than 0.5 h for the heart rate.

N2  - Febrile convulsion was observed in about 10% of the children studied. The early onset group, which shows the first seizure before one year of age, has a particularly high incidence of abnormal EEG pattern. Early onset plus onset of seizure at a relatively low level of body temperature elevation are bad omens for clinical epilepsies. Febrile convulsion has recognizable heredo familial factors. Moreover, the febrile convulsive children with familial history tend to have abnormal EEG patterns. The parents of febrile convulsive children are likely to have abnormal EEG patterns. The appearance of EEG abnormalities is more widespread in patients' mothers than their fathers. Febrile convulsive children are likely to have histories of pregnancy disorders, especially abnormal genital hemorrhage in early pregnancy and pathological emesis. This category of convulsive children has a high incidence of EEG abnormality. The electroencephalographic study of these children revealed that the appearance of spike and/or spike and wave complex is an important factor determining patients' outcome in regard to epilepsies. Translocation of an ictal focus from the occipital to the frontal or fronto temporal region is an ominous sign. All children clinically diagnosed as epileptics have an individual history of febrile convulsive condition of the complicated type (Fukuyama). There are so far no epileptic children in the control group. A relationship of character patterns with ictogenic situations as well as with ictaffine hours of the day was found; a relationship which reminds one of the relationship of grand mal epilepsies with sleep waking rhythm.

N2  - In a group of 120 children with prenatal and postnatal trauma 31 children with epileptic seizures were found who accounted for 25.8% of neuropsychiatric complications in this group. Epilepsy was more frequent in children with a history of asphyxia than after other forms of perinatal trauma. Seizures were observed either immediately after birth or up to the age of 100 mth. In children with delayed onset of seizures evidence of abnormal behavior with excessive motor agitation, sleep and appetite disturbances was found from birth. Besides prophylactic measures applied to avoid complications of pregnancy and labor it is indispensable to separate the children with perinatal trauma and group them for further neuropsychiatric observation in outpatient clinics and to begin treatment which may prevent development of epilepsy in at least a part of these children and may contribute to better rehabilitation of brain damaged children.

N2  - To determine if the central nervous sytem 'program' controlling PRL secretion is operative during pregnancy, three pregnant women (12th, 20th and 32nd week of gestation) had 24 hour, 20 minute interval plasma sampling and polygraphic monitoring of nocturnal sleep. All three subjects showed episodic PRL secretion during waking which became augmented during nocturnal sleep. Since the number of 'major' PRL secretory episodes was similar to normals, the increased PRL levels were most probably achieved by increased secretion per secretory episode. These findings suggest that during pregnancy, the PRL sleep related secretory 'program' is maintained in a qualitative manner, albeit at a higher set point.

N2  - Serotonin:acetyl coenzyme A N acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) activity in pineal gland was assayed in rats which were born and raised under diurnal lighting conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N Acetyltransferase activity in the pups raised under diurnal lighting showed a rhythmic pattern, with high enzyme activity during the dark period. The pups raised in continuous darkness also showed a rhythmic pattern, the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr in 7 wk old pups; the rhythmic phase of N acetyltransferase began in the evening in the 12 day old pups and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every wk. The pups raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic phase was delayed by 3 hr every wk. When the mother rats were coupled in darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after the pups were born, their pups again showed a rhythmic pattern. These observations indicate that the biological clock for N acetyltransferase is generated independently of environmental lighting. When mothers were coupled under reversed lighting conditions and transferred into darkness or light, the rhythmic pattern in their pups was inverted 180° from that of pups born of diurnal mothers. When the pups were raised in darkness, the rhythmic phase of N acetyltransferase in the pups was similar to that of their mothers. It is suggested that in the absence of light darkness cycle, the mother rat sets the rhythm of the pups to synchronize with her own rhythm. When pups were reared by a foster mother, with a different rhythmic pattern from that of their original mother, the rhythmic phase in the pups was closer to that of the original mother, suggesting that the original mother plays the predominant role in setting the rhythm of the pups.

N2  - Spectral analysis of the EEG using fast Fourier transform in preterm and full term infants revealed significant maturational changes in all three stages of sleep. In quiet sleep full term infants differed from preterm babies (<37 weeks gestation) by significantly higher power in delta and theta frequencies (1.6-7.5 Hz). During indeterminate sleep the slowest frequencies (0.1-1.5 Hz) showed significantly less power, while power of faster frequencies (1.6-7.5 Hz) was significantly greater in full term infants rapid eye movement (REM) sleep differed in slowest (0.1-1.5 Hz) and fastest (17.5-25 Hz) frequency band, showing significantly lower power in the former and significantly higher in the latter in full term infants. From the diagnostic point of view the most important maturational EEG changes were found by computing the REM sleep quiet frequency spectrum difference. This showed significantly higher power during quiet sleep over a wide range of frequencies (0.1-12.5 Hz) in full term infants, while preterm infants had an almost identical spectrum during these two stages of sleep with a significant intensity drop only in theta2 (5.6-7.5 Hz) during REM sleep. Since these differences can be readily identified in the individual infant it is suggested that the assessment of the EEG may be useful for the early detection of delays in maturation.

N2  - A methodological study of healthy subjects was conducted to investigate factors influencing plasma free tryptophan and platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. The following changes were found during the menstrual cycle: free tryptophan was lower during the 'ovulatory' phase than during the 'premenstrual' phase, MAO activity was 20% lower during the 'premenstrual' phase as compared with the 'neutral' phase (days: menses -24 to -1). During pregnancy MAO activity was also lower than the values found six weeks postpartum. MAO activity in women was significantly higher than in men and exhibited greater variability. A circadian rhythm for free tryptophan was observed (minimum at midday, maximum at midnight). No diurnal variation in MAO activity could be established. Preliminary data from untreated endogenous depressive patients showed no difference in free tryptophan concentrations at 8 a.m. or 4 p.m. from control values.

N2  - Under baseline conditions of recumbency and normal sodium intake there was a small significant hyperaldosteronism evident from elevated plasma concentration and aldosterone excretion in presence of suppressed metabolic clearance rate (MCR) in benign essential hypertension (BEH). BEH patients, particularly those with hyperkinetic circulation often excreted more oxo conjugate and present greater than normal response in plasma aldosterone to upright posture. Upright posture decreased aldosterone MCR in controls, but effect was negligible in BEH. In BEH, decreased MCR and excretion of hepatic metabolite (tetrahydroaldosterone) may be due to impaired hepatic extraction related to increased aldosterone binding to a transcortin like plasma fraction (TLPF). Concomitant fluctuations of TLPF and plasma concentration during circadian rhythm, the menstrual cycle and pregnancy suggest a possible role of TLPF in aldosterone distribution and dynamics. Recumbent BEH patients had increased plasma aldosterone around midnight. BEH patients showed hyperresponsiveness to ACTH infusion in plasma aldosterone with simultaneous sharp decrease of TLPF binding, while aldosterone MCR increased significantly and the ratio of the urinary and hepatic metabolites of aldosterone changed. Changes in binding degree probably contribute to perturbated aldosterone metabolism in BEH. In the majority of BEH patients with normal or low plasma renin activity 18 hydroxydeoxycorticosterone secretion is increased. ACTH stimulation or dexamethasone suppression of 18 hydroxydeoxycorticosterone is comparable in controls and patients. This hormone circulates in unbound form.

N2  - A boy born after 25 weeks' gestation is presented. During the first trimester, the mother had experimented with 'uppers and downers', LSD, took 'a lot of' Doriden for sleep and repeatedly smoked cannabis to 'highs'. She spotted from the third month on and before delivery had early toxemia and one episode of syncope. At birth the child weighed 1109 gm. He was exchange transfused, had RDS and was kept in the hospital for 3 1/2 months. His developmental milestones have been delayed, such as walking at 26 months, talking at 36 months. He is below the 3rd percentile in height and weight. He has poor muscle mass and sparse subcutaneous fat. His head is narrow. The eyes have an antimongoloid slant and epicanthus. There is slight left lid ptosis. The bridge of his nose is rather prominent. The palate is higharched but without tooth crowding. The ears are large and low set. There is a blowing systolic murmur at the left sternal border. The hands have slender tapering fingers and transverse palmar creases (not true simian lines). The testicles were palpated in the inguinal canals. The IQ was 55 at 3 7/12 years. Hypertonia, micrognathia, hypospadias and seizures were absent. The cytogenetic report was 46,XY,-21,+ small metacentric. Cytogenetic study of the family showed normal karyotypes of mother (46,XX), father (46,XY) and older sister (46,XX). The mother denied drug experimentation during her first pregnancy.

N2  - Etomidate, R (+) ethyl 1 (1 phenylethyl) 1H imidazole 5 carboxylate was found to be a potent, short acting and safe hypnotic, when given intravenously in single doses to mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs. In rats of different body weights (50, 100, 200 and 300 g) two injection rates were used (2 sec and 2 min). By rapid iv injection in rats of 200 g, etomidate (ED50 = 0.57 mg/kg) is about 6 times more potent than methohexital (ED50 = 3.51 mg/kg) and 25 times more potent than propanidid and thiopental (ED50's = 13.4 mg/kg). The safety margin (LD50/ED50) in these rats is 26.0 for etomidate, 9.5 for methohexital, 6.7 for propanidid and 4.6 for thiopental. Potency and toxicity of ectomidate slightly increase with increasing injection rates without affecting the safety margin. The duration of hypnosis with etomidate is dose dependent and the safety margin will therefore be widened when sleep of short duration is aimed at. Recovery after etomidate is very rapid. With lower body weights, higher doses in mg/kg are required for inducing hypnosis of comparable duration. No systematic differences were found after etomidate injection in incidence and duration of hypnosis nor in mortality between animals of different sex. Electrocardiogram, blood pressure, hematologic and biochemical analysis, urinalysis and histopathology did not reveal any drug related adverse effect after daily injection of etomidate for 3 wk in rats (highest dose 5.0 mg/kg) and 2 wk in dogs (highest dose 1.50 mg/kg). No tolerance was observed after repeated administration. Etomidate is devoid of any teratogenic effect in rats (highest dose: 5.0 mg/kg daily from day 6 through day 15 of pregnancy), and in New Zealand white rabbits (highest dose: 4.5 mg/kg daily from day 6 through day 18 of pregnancy). The hypnotic effects of etomidate at very low dose levels in different laboratory animals are compared with the effects obtained in human subjects, in which successful induction of anesthesia was obtained without producing any release of histamine and with only minimal effects on cardiovascular and respiratory functions.

N2  - Chronic fetal lamb preparations with tracheal pressure cannulae and electromagnetic flow meters have demonstrated that fetal breathing movements do exist and are present from early in gestation and thus prepare the fetus for the respiratory work necessary to sustain life after birth. This breathing activity is associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as demonstrated by simultaneous fetal electrocorticogram, and the amount of time spent in breathing activity demonstrates a diurnal variation being minimal in the early morning hours and maximal during early evening. Hypercapnia significantly increases the amount of breathing activity while it is minimized or abolished by fetal stresses such as hypoxia, acidosis and hypoglycemia. Breathing movements are also significantly reduced a few days prior to the onset of labor. Noninvasive measurement of fetal breathing became possible through the use of an A scan ultrasound transducer which recorded the amplitude and frequency of chest wall movement. Confirmation that the signal obtained represented respiratory activity was demonstrated in chronic sheep preparations with simultaneous tracheal pressure and flow recordings. The application of this technique to 200 antenatal patients near term revealed that breathing activity normally occurred between 55 and 90% of the recording period with a frequency of 30 to 70 breaths per min. Ten patients, however, demonstrated absent respiratory activity or irregular gasping movements and these resulted in intrauterine death within 24 to 72 hr and delivered stillborn severely growth retarded fetuses. Fifteen other patients with reduced respiratory activity or gasping manifested fetal asphyxia during subsequent labor and delivery. Preliminary results of fetal breathing monitoring in labor indicates that the presence of breathing activity indicates fetal well being as it disappears early in distressed fetuses. The conversion from episodic breathing in utero to regular sustained respiration postnatally is postulated to result from the rise in PAO2 from 25 mm of mercury to 60 mm of mercury in the extrauterine environment.

N2  - The diurnal variation of unconjugated estriol concentration was investigated in 8 normal patients between the 34th and 41th wk of gestation. Every 2 hr, blood samples were taken. Serum estriol was determined by a recently developed radioimmunologic method. A circadian rhythm of serum unconjugated estriol was observed with the lowest estriol values at 08.00 hr in the morning and the highest at 20.00 hr at night. During this time, estriol increased by an average of 31%.

N2  - A series of 240 patients admitted for termination of middle trimester pregnancy received prostaglandin F2α by intraamniotic injection at various times of the day. It was shown that the response (in terms of induction abortion interval, total dose of PGF2α required and duration of hospitalization) was significantly influenced by the time of injection and that for each of these parameters there was a statistically circadian or 24 hr rhythm. The optimal response was obtained following infusion of PGF2α at 1800 hr. Observations on additional groups of patients indicated that this response rhythm was disturbed by bed rest during the day prior to PGF2α administration. The induction abortion interval was also prolonged by concomitant use of d propoxyphene for analgesia and by twin pregnancies. In addition to the circadian rhythm of response related to the time of administration of PGF2α there was a circadian rhythm in the hourly incidence of abortion, the peak incidence being recorded at about 0800 hr. The temporal relation of the observed periodicity in response to the intraamniotic administration of PGF2α to circadian fluctuations in plasma steroid levels is discussed. It is suggested that a chronotherapeutic approach to the induction of abortion or labor with prostaglandins may be advantageous.

N2  - During the 9 mth of pregnancy, a woman passes through her usual wide range of consciousness states. She sleeps, wakes, laughs, cries, has orgasms, becomes intoxicated, works, plays, continues her life as a person. But, as repeated studies have shown, she is undergoing profound physiological and psychological changes. Some women change more than others, but all enter into the special state to one degree or another. Characteristically, they become more intensely emotional than usual and rapidly swing from one mood to another, a phenomena known as emotional lability. They are unusually prone to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and crying spells. She may become obsessed with dreams and symbols, become suddenly superstitious, feel extraordinarily vulnerable, or become phobic to cars, to small spaces, or to strangers. Pregnancy is not an 'altered state of consciousness' only because of altered chemical balance, it is also a special state because of the content of the pregnant consciousness.

The mean half life of HPL after delivery of normal infants determined in 5 patients was found to be 14.6 min (range 13.2-16.4 min). A close correlation was found between serum HPL and serum progesterone (r = 0.75). No circadian rhythm was found.

N2  - Analysis of data from a series of 240 prostaglandin (PG) F2a induced terminations of pregnancy has indicated that there are circadian rhythms in the induction abortion interval, the total dose of PGF2a required to produce abortion, the duration of hospitalization and in the distribution of abortions along the 24 hr scale. The response rhythm was disturbed by bed rest during the day and by withholding the evening meal prior to PGF2α administration. The induction abortion interval was also prolonged in ditokous pregnancies and with the use of d propoxyphene for analgesia. The temporal relationship of circadian variations in peripheral plasma steroid to the observed periodicity in response to the intraamniotic administration of PGF2a is discussed. Both the periodicity in spontaneous delivery at term and PGF2a induced abortion may be related to circadian fluctations in steroid metabolism.

N2  - The effects of the ovarian hormones and of the gonadotrophic hormones of the pituitary hypophysis upon organization of sleep and of wakefulness in women are less precise than has been suggested. According to the authors' results, sleep in a woman with normal menses is not influenced by the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy is accompanied by a decrease in deep slow sleep and a slight increase in fast sleep during the last trimester. These changes do not occur simultaneously and the alterations of sleep during the first trimester are derived from subjective data; estrogens which are secreted in very increased proportions are likely to have an effect of lightening deep slow sleep. An interesting approach to understanding the effect of sex hormones on sleep would seem to be present in pathological conditions such as certain cases of amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea associated with hypersomnia during which a hypothalamic dysfunction is probable.

N2  - 17 male rats were studied who had recovered from severe neonatal jaundice induced by giving the mother phenylhydrazine during pregnancy. The mean duration of paradoxical sleep was reduced in these animals by comparison with 17 controls. This observation is correlated with the reduced ability of such experimental rats to learn active avoidance tests, and compared with data showing that paradoxical sleep tends to be reduced in mentally retarded children and adults.

N2  - Because of the authors' previous findings that pregnanolone and related metabolites of progesterone inhibit drug demethylation and hydroxylation reactions in vitro, a variety of other steroids and naturally occurring substances were tested for inhibition of the O demethylation of p nitroanisole by 9,000 g hepatic supernatants from adult male rats. Of some 58 steroids tested, none was more potent than pregnanolone. Other potent inhibitors, with the exception of norethindrone, had a similar structure (C21) with hydroxyl or keto groups at C3 and C20. Inhibitory activity was not related to the endocrine activity of the steroid. Inhibition by a group of 11 steroids was generally greater with 9,000 g supernatants from female rats, and was uniformly increased with supernatants from pregnant rats. By 10 days after delivery, inhibition returned to levels equivalent to those found with supernatants from virgin females. Cholesterol and related compounds, fatty acids and esters, ceramides, gangliosides, phosphatidyl inositol and other natural fatty acid conjugates and a variety of indoles and lipids had no inhibitory activity. Pregnanolone administration increased the duration of hexobarbital and of barbital induced sleep in rats, apparently due to an additive sedative effect. However, microsomes prepared from these animals exhibited lesser rates of demethylation, with kinetics compatible with uncompetitive inhibition. These results indicate that progesterone, its metabolites and structurally similar steroids are potent inhibitors of microsomal drug metabolism. Such inhibition may be responsible in part for the low rates of drug metabolism seen in the female during pregnancy, and in the neonate.

N2  - The authors' method for the assay of total plasma estriol in human pregnancy was scaled down and modified to accommodate 0.2 ml samples. The method was applied to the evaluation of diurnal rhythms in 7 subjects who were studied at 5 regular intervals on 2 successive days. Three subjects exhibited little fluctuation over the 48 hr period. The other 4 subjects showed occasional wide fluctuations but in no case did the pattern repeat on the second day. The results contradict 2 previous studies, one emanating from the authors' laboratory, in which circadian rhythms were reported.

N2  - A statistically significant relationship exists between psychological ill health in the past, during pregnancy and at the time of admission of distressed babies to an infant care hospital. In this study 77 of 104 mothers showed such a relationship. Past and present physical ill health and that during pregnancy was not statistically significant. The infant developmental distress syndrome is characterised by feeding difficulties and vomiting, excessive crying, crossness and hyper responsivity, and sleep disturbances. Response to hospitalisation and non specific therapy rapidly reverses the syndrome which clinically can be recognised by the presentation of the distressed infant in association with the mother's psychological ill health as defined. The vulnerability of the mother, particularly of those who have premature infants, and the unmarried who intend to keep their babies is discussed, together with the potential for primary prevention of further developmental pathology.

N2  - The criteria for a test of placental function are as follows: The material measured should occur only in pregnancy, with the maternal contribution limited to clearance and excretion. The levels should not show gross variation from day to day, and there should be no circadian rhythm. The half life should be sufficiently short that only a brief time elapses between a fall in synthesis and a decrease in levels. The technique of measurement should be precise, should be applicable to large numbers of samples, and should be rapid so that the results are available to the clinician within hours rather than days. Of these criteria, the first 3 are to a large extent beyond the control of the investigator. Present tests, including the measurement of the hormone products discussed here, all have some disadvantages; for instance, they cannot be measured directly in the fetoplacental unit. The most important practical criterion is the fourth, that measurement should be easy, rapid, and precise, and that it should be possible to process large numbers of samples. The latter will ensure that studies of adequate size can be performed, and thus that the place of the test can be scientifically evaluated. It is also essential if a large increase in clinical application is envisaged. For the future, it is certain that the approach to placental function tests will be very different in the 1980's from that which obtains at the present time. First, all tests are likely to be performed on blood samples; the disadvantages of urine collection are such that it is bound to be replaced. Secondly, all tests for hormone products will be performed by radioimmunoassay; unless this technique is replaced by a better one, it offers immense advantages in terms of both precision and the ability to process large numbers. Thirdly, every unit will have available a spectrum of tests: for instance, oestriol as a test of fetus and placenta together; human placental lactogen as a test of the placenta alone; and a specific fetal product such as alphafetoprotein, as a test of the fetus alone. Fourthly, and most important, these tests will not be confined to those patients who have obvious clinical abnormalities, but rather, they will be extended to all patients. The collection of a blood sample for biochemical determinations will become as routine a part of an antenatal visit as is the taking of blood pressure.

N2  - Of 1,690 infants born after 38 completed wk of gestation and examined at birth, 163 who showed moderate to severe subcutaneous wasting were selected for prospective study. A number of adverse effects were recorded in the neonatal period, namely, increased perinatal mortality, birth asphyxia, abnormal central nervous system signs and congenital abnormalities. Many of these effects increased as the severity of the wasting increased. When compared with matched controls there was a significantly increased incidence of hospital admissions and sleep disorders during the first yr of life and of low social quotients at the one yr examination, the highest proportions occurring in the severely wasted group.

N2  - In this prospective study on epilepsy over a period of 2 yr involving 631 subjects, 65% were residents of Bangalore city. Major epilepsy accounted for 46% of all types of attacks, while temporal lobe epilepsy and/or temporal lobe epilepsy becoming generalised came next with 34%. Motor and/or motor epilepsy becoming generalised accounted for only 7%. Absence and myoclonus were very rare. There was a significant direct relationship between pregnancy order and epilepsy. There was a significantly higher incidence of past febrile convulsions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, restricted or becoming generalised, than in other types. Sleep sensitive attacks were significantly more frequent in major epilepsy than in other types. Hot water epilepsy, which accounted for 9% of all cases, was more often temporal lobe in type. Unequivocal EEG confirmation of epilepsy from a single interictal resting record was seen in one third of patients with major epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy restricted or becoming generalised, under three fourths of patients with absence and myoclonus and in about one eighth of patients with other focal epilepsies, restricted or becoming generalised. Thus the diagnostic value of a single resting EEG in epilepsy is limited.

N2  - The problem of the cutaneous pain threshold induced by thermal stimuli is considered from a biophysical point of view. A new method for the determination of the cutaneous pain threshold is described. Research has been carried out with this method on rhythmic changes of the cutaneous pain threshold. It was observed that a circadian rhythm is present both in men and in women. A circatrigintan rhythm is present: in fertile women, in which it coincides with the menstrual cycle; in women in pregnancy; in women in menopause; in young men; in men over 55 yr of age. During the administration of oral contraceptives the circatrigintan rhythm is no more evident in the fertile women, but persists, instead, in women in menopause.

N2  - Early diagnosis and operative treatment are important to achieve a lasting disappearance of the complaints and symptoms of chronic compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is surrounded by stiff tissue, namely bone and ligament, carpi transversum and is very narrow. The contents are, apart from the median nerve, composed of flexor tendons and even under normal conditions the nerve sustains distinct stress during extreme flexion and extension. The patient is awakened after several hours of sleep by tormenting paraesthesiae in the first 3 fingers, or in the whole hand. Shaking of the hand and massage relieve the symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms exist for years, before neurologic symptoms develop, as a disturbance of sensation and atrophy of the thenar muscles. Women are more often affected than men. The diagnosis is clear when the syndrome is complete. Without objective signs one can provoke the typical symptoms by extreme flexion of the wrist during 1-2 min and by tying up the upper arm. Pain syndromes from other causes must be excluded, for instance: lower cervical syndrome, compression of the lower part of the brachial plexus, arthritis and syringomyelia with atrophy of the thenar musculature. By bipolar stimulation a prolonged conducting time of the nerve is found. The etiology includes hormonal changes (pregnancy), climacteric, acromegaly, hypothyroidism), rheumatic changes, tendovaginitis, trauma, and ganglion. Conservative treatment by cortisone injection in the carpal tunnel is given. When conservative measures fail operative treatment is indicated. The median nerve is decompressed under general anesthesia and local hemostasis. Via a lazy S incision the transverse ligament is incised along its ulnar border and partly excised. Often the compression is mostly in the distal part of the tunnel. In a 4 yr period the diagnosis was made in 96 cases. Thirty seven patients were operated on (42 hands). Thirty five had very painful paraesthesia mostly limited to the area of the median nerve and 29 hands showed more or less atrophy of the thenar musculature. The operative results were good in 30 patients (35 hands) (complete disappearance of the symptoms to very satisfactory). Four cases showed only slight improvement and 3 cases no improvement. In 35 hands (30 patients) there was definite improvement of sensation, of which 15 showed complete cure.

N2  - It has been consistently found that when normal adults go to sleep they release a large quantity of growth hormone from the pituitary into the plasma. Over a 24 hour period, very little other growth hormone is detectable in plasma with the exception of a few episodes of release at irregular intervals during waking. If an individual does not fall asleep there will be no release of growth hormone. When release occurs it is associated with the nonREM portions of the sleep waking cycle, and indeed appears to be related to the deeper phases of slow wave sleep, especially stages 3 and 4. There is a general night to night consistency in this release in any given subject with respect to number of release episodes and magnitude of release. There is, however, considerable variability from subject to subject. Sleep related release of growth hormone has been shown to occur in children after early infancy. It occurs in both men and women, although there is some variation according to sex in that women seem to have less consistent release from night to night. There appears to be a decreasing release with age so that by middle aged persons the amount of hormones secreted in sleep appears to be less than in younger adults. The 24 hour pattern of prolactin secretion is that of secretion of prolactin in numerous small episodes during the daytime. When sleep occurs there is a marked release of the hormone and a marked augmentation of plasma concentrations as sleep progresses with highest concentrations reached at the end of sleep. In distinction from growth hormone, there does not appear to be a sleep stage relationship. In similarity to growth hormone, when sleep does not occur the augmentation of release of prolactin does not occur, indicating that this augmentation of release is totally dependent on the occurrence of sleep. With both prolactin and growth hormone, sleep reversal and nap studies have shown that release will occur in sleep during daytime hours. Since the study of the 24 hour patterns of prolactin release is so recent, we do not know as yet the pattern of release in pregnancy or the differences between the sexes or with aging.

N2  - The concentration of prolactin in serum after estrogen and progesterone injection into spayed rats was measured by radioimmunoassay. After a single injection of 5 μg estradiol benzoate (OB) into long term ovariectomized rats, serum prolactin concentrations showed a circadian rhythm with high levels in the afternoon and almost no changes in the morning. Peaks of prolactin occurred 2, 3 and 4 days after the injection. Below a dose of 1 μg OB, the response was dose dependent, but the response was then maximal. In spayed rats primed with 5 μg OB, the injection of 2 mg progesterone 2, 3 or 4 days later resulted in a significant increase in serum prolactin. This response, in contrast to that of estrogen, occurred in the morning and in the evening and was found to be dose dependent. The rise in serum prolactin after injection of 1 mg progesterone also showed a close relationship to the priming dose of OB. Progesterone had no effect in spayed, untreated animals. Maximal levels of prolactin were attained 3 to 4 hr after the s.c. injection of progesterone. The release of prolactin which can be induced either by OB or by progesterone was blocked by the administration of progesterone injected 1 day before the expected release would occur. These results indicate that progesterone exerts both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on prolactin secretion. Male rats were found to be less sensitive to the ovarian steroid treatment. It is suggested that estrogen could be responsible for the rise in prolactin observed at proestrus and progesterone for the increase in prolactin in pseudopregnancy and pregnancy.

N2  - No systematic changes in the percentage of paradoxical sleep were found either over pregnancy or over the menstrual cycle, whether ovulatory or not. On the other hand, the number of rapid eye movements increased significantly in the latter half of pregnancy and of the ovulatory menstrual cycles. This variation was not found in nonovulatory menstrual cycles. The rapid eye movement of paradoxical sleep would therefore seem to be a parameter which can reflect, though in a nonspecific way, the activation of the CNS endocrine system occurring during pregnancy and during the menstrual cycle.

N2  - Plasma levels of human placental lactogen (HPL) in normal pregnancy from the 22nd week until delivery were measured with a rapid radioimmunoassay. The HPL concentration in plasma rose steadily up to the 37th week and thereafter gradually decreased until delivery. Individual women followed during the latter part of pregnancy showed a characteristic pattern with very small deviations from their original relative level within the normal range. Significant fluctuations in HPL levels were noted during a 24 hr period of sampling and during shorter periods. No systematic circadian variation was observed. The variations showed no clear relation to sleep, meals or light exercise. During spontaneous and induced labor significant FLUCTUATIONS IN HPL concentrations occurred but these were of the same magnitude as those during the latter part of normal pregnancy; no correlation between HPL levels and uterine contraction and relaxation was found. Strenuous physical exercise during the last month of pregnancy sufficient to affect the fetal heart rate did not influence the HPL levels.

N2  - Pregnant and postpartum women were presented with auditory stimuli, of from 10 to 70 decibels, of baby's cries, a woman's voice saying 'baby is crying' and a speech noise during stage 2, stage REM and slowwave stages of sleep. The subjects were awakened with increasing difficulty in the above given order of stages, and with increasing facility going from speech noise to human voice to baby's cry, in that order. There was an overall lowering of awakening threshold after delivery. All the differences found were statistically significant, except that the difference between the voice saying 'baby is crying' and the tape recorded baby's cry was not significant. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

N2  - The ontogenesis of the states of sleep in guinea pig foetus was studied by polygraphic method. Long lasting records have been made in utero between the 40th and 64th day of gestation. The ECoG activation pattern of paradoxical sleep (PS) and wakefulness appear from the 40th day (0.6 of term); the slow wave sleep (SWS) appear about the 49th day (0.7 of term) and is characterized by cortical spindles. Between the 40th and the 47th day, cerebral maturation is accompanied by a progressive decrease of a discontinuous ECoG activity state. From 53 days (0.8 of term), the ECoG patterns of states of vigilance are similar to those of the newborn guinea pig. The percentage of time spent in PS is very high (80-90% at 48 days) before the SWS appearance. These observations prove the existence of a prenatal differentiation of the states of vigilance. The differentiation stages are similar to those observed after birth in immature newborn mammals. No relationship exists between the sleep of mother and foetus.

N2  - Early administration of the sedative and sympathicolytic hypotensive combination of small doses of barbituric acid and dihydroergotoxin is of decisive advantage in pre eclampsia. An attack of eclampsia can almost always be prevented in this way. The manifest attacks of eclampsia and status eclampticus are most reliably controlled with a rapidly acting, rapidly eliminated barbiturate, administered intravenously. Once the attack is under control, induced therapeutic sleep has a good chance of success. This treatment is described in detail and the pharmaceutical and obstetric aspects are discussed from the clinical and pharmacological points of view.

N2  - Foot and leg cramps are among the most frequent complaints presented by patients of both sexes, especially older persons. Similar cramping may occur in the thighs or in other skeletal muscles of the extremities and trunk. Foot and leg cramps usually occur after unusual exertion or during sleep. "Nocturnal leg cramps" may be of sufficient intensity to prevent sleep. "Pregnancy cramps" are particularly distressing. Effective treatment of foot and leg cramps requires an understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology and diagnostic techniques. Weight reduction and improved diet are essential. Among the useful supplementary medications are calcium lactate or gluconate, vitamin-mineral supplements, sympathetic blocking agents, vasodilators, ataraxics, muscle relaxants, quinine, hydrochloride, antihistamines, and nonmercurial diuretics. Improved foot care and correction of foot imbalance is usually required. Edema and venous insufficiency are improved by elastic support, by repeated foot elevation for massages, by manipulations and exercises and by the use of diuretics. There may be need for operations on the veins and for sclerotherapy. Patients with arterial insufficiency are often benefited by lumbar sympathetic blocks with long-acting anesthetics and intra-arterial injections with relaxants, vasodilators, thrombolytic enzymes and anticoagulants. Sympathectomy, angiography and reconstructive arterial operations are indicated in only a small proportion of patients with foot and leg cramps.
