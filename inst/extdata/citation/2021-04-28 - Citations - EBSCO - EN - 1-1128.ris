AB  - Background. Many women with perimenopausal insomnia (PMI) have sought alternative therapies such as acupuncture because of concerns about risks associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and/or psychotropic drugs. This systematic review aimed to clarify if acupuncture alone or combined with standard Western pharmacotherapy (HRT and/or psychotropic drugs) is more effective in ameliorating PMI in comparison to pharmacotherapy alone. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PMI treatment via acupuncture alone or combined with Western pharmacotherapy versus Western pharmacotherapy were searched for from eleven databases from inception to March 2020. Cochrane criteria were followed. Results. Fifteen studies involving 1410 women were analyzed. Meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture significantly reduced the global scores of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [MD = −2.38, 95% CI (−3.38, −1.37), p < 0.01] and Kupperman Index [MD = −5.95, 95% CI (−10.68, −1.21), p = 0.01], compared with hypnotics. Acupuncture combined with hypnotics was more effective than hypnotics alone in decreasing PSQI scores [MD = −3.13, 95% CI (−5.43, −0.83), p < 0.01]. Too few RCTs were available to investigate the clinical efficacy differences between acupuncture and HRT/psychotropic drugs other than hypnotics. Conclusions. Despite limited evidence, in comparison to hypnotics, acupuncture was associated with significant improvements in PMI, and reductions of other menopausal symptoms. This finding suggests that acupuncture may be a useful addition to treatment for PMI.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate factors associated with mental health quality of life (QOL), such as depressed mood, anxiety, poor memory and sleep, among midlife women according to the menopausal status.Material and Methods: Participants were 500 women aged 40-65 years. Data were collected using socio-demographic questionnaire, Women's Health Questionnaire (domains of depressed mood-DEP, anxiety-ANX, memory-MEM and sleep-SLE) and Short Form-36 (Mental Composite Score) for assessment of health-related QOL. Factors associated with poorer DEP, ANX, MEM and SLE were examined using adjusted linear regression models.Results: In premenopausal women, lower household monthly income (p = .046) was associated with higher level of DEP; higher body mass index (p = .045) was associated with higher ANX; having gynecological illnesses (p = .017) and menopause-related symptoms (p = .039) were associated with poorer MEM; being married (p = .036), drinking alcohol (p = .036) and having more physical activity (p = .041) was associated with better SLE. In postmenopausal women, worse DEP was more likely among women residing in city outskirts (p = .009), who are not married (p = .038) and with sedentary occupations (p = .049); lower education level (p = .030) was associated with more ANX; lower education level (p = .045) and having menopause-related symptoms (p = .044) were associated with poorer MEM; not engaging in regular recreation (p = .031) was associated with better SLE.Conclusions: To improve QOL, pre- and postmenopausal women should not only be supported in the management of menopause-specific symptoms. Women should also receive recommendations as to the behavioral and personal changes when approaching the midlife period.

AB  - Background: Psychological well-being (PWB) is predictive of future health and mortality. Midlife is a pivotal time in women's lives and may impact future PWB. This study, based on a longitudinal cohort of women, sought to identify how personal and social resources and modifiable behaviors at midlife relate to women's PWB in later life, and to determine if psychological resilience in later life moderates the impact of health problems on PWB. Materials and Methods: We assessed the association of midlife factors with PWB ∼9 years later in 1693 women from the multiracial/ethnic Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) cohort. PWB was a composite score with cognitive and affective components. Midlife factors included sociodemographics, health, menopause-related, and psychosocial factors collected over the course of midlife. Results: In a multivariable model, greater PWB at an older age was associated with the following at midlife: less financial strain, greater physical activity, not smoking, better physical functioning, and fewer sleep problems. More positive attitudes toward menopause and aging, less cynicism, greater optimism, less trait anxiety, greater spirituality, and greater resilience were also independently associated with better PWB. Chinese women reported lower PWB compared with whites. Later life resilience moderated the impact of sleep problems on PWB. Conclusions: Several modifiable factors at midlife are associated with better PWB in older women and highlight the importance of healthy behaviors such as physical activity and good sleep hygiene at midlife. Interventions to increase optimism, spirituality, and resilience are also worth exploring.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder. In women, the frequency of OSA increases substantially during and after the menopause, as does the prevalence of obesity in this reproductive life stage. This cross-sectional study uses data from the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO, 2007), and comprises a sample of 500 women aged 20–80 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the factors associated with OSA in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. All participants underwent polysomnography, and obesity was assessed using the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body mass index, neck and waist circumference, measured using standard methods. WHtR was the factor most associated with a significant increase in risk of OSA in premenopausal women. Waist circumference was the factor most associated with OSA in postmenopausal women, for all severities of the disease. Anthropometric factors presented a high rate of accuracy in the classification of women with OSA. The study found that different obesity-related anthropometric measures should be considered in the diagnosis of OSA, according to the woman's reproductive stage.

AB  - Objective. The KOSMOS study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, investigated the effects and safety of kamishoyosan (TJ-24), a traditional Japanese medicine, in the treatment of climacteric disorder. Methods. Japanese women with climacteric disorder were administered a placebo during a 4-week run-in period, after which they were classified as placebo responders (R group) if their score on the modified Questionnaire for the Assessment of Climacteric Symptoms in Japanese Women (m-QACS) with excitability and irritability as the primary outcome improved by ≥ 3 points and as placebo nonresponders (NR group) otherwise. Members of the NR group were randomly allocated to receive either TJ-24 or placebo. After 12 weeks, their m-QACS scores, anxiety and depression, sleep, and overall quality of life (QOL) were compared. Results. The TJ-24 and placebo arms in the NR group included 20 patients each. The change in the m-QACS scores of members of the NR group for excitability and irritability at 12 weeks versus baseline was –3.1 ± 1.7 in the TJ-24 arm, a significant decrease, but compared with –2.7 ± 2.2 in the placebo arm, no significant difference was between two arms. However, the proportion of participants whose score improved by ≥3 points was significantly higher in the TJ-24 arm. In the subgroup analysis of premenopausal women, the changes in the score for excitability and irritability were significantly larger in the TJ-24 arm. The incidence of adverse drug reactions or adverse events did not differ between the two arms, and no serious events were reported. Conclusion. Although no significant difference was identified for the primary outcome, a significantly higher proportion of patients who received TJ-24 displayed improvement. Its high level of safety and effects on excitability and irritability in premenopausal women suggest that TJ-24 may be a useful treatment.

AB  - "Tongmai Tiaoshen" practices are effective for treating psychophysiological disorders. Herein, we report the treatment of a post-menopausal female patient with chronic insomnia using "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy. A 62-year-old woman who had chronic insomnia due to deficiency of heart and spleen accompanied by anxiety and depression for 30 years was treated with "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy for six weeks. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores were recorded before and after treatment to evaluate treatment efficacy. Compared with the baseline, PSQI, HDRS, and SAS scores were significantly lower after application of the abdominal massage therapy. The "Tongmai Tiaoshen" abdominal massage therapy may alleviate the symptoms of chronic insomnia caused by deficiency of heart and spleen, thus improving the quality of sleep and mitigating the state of anxiety and depression. • Post-menopausal women with poor sleep should be assessed for chronic insomnia. • Chronic insomnia or poor sleep lasting more than 3 months can affect life quality. • Abdominal massage therapy may be effective for insomnia in post-menopausal women. • Abdominal massage therapy efficacy should be tested in more insomnia patients.

AB  - Objective: To identify groups of women who share levels and patterns of change in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), self-reported sleep maintenance problems, and frequent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) up to 10 years before and after their final menstrual period and to evaluate their premenopausal characteristics.Method: Group-based multi-trajectory modeling grouped 1,407 women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation who had an observed natural menopause and did not use hormone therapy, based on repeated measures of FSH, sleep maintenance problems, and frequent VMS relative to final menstrual period. Multivariable analyses assessed race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, and depressive symptoms as predictors of group membership.Results: Women formed five distinct groups: (1) low symptoms (low VMS/sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 552; 39.2%); (2) moderate VMS and sleep problems/low FSH rise (N = 169; 12.0%); (3) dominant sleep problems (lower VMS/high sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 203; 14.4%); (4) dominant VMS (high VMS/lower sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 297; 21.1%)); and (5) high symptoms (high VMS/high sleep problems)/intermediate FSH rise (N = 186; 13.2%)). Multivariate analyses showed that race/ethnicity, premenopausal body mass index and depressive symptoms, and increasing depressive symptoms during the early phase of the transition predicted group membership.Conclusions: Women can be classified based on shared levels and patterns of FSH, sleep maintenance problems, and frequent VMS across the menopause transition. Either VMS or sleep maintenance problems can be dominant in the face of high FSH. Experiencing one menopause-related symptom or hormone profile does not automatically imply that another is also being experienced.

AB  - Importance: Although previous meta-analyses mainly focused on the effects of hormonal treatment against menopausal sleep disturbances, the therapeutic role of antidepressants has not been systematically addressed.Objective: To study the therapeutic benefit and safety of antidepressants in menopausal sleep disturbances.Evidence Review: Randomized controlled trials assessing the therapeutic effects of antidepressants against menopausal sleep problems were identified from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct databases from inception to March 1, 2020. Studies that were clinical trials with placebo controls were included. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to a random effects model.Findings: Analysis of seven eligible randomized controlled trials including a total of 1,949 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women showed the effectiveness of serotonergic antidepressants against sleep disturbances despite the small effect size (Hedge  g = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.11-0.38). The efficacy remained significantly better than that of placebo for postmenopausal women (Hedge  g = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.04-0.45), participants with hot flashes (Hedge g = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.02-0.34), and those without diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Hedge g = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.06-0.40). There was no difference in therapeutic benefit between sedating and nonsedating serotonergic antidepressants. Besides, the dropout rate did not differ between antidepressant and placebo groups.Conclusions and Relevance: Our results showed that serotonergic antidepressants were effective against sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The efficacy remained significant for women without major depressive disorder. The dropout rates were also comparable between serotonergic antidepressants and placebo groups.

AB  - Importance: Menopause is associated with bothersome symptoms for many women, including mood changes, hot flushes, sleep problems, and fatigue. Progesterone is commonly prescribed in combination with estrogen therapy. Although monotherapy with progestins has been used as treatment of menopausal symptoms in women with contraindications to estrogens, the optimal route, and dosage of progestin monotherapy has not been established.Objective: To assess whether progestin as a standalone treatment is effective for treating vasomotor and mood symptoms associated with menopause.Evidence Review: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Embase databases from January 1980 to January 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated different forms of progestin for the treatment of vasomotor or mood symptoms associated with menopause.Findings: A systematic search of 892 studies identified seven RCTs involving a total of 601 patients. The available literature was heterogeneous in terms of formulation and dose of progesterone; administration ranged from 5 to 60 mg of transdermal progesterone, 10 to 20 mg oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone. Duration of treatment also differed between studies, ranging from 21 days to 12 months (median: 12 wks). Three of seven RCTs reported that progestin therapy led to an improvement of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in postmenopausal women. The largest study administering oral progestin using 300 mg micronized progesterone reported a 58.9% improvement in VMS (vs 23.5% in placebo group, n = 133), whereas the largest study using transdermal progesterone reported no improvement (n = 230). No study reported an improvement of mood symptoms. Side effects, such as headaches and vaginal bleeding, were significant in five of seven RCTs and led to discontinuation of treatment in 6% to 21% of patients.Conclusions and Relevance: A beneficial effect was reported in some trials with the transdermal route at longer duration and with oral treatment at higher doses for VMS for progesterone-only therapy. This report may help to inform future studies of progestin-only therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Background: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as adjuvant therapy after breast cancer (BC) surgery have demonstrated to reduce the risk of disease recurrence, to lower the risk of contralateral BC, and to improve survival when compared to tamoxifen in patients with limited-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) BC. However, AIs are associated with adverse events that can have a significant impact on patient quality of life (QoL). Aim: This study aimed to identify profiles of psychological symptoms and QoL in HR+ BC patients undergoing AI therapy. Method: Data were collected with questionnaires administered at three time points: AI initiation (t0); 3 months after AI initiation (t1); and 6 months after AI initiation (t2). The FACT-G, FACT-B, and FACT-ES questionnaires were used to assess QoL; psychological symptoms were assessed using the SCL-90-R. Results: 43 women were enrolled in the study (t0), and 37 completed the t1 evaluation and 29 the t2 evaluation. We found (1) a progressive decrease over time in FACT-G and FACT-ES scores, in particular in the Physical, Emotional, and Endocrine subscales, and an increase in the SOM (somatization) subscale of the SCL-90-R; (2) the presence of 4 clusters related to different psychological symptoms and QoL evolution over time; (3) that patients belonging to the cluster characterized by worsening symptoms and QoL during time differed from the others in the Emotional subscale of the FACT-B and in the GSI (Global Score), OCD (obsessive-compulsive), DEP (depression), ANX (anxiety), and SLP (sleep disorders) dimensions of the SCL-90-R and had significantly higher BMI levels; and (4) that 3 items from the SCL-90-R and 2 items from FACT Emotional Well-Being subscale were predictive of the "worst" cluster. Conclusions: Although larger studies are needed to confirm these results, our data open up new ways of investigation into the effects of AIs on QoL in HR+ BC patients.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to compare next-morning responses of RMR and appetite to pre-sleep consumption of casein protein (CP) in pre- and postmenopausal women. The study was a randomised, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Seven sedentary premenopausal (age: 19·9 (sd 1·2) years; BMI: 23·1 (sd 2·6) kg/m2) and seven sedentary postmenopausal (age: 56·4 (sd 4·9) years; BMI: 26·3 (sd 3·5) kg/m2) women participated. During visit one, anthropometrics and body composition were measured. Following visit one, subjects consumed either CP (25 g) or placebo (PL) ≥2 h after their last meal and ≤30 min prior to sleep on the night before visits two and three. Visits two and three occurred ≥1 week after visit one and were 48 h apart. During visits two and three, RMR (VO2), RER and appetite were measured via indirect calorimetry and visual analogue scale, respectively. Anthropometrics and body composition were analysed by one-way ANOVA. RMR and measures of appetite were analysed using a 2 × 2 (menopause status × CP/PL) repeated-measures ANOVA. Significance was accepted at P ≤ 0·05. RMR was significantly lower in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women under both conditions (P = 0·003). When consumed pre-sleep CP did not alter RMR, RER or appetite compared with PL when assessed next morning in pre- and postmenopausal women. These data contribute to growing evidence that pre-sleep consumption of protein is not harmful to next-morning metabolism or appetite. In addition, these data demonstrate that menopause may not alter next-morning RMR, RER or appetite after pre-sleep consumption of CP.

AB  - Background. Insomnia occurs in more than half of menopausal women. These disorders can contribute to a change in the prooxidant-antioxidant balance, causing the damage to structural cellular elements. Currently, there is a lack of research on this issue. Aim. To carry out a comparative analysis of the level of advanced oxidation protein products in in peri- and postmenopausal women with insomnia. Materials and methods. The study included peri- (n = 30) and postmenopausal (n = 60) women, who were divided into 2 groups (control and main groups) in each menopausal phase after being questioned using special sleep questionnaires: Insomnia Severity Index; Epworth Sleepiness Scale; Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. The advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels was determined by immunoenzymatic assay using ImmunDiagnostik (German) kits on a BioTek EL×808 (USA) analyzer. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann – Whitney test. Results. Comparative analysis of the AOPP levels in control groups, depending on the menopausal periods, showed an increase in their levels in the postmenopausal period as compared to perimenopause (p < 0.05). When comparing the AOPP levels between the control and the main group in different menopausal periods, statistically significant differences were revealed only in the perimenopausal period towards a higher content in women with insomnia (p < 0.05). The presence of insomnia in postmenopausal women is accompanied by a higher AOPP levels as compared to the perimenopausal women (p < 0.05). Conclusion. The obtained results indicate the association between insomnia and oxidative proteins modification only in the perimenopausal period.
AB  - Обоснование. Инсомнические расстройства встречаются более чем у половины женщин в менопаузе. Данные нарушения могут способствовать изменению прооксидантно-антиоксидантного баланса, приводя к повреждению структурных клеточных элементов. В настоящее время отмечается дефицит исследований по данному вопросу. Цель исследования. Провести сравнительный анализ уровня продуктов окисления белков у женщин с инсомнией в перии постменопаузе. Материалы и методы. В исследовании приняли участие женщины пери(n = 30) и постменопаузального (n = 60) периодов, которые после анкетирования по специальным опросникам сна: тест для оценки субъективной тяжести инсомнии, шкала сонливости Эпворта, Мюнхенский тест, – были разделены на 2 группы в каждой фазе менопаузы (группа контроля и основная группа). Содержание продуктов окисления белков определяли иммуноферментным анализом с использованием наборов «ImmunDiagnostik» (Германия) на анализаторе «BioTek EL×808» (США). При анализе межгрупповых различий для независимых выборок использовали критерий Манна – Уитни. Результаты. Сравнительный анализ уровней продуктов окисления белков у женщин контрольных групп в зависимости от фазы климактерия показал увеличение их содержания в постменопаузальном периоде по сравнению с перименопаузой (p < 0,05). При сравнении показателя окислительной модификации белков между контролем и основной группой в разных фазах климактерия статистически значимые различия в его уровнях выявлены только в перименопаузальном периоде в сторону более высокого содержания у женщин с инсомнией (p < 0,05). Наличие инсомнии в постменопаузе сопровождается более высоким уровнем белкового окисления по сравнению с перименопаузальным периодом (p < 0,05). Заключение. Полученные результаты свидетельствуют об ассоциации инсомнии с окислительной модификацией белков только в перименопаузальном периоде.

AB  - Purpose: Personality traits have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. The objective of this study was to examine whether and to what extent the associations between personality traits (dispositional optimism, hostility, and negative emotional expressiveness) and risk of T2DM were mediated by health behaviors and obesity.Methods: Postmenopausal women (n = 110,992) aged 50-79 years without diabetes at enrollment in the Women's Health Initiative study (1993-1998) were followed up to 25 years. Incident diabetes was assessed via a validated self-report of physician-diagnosed diabetes treated with insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. Mediation analyses were performed using approaches under a counterfactual framework.Results: An inverse association of optimism with diabetes was significantly mediated by a factor primarily extracted from physical activity, diet quality, and sleep quality with a mediated proportion of 28%. Positive associations for hostility and negative emotional expressiveness were substantially mediated by a factor primarily composed of body mass index and waist circumference with mediated proportions of 32% and 44%, respectively.Conclusions: Our data revealed that less than half of the associations between personality traits and risk of T2DM were explained by indirect health behavior pathways. Women's personality traits should be considered in prevention of diabetes in addition to promoting health behaviors.

AB  - Aims: The current study aimed to examine feasibility of participant recruitment and retention rates for the Women's Wellness with Type 2 Diabetes program (WWDP), and to assess initial efficacy of the program in improving wellbeing outcomes.Methods: 70 midlife women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participated in a 12-week wellness-focused intervention, the WWDP. The WWDP involved a structured book (with participatory activities), an interactive website and nurse consultations. This study had an Australian and a UK arm. Analyses were conducted using chi-square, McNemar, paired t-test, and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests.Results: The attrition rate for the sample was 22.2%. Overall, significant improvement was observed in diabetes distress (DD), diabetes self-efficacy, weight, BMI, menopausal symptoms and sleep symptoms from baseline to program completion at 12 weeks. Australian participants were also more likely to meet fruit recommendation guidelines and had significant waist- and hip-circumference reductions.Conclusions: Good retention rates and initial efficacy findings indicated feasibility of the WWDP as a promising 12-week health and wellness program for women with T2DM. They also suggest incorporating a focus on self-efficacy and gendered information may be important in improving wellness and health outcomes related to distress and menopause.

AB  - Introduction: Limited literature concerning nocturia in early postmenopausal women is available. However, due to the lack of endogenous estrogen in these women, an increased prevalence of nocturia is expected.Material and Methods: This prospective observational trial recruited 210 'early' postmenopausal women consulting the Ghent University menopause clinic. Postmenopausal status was biochemically confirmed. Women completed 3 questionnaires: the ICI questionnaire on nocturia (ICIQ-N); 'Targeting the individual's Aetiology of Nocturia to Guide Outcomes' (TANGO) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Moreover, information concerning women's age, anthropometrics and lifestyle was collected. Nocturia was defined as two or more nocturnal voids.Results: Nocturia was reported in 24.8% (52/210) of the postmenopausal women. Bother increased with every nocturnal void. Women with two or more nighttime voids were found to have significantly increased prevalence of urgency compared with women with only one (p < 0.001; 38.5% versus 22.7%). Trouble initiating sleep at the start of the night and insomnia during the night were significantly different in women with a different nocturnal frequency (initiating sleep p = 0.09, no voids 34.4 %, 1 void 39.2 %, ≥ 2 voids 53.8 %; insomnia p < 0.001; no voids 1.6%, 1 void 22.7 %, ≥ 2 voids 53.8 %). In addition to bladder and sleep dysfunctions, waist circumference was a risk factor for nocturia (OR 1.04; 95 % CI: 1.01-1.08).Conclusion: Nocturia is an important problem in early postmenopausal women, affecting a quarter of the questioned women. Etiology of nocturia in this population is multifactorial as estrogen withdrawal is accompanied by bladder and sleep dysfunctions.

AB  - Objectives: To examine Chinese middle-aged women's health and wellbeing and the associated biosocial correlates.Study Design: This study used a cross-sectional design, including selected retrospectively collected information on the final menstrual period, drawn from the 2013 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Women aged 45 to 59 were selected.Main Outcome Measures: Factor analysis of 16 menopausal symptom ratings yielded four different and independent measures of pre-/peri-menopausal and early postmenopausal women's health. These were: negative mood (feel frustrated, sad, lonely, worried, bored, angry, tired and stressed), positive emotions (feel enthusiastic, content and happy), musculoskeletal pain (shoulder/neck pain, knee and other joint pain, and back pain), and sleep and memory problems (trouble sleeping and poor memory).Results: Menopausal status was positively associated with sleep and memory problems, whilst the number of years since the final menstrual period was positively associated with musculoskeletal pain. In contrast, lifestyle activities and social participation were linked to positive emotions. The association between selected biosocial factors and negative mood was not significant after controlling for other demographic and social background factors.Conclusions: Musculoskeletal health as well as sleep and memory problems are positively associated with menopausal biological factors amongst Chinese mid-life women. Maintaining active social engagement contributes to positive wellbeing among middle-aged women.

AB  - Objective: Following concerns about hormone therapy, postmenopausal women need alternative options to manage menopause-related symptoms and improve their well-being. A 14-week pilot study has shown that supplementation with resveratrol, a phytoestrogen with circulatory benefits, can improve aspects of well-being including chronic pain, which is a common complaint in postmenopausal women. We aimed to confirm these benefits in a larger, long-term study.Methods: The Resveratrol for Healthy Ageing in Women study, a 24-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover intervention trial of resveratrol supplementation (75 mg BID) was conducted in 125 healthy postmenopausal women to evaluate effects on cognitive performance (results published elsewhere). Aspects of well-being including pain perception, mood and depressive symptoms, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, and quality of life were assessed with questionnaires as secondary outcomes of the study. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to hypercapnia was measured as a surrogate marker of cerebrovascular function.Results: Resveratrol supplementation reduced composite pain score (P < 0.001), especially in overweight individuals; this was associated with improvements in cerebrovascular responsiveness to hypercapnia (R = -0.329, P = 0.014). Somatic menopausal symptoms (P = 0.024) and general well-being (P = 0.010) were also improved after resveratrol supplementation.Conclusions: These results confirm the pilot study finding that resveratrol supplementation can reduce chronic pain in age-related osteoarthritis and improve menopause-related quality of life in postmenopausal women. These improvements are sustained by supplementation for at least 12 months and are associated with enhancement of circulatory function.Clinical Trial Registration: ACTRN12616000679482p.

AB  - Objective: To assess differences in behavioral and psychological health characteristics in perimenopausal women delineated by income disparity.Methods: A hypothesis generating secondary data analysis was conducted in 33 women, using public health insurance enrollment as a proxy for income. Sociodemographic characteristics were assessed. Study outcomes included behavioral health characteristics: current cigarette smoking, substance abuse history, current exercise, obesity (BMI ≥30); psychological health characteristics, and sleep: depressed mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]). Group comparisons were assessed via the Student t test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test or Chi-square test, and multivariable models.Results: Forty-two percent (n = 14) were designated as income disparate, and sociodemographic characteristics were similar between groups; nearly half were Black/African American. More income disparate women reported current cigarette smoking [71% (10) vs 21%(4), P = 0.004] and substance abuse history [79%(11) vs 5%(1), P < 0.0001]. Fewer income disparate women reported current exercise [57%(8) vs 89%(17), P = 0.03] and more were obese [BMI ≥30; 50%(7) vs 11%(2), P = 0.01]. Income disparate women experienced significantly higher CES-D scores [13.5 (11.75, 23.75) vs 6 (0, 9), P < 0.0001], GAD-7 scores [5.5 (2, 8.75) vs 2 (0, 4), P = 0.04], and ISI scores [11 (5.55) vs 5 (4.36), P = 0.004].Conclusions: Findings from this preliminary analysis evidence inequities in behavioral, psychological, and sleep characteristics in perimenopausal women. Awareness of how the social determinants of health impact outcomes among vulnerable perimenopausal women is critical to developing equitable aging opportunities, including customized preventive health screenings and interventions that engage income disparate perimenopausal women.

AB  - Abstract: Women often complain of symptoms of fatigue and generalized aches and pains around menopause. Even though fibromyalgia is more prevalent in midlife women, not all women presenting with aches and pain and disrupted sleep meet diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. This Practice Pearl addresses the distinction between chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia and the management of fibromyalgia in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

AB  - Purpose: There is provocative, yet inconsistent, evidence that sleep deficiency may influence the development of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with sleep deficiency among postmenopausal women in the California Teachers Study (CTS).Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 2,856 invasive breast cancer cases and 38,649 cancer-free controls, nested within the CTS. Self-administered questionnaires were used to ascertain several components of sleep deficiency, including quality, latency, duration, disturbance and use of sleep medications. Additionally, a Global Sleep Index (GSI) was created by summing the individual sleep components and categorizing into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI).Results: Increased breast cancer risks were associated with sleep deficiency. With the exception of duration, linear increases in risk were associated with all the other individual components of sleep deficiency (p-trend ≤ 0.002). The OR for the highest GSI quartile vs. lowest was 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.38; p-trend < 0.001).Conclusions: Sleep deficiency may be a risk factor for breast cancer. Additional prospective studies and those aimed at elucidating underlying mechanism are warranted.

AB  - Importance: Indoor nighttime light exposure influences sleep and circadian rhythms and is known to affect mood-associated brain circuits in animals. However, little is known about the association between levels of nighttime outdoor light and sleep and mental health in the population, especially among adolescents.Objective: To estimate associations of outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) with sleep patterns and past-year mental disorder among US adolescents.Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study of US adolescents used the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted from February 2001 through January 2004. A probability sample of adolescents aged 13 to 18 years was included. Analyses were conducted between February 2019 and April 2020.Exposures: Levels of outdoor ALAN, measured by satellite, with means calculated within census block groups. ALAN values were transformed into units of radiance (nW/cm2/sr).Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported habitual sleep patterns (weeknight bedtime, weeknight sleep duration, weekend bedtime delay, and weekend oversleep) and past-year mood, anxiety, behavior, and substance use disorders, measured via an in-person structured diagnostic interview. Parent-reported information was included in behavior disorder diagnoses.Results: Among 10 123 adolescents (4953 boys [51.3%]; mean [SE] age, 15.2 [0.06] years [weighted]; 6483 for behavior disorder outcomes), ALAN was positively associated with indicators of social disadvantage, such as racial/ethnic minority status (median [IQR] ALAN: white adolescents, 12.96 [30.51] nW/cm2/sr; Hispanic adolescents: 38.54 [47.84] nW/cm2/sr; non-Hispanic black adolescents: 37.39 [51.88] nW/cm2/sr; adolescents of other races/ethnicities: 30.94 [49.93] nW/cm2/sr; P < .001) and lower family income (median [IQR] ALAN by family income-to-poverty ratio ≤1.5: 26.76 [52.48] nW/cm2/sr; >6: 21.46 [34.38] nW/cm2/sr; P = .005). After adjustment for several sociodemographic characteristics, as well as area-level population density and socioeconomic status, this study found that higher ALAN levels were associated with later weeknight bedtime, and those in the lowest quartile of ALAN reported the longest weeknight sleep duration. Those in the highest quartile of ALAN went to bed 29 (95% CI, 15-43) minutes later and reported 11 (95% CI, 19-2) fewer minutes of sleep than those in the lowest quartile. ALAN was also positively associated with prevalence of past-year mood and anxiety disorder: each median absolute deviation increase in ALAN was associated with 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.14) times the odds of mood disorder and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.16) times the odds of anxiety disorder. Further analyses revealed associations with bipolar disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.35]), specific phobias (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.11-1.26]), and major depressive disorder or dysthymia (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.15]). Among adolescent girls, differences in weeknight bedtime by ALAN (third and fourth quartiles vs first quartile) were greater with increasing years since menarche (F3, 8.15; P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, area-level outdoor ALAN was associated with less favorable sleep patterns and mood and anxiety disorder in adolescents. Future studies should elucidate whether interventions to reduce exposure to ALAN may positively affect mental and sleep health.

AB  - Background: There is a prevalence peak of depression in the perimenopause, with this reproductive phase being considered a window of vulnerability due to major biopsychosocial changes. Depression has been associated with physical and psychosocial impairment. Prior depression has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of several somatic and mental diseases. We assume that women with prior depression will exhibit increased burdensome symptoms in the perimenopause compared to women without prior depression.Methods: A total of 135 perimenopausal women aged 40-56 years participated in the longitudinal Swiss Perimenopause Study. For the purpose of this investigation, a cross-sectional design was chosen. A wide range of validated psychosocial questionnaires were used to compare women with and without prior depression regarding their experience of the perimenopause. Findings were statistically adjusted for multiple testing.Results: Women with prior depression showed significantly more depressive symptoms (U = 1215.5, p < .01), more menopausal symptoms (U = 1395.0, p < .01), and more sleep disturbances (U = 1583.5, p < .05) than women without prior depression. Moreover, women with a history of depression reported lower subjective mental health (U = 1573.0, p <  05) and felt more isolated (U = 1524.0, p < .05) than those without prior depression.Limitations: Self-report data may affect the results. Furthermore, due to the cross-sectional design, causality cannot be inferred.Conclusions: Prior depression affects women's experience of the perimenopause. Women with prior depression exhibit significantly more negative health outcomes in the perimenopause than those without prior depression.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of auricular acupressure therapy on sleep disorder and fatigue in menopausal women. Methods: The study design was a non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design. The participants were 40~60 years old women, assigned to the experimental group (n=25) or the control group (n=27). Auricular acupressure using vaccaria seeds was administered to the experimental group. The sessions continued for 6 weeks. Outcome measures included Pittsburgh sleep quality index, sleep meter, sleep diary, fatigue assessment instrument, serum cortisol, and serum serotonin. Results: Menopausal women in the experimental group showed significant increases in deep sleep, light sleep, serotonin level and sleep duration compared with the control group. Also, the experimental group reported decreases in PSQI, sleep latency, awakening time, fatigue and cortisol level compared with the control group. Conclusion: Results show that auricular acupressure using vaccaria seeds is considered as an effective treatment for sleep disorder and fatigue in menopausal women. We conclude that it can be used as a nursing intervention method proven to reduce sleep disorder and fatigue in menopausal women.

AB  - Background: Childhood abuse has been associated with poor health outcomes in adulthood. However, the physiologic pathways by which abuse is linked to health are not fully elucidated. Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of multiple chronic diseases. We tested whether childhood trauma exposure was related to increased systemic inflammation in midlife women. Materials and Methods: Participants were 304 nonsmoking perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years and free of cardiovascular disease. They completed questionnaires assessing psychosocial and behavioral factors, including childhood trauma, anthropometric measures, wrist actigraphy sleep measurements, and a fasting blood draw for inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Associations between childhood trauma and inflammatory markers were tested in linear regression models controlling for age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, anti-inflammatory medication use, and alcohol consumption. Other covariates considered included sleep continuity and depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 44.8% of the sample experienced at least one type of childhood abuse/neglect. Women with a history of emotional abuse had higher IL-6 levels than women without this history in multivariate models (β = 0.077, standard error = 0.032, p = 0.017). Results were not accounted for by covariates and persisted additionally controlling for depressive symptoms and sleep. Childhood abuse/neglect was not related to hsCRP. Conclusions: Childhood emotional abuse was associated with higher levels of IL-6 in midlife women. Assessing childhood trauma exposure along with inflammatory markers may be important for the development of prevention strategies at midlife to prevent chronic diseases later in life.

AB  - A reduction in estrogen levels in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods causes various symptoms in women, such as hot flushes, sweats, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Chlorogenic acids (CGAs), which are phenolic compounds widely present in plants such as coffee beans, have various physiological functions. However, the effects of CGAs on menopausal symptoms are unknown. To examine the effects of CGAs on menopausal symptoms, especially hot flushes, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted in healthy women. Eighty-two subjects were randomized and assigned to receive CGAs (270 mg) tablets or the placebo for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of intake, the number of hot flushes, the severity of hot flushes during sleep, and the severity of daytime sweats decreased significantly in the CGA group compared to the placebo group. The modified Kupperman index for menopausal symptoms decreased significantly after 2 weeks in the CGA group compared to the placebo group. Adverse effects caused by CGAs were not observed. The results show that continuous intake of CGAs resulted in improvements in menopausal symptoms, especially hot flushes, in healthy women.

AB  - Due to the adverse effects of medication we decided to provide a safe, economic, and easy intervention to decrease sleep problems in menopausal women. This trial aimed to determine the effect of footbath on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women. One hundred menopausal women were randomly stratified using a permuted block randomization procedure by Random Allocation Software, and assigned to one of two study groups: control (without intervention, n = 50) and intervention (footbath, n = 50). The footbath group was asked to lie their feet into the warm water for 20 min in a container with a depth of 10 cm one hour before the usual sleeping time for 6 weeks. To assess sleep quality, we used the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). To evaluate severity of menopause symptoms, the Greene scale was applied. Before the intervention, 96% of the subjects in the footbath group and 94% in the control group were poor sleepers. The results of analysis of covariance showed significant improvement in sleep quality and decrease in severity of menopause signs in the footbath group compared to the control group. At the baseline, there was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of menopause signs and the global score of PSQI in all study individuals (p ≤.001, r =.464). The present study findings showed that footbath intervention enhanced sleep quality in menopausal women. Thus, footbath as a safe, simple, and non‐pharmacological application can improve quality of life in postmenopausal women and inhibit problems due to inadequate sleep quality.

AB  - • Depression is highly prevalent during the perimenopause. • Perimenopausal depression comprises core symptoms of a major depressive disorder and menopausal symptoms. • The assessment of menopausal symptoms in the context of perimenopausal depression is highly inconsistent. The menopausal transition constitutes a phase of major biopsychosocial changes associated with an elevated risk for the development of depression. Perimenopausal depression is highly prevalent and usually characterized by core symptoms of a major depressive disorder combined with menopausal complaints such as vasomotor symptoms or other physical complaints. However, a distinct definition of the condition is lacking. The aim of this review is to portray the symptoms assessed in studies on perimenopausal depression in order to provide relevant information on the current understanding of this condition. A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. A total of 37 studies were included. Various assessment tools have been used to measure symptoms related to perimenopausal depression. Fifteen symptoms were identified. Depressed mood was assessed across all studies. Low energy or sleep disturbances, as acknowledged symptoms of a major depressive disorder, were surveyed in most studies. However, the assessment of menopausal complaints was rather heterogeneous. While vasomotor symptoms were often measured, other menopausal symptoms such as mood swings or pain were investigated less frequently. Sexual problems were only rarely assessed. Studies on perimenopausal depression regularly include the assessment of core symptoms of a major depressive disorder, but the assessment of menopausal complaints is inconsistent. While certain symptoms are commonly measured, others are not assessed. Such inconsistencies underline an ambiguous understanding of perimenopausal depression, which in turn affects the evaluation and treatment of the condition. Thus, the use of the existing guidelines on perimenopausal depression is recommended.

AB  - This study examined the effects of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia. A randomized controlled trial was performed on 44 women. The intervention included one group session of sleep hygiene education and four individual sessions of counseling. The instruments included the Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Menopausal quality of life. The data were analyzed using repeated measure MANOVA, followed by repeated measure ANOVA. Repeated measure MANOVA showed that time had a significant main effect on the anthropometric variables (body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressures) and revealed significant main effects of the group and time on the psychosocial variables (sleep quality, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and quality of life) (p <.05). Repeated measure ANOVA results indicated a significant effect of the group on insomnia and sleep quality (p <.05). Overall, the intervention was effective in improving insomnia and poor sleep quality.

AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRfitness) is associated with reduced risk of depression and anxiety in women, however, the mechanisms by which CRfitness may be protective against the development of these disorders are less clear. Because sleep problems are associated with both a higher risk for mental illness and altered physiological responses to stress, this study investigated whether sleep quality might influence the relationship between CRfitness and physiological stress responses in women. Thirty healthy women (18–45 y) who were medication-free, with regular menstrual cycles completed: (1) enrolment visit [including the assessment of CRfitness via maximal oxygen consumption during exercise]; (2) one-week sleep monitoring period including subjective (daily sleep diaries) and objective (wrist actigraphy) sleep measures; and (3) psychosocial stressor protocol (the Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) for the collection of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and salivary cortisol stress responses. Higher CRfitness was associated with reduced wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration (r = −.38, p = 0.04), higher self-reported sleep quality (higher scores reflect poorer sleep quality; r = −.37, p = 0.05), and lower HR (r = −.43, p = 0.02) during the stressor. Higher sleep quality was associated with a lower HR during the stressor (r =.44, p = 0.01). Increased WASO duration and WASO number were associated with blunted cortisol output during the stressor (r = −.44, p = 0.02, and r = −.46, p = 0.02, respectively). Results suggest that, in women, CRfitness may be protective against the deleterious effects of stress via improved sleep quality.

AB  - Objective: To develop and internally validate a multivariable predictive model for days with new‐onset migraine headaches based on patient self‐prediction and exposure to common trigger factors. Background: Accurate real‐time forecasting of one's daily risk of migraine attack could help episodic migraine patients to target preventive medications for susceptible time periods and help decrease the burden of disease. Little is known about the predictive utility of common migraine trigger factors. Methods: We recruited adults with episodic migraine through online forums to participate in a 90‐day prospective daily‐diary cohort study conducted through a custom research application for iPhone. Every evening, participants answered questions about migraine occurrence and potential predictors including stress, sleep, caffeine and alcohol consumption, menstruation, and self‐prediction. We developed and estimated multivariable multilevel logistic regression models for the risk of a new‐onset migraine day vs a healthy day and internally validated the models using repeated cross‐validation. Results: We had 178 participants complete the study and qualify for the primary analysis which included 1870 migraine events. We found that a decrease in caffeine consumption, higher self‐predicted probability of headache, a higher level of stress, and times within 2 days of the onset of menstruation were positively associated with next‐day migraine risk. The multivariable model predicted migraine risk only slightly better than chance (within‐person C‐statistic: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.58). Conclusions: In this study, episodic migraine attacks were not predictable based on self‐prediction or on self‐reported exposure to common trigger factors. Improvements in accuracy and breadth of data collection are needed to build clinically useful migraine prediction models.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 368 postmenopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The frequency and severity of low back pain were recorded for all participants, as well as depressive symptoms and anxiety, quality of life and sleep quality. RESULTS: 90.2% of the participants reported low back pain. As low back pain severity increased, it was found that depression, anxiety levels, NHP and PSQI total scores increased as well (p = 0.0001). Significant positive correlations were found between pain intensity and outcome measures, except for sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A great majority of women experience postmenopausal low back pain, which causes significant problems that negatively affect their quality of life, emotional state and sleep quality.

AB  - Objective: Our study aims to investigate the differences in insomnia between Chinese and Western women during menopause to fill the gaps in the research on menopause in Chinese women, and to examine the premenopausal factors predictive of moderate to severe insomnia during menopause.Study Design: This is a longitudinal cohort study conducted in an urban Chinese community with a total of 458 participants.Main Outcome Measures: Presence of insomnia symptoms (trouble falling asleep, waking up early); vasomotor symptoms; anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; and menopausal stages.Results: Multivariable analysis showed that compared with that in premenopause, the prevalence of trouble falling asleep was significantly higher in menopausal transition (P = 0.029) and postmenopause (P < 0.001), and the prevalence of early-morning awakenings also significantly increased in menopausal transition (P = 0.003) and postmenopause (P = 0.011). In multivariable analysis anxiety (P = 0.022) and depression (P = 0.005) were independently and significantly positively associated with trouble falling asleep. Anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P = 0.018), and levels of follicle stimulating hormone (P-0.031) were independently and significantly positively associated with trouble falling asleep. Women who experienced insomnia in premenopause had a significantly higher risk of moderate to severe insomnia in menopausal transition (P = 0.003) and postmenopause (P = 0.047) than those who did not.Conclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of sleep disturbance significantly increased during and after menopause. Women with anxiety and depression had a higher risk of insomnia. Difficulty in sleep initiation in the premenopausal period was a strong predictor of moderate to severe insomnia at menopausal transition and postmenopause.

AB  - Objective: Follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol (E2) have been associated with sleep in midlife women, however, few studies have examined the association of other hormones or environmental chemical exposure such as phthalates, with self-reported sleep quality. We assessed the relationship of self-reported sleep with hormones and phthalates.Methods: In total, 762 women (aged 45-54 y, 459 premenopausal, and 303 perimenopausal) from the Midlife Women's Health Study answered self-reported questions regarding the frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. Serum E2, progesterone, testosterone, serum hormone binding globulin, free E2 index, free testosterone index, E2:progesterone, and E2:testosterone were measured. Summary measures of phthalate mixtures, including the phthalates from plastic sources (sumPLASTIC), personal care products (sumPCP), di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (sumDEHP), anti-androgenic phthalates (sumAA), and all phthalate metabolites measured (sumALL), were calculated from urinary phthalate metabolites. Ordinal logistic regression was used to fit each outcome sleep measure with all hormones and summary phthalates.Results: Progesterone and testosterone were significantly negatively associated with the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia. Free testosterone index was also negatively associated with insomnia frequency. E2:progesterone was positively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances and restless sleep in self-reported nonsmokers. SumPCP and sumALL were significantly negatively associated with frequency of sleep disturbances, insomnia, and restless sleep. SumDEHP and sumPLASTIC were negatively associated with insomnia frequency. Further, the direction of association between phthalates and sleep appears to be dependent on the quartile of phthalate exposure. All significant associations between phthalates and sleep were in self-reported nonsmokers or former smokers.Conclusions: Our study supports previous literature that hormones beyond follicle-stimulating hormone and E2 are associated with sleep disruptions in menopause. Further, we are among the first to show that phthalate exposure is associated with sleep disruptions in midlife women.

AB  - Objectives: Despite an increasing number of studies reporting significant associations of depression to sleep problems in general, few studies have been conducted on racial/ethnic variations in the associations among midlife women in their menopausal transition. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between depressive symptoms and sleep-related symptoms in a multiethnic group of midlife women while considering the women's race/ethnicity and menopausal status.Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the data from 1,054 midlife women in two larger studies. The depression index for midlife women and the sleep index for midlife women were used to measure sleep-related symptoms and depressive symptoms. Descriptive and inferential statistics including hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used for data analyses.Results: In the regression models by race/ethnicity, the total numbers (0.294 in non-Hispanic [NH] African Americans ≤ β ≤ 0.410 in NH Asians), and total severity scores (0.141 in Hispanic ≤ β ≤ 0.365 in NH Whites) of depressive symptoms were positively associated with the total severity of sleep-related symptoms (all P < 0.01). In the regression models by menopausal status, the total numbers (β = 0.106 in premenopausal and 0.443 in postmenopausal) and total severity scores (0.272 ≤ β ≤ 0.561) of depressive symptoms were positively associated with the total severity scores of sleep-related symptoms (all P < 0.05).Conclusions: Further studies with diverse groups of midlife women using objective measurements and biomarkers are warranted to confirm the findings.

AB  - Objective: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are associated with a poorer cardiovascular risk profile. Although the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood, alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis have been hypothesized to play a role. This study examined the within- and between-subject relationship between VMS and cortisol in a sample of healthy perimenopausal women.Methods: A total of 101 perimenopausal women, ages 45 to 55 years, were included in the study. Once a week for 12 weeks, participants completed a 24-hour hot flash diary assessing frequency and severity of VMS. They also provided two saliva samples for the measurement of the cortisol awakening response (CAR) - immediately upon waking and 30 minutes postwaking - and collected a urine sample for the measurement of a urinary metabolite of estradiol and progesterone: estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide, respectively. General linear models examined the between-subject relationship between mean VMS symptoms and mean CAR, whereas multilevel modeling was used to examine the relationship between within-person weekly changes on weekly CAR.Results: Within-subject weekly change in VMS bother, frequency, and severity were not significantly related to weekly CAR. Several significant between-subject effects of VMS on the CAR were, however, observed such that total number of hot flashes, overall VMS severity, and VMS bother, were each associated with a blunted CAR. Results remained significant despite statistically adjusting for levels of estrone-3-glucuronide, pregnanediol glucuronide, and self-reported sleep quality.Conclusion: Findings suggest that women who suffer from more severe and bothersome perimenopausal VMS exhibit alterations in HPA axis activity. Within an individual, short-term changes in VMS are, however, not associated with concurrent changes in HPA axis functioning. Further research investigating the role of the HPA axis in linking VMS and increased cardiovascular disease risk is warranted. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A607.

AB  - Introduction: Introduction: among adolescent gymnasts some concern for body weight has been observed, with diets inadequate in energy and some nutrients in the search for maximum performance. Objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary-nutritional status, body composition, eating behavior, and perceived body image concerns of female gymnasts at sub-national competition levels. In addition, to study the relationship between the prevalence of the risk of eating disorders and variables such as substance use, irregular menstruation, fatigue, and hours of sleep. Materials and method: a total of 33 female subelite gymnasts participated (age: M = 14.52, SD = 1.85), with age ranging from 11 to 18 years. Anthropometric evaluations (restricted profile) were made, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) and Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) were administered, and the subjects were then interviewed for collecting sociodemographic, socio-sports, health, and food intake data. Results: the results showed that their diet was deficient, among other micro- and macro-nutrients, in water, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins D and E, fiber, iron and calcium, whereas they ingested an excess of vitamin A and sodium. These athletes had normal weight, high muscle mass values, low fat mass levels, and intermediate somatotype components (balanced endomorph with a tendency to central). Two cases at risk for an eating disorder, and concerns related to perceived body image in a quarter of the sample were identified. Conclusion: the risk of having an eating disorder is related to the consumption of prohibited drugs or addictive substances, irregular menstruation, tiredness, and fewer hours of sleep.
AB  - Introducción: entre las gimnastas adolescentes se ha observado cierta preocupación por el peso, con dietas insuficientes en energía y algunos nutrientes en búsqueda del máximo rendimiento. Esta preocupación puede estar relacionada con trastornos de la conducta alimentaria, menstruación irregular, cansancio y descanso insuficiente. Objetivos: evaluar el estado diétético-nutricional, la composición corporal, el comportamiento alimentario y la preocupación por la imagen corporal de las gimnastas de competición. Métodos: estudio observacional y transveral en el que participaron 33 gimnastas femeninas (edad: M = 14,52, DT = 1,85), subélite, de entre 11 y 18 años de edad. Se realizaron valoraciones antropométricas, se les aplicó un test de actitudes alimentarias (EAT-26) y un cuestionario sobre la figura corporal (BSQ), y se las entrevistó, recogiéndose datos sociodemográficos, sociodeportivos, de salud y sobre la ingesta. Resultados: la dieta de las deportistas es principalmente deficitaria en agua, carbohidratos, proteínas, vitaminas D y E, fibra, hierro y calcio, con sobreingesta de vitamina A y sodio. Las deportistas presentan normopeso y valores altos de masa muscular, bajos de masa grasa y medios de los componentes del somatotipo (endomorfo equilibrado con tendencia a central). Se detectaron dos casos de riesgo de trastorno de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) y preocupación por la imagen corporal percibida en un cuarto de la muestra. Conclusiones: el riesgo de padecer un TCA se relaciona con el consumo de fármacos prohibidos o sustancias adictivas, la menstruación irregular, el cansancio y dormir menos horas.

AB  - Physical exercise and isoflavone supplementation are potential strategies to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are additive effects of isoflavone supplementation when associated with combined aerobic and resistance exercise on resting and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and in blood pressure variability (BPV). Thirty-one non-obese postmenopausal women were randomly allocated into two groups: placebo and exercise (Placebo n = 19); and isoflavone supplementation (100 mg/day) and exercise (isoflavone n = 19). ABPM and BPV were evaluated before and after 10 weeks of moderate combined (aerobic and resistance) exercise training. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) with Bonferroni correction and intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare the effects of interventions on resting BP, ABPM and BPV. Combined exercise training decreased resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and reduced 24 h and awake ambulatory SBP, DBP and mean blood pressure over time, with no additional effects of isoflavone supplementation. No changes were observed in sleep period, or in BPV indexes (Standard Deviation of 24 h (SD), daytime and nighttime interval (SDdn) and average real variability (ARV) in both groups. We conclude that isoflavone supplementation does not potentiate the effects of combined training on resting and ambulatorial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in non-obese postmenopausal women.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) programs are inexpensive, non-pharmaceutical and universally accessible options with demonstrated efficacy in reducing menopausal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a behavioral strategy for initiating and sustaining PA with the hope to reduce or eliminate menopausal symptoms. Methods : Menopausal and perimenopausal women (n=190) were randomly assigned to intervention (n=95) and non-intervention (n=95) groups using a random-numbers table. The intervention group consisted of 18 neighborhood network subgroups, each consisting of five to six women known to one another. They participated in a 12-week regular PA program, augmented by eight interactive group education and discussion sessions. The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) self-report instrument was used to determine perceived severity of menopausal symptoms. Results: The intervention group showed a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms (P < 0.001). Those whose symptoms rated severe/very severe for hot flushes were reduced from 30.1% to 11.8%. Also, participants whose sleep problems and joint discomfort rated severe/very severe declined from 28% to 6.5% and joint discomfort rated severe or very severe was reduced from 52.7% to 4.4%, respectively. Conversely in the nonintervention group, hot flushes, sleep problems and joint problems got significantly worse(P < 0.05). Conclusion: Implementing educational program that increases awareness of PA benefits in combination with existing neighborhood networks that facilitate communication and cooperation may increase PA levels and decrease menopausal symptoms. Such networks offer alow-cost means of improving quality of life (QOL) for perimenopausal and menopausal women.

AB  - Study Question: To what extent does the use of mobile computing apps to track the menstrual cycle and the fertile window influence fecundability among women trying to conceive?Summary Answer: After adjusting for potential confounders, use of any of several different apps was associated with increased fecundability ranging from 12% to 20% per cycle of attempt.What Is Known Already: Many women are using mobile computing apps to track their menstrual cycle and the fertile window, including while trying to conceive.Study Design, Size, Duration: The Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) is a North American prospective internet-based cohort of women who are aged 21-45 years, trying to conceive and not using contraception or fertility treatment at baseline.Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: We restricted the analysis to 8363 women trying to conceive for no more than 6 months at baseline; the women were recruited from June 2013 through May 2019. Women completed questionnaires at baseline and every 2 months for up to 1 year. The main outcome was fecundability, i.e. the per-cycle probability of conception, which we assessed using self-reported data on time to pregnancy (confirmed by positive home pregnancy test) in menstrual cycles. On the baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported whether they used mobile computing apps to track their menstrual cycles ('cycle apps') and, if so, which one(s). We estimated fecundability ratios (FRs) for the use of cycle apps, adjusted for female age, race/ethnicity, prior pregnancy, BMI, income, current smoking, education, partner education, caffeine intake, use of hormonal contraceptives as the last method of contraception, hours of sleep per night, cycle regularity, use of prenatal supplements, marital status, intercourse frequency and history of subfertility. We also examined the impact of concurrent use of fertility indicators: basal body temperature, cervical fluid, cervix position and/or urine LH.Main Results and the Role Of Chance: Among 8363 women, 6077 (72.7%) were using one or more cycle apps at baseline. A total of 122 separate apps were reported by women. We designated five of these apps before analysis as more likely to be effective (Clue, Fertility Friend, Glow, Kindara, Ovia; hereafter referred to as 'selected apps'). The use of any app at baseline was associated with 20% increased fecundability, with little difference between selected apps versus other apps (selected apps FR (95% CI): 1.20 (1.13, 1.28); all other apps 1.21 (1.13, 1.30)). In time-varying analyses, cycle app use was associated with 12-15% increased fecundability (selected apps FR (95% CI): 1.12 (1.04, 1.21); all other apps 1.15 (1.07, 1.24)). When apps were used at baseline with one or more fertility indicators, there was higher fecundability than without fertility indicators (selected apps with indicators FR (95% CI): 1.23 (1.14, 1.34) versus without indicators 1.17 (1.05, 1.30); other apps with indicators 1.30 (1.19, 1.43) versus without indicators 1.16 (1.06, 1.27)). In time-varying analyses, results were similar when stratified by time trying at study entry (<3 vs. 3-6 cycles) or cycle regularity. For use of the selected apps, we observed higher fecundability among women with a history of subfertility: FR 1.33 (1.05-1.67).Limitations, Reasons For Caution: Neither regularity nor intensity of app use was ascertained. The prospective time-varying assessment of app use was based on questionnaires completed every 2 months, which would not capture more frequent changes. Intercourse frequency was also reported retrospectively and we do not have data on timing of intercourse relative to the fertile window. Although we controlled for a wide range of covariates, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding (e.g. choosing to use an app in this observational study may be a marker for unmeasured health habits promoting fecundability). Half of the women in the study received a free premium subscription for one of the apps (Fertility Friend), which may have increased the overall prevalence of app use in the time-varying analyses, but would not affect app use at baseline. Most women in the study were college educated, which may limit application of results to other populations.Wider Implications Of the Findings: Use of a cycle app, especially in combination with observation of one or more fertility indicators (basal body temperature, cervical fluid, cervix position and/or urine LH), may increase fecundability (per-cycle pregnancy probability) by about 12-20% for couples trying to conceive. We did not find consistent evidence of improved fecundability resulting from use of one specific app over another.Study Funding/competing Interest(s): This research was supported by grants, R21HD072326 and R01HD086742, from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, USA.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and test a structural model of functional health in middle‐aged women based on the theory of unpleasant symptoms. METHODS: The direct and indirect effects of menopause status, childhood trauma, post‐traumatic stress, social support, and sleep quality on functional health of 264 Korean women were examined. FINDINGS: Menopause status and poor sleep quality had a negative direct effect and social support had a positive direct effect on functional health. Menopause status had a negative indirect effect on functional health through poor sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsychosocial nursing intervention programs need to be developed to improve functional health in middle‐aged women. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: It is important to mediate quality of sleep to improve functional health in middle‐aged women. 목적: 불쾌증상 이론을 바탕으로 중년 여성의 건강기능을 평가하기 위함이다. 방법: 264명의 한국 여성을 대상으로 건강기능에 영향을 미치는 폐경, 아동기 외상, 외상 후 스트레스, 사회적 지지의 직ㆍ간접적 영향을 확인하였다. 결과: 폐경과 낮은 수면의 질은 건강기능에 부적 영향을 미쳤으며, 사회적 지지는 건강기능에 정적 영향을 미쳤다. 폐경은 건강기능에 간접적 영향을 미쳤다. 결론: 중년여성의 건강기능을 증진하기 위해 신체ㆍ심리ㆍ사회적 요인을 고려한 통합적 중재가 필요하다. 간호실무 적용점: 중년여성의 건강기능을 유지하기 위해 수면의 질을 중재하는 것이 중요하다.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and their related risk factors among middle-aged Korean women according to their reproductive stages.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 3039 Korean women, aged 45-65 years, who attended their routine health checkup. Their scores from the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were compared and participants were categorized into four groups according to stage of menopause: premenopause, early menopause (≤2 years from their last menstruation), mid-menopause (2-8 years), and late menopause (>8 years).Results: The mean age of the participants was 52.81 ± 5.39 years, and 98.5 % of them reported one or more symptoms included in the MRS. The most common symptom was physical/mental exhaustion, experienced by 86.7 % of participants. The prevalence of moderate to severe symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, heart discomfort, sleep problems, sexual problems, vaginal dryness, and joint/muscular discomfort, increased in the early menopausal period. This increased in the late menopausal period compared with its prevalence at premenopause. The prevalence of moderate to severe psychological symptoms, heart discomfort, and sleep problems followed a U-shaped trend after menopause: high at early menopause, low at mid-menopause, and high again at late menopause. A low level of physical exercise was an independent risk factor for a high total MRS score; however, the menopausal stages, age, and weight were also variously associated with menopausal symptoms.Conclusions: Several menopausal symptoms remain severe, or are aggravated, until the late menopausal period among Korean women. More attention is warranted to manage these symptoms in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: Troublesome hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) are experienced by many women after treatment for breast cancer, impacting significantly on sleep and quality of life. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to be effective for the alleviation of HFNS. However, it is not known if it can effectively be delivered by specialist nurses. We investigated whether group CBT, delivered by breast care nurses (BCNs), can reduce the impact of HFNS.Methods: We recruited women with primary breast cancer following primary treatment with seven or more HFNS/week (including 4/10 or above on the HFNS problem rating scale), from six UK hospitals to an open, randomised, phase 3 effectiveness trial. Participants were randomised to Group CBT or usual care (UC). The primary endpoint was HFNS problem rating at 26 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included sleep, depression, anxiety and quality of life.Results: Between 2017 and 2018, 130 participants were recruited (CBT:63, control:67). We found a 46% (6.9-3.7) reduction in the mean HFNS problem rating score from randomisation to 26 weeks in the CBT arm and a 15% (6.5-5.5) reduction in the UC arm (adjusted mean difference -1.96, CI -3.68 to -0.23, P = .039). Secondary outcomes, including frequency of HFNS, sleep, anxiety and depression all improved significantly.Conclusion: Our results suggest that specialist nurses can be trained to deliver CBT effectively to alleviate troublesome menopausal hot flushes in women following breast cancer in the NHS setting.

AB  - Background: Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a leading cause of dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls. Manual acupuncture may be considered as an effective treatment for PD, but high-quality evidence remains limited. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the prevention of PD as compared with sham acupuncture and usual care.Methods/design: This is a three-arm, randomized, controlled clinical trial in which the patients, assessors, and statisticians will be blinded. A total of 300 acupuncture-naive patients who were diagnosed as PD will be randomly allocated to the verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or usual care groups in a 2:2:1 ratio. Patients in the verum acupuncture group will receive manual acupuncture at specific acupuncture points with penetrating needling, while those in the sham acupuncture group will receive non-penetrating needling at non-acupuncture points. They will be given five sessions over a menstrual cycle for 3 menstrual cycles. Patients in the usual care group will receive health education and informed to receive manual acupuncture for free after waiting for 7 menstrual cycles. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline in the Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale Score (CMSS). The secondary outcomes will be the changes in Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS), visual analog scale (VAS), Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ-2), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI- II), Acupuncture Expectancy Scale (AES), 60-item NEO Personality Inventory-Short Form (NEO-FFI), and acute medication intake. The adverse events will be recorded at every visit. The analyses will be performed base on a full analysis set (FAS) and a per-protocol set (PPS).Discussion: This study may provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of manual acupuncture for PD. In addition, the results of this study will help to identify the efficacy of acupuncture due to the specific effects of acupuncture or placebo effects of acupuncture ritual.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials.gov NCT02783534 .

AB  - Background: Women commonly seek medical advice about menopausal symptoms. Although menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective treatment, many women prefer non-pharmacological treatments, such as physical activity. The effectiveness of physical activity has been inconclusive when assessed by randomised controlled trials, and it remains unclear how women feel about it as a possible treatment approach. The aim of the study was to explore symptomatic menopausal women's views and experiences of physical activity as a treatment for vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.Methods: An in-depth qualitative study was embedded within a randomised controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of physical activity as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms in previously inactive vasomotor symptomatic women. Participants were randomised to one of two physical activity interventions or a usual care group. Both physical activity interventions involved two one-to-one consultations, plus either supporting materials or access to physical activity support groups, over 6 months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 purposively selected participants from all three trial groups after they had completed trial follow-up. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed by constant comparison.Results: All participants talked positively about physical activity as a treatment for their menopausal symptoms, with most reporting participation had improved their hot flushes and night sweats. They reported that they had experienced improved sleep, physical health and psychological well-being. Those who received the physical activity plus social-support intervention reported their ability to cope with their menopausal symptoms had improved. Many participants commented that they would prefer doctors to discuss physical activity as a possible treatment for their hot flushes and night sweats, before offering medication.Conclusions: Based on the views and experiences of the women who participated in this study, healthcare professionals should continue discussing physical activity as a potential first treatment option with menopausal women. Furthermore, healthcare professionals should ensure they prepare, support, and encourage these women both physically and emotionally.Trial Registration: ISRCTN ISRCTN06495625 Registered 10/11/2010.

AB  - Background: Autonomic neuropathy (AN) commonly arises as a long-term complication in diabetes mellitus and can be diagnosed from heart rate variability (HRV), calculated from electrocardiogram recordings. Psychosocial stress also affects HRV and could be one of several confounders for cardiac AN. The present work investigated the impact of psychosocial stress on HRV in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and assessed the use of salivary cortisol as a biomarker for psychosocial stress in this context.Methods: A total of 167 individuals 6-60 years old (113 with T1DM and 54 healthy controls) underwent 24-hr ECG recordings with HRV analysis. Salivary cortisol was sampled thrice during the registration day. Perceived psychosocial stress along with other factors of possible importance for the interpretation of HRV was documented in a diary.Results: Heart rate variability (high-frequency power during sleep) was reduced (p < .05) with older age, longer diabetes duration, higher mean glucose levels, physical inactivity, and perceived psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol levels in the evening were increased (p < .05) in women in ovulation phase, in individuals with preceding hypoglycemia or with hyperglycemia. The amplitude of salivary cortisol was reduced (p < .05) with the presence of perceived psychosocial stress, but only in adult healthy controls, not in individuals with diabetes.Conclusion: Psychosocial stress might be a confounder for reduced HRV when diagnosing cardiac AN in T1DM. Salivary cortisol is, however, not a useful biomarker for psychosocial stress in diabetes since the physiological stress of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia seems to overrule the effect of psychosocial stress on cortisol.

AB  - Introduction: Premenstrual syndrome is a prevalent disorder affecting a large number of women in their reproductive ages. Nutritional importance of zinc has been known for a long time and studies have shown that zinc can positively affect psychological disorders.Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of zinc supplementation on quality of life and sleep quality of young women diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome.Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out on 60 young university women that were allocated into two groups of intervention who took 30 mg/day of elemental zinc or placebo for three months. Pre- and post-intervention, participants completed the questionnaires of quality of life and Pittsburgh sleep quality.Results: After supplementation, quality of life score in the intervention group was increased (+ 9.185 ± 7.29, P < 0.001), however, in comparison with the control group, results were not significant; Physical aspects of quality of life score were significantly enhanced (+ 5.55 ± 3.71 vs. + 0.13 ± 2.87, P < 0.001). Sleep quality was marginally improved just in the zinc group (- 1.48 ± 4.12, P = 0.07).Conclusion: Zinc supplementation for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on physical aspects of quality of life in young women with premenstrual syndrome.

AB  - Objective: Period of elderly age preordains the occurrence of many health issues. People deported during World War II to concentration camps suffered from malnutrition, lack of sleep, physical and mental exhaustion. Recently, the health condition of Holocaust survivors is often complicated as a result of physical punishments and different torture methods as well as mental hardships which they had suffered during deportation. The consequences often have psychosomatic nature thus the survivors are often receivers of health care. The topic of bibliography review is based on the need to objectivize and systematically evaluate subjective health issues of Holocaust survivors in connection with trauma related to the stay in a concentration camp. The aim is to offer a review of effects of the Holocaust on health of different body systems for survivors in concentration camps and Jewish ghettos in the course of World War II.Methods: To map the subjective problems of Holocaust survivors, evidence-based medicine (EBM) method has been used with the help of scientific database PubMed, CINAHL Plus with full text, ProQuest and other sources with specific key words and Boole operators. Prognostic type of clinical/review questions has been selected for the bibliography review, which is trying to predict the probability of relation or output of illness/condition and based on diseases or symptoms seriousness to find out expectancy for treatment/improvement of care.Results: 175 studies have been found in basic search with the use of key words both in English and in Czech language. The search has not been time-limited. The advanced search has focused on different body systems and health damage due to Nazi experiments. Fourteen studies have been used to complete the study. The research results have confirmed the significant effect of Holocaust trauma on body condition of the survivors. The reasons of this condition were insufficient nutrition, unsuitable and harmful hygienic, living and working conditions and brutality of the guards. According to the research, these factors have impacted all organ systems, mainly locomotion and cardiovascular ones. The results have shown a more frequent occurrence of osteoporosis, fractures of long bones and corresponding chronical pain of people of Jewish origin who had gone through different forms of torture during World War II. Other present symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, tumors mainly in the area of colorectum and lungs. Moreover, the stay in concentration camps had influence on women's menstrual cycle.Conclusion: The studies of Holocaust effects are an example of the influence of an extreme mental and physical burden on the body condition of the survivors' health. The results of the studies have shown a wide range of the effects also in mental and social areas.

AB  - Ovarian hormones, including 17β-estradiol, are implicated in numerous physiological processes, including sleep. Beginning at puberty, girls report more sleep complaints than boys, which is maintained throughout the reproductive life stage. Sleep problems are exacerbated during the menopausal transition, evidenced by greater risk for sleep disorders. There is emerging evidence that menopause-associated hormone loss contributes to this elevated risk, but age is also an important factor. The extent to which menopause-associated sleep disturbance persists into postmenopause above and beyond the effects of age remains unknown. Untreated sleep disturbances have important implications for cognitive health, as they are emerging as risk factors for dementia. Given that sleep loss impairs memory, an important knowledge gap concerns the role played by menopause-associated hormone loss in exacerbating sleep disturbance and, ultimately, cognitive function in aging women. In this review, we take a translational approach to illustrate the contribution of ovarian hormones in maintaining the sleep–wake cycle in younger and middle-aged females, with evidence implicating 17β-estradiol in supporting the memory-promoting effects of sleep. Sleep physiology is briefly reviewed before turning to behavioral and neural evidence from young females linking 17β-estradiol to sleep–wake cycle maintenance. Implications of menopause-associated 17β-estradiol loss is also reviewed before discussing how ovarian hormones may support the memory-promoting effects of sleep, and why menopause may exacerbate pathological aging via effects on sleep. While still in its infancy, this research area offers a new sex-based perspective on aging research, with a focus on a modifiable risk factor for pathological aging.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess whether women who choose to use menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) have lower quality of life (QoL) than those who do not initiate it using Cervantes short form scale (C-SF), and analyze sociodemographic factors associated with lower QoL in women.Study Design: A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was made in four hundred and eighty women with climacteric symptoms.Results: Mean age was 51.1 years. Two hundred and sixty-one women (54.3 %) started MHT. The sample´s global mean in C-SF score was 51.3 ± 13.9. Women who choose to use MHT have higher score in C-SF (lower QoL) than women who reject it (58.7 ± 15.9 vs 46.7 ± 12.8; p < 0.001). We found higher score in women with early menopause (53.7 ± 15.9 vs 49.7 ± 13.1; p = 0.037); with no obesity (<30 vs >30 BMI) (52.8 ± 13.5 vs 41.0 ± 8.2; p = 0.002); with previous malignancies (56.2 ± 18.2 vs 50.2 ± 13.5; p = 0.020) and without sexual activity (58.0 ± 25.4 vs 50.4 ± 13.1; p = 0.009. No differences were found in C-SF score with respect to tobacco habits or physical activity. In the multivariate analysis, the variable independently associated to lower QoL by C-SF (high score) was to be a woman who want to initiate MHT (p = 0.004).Conclusions: Women who choose to use MHT due to menopausal symptoms have lower quality of life measured by C-SF scale. Women with early menopause, with no obesity (<30 BMI), without sexual activity and with previous malignances have lower quality of life measured by C-SF scale. Women with early menopause have more psychic symptoms like nervousness, fatigue and sleep complaints by C-SF scale than women with natural menopause.

AB  - Objective: One of the most common complaints observed during the menopausal period is sleep disorders, affecting 40%-60% women. In this study, we aimed to determine complementary and clternative medicine (CAM) for menopausal women experiencing sleep disturbances, and the prevalence and influencing factors of sleep disturbance. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, we included menopausal women experiencing sleeplessness [≥4 degree of discomfort according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)] (n=201). A questionnaire and the CAM Scale were used to collect data. The necessary institutional and ethical committee permissions were obtained. Results: The mean age of the menopausal women was 47.23±4.53 [minimum (min)- maximum (max), 30-60] years, and their mean VAS for insomnia was 5.20±1.12 (min-max, 4-9). The following methods were used by the women to overcome insomnia: herbal supplements (96.6%), dietary supplements (98.8%), religious practices (95.7%), and mind-body practices (76.9%). The most common methods were fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products, honey, linden tea, rosehip, prayer, pray, and music. Approximately 70.5% women expressed that the method they used was effective. Conclusion: Almost all menopausal women used any method of CAM. Further studies on the effectiveness of these methods as well as the training to be provided and the information dissemination by healthcare professionals are recommended.
AB  - Amaç: Menopozal dönemde görülen en sık şikayetlerden biri de uyku bozukluklarıdır ve kadınların %40-60'ını etkilemektedir. Çalışma menopoz döneminde olan kadınların uyku sorunlarına yönelik kullanmış oldukları tamamlayıcı ve alternatif tedavileri (TAT), yaygınlığını ve etkileyen faktörleri belirlemek için planlandı. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışma tanımlayıcı ve kesitsel niteliktedir. Örneklemini menopoz döneminde olan ve uykusuzluk problemi Visual Analog Skalasına (VAS) göre 4 ve üstü derecede rahatsızlık hisseden) yaşayan kadınlar oluşturmaktadır (n=201). Verilerin toplanmasında, kadınların sosyo-demografik özellikleri, menopozal döneme ait bilgileri ve uyku sorunlarını içeren anket formu ile TAT Ölçeği kullanıldı. Gerekli kurum ve etik kurul izinleri alındı. Verilerin analizlerinde yüzde, ortalama, ki-kare, Mann-Whitney U ve Kruskal-Wallis testleri yapıldı. Bulgular: Kadınların menopoz yaş ortalaması 47,23±4,53 [minimum (min)-maksimum (maks)= 35-65), VAS'a göre kadınların uykusuzluk şikayetleri ortalaması 5,20±1,12 (min-maks= 4-9)'dir. Kadınların uykusuzluk problemi için kullanmış oldukları yöntemler; bitkisel yaklaşımlar (%96,6), diyet takviyesi (%98,8), dini yaklaşımlar (%95,7) ve zihin-beden uygulamalarıdır (%76,9). En sık kullanılan yöntemler; meyve-sebzeler, süt ve süt ürünleri, bal, ıhlamur, kuşburnu, namaz, dua etmek ve müzik gibi uygulamalardır. Kadınların %70,5'i ise kullandıkları yöntemin etkili olduğunu ifade etti. Sonuç: Menopozal dönemde olan kadınların hemen hemen hepsi herhangi bir TAT yöntemi kullanmaktadır. Kadınların çoğunluğu bu yöntemleri sağlık profesyonellerinden eğitim almadan uygulamaktadır. Bu yöntemlerin etkinliklerinin daha geniş kapsamlı olarak araştırılması, eğitimlerin sağlık profesyonelleri tarafından verilmesi ve yaygınlaştırılması önerilmektedir.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with heterogenous clinical manifestations. The evidence indicates that PCOS is associated with long-term health risks including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, endometrial cancer, and mood disorders. Although cardiometabolic risk factors are more common among women with PCOS, currently there is no strong evidence for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. The effect of menopausal transition on the long-term health consequences of PCOS is mostly uncertain. The PCOS phenotype improves with aging in affected women. Accordingly, the differences in the cardiometabolic risk profiles of PCOS patients and of the general population seem to disappear after menopause. However, it is not clear whether this phenotype amelioration is associated with changes in other long-term health risks after the menopause. There are also gaps in our knowledge about the impact of long-term use of oral contraceptives on the prevalence of PCOS-related comorbidities. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the long-term health consequences of PCOS and their clinical implications in peri- and postmenopause, and highlights areas for future research.

AB  - Rationale and objective: Estradiol decline has been associated with depression and anxiety in post-menopausal women. Agomelatine (Ago) is an agonist of the melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptors and an antagonist of the serotonergic 5-HT2c receptors. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of combining Ago with 17β-estradiol (E2) on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in young adult female rats. Methods: OVX rats were treated with Ago (40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 10 days starting 1 week after surgery alone or combined with two doses of E2 (40 μg/kg/day, s.c.) given before behavioral testing. Results: Co-administration of E2 enhanced the anti-depressant and anxiolytics effects of Ago as evidenced by decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test, as well as increased time spent in the open arms and number of entries to open arms in the elevated plus-maze. In parallel, Ago increased hippocampal norepinephrine, dopamine, melatonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Meanwhile, Ago-treated rats exhibited reduced hippocampal nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) P65 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine level. Ago upregulated estrogen receptor (ER α and β) mRNA expression in the hippocampus of OVX rats and elevated serum estradiol levels. Co-administration of E2 with Ago synergistically decreased NF-kB P65 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased BDNF levels. Conclusion: E2 augmented the neuroprotective effect of Ago in OVX rats via its anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects. The combined treatment of E2 and Ago should be further investigated as a treatment of choice for depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances associated with menopause.

AB  - Study Objectives: To determine whether insomnia patients with objective sleep disturbance are less responsive to cognitive and behavioral treatments than those without objective sleep disturbance, characterize effects of insomnia therapy on objective sleep, and determine whether reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal correspond to changes in objective sleep.Methods: Secondary analysis of a single-site, randomized controlled trial. 113 postmenopausal women (56.40 ± 5.34 years) with menopause-related insomnia disorder were randomized to three treatment conditions: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), sleep restriction therapy (SRT), or sleep education control. Primary outcomes were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and polysomnography (PSG) sleep parameters and were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up.Results: Patients with lower pretreatment PSG sleep efficiency had lower rates of insomnia remission after active treatment relative to those with higher sleep efficiency (37.8% vs 61.8%). Neither CBTI and SRT produced clinically meaningful effects on PSG sleep. Exploratory analyses revealed that reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal were associated with decreases in PSG sleep latency, but not wake after sleep onset.Conclusions: Our findings support an emerging literature suggesting that insomnia patients with objective sleep disturbance may have blunted response to insomnia therapy. Research is needed to enhance treatments to better improve insomnia in patients with objective sleep disturbance. A lack of observed CBTI and SRT effects on PSG sleep suggests that these therapies may be presently ill-designed to improve objective sleep. Nocturnal cognitive arousal may represent an entry point to improve objective sleep latency in insomnia. NAME: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes.

AB  - The present study investigated the concomitants of menopause-specific quality of life among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Based on the Wilson and Cleary model of quality of life, this cross-sectional study recruited 329 women of age 40–65 years following operational convenience. The study was conducted in the office of the Korea Population, Health and Welfare Association (KPHWA) in Incheon, South Korea. Data collected on sociodemographic characteristics, social support, biological/physiological characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-K), and self-rated health. Menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire (MENQOL) was used in this study. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was performed. The study found that social support and self-rated health were negatively correlated with MENQOL in premenopausal women, while the income level and self-rated health were negatively associated with MENQOL in postmenopausal women. Sleep quality was positively correlated with MENQOL in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The study results indicate the need for tailored approaches based on menopausal status. Especially, social support may help improve the MENQOL of premenopausal women, while in postmenopausal women, improved sleep quality may enhance their menopause-specific quality of life.

AB  - Background: Obesity and upper gastrointestinal disorders are the public health problems in the world and Iran. The role of routine preoperative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy of the morbid obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery is a subject of discussion. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between gastric pathological findings in morbid obese patients with demographic information, Helicobacter pylori, biochemical status and inflammatory factors. Methods: Upper digestive endoscopic findings, including rapid urease test and pathological examples in the six areas of stomach were examined in 196 morbid obese patients who were candidates for bariatric surgery. These cases had either body mass index (BMI) higher than 40 or higher than 35 in addition to one comorbidity. For grading chronic gastritis, six samples were given from these areas of stomach: two biopsies from antrum, with 2-3 centimeters (cm) from pylorus, one sample from distal of lesser curvature, another one from distal of greater curvature, two samples from corpus with eight ems distance from cardia ( one of them from lesser curvature another one from greater curvature) and one sample from incisura angularis according to Sydney system. Height, weight, sex, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (Chol), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDH), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and history of some diseases (hypothyroidism, lipid profile metabolism disorders, diabetes mellitus type II, sleep apnea, menstrual abnormalities, and eating disorders) were evaluated as well. We get six samples from three areas of the stomach for grading chronic gastritis according to Sydney system: two biopsy samples from pylorus, by 2-3 cm from pylorus, one from distal of lesser curvature, one from distal of greater curvature, two sample from cardia, with eight cm distance from cardia (one from lesser and the other from greater curvature), and one sample from incisura angularis. I-test, chi-square and Fisher exact test were used in statistical analysis. This study was approved by ethics committee of lran University of Medical Sciences by this code: 25669.1396 IR.IUMS.REC. Results: There were 86.2% women among all 196 cases. Mean± standard deviation (SD) of age, weight and BMI of participants were 39.9±10.2 years, 123.5±22.5 kilogram (Kg), and 45.9±6.1 kg/m2, respectively. Smoking in 15.8% and alcohol drinking in 138% was observed. Dyslipidemia in 44 (22.4% ), hypothyroidism in 42 (21.4% ), menstrual abnormality in 39 (19.9%), diabetes mellitus in 26 (13.3%) and sleep apnea in 21 cases (10.7%) were the most common comorbidities in these patients. Family history of obesity: 161 (88.2%), hypertension: 121 (61.7%), diabetes mellitus: 113 (57.7%) and cancer: 64 patients (32.7%) were the most common diseases in family of affected patients. Eating disorders were volume eating in 161 (82.1%), microphagia in 129 (65.8%) and bulimia in 121 cases (61.7%), respectively in descending order. The most common pathologic findings of the stomach were chronic inflammation in 195 (99.5%), acute inflammation in 131 (66.8%), active inflammation in 127 (64.8%), H. pylori infection in 120 (61.2%), active atrophy in 37 (18.9%), metaplasia in 29 (14.8%) and atypia in 19 cases (9.7%), respectively. There was not any cases with dysplasia. The most common H. pylori prevalence was in incisura in 116 cases (59.2%), while, the lowest prevalence was observed in cardia in 103 patients (52.6%). Urease test for H. pylori infection was positive in 114 cases (58.2%), while, H. pylori infection in all six regions of the stomach was observed in 120 cases (61.2%). Urease test result and presence of H. pylori infection had statistically significant association with each other (p<0.001). In 27 cases (22.5%) despite H. pylori infection in pathologic assessment from biopsy samples of one of six regions of the stomach, urease test was falsely negative. On the other hand, in 21 samples (27.6%) despite negative result for H. pylori in all six areas of the stomach, urease was falsely positive. The specificity and sensitivity of rapid urease test were calculated to be 72.4% and 77.5%, respectively. Demographic information, biochemical status and inflammatory factors of the two groups of patients with and without pathological findings in the six areas of stomach were not different (For all of them p>0.050). However, the presence of Helicobacter pylori was associated with pathology finding in only two areas: small corpus and large corpus (p= 0.006 and p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: In our study abnormal findings in endoscopy was higher than similar studies. Positive result of urease test was also higher because similar studies have excluded symptomatic cases with gastroesophageal reflux disease and PPI users. The role of routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy before obesity surgery is under debate. The American Society of Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (SAGES) recommends the American Society of Metabolic and Obesity Surgeons (ASMBS) and the American Society of Gastroenteroscopic Endoscopies that endoscopy be decided according to each individual condition and type of procedure. It is recommended in patients at high risk for gastric cancer such as a history of Helicobacter pylori, BMI, waist and waist to hip ratio, family history of gastric cancer and male sex and according to protective effects of Helicobacter pylori treatment in the prevention of gastric cancer under the age of 40. It was done to prevent pathology in at least these two areas of the stomach in the future. However, showing the presence of Helicobacter pylori with pathology in these two areas of the stomach in this study does not mean that if Helicobacter pylori is eradicated, the chance of developing gastric cancer in these areas will be zero; Other studies have not shown that Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with pathology in any part of the stomach due to the lack of gastric mapping, so it is likely that what has been said about eradicating Helicobacter pylori and reducing the chance of stomach cancer. It has been due to the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in two areas of small corpus and large corpus of the stomach. According to the association of Helicobacter pylori infection and pathological findings in small corpus and large corpus areas of stomach and the results of other studies that Helicobacter pylori infection increases the chance of gastric cancer and due to high false negative rate of rapid urease test (22.5%) It is recommended that for patients with high risk of gastric cancer use pathological samples, especially in these two areas, to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection.

AB  - Background: Little attention has been paid to whether snoring frequency is associated with body composition in menopausal women, particularly in China. This study objected to investigate the association between self-reported snoring and body composition in (peri-post) menopausal Chinese women as well as metabolic indicators.Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 715 participants aged 40-67 years from the Menopause Clinic in the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Participants were categorized into four subgroups stratified by self-reported snoring frequency: never, rarely (< 1 night per week), occasionally (1-2 nights per week), regularly (≥3 nights per week), while body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Besides, blood sample were collected to test the glycolipid indicators.Results: In our sample of investigation, regular snoring (≥3 nights per week) was found to be an independent risk factor for higher fat mass (total, upper limbs, trunk), with the highest risk of 2.4 times for fat mass of trunk after adjusting for metabolic confounders(p = 0.003). Meanwhile, regular snoring was independently associated with higher fat mass (total and each segment) only in menopausal transition (p = 0.023).Conclusions: We suggested that self-reported regular snoring may be taken as a simple alternative to predict higher fat mass (≥17.11 kg, upper quartile) in menopausal women. Similarly, body composition should be attached to the great importance to those who in menopausal transition in order to help to prevent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

AB  - Background: This study aimed to compare the lifestyle factors and SQ between women with and without endometriosis. Also in this essay, the influence of food intake, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on sleep quality of women with endometriosis was determined.Methods: Of the 156 infertile women approached for the study, 78 women had endometriosis and 78 were included in the control group. At first, each participant completed a checklist including questions about demographics, physical activity, reproductive and menstrual status. SQ was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Dietary data were collected using a validated 147-item semi-quantitative FFQ.Results: Irregular menstrual status, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, history of abortion, family history of endometriosis were associated with endometriosis risk (P < 0.05). In women with physical activity more than 3 h per week, high consumption of the dairy product, and fruit endometriosis is less common (P < 0.05). The total PSQI score, and the scores for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep disturbance domains were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). In women with endometriosis, poor SQ was associated with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, physical activity, and low consumption of the dairy product, fruit, and nut (p < 0.05).Conclusion: In endometriosis women, SQ was lower than healthy individuals. Lifestyle factors can effect on SQ of these patients.

AB  - Breast pain (mastalgia) is experienced by <=70% of women during their lifetime[1] and may be considered a physiological symptom rather like painful menses, but remains a common presentation in primary care. CAUSES OF MASTALGIA I Cyclical breast pain i is the condition experienced by two-thirds of patients with true mastalgia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that: breast pain is not a criteria for urgent referral, with a positive predictive value of <3% for breast cancer; and[6] referral is recommended if cyclical breast pain is affecting quality of life or sleep, and has been ongoing for more than 3 months if the pain is unresponsive to first-line treatment.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine premenstrual symptoms (PMS) of shift nurses and identify the association between PMS, sleep, and occupational stress. Methods: This study was conducted with a secondary data analysis that used data from the Shift Work Nurse's Health and Turnover study. The participants were 258 nurses who were working in shifts including night shifts. PMS, sleep patterns (sleep time and sleep time variability), sleep quality, and the occupational stress of each participant were measured using the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, a sleep diary, an actigraph, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Korean Occupational Stress Scale, respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 and STATA 15.1 to obtain descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficients, multiple linear regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and Baron and Kenny's mediating analysis. Results: The average PMS score, average sleep time, average sleep time variability, average sleep quality score, and average occupational stress score of the participants was 53.95 ± 40.45, 7.52 ± 0.89 hours, 32.84 ± 8.43%, 12.34 ± 5.95, and 49.89 ± 8.98, respectively. A multiple linear regression analysis with GEE indicated that sleep time variability (B = 0.86, p = .001), and sleep quality (B = 2.36, p < .001) had negative effects on nurses' PMS. We also found that sleep quality had a complete mediating effect in the relationship between occupational stress and PMS. Conclusion: These findings indicate that both sleep time variability and sleep quality are important factors associated with PMS among shift work nurses. To improve shift nurses' PMS status, strategies are urgently needed to decrease sleep time variability and increase sleep quality.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a new, improved herbal formula of a traditional Chinese medicine, improved Gengnianchun (I-GNC), on hot flushes, depression, anxiety, and sleep in peri- and postmenopausal women in China.Methods: A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial of peri- and postmenopausal women with Kupperman Index (KMI) scores of 15 or higher was conducted for 12 weeks. Hot flush frequencies, KMI scores, Hamilton depression scale scores, Hamilton anxiety scale scores, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were evaluated. Each outcome was evaluated every 4 weeks.Results: Ninety-eight participants completed the study. The I-GNC formula significantly reduced the mean (SD) frequency of hot flushes from 7 (4.554) to 1.2 (1.675) in the I-GNC group and from 6.74 (3.43) to 3.66 (2.635) in the placebo group (P < 0.01). The KMI (P < 0.01), Hamilton depression scale (P < 0.01), and Hamilton anxiety scale (P < 0.01) scores decreased in both groups after treatment, and significant differences were observed between the two groups (P < 0.01); however, no significant difference in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was observed. I-GNC had no effect on serum follicle-stimulating hormone or E2 levels. There were no obvious adverse effects.Conclusions: The traditional Chinese medicine herbal formula I-GNC can alleviate the symptoms of menopausal syndrome and improve quality of life among peri- and postmenopausal women. I-GNC is safe and has no notable adverse effects.

AB  - Objective: Our goal was to explore the range and characteristics of published papers on therapeutic walking programs for menopausal women and to identify program features that resulted in successful outcomes including reduced symptoms and improved long-term wellness.Methods: We searched biomedical and exercise-related databases for articles published up to June 1, 2017, using keywords related to menopause and walking. Data were collected into EndNote X8 reference manager to identify and remove duplicates. The final selection included all articles that studied walking as a health intervention for women in menopause transition or postmenopausal.Results: A total of 3,244 papers were collected from the six databases. After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 96 articles were charted, including 77 different walking programs. Walking interventions ranged from 4 weeks to 3 years with an average weekly frequency of 3.8 ± 1.8 and were applied to a variety of symptoms and their biological markers and risk factors. Overall, 91% of the programs showed a beneficial outcome in at least one menopause-related medical issue. Information on menopause-specific symptoms, especially vasomotor symptoms and sleep problems, was scarce.Conclusion: The scoping review highlights the growing interest in walking programs as therapies for menopause and related symptoms and provides evidence of their possible benefit as a wellness option for women in menopause and beyond. Further research would be recommended to establish the therapeutic value of walking programs for women with specific focus on typical menopause symptoms at different stages of menopause. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A587.

AB  - Objectives: Menopause is a well-known risk factor for accelerating cognitive aging in women. This study aimed to assess differences in cognitive function and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) according to menopausal status to determine whether the menopause significantly affects the relationship between cognitive function and HRQOL. Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study with a convenience sample of 178 Korean women including 89 naturally menopausal women (65 ± 10 years) and 89 non-menopausal women (45 ± 8 years) who met the eligibility criteria and completed neuropsychological tests and self-report questionnaires about their HRQOL, cognitive function, depression, and sleep quality. Multiple regression analyses were performed within and between groups according to menopausal status. Results: Menopausal women had significantly worse scores on neuropsychological performance and HRQOL than non-menopausal women. A better neuropsychological performance (β = 0.34) was solely associated with a better HRQOL in menopausal women, whilst socioeconomic variables were associated with HRQOL in non-menopausal women. Conclusion: Menopause is an important risk factor for HRQOL, and the association between cognition and HRQOL may differ according to menopausal status. When developing programs for target groups to improve daily functioning and HRQOL, healthcare professionals need to pay more attention to this relationship.

AB  - Purpose: Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological problem in young women and adolescents. Exercise therapy provides positive effects on women with primary dysmenorrhea. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a combined exercise program on pain, sleep and menstrual symptoms in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.Methods: The study is a randomized controlled study. The study included 28 sedentary individuals. The participants were assigned to two groups as the exercise (mean age 22.9 ± 2.0 years) and the control (mean age 23.1 ± 1.8 years) groups. The exercise protocol was carried out with the exercise group three times a week for eight weeks. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used for assessing the intensity of pain. The Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used for evaluating menstrual symptoms and sleep quality, respectively. The study was registered on the Clinical Trials website by the number NCT03625375.Results: The comparisons between the groups revealed statistically significant differences in abdominal pain severity, MSQ total score and the subscale scores of negative outcomes and management methods (p < 0.05). The intragroup comparisons of the exercise group demonstrated that the scores of the low back pain and abdominal pain and the MSQ and PSQI scores were found to be significantly different after the 8-week program (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The combined exercise therapy is an effective way to manage symptoms associated with primary dysmenorrhea.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate possible relationships among hematologic factors, psychological dimensions, the presence of self-reported sleep problems, and clinical characteristics in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS).Methods: Twenty-five postmenopausal female patients with primary BMS (aged 55.2 ± 9.6 years) were included. All participants underwent clinical and psychological evaluations and blood sampling. The patients were subdivided according to the absence or presence of the self-reported sleep problems.Results: Pain intensity of BMS patients with sleep problems was significantly higher than those without sleep problems, and the severity of oral complaints was correlated with the presence of depression, anxiety, hostility, phobia, and psychosis. Estradiol levels were significantly lower, and FSH and LH levels were higher in BMS patients with sleep problems than those without sleep problems.Discussion: BMS patients with sleep problems may suffer inharmonious psychoneuroendocrinological interactions that might worsen oral BMS symptoms.

AB  - Background: Antecedents of chronic pelvic pain are not well characterized, but pelvic organ visceral sensitivity is a hallmark of these disorders. Recent studies have identified that some dysmenorrhea sufferers are much more likely to exhibit comorbid bladder hypersensitivity. Presumably, these otherwise healthy women may be at higher risk of developing full-blown chronic bladder pain later in life. To encourage early identification of patients harboring potential future risk of chronic pain, we describe the clinical profile of women matching this putative pain-risk phenotype.Objective(s): The objectives of the study were to characterize demographic, menstrual, pelvic examination, and psychosocial profiles of young women with comorbid dysmenorrhea and bladder hypersensitivity, defined using a standardized experimental visceral provocation test, contrasted with healthy controls, pure dysmenorrhea sufferers, and women with existing bladder pain syndrome.Study Design: This prospective cohort study acquired data on participants with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea (n = 212), healthy controls (n = 44), and bladder pain syndrome (n = 27). A subgroup of dysmenorrhea patients was found on screening with noninvasive oral water challenge to report significantly higher bladder pain during experimentally monitored spontaneous bladder filling (>15 out of 100 on visual analogue scale, based on prior validation studies) and separately defined as a group with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain. Medical/menstrual history and pain history were evaluated with questionnaires. Psychosocial profile and impact were measured with validated self-reported health status Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short forms and a Brief Symptom Inventory for somatic sensitivity. Pelvic anatomy and sensory sensitivity were examined via a standardized physical examination and a tampon provocation test.Results: In our largely young, single, nulliparous cohort (24 ± 1 years old), approximately a quarter (46 out of 212) of dysmenorrhea sufferers tested positive for the dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain phenotype. Dysmenorrhea-only sufferers were more likely to be African American (24%) than healthy controls (5%, post hoc χ2, P = .007). Pelvic examination findings did not differ in the nonchronic pain groups, except for tampon test sensitivity, which was worse in dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain and dysmenorrhea sufferers vs healthy controls (2.6 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.2 vs 0.7 ± 0.2, P < .05). Consistent with heightened pelvic sensitivity, participants with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain also had more nonmenstrual pain, dysuria, dyschezia, and dyspareunia (P's < .05). Participants with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain had Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Physical T-scores of 47.7 ± 0.9, lower than in women with dysmenorrhea only (52.3 ± 0.5), and healthy controls 56.1 ± 0.7 (P < .001). Similarly, they had lower Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Mental T-score than healthy controls (47.8 ± 1.1 vs 52.8 ± 1.2, P = .017). Similar specific impairments were observed on Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales for anxiety, depression, and sleep in participants with dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain vs healthy controls.Conclusion: Women with dysmenorrhea who are unaware they also have bladder sensitivity exhibit broad somatic sensitivity and elevated psychological distress, suggesting combined preclinical visceral sensitivity may be a precursor to chronic pelvic pain. Defining such precursor states is essential to conceptualize and test preventative interventions for chronic pelvic pain emergence. Dysmenorrhea plus bladder pain is also associated with higher self-reported pelvic pain unrelated to menses, suggesting central nervous system changes are present in this potential precursor state.

AB  - Introduction: The prevalence of migraine was found to be more than three-fold higher in women as compared with men, and in addition to differences in prevalence rates, the characteristics and associated features might also differ between the sexes. The aim of this study was to compare sex-specific features of migraine and demographic parameters in a nationwide population-based study in Turkey. Methods: Among 5323 subjects, a total of 871 patients who were diagnosed as having definite migraine according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders-III (ICHD-III) were included in our study. The demographic characteristics, associated features, and triggers of migraine were examined with regard to sex. Results: The study group comprised 640 women (73.5%) and 231 men (26.5%), with a female to male ratio of 2.8:1. Attack duration, mean migraine disability assessment scores (MIDAS), frequencies of nausea, vomiting, osmophobia, vertigo/dizziness, and allodynia were found significantly different between women and men. When we compared these parameters between men and postmenopausal women, all these parameters were still significant except nausea. Odor was statistically more frequent as a reported trigger in women, whereas excessive sleep was a statistically more frequent triggering factor in men. The rates of depression and allergy were significantly higher in women when compared with men. Conclusion: Longer attack duration, higher MIDAS scores, and the frequencies of nausea, vomiting, osmophobia, vertigo/dizziness, and allodynia were more significant in women and this variance in sex persisted after menopause. Also, some trigger factors and comorbidities differed between the sexes. These findings might result from complex genetic factors besides sociocultural influences, biologic, and sociocultural roles. Future studies should continue to explore biologic and genetic factors with respect to sex in migraine.

AB  - A large portion of reproductive-aged women report experiencing distressing premenstrual symptoms. These symptoms can be exacerbated by concurrent mood problems and contribute to long-term depressive risk. However, difficulty sleeping and regulating emotional responses are also associated with the premenstrual phase and represent additional, well-established risk factors for depression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether habitual sleep problems and emotion regulation strategies serve to mediate the relationship between mood and premenstrual symptoms in non-treatment–seeking young women. Participants included 265 adult women between the ages of 18 and 25 who provided retrospective self-reports of depressive symptoms, habitual sleep quality, and premenstrual symptoms for the past month. Trait-based difficulties in regulating emotions were also assessed. Greater depressive symptoms significantly predicted greater premenstrual symptoms and both poor sleep and ineffective emotion regulation were shown to mediate this relationship. Poor sleep may enhance experience of premenstrual symptoms via its well-established impact on physical, cognitive, and/or affective functioning. Similarly, an inability to effectively regulate emotional responses in general may exacerbate experience or perception of somatic and mood symptoms during the premenstrual period, contributing to mood disturbances and risk. Findings require replication in future studies using prospective designs and more diverse samples of women.

AB  - Infants < 51 weeks post-menstrual age (< 51 PMA) are often referred for modified barium swallow (MBS) studies for suspected silent aspiration (SA) given a possible association between SA and aspiration pneumonia. Infants this young are unlikely to have developed a mature laryngeal cough reflex, most likely rendering SA an expected finding in those who aspirate. The aims of this retrospective review were to (1) determine if SA resolves in a significant proportion of infants around the expected emergence of the laryngeal cough reflex, (2) determine which factors or characteristics are associated with and without SA resolution in these infants, and (3) determine if SA, or any aspiration, is associated with increased rates of lower respiratory infection (including aspiration pneumonia) in these infants. Results from the chart review revealed that 79/148 (53.4%) infants had SA on MBS < 51 PMA. 16/48 (33.3%) infants assessed for SA by the time of the expected emergence of the cough reflex had resolution. SA resolution was less common in infants with obstructive sleep apnea (p = 0.037). A total of 50/70 (71.4%) infants with a follow-up MBS had eventual SA resolution. Aspiration was not significantly associated with LRI, including aspiration pneumonia. The results suggested that the laryngeal cough reflex might develop later than reported in the literature and there is no association between aspiration and LRI. These findings may indicate that age should be considered before ordering an MBS solely to assess for SA in this population. The study provides preliminary evidence for future prospective research regarding SA resolution.

AB  - Objective: Intermittent hypoxia (IH)-a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-enhances lung cancer progression in mice via altered host immune responses that are also age and sex-dependent. However, the interactions of menopause with IH on tumor malignant properties remain unexplored. Here, we aimed to investigate lung cancer outcomes in the context of ovariectomy (OVX)-induced menopause in a murine model of OSA.Methods: Thirty-four female mice (C57BL/6, 12-week-old) were subjected to bilateral OVX or to Sham intervention. Six months after surgery, mice were pre-exposed to either IH or room air (RA) for 2 weeks. Then, 10 lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells were injected subcutaneously in the left flank, with IH or RA exposures continued for 4 weeks. Tumor weight, tumor invasion, and spontaneous lung metastases were assessed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were isolated and subjected to flow cytometry polarity evaluation along with assessment of TAMs modulation of LLC1 proliferation in vitro. To determine the effect of IH and OVX on each experimental variable, a two-way analysis of variance was performed.Results: IH and OVX promoted a similar increase in tumor growth (∼2-fold; P = 0.05 and ∼1.74-fold; P < 0.05, respectively), and OVX-IH further increased it. Regarding lung metastasis, the concurrence of OVX in mice exposed to IH enhanced the number of metastases (23.7 ± 8.0) in comparison to those without OVX (7.9 ± 2.8; P < 0.05). The pro-tumoral phenotype of TAMS, assessed as M2/M1 ratio, was increased in OVX (0.06 ± 0.01; P < 0.01) and IH (0.06 ± 0.01; P < 0.01) compared with sham/RA conditions (0.14 ± 0.03). The co-culture of TAMS with naive LLC1 cells enhanced their proliferation only under IH.Conclusion: In female mice, both the IH that is characteristically present in OSA and OVX as a menopause model emerge as independent contributors that promote lung cancer aggressiveness and seemingly operate through alterations in the host immune response.

AB  - Menopause is generally experienced as a biopsychosocial process involving physiological changes, and influenced by a wide range of psychological, social and cultural factors. The loss of ovarian oestrogen production may cause debilitating symptoms, including hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, bladder dysfunction, loss of libido, and mood changes. Experience of the menopause transition varies widely between individuals, depending on the age of onset, personal health and wellbeing, social context, environment and culture. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) remains the most effective treatment for the management of vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness, but has no proven role in the treatment of chronic diseases of ageing. Treatment should be individualized, and for most healthy women aged 50–59 years the risks of HRT are low. An understanding of the pathophysiology of menopausal symptoms and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal treatments assists in the individual management of patients.

AB  - Background: Studies assessing the impact of sleep restriction (SR) on blood pressure (BP) are limited by short study length, extreme SR (<4 hours a night), and lack of attention to psychological distress as a possible mediator.Methods: A community-based cohort was assembled with 237 women (age 34.1 ± 13.5 years; body mass index 25.4 ± 5.4 kg/m2), and a randomized, crossover, intervention study was conducted in 41 women (24 completed: age 30.2 ± 6.5 years; body mass index 24.3 ± 2.8 kg/m2) to determine the causal effect of SR on BP. Sleep was maintained as usual (HS) or reduced by 1.5 hours a night (SR) for 6 weeks. In the cohort, associations between sleep and psychosocial factors were evaluated using multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical confounders. In the intervention study, in-office BP was measured weekly; ambulatory BP was measured at end point. Psychological factors were assessed at baseline and end point. Mixed-model analyses with total sleep time (TST, main predictor), week and fraction of time spent in physical activity (covariates), and subject (random effect) were performed.Results: Among the community cohort, higher perceived stress, stressful events and distress, and lower resilience were associated with shorter sleep, worse sleep quality, and greater insomnia symptoms (P < .05). In the intervention, systolic BP increased as TST decreased (TST × week interaction, [coefficient ± standard error] -0.0097 ± 0.0046, P = .036). Wake ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (-0.059 ± 0.022, P = .021) and mean arterial pressure (-0.067 ± 0.023, P = .018) were higher after SR versus HS. Psychological distress variables were not affected by TST and did not mediate the effects of SR on BP.Conclusions: These results suggest that SR influences CVD risk in women via mechanisms independent of psychological stressors.

AB  - The objective of this review was to evaluate systematically the effectiveness of Lavender aromatherapy on physical and psychological symptoms in menopausal women. A comprehensive systematic literature search in the electronic databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Ovid, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of science, and Google scholar, as well as Magiran, SID, and Irandoc for Persian literature review up to January 2020. All Randomized controlled trials, and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the impact of aromatherapy with lavender alone or in combination with other aromas on physical and psychological symptoms in menopausal women were included in this systematic review. Sixteen interventional studies consisted of 1092 postmenopausal women included in systematic review. Eight of eligible studies with 493 participants included in meta-analysis. There were significant between group differences in menopausal symptoms (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.98 to −0.80, I2 = 76%; four trials, 236 participants); sleep quality score (SMD = −2.16, 95%CI: −3.77 to −0.54, I2 = 95%; three studies, 199 participants); systolic blood pressure (MD = −5.34 mmHg, 95% CI: −7.40 to −3.29, I2 = 10%; two study, 114 participants); diastolic blood (MD = −5.06 mmHg, 95% CI: −7.55 to −2.57, I2 = 0%; two study, 114 participants). Aromatherapy had positive effect on sexual function, self-esteem, anxiety, hot flash, but it had negative impact on triglyceride and high density lipoprotein compared to placebo (p < 0.05). Aromatherapy with Lavender in postmenopausal women may cause an improvement in most of physical and psychological symptoms. Further high quality studies especially with focus on the adverse events are suggested globally. • Lavender alone or in combination with other aromas may lead to improve the physical and psychological symptoms of menopausa. • The quality of most evidences to support the physical and psychological effects of aromatherapy with lavender is poor. • Limited safety data indicated the optimal dose and adverse events.

AB  - There are growing concerns that poor dietary behaviors at young ages will increase the future risk of chronic diseases in adulthood. We found that female college students who skipped breakfast had higher incidences of dysmenorrhea and irregular menstruation, suggesting that meal skipping affects ovarian and uterine functions. Since dysmenorrhea is more prevalent in those with a past history of dieting, we proposed a novel concept that inadequate dietary habits in adolescence become a trigger for the subsequent development of organic gynecologic diseases. Since inadequate feeding that was limited during the non-active phase impaired reproductive functions in post-adolescent female rats, we hypothesize that circadian rhythm disorders due to breakfast skipping disrupts the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, impairs the reproductive rhythm, and leads to ovarian and uterine dysfunction. To explain how reproductive dysfunction is memorized from adolescence to adulthood, we hypothesize that the peripheral clock system also plays a critical role in the latent progression of reproductive diseases together with the central system, and propose naming this concept "adolescent dietary habit-induced obstetric and gynecologic disease (ADHOGD)". This theory will contribute to analyzing the etiologies of and developing prophylaxes for female reproductive diseases from novel aspects. In this article, we describe the precise outline of the above hypotheses with the supporting evidence in the literature.

AB  - Objective: To characterize behavior of 2-year-old children based on the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).Study Design: We studied children born at 22-26 weeks of gestation and assessed at 22-26 months of corrected age with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). BPD was classified by the level of respiratory support at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. CBCL syndrome scales were the primary outcomes. The relationship between BPD grade and behavior was evaluated, adjusting for perinatal confounders. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether cognitive, language, or motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on behavior.Results: Of 2310 children, 1208 (52%) had no BPD, 806 (35%) had grade 1 BPD, 177 (8%) had grade 2 BPD, and 119 (5%) had grade 3 BPD. Withdrawn behavior (P < .001) and pervasive developmental problems (P < .001) increased with worsening BPD grade. Sleep problems (P = .008) and aggressive behavior (P = .023) decreased with worsening BPD grade. Children with grade 3 BPD scored 2 points worse for withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems and 2 points better for externalizing problems, sleep problems, and aggressive behavior than children without BPD. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on the attention problems, emotionally reactive, somatic complaints, and withdrawn CBCL syndrome scales (P values < .05).Conclusions: BPD grade was associated with increased risk of withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems but with decreased risk of sleep problems and aggressive behavior. The relationship between BPD and behavior is complex. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediate the effects of BPD grade on some problem behaviors.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between common mental disorders (CMD), sleep quality, and moderate and severe menopausal symptoms in adult women in southern Brazil.Methods: This cross-sectional, population-based study investigated a representative sample of 393 women (age 40-69 years) living in an urban area. A standardized and pretested questionnaire that included the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 for CMD (Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 ≥7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-BR for sleep disorders (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index >5), and the Menopause Rating Scale for moderate/severe menopausal symptoms (Menopause Rating Scale >8) was used for data collection. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using robust Poisson regression.Results: The prevalence of moderate/severe menopausal symptoms in the sample was 58.0% (95% CI 53.0-63.0), the prevalence of CMD was 40.2% (95% CI 35.3-45.2), and the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 49.4% (95% CI 44.3-54.5). CMD and poor sleep quality occurred simultaneously in 34.4% of participants (95% CI 29.6-39.3). Moderate/severe menopausal complaints were significantly more prevalent in women with CMD (P < 0.001) and poor sleep quality (P < 0.001); the presence of both CMD and poor sleep quality increased the likelihood of moderate/severe menopausal complaints threefold. After adjustment, CMD and poor sleep quality remained strongly and significantly associated with moderate/severe menopausal complaints (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Considering the complex time-course relationship between CMD, sleep quality, and menopausal symptoms, longitudinal studies should follow women with these issues throughout the menopausal period to identify a possible temporal link between exposures and outcome. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A554.

AB  - Objective: The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health clinical trials network was funded by the National Institutes of Health to find new ways to alleviate the most common, bothersome menopausal symptoms by designing and conducting multiple concurrent clinical intervention studies, accommodating a wide scope of populations and intervention strategies.Methods: Trials were conducted in Boston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Oakland, Philadelphia, and Seattle, with the Data Coordinating Center in Seattle, and were designed with standardized eligibility criteria and endpoints. Primary outcomes focused on vasomotor symptoms, sleep quality and insomnia symptoms, and vaginal symptoms. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, sexual function, and mood.Results: We completed five randomized clinical trials and three ancillary studies, testing nine interventions in over 1,300 women and collecting nearly 16,000 bio-specimens. Escitalopram, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release, and low-dose estradiol diminished hot flashes by approximately 50% as compared with a 30% decrease by placebo. No benefits on vasomotor symptoms were observed with yoga or exercise compared with usual activity, nor with omega-3 supplementation compared with placebo. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia reduced self-reported insomnia symptoms and improved overall sleep quality compared with menopause education control. We did not find significant benefit from a vaginal estradiol tablet or a vaginal moisturizer compared with placebo tablet and gel in diminishing the severity of vaginal symptoms.Conclusions: The MsFLASH trials contributed substantially to our understanding of bothersome menopausal symptom treatment. It is important that clinicians counseling women about available treatment options consider all therapies-both nonhormonal and hormonal.

AB  - Poor sleep is frequently reported by women during the menopausal transition period. Difficulties with sleep can affect women's physical and emotional health as well as their overall quality of life. Investigators have found that there is a correlation between a woman's menopausal history and poor sleep; however, there are differences within each menopausal stage. In this short review, we examine a recent secondary analysis study of quality of sleep and risk factors for poor sleep among women ages 45 to 54 years. It is important for nurses to appreciate the impact of sleep disturbance on women's health and quality of life and to help them make informed decisions about the management options best for them.

AB  - Increasing numbers of women experience early menopause due in part to surgical treatment for benign gynecologic disorders and the rise in risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, the adverse health consequences of early loss of ovarian function accelerate the menopausal state and affect multiple systems, including cardiovascular, neurologic, bone, and connective tissue, and affect quality of life owing to vasomotor symptoms, mood, sleep, and sexual function. Yet many clinicians and women remain reluctant to use hormone therapy because of the Women's Health Initiative's adverse findings, even though they are not applicable to women with early menopause. This review examines the effects of early menopause and highlights the critical role of hormone therapy in this population.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of poor sleep and its risk factors for adults living in a suburban area of Shanghai with rapid urbanization.Methods: A total of 37,545 residents who were aged 20 to 74 years and from the "Peak Program," a community-based natural population cohort study, were included. Data on demographics, lifestyle, and physical health-related factors were collected using a face-to-face questionnaire interview. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and poor sleep was defined as a PSQI score above 7.Results: The overall mean of PSQI score was 3.69 ± 2.57 while the prevalence of poor sleep was 8.3%. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was higher in participants who were older than 40 years, had less education, smoked tobacco, had anxiety, and had a chronic disease (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for confounding, a logistic regression model indicated that poor sleep was associated with advanced age, smoking, anxiety, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and other chronic diseases (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In addition, compared to women who were premenopausal, the naturally postmenopausal women (OR 1.675, 95% CI 1.44-1.94) and induced menopausal women (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.81-2.82) were more likely to report poor sleep.Conclusion: The prevalence of poor sleep among individuals who lived in the Songjiang District of Shanghai and were aged 20 to 74 years was remarkably lower than in the general population of China. Poor sleep was generally more common in middle-aged and elderly residents and in those suffering from anxiety and chronic diseases. Regular exercise, anxiety relieving, and treatment improvement of different chronic diseases may help sleep better.

AB  - This study analyzed the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and associated factors among Cambodian women. A cross-sectional study was performed with 200 women aged 40–60 years in three provinces and one urban area in Cambodia from July 2017 to August 2017. Three symptom categories: somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms (totaling 11 symptoms) related to menopause were assessed using the Khmer version of Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Over one-fifth (21.5%) of the participants were premenopausal; 22.5% were perimenopausal, and 56% were postmenopausal. Somatic and psychological symptoms occurred more frequently than urogenital symptoms in all three statuses. The three most prevalent symptoms for all women were physical and mental exhaustion (88.1%), irritability (85.9%), and sleep problems (82.5%). The average MRS score was 12.22 ± 5.37 (range 0–44). Postmenopausal women had significantly higher rates of menopausal symptoms than pre- and perimenopausal women. Increased severity of menopausal symptoms was associated with less personal income (≤100 US$), higher parity (>4 children), abortion(s), use of calcium supplements, and history of heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. This study demonstrated a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms among Cambodian women in Cambodia. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to deal with independent factors associated with these symptoms.

AB  - Background: Impaired sleep is common in menopausal women. The aim was to examine associations between uses of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and sleep disturbance in a large population sample.Methods: Female participants aged 45 to 75 years were selected from the Norwegian Health Study in Nord-Trøndelag (HUNT3, 2006-2008) (N = 13,060). Data were linked to the Norwegian Prescription Database, identifying use of prescribed MHT and use of sleep medication. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression.Results: In total, 996 women used systemic MHT (7.6%), with the highest prevalence of 10.3% among women 55 to 64 years of age. Despite high reports of frequent nocturnal awakening (24.7%) and high reports of hot flashes, use of MHT was low in this large population based survey. Although MHT use was associated with more sleep disturbance in unadjusted analyses, the association was not significant after adjusting for relevant covariates. Using sleep medication, reporting poor health, tobacco and alcohol use, doing daily exercise, having higher levels of anxiety, and being less satisfied with life were factors showing the strongest associations with sleep disturbance.Conclusion: The lack of association between MHT and sleep disturbance suggests that other factors, such as self-perceived good health, a healthy lifestyle and anxiety/depression, are more relevant to sleep than MHT.

AB  - Introduction: Major depression is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk. We have previously shown that severe insomnia, a core symptom of major depression episode (MDE), is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, a component of metabolic syndrome, in women but not in men with major depression. Since insomnia is related to cardiovascular morbidity in the general population and major depression also, our objective was to assess the link between insomnia and metabolic syndrome, a marker syndrome of cardiovascular risk, during MDE, in women and in men.Methods: In 624 patients with a current MDE cohort, both insomnia and metabolic syndrome were assessed in women and men. Insomnia was rated from 0 to 6 based on the HDRS corresponding items, severe insomnia being defined by a total insomnia score ≥4.Results: severe insomnia was associated with metabolic syndrome in women but not in men. In multivariate logistic regressions, these results in women were independent from age, educational level, major depressive disorder duration and current smoking. These results were only significant in women aged ≥50 years, a cut-off age for menopausal status but not in women under 50 years.Conclusion: Women aged ≥50 years with a severe insomnia during MDE have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Severe insomnia may be a clinical marker of metabolic risk in this population. They should be particularly monitored for metabolic syndrome and may benefit from sleep recommendations and cardiovascular prevention.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and sleep disturbances are both common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Compared with men, women are more likely to report insufficient sleep. During the 2018 Research Conference on Sleep and the Health of Women sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, researchers in cardiology, integrative physiology and sleep medicine reviewed the current understanding of how sleep and sleep disturbances influence CVD in women across the lifespan. Women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of sleep disturbances at important stages of their life, including during pregnancy and after menopause. The proposed pathways linking sleep disturbances and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women are numerous and the complex interaction between them is not well understood. Future research focused on understanding the scope of sleep disorders in women, defining the underlying mechanisms, and testing interventions to improve sleep are critical for improving the cardiovascular health of all women.

AB  - Poor sleep is one of the most frequent health concerns among menopausal women. All stages of sleep can be impacted by the menopause transition. Negative outcomes of poor sleep are multidimensional and include poor physical, psychological, cognition, and social outcomes. Hypnosis is a nonpharmacological treatment for poor sleep and hot flashes in menopausal women. The goal of hypnosis is to educate and train subjects to perform self-hypnosis to alleviate the underlying symptom. The use of hypnosis as a treatment for poor sleep has shown benefits for both acute and chronic insomnia. Initial findings from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) Hypnosis Intervention for Sleep in Menopause: Examination of Optimal Dose and Method of Delivery randomized control trial of 90 women were presented. Results showed that program and treatment satisfaction were high in all groups, adherence to daily practice met or exceeded adherence benchmarks. There were significant reduction of poor sleep quality in all groups with a significant increase in minutes slept in all groups. The majority of women also showed clinical improvements of duration. There were clinically meaningful improvements in reducing the perception of poor sleep quality in 50%–77% of women across time. Overall, the use of self-hypnosis as a treatment program for sleep problems related to menopause was acceptable for women. Data further support that hypnosis is a promising technique to improve sleep in menopausal women with sleep and hot flashes. Further research is ongoing on self-hypnosis delivery and implementation into wider populations of women using clear definition and control groups.

AB  - Objective: Investigate temporal patterns of sleep maintenance problems in women who became surgically menopausal (hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy) before their final menstrual period and examine whether presurgery trajectories of sleep maintenance problems are related to problems staying asleep postsurgery.Methods: Longitudinal analysis of sleep self-reports collected every 1 to 2 years from 1996 to 2013 from 176 surgically menopausal women in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a seven-site community-based, multiethnic/multiracial, cohort study. Median follow-up was 15.3 years (4.2 years presurgery, 10.2 years postsurgery). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify patterns of problems staying asleep, and the presurgery trajectories were used to predict similar postsurgery sleep problems.Results: Four trajectory patterns of sleep maintenance problems were identified: low (33.5% of women), moderate (33.0%), increasing during presurgery (19.9%), and high (13.6%). One-fifth of women reported a presurgery increase in these problems. Postsurgically, problems staying asleep remained associated with similar levels of presurgical problems, even after adjusting for postsurgical early morning awakening, frequent vasomotor symptoms, and bodily pain score (βlow = -1.716, βmoderate = -1.144, βincreasing = -0.957, βhigh = -1.021; all P values <0.01).Conclusions: Sleep maintenance problems were relatively stable across time postsurgery. These data are remarkably consistent with our trajectory results across the natural menopause, suggesting that presurgical assessment of sleep concerns could help guide women's expectations postsurgically. Although reassuring that sleep complaints do not worsen postsurgically for most surgically menopausal women, referral to a sleep specialist should be considered if sleep symptoms persist or worsen after surgery.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep complaints are common during the menopause transition. However, it is difficult to disentangle changes in sleep related to aging from those directly due to menopause. We compared sleep disorders in 45 to 60-year-old women in a large population-based study, according to menopausal status.Methods: Women aged between 45 and 60 years who self-reported menopausal status were selected from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging, excluding those with prior hysterectomy. Participants completed assessments for overall sleep satisfaction, hours of daily sleep, sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintenance insomnia, daytime somnolence, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Each sleep variable was compared between postmenopausal and pre/perimenopausal women using multivariate regression, adjusting for potential confounders.Results: Among 6,179 women included, 3,713 (60.1%; age 55.7 ± 3.3 years) were postmenopausal and 2,466 (39.9%) were pre/perimenopausal (age 49.80 ± 3.1 years). Compared with pre/perimenopausal women, postmenopausal women were more often reported requiring ≥30 minutes to fall asleep (20.4% vs 15.5%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.53) and were more likely to meet criteria for possible sleep-onset insomnia disorder (10.8% vs 7.3%; AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07-2.12). Postmenopausal women were also more likely to screen positive for OSA (14.6% vs 10.4%; AOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.92). The two groups did not differ on sleep dissatisfaction (32.4% vs 29%), daytime somnolence disorder (1.6% vs 1.3%), sleep-maintenance insomnia disorder (17% vs 14.5%), RLS (23.5% vs 20.9%), or RBD (3.9% vs 4.0%).Conclusions: Menopause is associated with increased sleep-onset insomnia. Postmenopausal women also are more likely to screen positive for OSA. However, menopausal status is not associated with sleep maintenance, somnolence, or RLS, and RBD. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A501.

AB  - Introduction. Urinary incontinence (UI) constitutes involuntary leakage of urine and concerns an increasing number of women. It usually occurs in perimenopausal period; however, it may occur any time. Symptoms typical of incontinence cause massive discomfort that can affect the quality of life (QoL). Aim. The assessment of the QoL in women suffering from UI dependent on sociodemographic variables. Material and methods. The research encompassed 102 patients of the gynaecological wards of the Independent Clinical Hospital No 1 in Lublin and the Independent Public Clinical Hospital No 4 in Lublin. The inclusion criterion was as follows female patients diagnosed with urinary incontinence and treated in hospital. The study was voluntary and anonymous. The research project was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Lublin (No KE-0254/25/2016). The method of diagnostic survey was applied by means of the authors' own questionnaire and the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ). The statistical analysis of the data results was carried out and p<0.05 was assumed as statistically significant. Results. Age conditioned the QoL in the females researched regarding the influence of the urinary tract symptoms on their general health, partner relations and sleep. The females over 65 years of age showed worse QoL in comparison with the younger ones. Education did not affect the impact of urinary symptoms on the domains of the QoL using the KHQ. The marital status was a variable that influenced the respondents' QoL. The married women had better QoL than the widowed or divorced ones. The financial situation conditioned the impact of the urinary symptoms on their general health, physical condition and sleep. The females with the average financial situation had worse QoL than those with good financial situation. Conclusions. The QoL of women with UI depended on their age, marital status and financial situation. The females over 65 years of age who were widowed or divorced with the average financial situation were characterised by worse QoL than the younger and married women with good financial situation.

AB  - Objective Pain hypersensitivity has been described as one of the most disabling symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Here we analyzed the relationship between an anti-inflammatory diet profile and the pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of tender point sites and other fibromyalgia-related symptoms in patients with FMS. Methods This cross-sectional study included 95 women diagnosed with FMS and 98 menopause-status matched controls. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was calculated by conducting a 24-hour diet recall interview. The PPTs of tender point sites and self-reported global pain levels were evaluated by algometry and the visual analog scale, respectively. Disease severity, fatigue, sleep anxiety, and central sensitization were also evaluated. Results Linear regression analysis revealed that the PPTs of tender point sites including the occiput (β  = 0.234, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.016–0.452, P  =   0.036), trapezius (β  = 0.299, 95% CI = 0.083–0.515, P  =   0.007), zygapophyseal joint (β  = 0.291, 95% CI = 0.022–0.559, P  =   0.035), second rib (β  = 0.204, 95% CI = 0.060–0.348, P  =   0.006), gluteus (β  = 0.591, 95% CI = 0.110–1.072, P  =   0.017), greater trochanter (β  = 0.379, 95% CI = 0.016–0.742, P  =   0.041), and knee (β  = 0.482, 95% CI = 0.117–0.850, P  =   0.011) were associated with DII score after adjustments for the age, menopausal status, and global energy levels reported by the patients with FMS. No significant differences were found for the cases or controls between the DII score and the remaining clinical symptoms. Analyses of covariance showed that the PPTs of the aforementioned tender point sites were also significantly associated (P  <   0.05) with the DII score quartiles in patients with FMS, but no significant differences were found between these quartiles and the other clinical symptoms. Conclusions A pro-inflammatory diet was associated with pain hypersensitivity in patients with FMS.

AB  - Purpose: The hallmark menopausal symptom, vasomotor symptoms (VMS), has been linked to adverse health indicators. However, the relationship between VMS and biological aging has not been tested. We examined associations between menopausal VMS and biological aging as assessed by 2 DNA methylation-based epigenetic aging indicators previously linked to poor health outcomes.Methods: Participants were members of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study integrative genomics substudy (N = 1206) who had both ovaries and were not taking hormone therapy. Relationships between VMS at enrollment (presence, severity) or VMS timing groups (no VMS: not at menopause onset nor at study enrollment; early VMS: at menopause onset but not at enrollment; persistent VMS: at menopause onset and study enrollment; and late VMS: at enrollment but not at menopause onset) and epigenetic clock indicators predictive of physical aging and early death (DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge) were tested in linear regression models adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, hysterectomy, education, body mass index, smoking, and, in additional models, sleep disturbance.Results: Women were on average 65 years of age at enrollment. Severe hot flashes at enrollment were associated with higher DNAm PhenoAge [relative to no hot flashes: B (SE) = 2.79 (1.27), P = 0.028, multivariable]. Further, late-occurring VMS were associated with both higher DNAm PhenoAge [B (SE) = 2.15 (0.84), P = 0.011] and DNAm GrimAge [B (SE) = 1.09 (0.42), P = 0.010, multivariable] relative to no VMS.Main Conclusions: Among postmenopausal women, severe or late-occurring VMS were associated with accelerated epigenetic age, controlling for chronological age. Postmenopausal women with severe or late-occurring VMS may have greater underlying epigenetic aging.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown that aromatherapy improve health problems related to anxiety, depression, heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep. However, the effect of aromatherapy in women who suffer from menopausal syndrome and its specific effects on HRV and sleep quality are unknown. Purpose: This study designed an aromatherapy intervention and evaluated its effect on menopausal syndrome, HRV, and sleep quality in women. Methods: This double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a medical center hospital. A total of 84 participants who met the study criteria were randomly assigned using permuted block randomization. The experimental group received a 20-min inhalation of essential oil and the control group received a 20-min inhalation of sweet almond oil every night for 4 weeks. Posttest data was collected at 2 weeks after completion of the intervention. Data were collected using the Green Menopausal Symptom Scale, HRV device, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: After adjusting for age, the results of the generalized estimation equations (GEE) showed that all outcomes were significantly different in both the experimental group and the control group (p < .05) for the interaction effect of group and time, and that the outcome of sleep quality on the 2nd week in the control group was not significantly different (p = .066). Conclusions/ Implications for Practice: This study supports that the 4-week aromatherapy intervention improves menopausal symptoms, the activity of autonomic nervous systems, and sleep quality in women with no adverse side effects. In the future, this intervention may be applied in outpatient departments to promote the health of menopausal women.

AB  - Objective: Weight gain and increased body fat mass are among the common complications of menopause. In addition to hormonal changes, behavioral and environmental factors aggravate transition through this phase. This study uses a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate factors associated with overweight and obesity in menopausal women.Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 4,471 women (pre/perimenopausal 3,150, menopausal 1,321) from baseline data of the Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort study in the west region of Iran in 2018. Obesity and overweight were the outcome variables. SEM was used to examine the relationships, using IBM SPSS, AMOS version 23.Results: The mean body fat percentage and visceral fat area in menopausal women was significantly greater than among pre/perimenopause women. The direct association of higher socioeconomic status (SES) with a healthy dietary pattern was stronger among pre/perimenopausal women than among menopausal women (ß = 0.574 vs ß = 0.552). In both groups, less physical activity was associated with depression and musculoskeletal disorders, and this association was stronger in menopausal women (ß = -0.174 vs ß = -0.215; P > 0.05). Overweight and obesity were directly decreased (ß = -0.011, P > 0.05) and indirectly increased (ß = 0.013, P > 0.05) in pre/perimenopausal women by sleep duration, but they were directly and indirectly decreased in menopausal women.Conclusions: The direct and indirect effects of well-known risk factors associated with overweight and obesity were found to be different in pre/perimenopausal and menopausal groups. Some risk factors showed stronger effects among menopausal women compared with the pre/perimenopausal women. Physical activity and healthy dietary pattern had a mediator impact in the two study groups.

AB  - There are suggestions that the loss of female sex hormones following menopause is critical for the development or progression of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). We conducted a review of the literature on the role of menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in SDB risk. There is an increase in SDB during the menopausal transition period, but data on an effect beyond that of increasing age and changes in body habitus are weak or absent. Early community-based, observational studies reported a protective effect by HRT on SDB prevalence, but this could possibly be explained as a healthy user effect. Interventional studies of the effect of HRT on SDB are sparse, with only a few randomized placebo-controlled studies, often performed on small samples of women without clinically significant SDB. HRT regimens have varied and all the studies are fairly old. They do not definitely assure the alleviation of SDB and HRT cannot thus be recommended as treatment for SDB. It is concluded that there is no evidence that female sex hormone changes during menopause per se are able to explain the increase in SDB in midlife women and conclusions on the effect of HRT on SDB cannot be drawn from the current literature.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of low-energy fracture of wrist, hip, and spine and the related risk factors in Chinese populations 50 years or older.This study was a part of the Chinese National Fracture Survey (CNFS) carried out in 8 Chinese provinces in 2015. Data on 154,099 Chinese men and women 50 years or older were extracted from the CNFS database for calculations and analyses. Low-energy fracture was defined as fracture caused by slip, trip, or falls from standing height.A total of 247 patients sustained low-energy fractures in 2014, indicating the incidence rate was 160.3/100,000 person-years, with 120.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 95.5-144.5] and 213.1(95% CI, 180.7-245.6)/100,000 person-years in men and women, respectively. In men, advanced age, alcohol consumption, residence at second floor or above without elevator, sleep duration <7 h/day, and history of past fracture were identified to be significant risk factors for low-energy fractures. In women, advanced age, living in east region, higher latitude zone (40°N -49.9°N), alcohol consumption, more births, sleep duration <7 h/day, and history of past fracture were identified as significant risk factors. Supplementation of calcium or vitamin D or both was identified to be associated with reduced risk of fracture in women (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.75), but not in men.These epidemiologic data on low-energy fractures provided updated clinical evidence base for national healthcare planning and preventive efforts in China. Corresponding interventions such as decreasing alcohol consumption and sleep improvement should clearly be implemented. For women, especially those with more births and past history of fracture, routine screening of osteoporosis, and intensive nourishment since menopause should be advocated.

AB  - This review presents data on changes in the physiology of sleep during reproductive aging. It is noted that insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are the main sleep disorders. The results of foreign and domestic studies in the field of free radical oxidation during sleep deprivation in animal models are presented, indicating the dependence of processes on the duration of sleep deprivation. The largest number of studies of free radical processes in a person with somnological pathology was carried out in the study of OSAS. Blood, urine, saliva, condensate of exhaled air can be biomaterial for determining the parameters of free radical oxidation. It was shown that the intensity of oxidative stress depends on the severity of OSAS, as evidenced by the positive correlation of the level of active products of thiobarbituric acid, the products of oxidation of proteins and carbonyl groups with the apnea/hypopnea index, determining the development of not only oxidative, but also carbonyl stress in patients with a severe degree OSAS. Biomarkers such as thioredoxin, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and reduced iron have shown a more stable relationship between increased oxidative stress and OSA. Despite the results obtained, the question of the association of oxidative stress and hypoxia in OSA remains debatable, which is associated with the opposite results of some studies. Insomnia, which occurs mainly in females, is accompanied by a high level of end products of lipid peroxidation with a decrease in the activity of antioxidants such as paraoxonase, an enzymatic component of the glutathione system. Along with this, menopausal women present low levels of uric acid, which correlates with high scores of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index questionnaire. Recent studies have identified an association between the activity of the «lipoperoxidation – antioxidants» system and the Clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism in menopausal Caucasian women, indicating the protective role of the minor allele.
AB  - В данном обзоре представлены данные об изменениях физиологии сна при репродуктивном старении. Отмечено, что основными нарушениями сна являются инсомнические расстройства и синдром обструк- тивного апноэ сна (СОАС). Представлены результаты зарубежных и отечественных исследований в области свободнорадикального окисления при депривации сна на животных моделях, свидетельствую- щие о зависимости процессов от длительности депривации сна. Наибольшее количество исследований свободнорадикальных процессов на человеке с сомнологической патологией проведено при изучении СОАС. Биоматериалом для определения параметров свободнорадикального окисления могут быть кровь, моча, слюна, конденсат выдыхаемого воздуха. Показано, что интенсивность окислительного стресса зависит от степени тяжести СОАС, о чём свидетельствуют положительные корреляции уровня активных про- дуктов тиобарбитуровой кислоты, продуктов окисления белков и карбонильных групп с индексом апноэ/ гипопноэ, определяя развитие не только окислительного, но и карбонильного стресса у пациентов с тяжёлой степенью СОАС. Такие биомаркеры, как тиоредоксин, малоновый диальдегид, супероксиддисму- таза и восстановленное железо показали более устойчивую связь между повышенным окислительным стрессом и СОАС. Несмотря на полученные результаты, вопрос об ассоциации окислительного стрес- са и гипоксии при СОАС остаётся дискутабельным, что связано с полученными противоположными результатами некоторых исследований. Инсомния, встречающаяся в основном у лиц женского пола, сопровождается высоким содержанием уровня конечных продуктов перекисного окисления липидов со снижением активности таких антиоксидантов, как параоксоназа, ферментативное звено глутатио- новой системы. Наравне с этим у менопаузальных женщин отмечается низкий уровень мочевой кисло- ты, коррелирующий с высокими баллами Питтсбургского опросника индекса качества сна. Последними исследованиями выявлена ассоциация активности системы «липопероксидация – антиоксиданты» и полиморфизма 3111Т/С гена Clock у менопаузальных женщин европеоидной расы, свидетельствующая о защитной роли минорного аллеля.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ingestion of tomato before bed on obese postmenopausal women's urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) level and sleep quality. We quantified melatonin concentrations in beefsteak tomato, black tomato, and two commercial tomato juices and found that beefsteak tomato contained the highest level of melatonin. In this 8-week open-label, randomized controlled dietary intervention trial, 36 subjects completed the entire trial. The tomato group ate 250 g of beefsteak tomatoes 2 h before sleep for 8 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected at the baseline and in the 8th week and were analyzed. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in the tomato group significantly decreased with time (p for trend = 0.0297). After 8 weeks of the beefsteak intervention, all components of the PSQI in tomato group had significantly improved, and their aMT6s level was 10-fold significantly higher than that of the control group. Therefore, supplementation with beefsteak tomato before sleep can increase circulating melatonin and improve sleep quality in obese postmenopausal women.

AB  - Background: Interest in herbal medicines and non-hormonal therapies for the treatment of menopausal symptoms has increased since the publication of adverse effects of estrogen replacement therapy. Vasomotor symptoms are the most characteristic and notable symptoms of menopause. Objective: To investigate the changes in the frequency and severity of hot flush and associated vasomotor symptoms experienced by peri-menopausal and menopausal women supplemented with the herbal formulation (Nu-femme™) comprising Labisia pumila (SLP+®) and Eurycoma longifolia (Physta®) or placebo. Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week study enrolled 119 healthy women aged 41-55 years experiencing peri-menopausal or menopausal symptoms and supplemented with Nu-femme™ or placebo. The primary endpoint was comparative changes between treatment groups in the change in the frequency and severity of hot flushes. The secondary objectives were to assess the changes in the frequency and severity of joint pain, Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire domain scores. Concentrations of serum hormone, lipid profile, bone markers, sleep quality and vitality were also studied as secondary objectives. Results: At week 12, significant (P < 0.01) improvements in hot flush symptoms were observed in Nu-femme™ and placebo groups. Even though there was no significant difference between groups, higher percentage of improvement, 65%, was seen in Nu-femme™ compared to 60% in placebo. Significant improvements (P < 0.001) in MRS and MENQOL scores at weeks 12 and 24 were observed in both groups, respectively. Luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) at weeks 12 and 24, respectively, compared to baseline in the Nu-femme™ group, with no significant changes observed in the placebo group. There were significant (P < 0.05) reductions in serum low-density lipid and triglycerides levels at week 12 in Nu-femme™ group, but no changes seen in placebo group. At the end of week 24, changes in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters remained within normal clinical ranges in both groups. Conclusion: Herbal formulation consists of L. pumila and E. longifolia (Nu-femme™) may support reduction in hot flushes and improvements in hormone and lipid profile in healthy peri-menopausal and menopausal women.

AB  - Background & Aim: Menopause is a period in women’s lives with complications and consequences that can reduce the quality of life. The most common complications are vasomotor disorders which can affect sleep, life enjoyment, social activities and work. The usual treatment for these effects is hormone therapy but due to its side effects, most people tend to have complication-free treatments. One of these strategies is nutritional measures. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of group counseling about the nutritional measures of Iranian traditional medicine on vasomotor disorders in postmenopausal women. Methods & Materials: This clinical trial study with multistage sampling was performed in 2018-2019 on 62 postmenopausal women referred to health center number 2 in Mashhad. Two health centers were selected as control or intervention group by Heads or Tails method in order to prevent the dissemination of the material. The intervention group received three sessions of the group counseling about the nutritional measures of Iranian traditional medicine. There was no intervention for the control group. The data collection tool was a questionnaire on the quality of life in menopause that was completed two months before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed on the SPSS software version 24 using independent t-test, Chi-square, Mann- Whitney, and Wilcoxon tests. Results: There was no significant difference in the mean score of vasomotor between the two groups before the intervention (P>0.05) but after the intervention, the difference between the mean score of vasomotor before and after the intervention was -2.18±4.08 for the intervention group and 0.59±3.30 for the control group. A significant decrease in the vasomotor score was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group (P<0.001). Conclusion: Group counseling about the nutritional measures of Iranian traditional medicine can help reduce vasomotor disorders.

AB  - Background: Recent attention has highlighted the common occurrence and health consequences of military sexual trauma (MST) in younger women veterans. However, almost nothing is known about MST in older veterans.Objective: To describe MST among older women veterans, including prevalence and common comorbidities.Design: Cross-sectional observational study, using data from national Department of Veterans Affairs medical records.Participants: Population-based sample of women Veterans aged 55+ with at least one documented MST screen response and at least one clinical encounter in fiscal years 2005-2015.Main Measures: MST screen: medical diagnoses (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, obesity, chronic pain conditions, back pain, dementia, insomnia, sleep apnea, menopause symptoms) and mental health diagnoses (anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, tobacco use, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, opioid use disorder, suicidal ideation) from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification codes in the medical record.Key Results: In this cohort of older women veterans (n = 70,864, mean age 65.8 ± 10.4 years), 13% had a positive MST screen. In multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and marital status, MST was strongly associated with most mental health diagnoses, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 7.25, 95% CI 6.84-7.68), depression (OR 2.39, 95% CI 2.28-2.50), and suicidal ideation (OR 2.42, 95% CI 2.08-2.82). MST was also associated with multiple medical conditions, particularly sleep disorders (insomnia OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.43-1.82; sleep apnea OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.37-1.61) and pain (chronic pain OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.50-1.67; back pain OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.34-1.47).Conclusions: A history of MST is common among older women veterans and associated with a range of medical and mental health diagnoses. These findings call attention to the need for additional research in this understudied population, and the importance of trauma-informed care approaches for women across the lifespan.

AB  - The reproductive function of humans is regulated by several sex hormones which are secreted in synergy with the circadian timing of the body. Sleep patterns produce generic signatures that physiologically drive the synthesis, secretion, and metabolism of hormones necessary for reproduction. Sleep deprivation among men and women is increasingly reported as one of the causes of infertility. In animal models, sleep disturbances impair the secretion of sexual hormones thereby leading to a decrease in testosterone level, reduced sperm motility and apoptosis of the Leydig cells in male rats. Sleep deprivation generates stressful stimuli intrinsically, due to circadian desynchrony and thereby increases the activation of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis, which, consequently, increases the production of corticosterone. The elevated level of corticosteroids results in a reduction in testosterone production. Sleep deprivation produces a commensurate effect on women by reducing the chances of fertility. Sleeplessness among female shift workers suppresses melatonin production as well as excessive HPA activation which results in early pregnancy loss, failed embryo implantation, anovulation and amenorrhea. Sleep deprivation in women has also be found to be associated with altered gonadotropin and sex steroid secretion which all together lead to female infertility. Poor quality of sleep is observed in middle-aged and older men and this also contributes to reduced testosterone concentrations. The influence of sleep disturbances post-menopausal is associated with irregular synthesis and secretion of female sex steroid hormones.

AB  - Objective: Review relationships among circadian clocks, core body temperature (CBT), and fertility in women. Methods: Scoping literature review. Results: Circadian clocks are a ubiquitous adaptation to the most predictable environmental events -- the daily cycles of light and dark. Core body temperature (CBT) also follows a circadian rhythm. Additionally, CBT is tightly controlled by a combination of neuronal circuits that begin in the hypothalamus and involve many other portions of the brain as well as a wide range of peripheral mechanisms. In women with normal reproductive function, the diurnal temperature pattern for CBT is strongly influenced by the menstrual cycle of reproductive hormones, primarily estradiol and progesterone, which modulate the activity of hypothalamic neural circuits involved in body temperature control, resulting in an infradian CBT rhythm. Conclusions: Analysis of CBT via continuous recording reveals patterns in the interactions of circadian and infradian CBT rhythms capable of accurately predicting the fertility window and hormonal patterns suggesting oligo-ovulation and subfertility. New wearable technologies can facilitate employment of hormone-associated changes in CBT for pregnancy planning and offer clinical insight to infertility and menopause.

AB  - Objective To determine whether menstruation education in high school students leads to changes in self-care to manage menstrual pain and to determine factors that influence such changes in self-care. Subjects and Methods The use of 23 self-care items was compared between immediately after and three months after intervention via menstruation education in 124 female students at High School A using a self-administered questionnaire. Results There were significant differences in the number of students performing seven of the 23 self-care activities between immediately after and three months after education: [Keep a menstrual cycle record] (p=0.004), [Lie down] (p<0.001), [Massage the abdominal and lower back area] (p=0.004), [Get enough sleep] (p=0.029), [Visit the hospital] (p=0.021), [Soak in a bath] (p=0.031), and [Eat three meals a day] (p=0.041). In analyzing associations between the status of performing self-care activities after education and physical, psychological, and social factors, students with the physical factor "menstrual pain" carried out significantly more self-care activities three months after education than immediately after education, compared to those without menstrual pain (p=0.025). Significant associations were not detected for other factors. Three items showed significant associations between changes in the number of students performing each of the 23 self-care items from immediately after to three months after education and physical, psychological, and social factors. Significantly more students with "someone who takes care of me or cares about me when I am unwell" vs. those without performed the activity [Keep a menstrual cycle record] three months after intervention (p=0.022). Similarly, significantly more students with "menstrual pain" vs. those without performed the activity [Massage the abdominal and lower back area] three months after intervention (p=0.045). On the other hand, significantly fewer students without "someone who provides me with information" vs. those with performed the activity [Eat three meals a day] three months after intervention (p=0.005). Conclusion Menstruation education in students with menstrual pain leads to changes in self-care to manage menstrual pain. The significance of "menstrual pain" and "status of menstruation support" as factors that aid in carrying out and continuing self-care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is an important recovery period for athletes. In general, women are not satisfied with their sleep quality, which is also true for female soccer players, although the reasons remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to confirm sex difference in sleep quality among athletes from various fields of sport, and to investigate factors related to poor subjective sleep quality in male and female athletes. METHODS: We collected data concerning subjective sleep quality, measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), from athletes who were 16 to 40 years of age and played various types of sports. Data concerning their sports, lifestyle, and sleep issues and sleep environments, and also menstrual issues for females, were collected. RESULTS: Data from 207 male athletes and 215 female athletes were assessed. Among them, 31.4% of men and 48.8% of women had poor subjective sleep quality (i.e., PSQ1≥6). In male athletes, witnessed apnea, episodes of disorientation or confusion during the time of sleep, long time gap between dinner and bedtime, and turning on the heating in the winter, were identified as factors associated with poor sleep quality by multivariate analysis, whereas in female athletes, bathing close to bedtime, habitual drinking, and being annoyed by noises at bedtime were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In both populations, females had poorer subjective sleep quality than males. Sex differences exist in factors associated with poor subjective sleep quality. Thus, different approaches should be considered to improve their sleep quality.

AB  - Objectives: Results from our recently conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicated that Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), with or without therapist support, is effective in reducing the perceived impact of hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS) and overall levels of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors with treatment-induced menopausal symptoms.Study Design: We used data of 235 women and compared the iCBT groups combined (n = 156) with the control group (n = 79). Bootstrapped multiple regression analyses with interaction terms (group x potential moderator) or indirect effects (mediation pathway) were conducted.Main Outcome Measures: Reductions in perceived impact of HF/NS and overall levels of menopausal symptoms.Results: Women with lower levels of education benefited most from the iCBT. Age, time since diagnosis, current endocrine treatment, oophorectomy, frequency of HF/NS, and psychological distress did not moderate the treatment effects. Factors that mediated treatment effects were the development of healthier beliefs about experiencing hot flushes in a social context, about the impact of night sweats on sleep and daily functioning, and about the ability to control and cope with hot flushes. The acquisition of behavioral coping strategies and decreased psychological distress did not mediate treatment effects.Conclusion: The results suggest that women with lower levels of education may benefit most from the current iCBT program, with or without therapist support. The development of healthier HF/NS beliefs contribute significantly to the observed positive effect of iCBT on the burden of menopausal symptoms.Clinical Trial Information: NCT02672189.

AB  - Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Background: Previous studies demonstrated a short-term relationship between infant sleep–wake states and oral feeding performance, with state being an indication of infants' neurobehavioral readiness for feeding. However, the relationship between sleep–wake states and feeding skills has not been evaluated longitudinally during hospitalization. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine preterm infants' sleep–wake state developmental trajectories and their associations with feeding progression during hospitalization. Methods: This descriptive and exploratory study was a secondary analysis using data from a longitudinal two-group, randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of early and late cycled light on health and developmental outcomes among extremely preterm infants who were born ≤28 weeks of gestational age. Sleep–wake states were assessed for two 2-hour interfeeding periods per day (day and night hours), 30 weeks postmenstrual age, and every 3 weeks until discharge. Occurrences of active sleep, quiet sleep, and waking were recorded every 10 seconds. Feeding progression was assessed based on an infant's postmenstrual age at five milestones: first enteral feeding, full enteral feeding, first oral feeding, half oral feeding, and full oral feeding. Trajectory analyses were used to describe developmental changes in sleep–wake states, feeding progression patterns, and associations between feeding progression and sleep–wake trajectories. Results: Active sleep decreased while waking, and quiet sleep increased during hospitalization. Two distinct feeding groups were identified: typical and delayed feeding progression. In infants with delayed feeding progression, rates of active and quiet sleep development during the day were delayed compared to those with typical feeding progression. We also found that infants with delayed feeding progression were more likely to be awake more often during the night compared to infants with typical feeding progression. Discussions: Findings suggest that delays in sleep–wake state development may be associated with delays in feeding progression during hospitalization. Infants with delayed feeding skill development may require more environmental protection to further support their sleep development.

AB  - Most women experiencing menopause have sought out traditional treatment options to relieve their symptoms. The aim of this study, which used a web-based survey, was to investigate perceptions of Korean medicine doctors (KMDs) on managing menopausal symptoms with herbal medicines. We developed and then sent a questionnaire via email to a total 497 KMDs in obstetrics and gynecology affiliated with the Society of Korean Medicine. The questionnaire consisted of three categories and a total of 26 items focusing on major menopausal symptoms, prescriptions, pattern identification, and background characteristics. Out of the 497 KMDs, we received responses from 48 doctors, a response rate of 9.7%. The most common symptoms of menopausal disorder perceived by responded KMDs were hot flashes (22.9%), sleep disorders (18.2%), systemic fatigue (12.5%), and sweating (12.0%). The herbal medicines reported to be the most effective when treating patients with menopausal disorders were Jiawei shaoyao-san (12.5%), Jiawei guipi-decoction (11.8%). The responding KMDs recommended one to two months of treatment for female menopausal disorder, using two to three doses of herbal medicine per day in combination with traditional Korean medicine (KM) therapies such as acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, and pharmacopuncture. The results of this survey may provide information about doctor's perceptions on using herbal medicines to manage patient's menopausal symptoms. Future studies should be done with a larger sample size to overcome the limitation of this study and to examine how KM is used for treating menopausal symptoms in clinical practice.

AB  - Although pubertal timing is gradually becoming earlier in Japan, support as for physical and mental health among children experiencing earlier puberty than their peers is inadequate. To better understand health and life satisfaction in seventh grade students (age 12–13 years), examination of relationships between health outcomes and pubertal timing, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors is necessary. Participants of the Toyama Birth Cohort Study (4,752 males and 4,740 females) answered questions regarding school year of onset of voice break for boys and menarche for girls, sleep quality, mental health difficulties, overall health, quality of life (QOL), and lifestyle. Relationship between health outcomes and pubertal timing was examined using binary logistic regression analysis. Earlier pubertal timing was associated with four health-related outcomes. For poor sleep quality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of fourth grade males and crude OR of fifth grade females were statistically significant. Regarding mental health difficulties, the crude OR of fifth grade males and adjusted OR of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade females were statistically significant. Associations between poor overall health and fourth grade males and fourth or fifth grade females were observed. For poor QOL, the adjusted OR of fourth grade males and females was statistically significant. Relationships between earlier pubertal timing and poor sleep quality, mental health difficulties, poor physical health, and poor QOL were observed. To improve children's quality of life, support from teachers and school doctors and nurses is needed—especially for children with earlier pubertal timing.

AB  - Purpose: The study aimed to examine the effects of sleep pattern, stress, and attitude towards menstruation, and behavior that causes a reduction in exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the course of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in female adolescents. Method: In total, 200 girls attending middle school in K city were recruited via convenience sampling between December 11 and 31, 2018, and 192 subjects were selected for the analysis. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, an independent t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple regression. Results: Overall, 9 (4.7%), 152 (79.2%), and 31 (16.1%) students had morning-, intermediate-, and evening-type sleep pattern, respectively. The mean scores for school-related stress were highest. Scores for stress regarding relationships with friends were the lowest. The mean score for attitudes toward menstruation was 72.33 out of 147. The mean score for behavior that led to a reduction in EDCs exposure was 56.57 out of 85. The mean scores for PMS severity were 25.30 and 38.39 out of 60. Analysis of factors affecting PMS revealed that severity of menstrual pain (β=.28), use of analgesics during menstruation (β=.17), family history of PMS (β=-.16), stress (β=.19), and behavior that reduces EDCs exposure (β=-.17) exerted significant effects on PMS. The explanatory power of these variables was 37%. Conclusion: The findings propose the necessity of a health intervention program including educational information, which can reduce PMS in adolescents, induce the behaviors which can decrease exposure to EDCs, and activities for managing the stress levels.

AB  - Objective: To provide a greater understanding of the expectations, symptoms and impact of the menopause among women and their partners. Study design: Three online surveys were conducted among women aged ≥45 years with menopause symptoms (currently or within previous 10 years). Two questionnaires focussed on symptoms and treatments and were conducted before (Survey 1, 2015; n = 1000) and after (Survey 2, 2016, n = 1000) publication of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) menopause guidelines. Survey 3 (2017) focussed on the psychosocial impact of the menopause and was also conducted among partners (women n = 650; partners n = 350). Results: Women experienced an average of seven symptoms; 42% reported them to be worse than expected. Approximately one-fifth of women were not expecting common symptoms, such as sleep disturbance and cognitive problems, and were uncertain how long symptoms could last. A significant proportion of women reported negative effects on work and relationships. There was a reluctance to talk openly about the menopause or consult a healthcare professional (HCP). Partners expressed a desire to provide support but were unsure how to do so. Often women felt isolated and 41% considered the information and support available to them was insufficient. Only 3% of women were aware of the NICE guidelines but the majority (66%) were interested in learning more. Conclusions: These findings underscore the knowledge gaps and lack of support for women impacted by the menopause. Improved HCP training and education is required to ensure that high-quality menopause support can be accessed as standard.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among women worldwide, with rising incidence numbers. In Belgium, one out of eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Fortunately, 80% of those breast cancer patients will still be alive 10 years after diagnosis due to improvements in screening and treatment strategies. However, an important portion of the breast cancer survivors (BCS) will face side effects, such as sleep disturbances, long after treatment ends. It has been demonstrated that untreated insomnia in BCS negatively impacts mood, physical symptoms, pain sensitivity, fatigue, and quality of life. Furthermore, insomnia is increasingly considered an independent risk factor for future depression in BCS. The importance of understanding sleep disturbances in cancer populations has been highlighted and recognized as warranting further research. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence and the risk factors for the development of sleep disturbances in BCS.Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and PEDro were systematically screened for studies encompassing data regarding the prevalence or risk factors of sleep disturbances in BCS. If possible, meta-analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were undertaken based on the methodological quality, study design, type of sleep disturbance, and the use of a measurement tool with strong psychometric properties to investigate significant heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) across studies.Results: A total of 27 studies were found eligible. The pooled estimate for sleep disturbances prevalence is 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.29-0.52], I2 = 100%, p < 0.00001) and ranged from 0.14 (95% CI = [0.04-0.24]) to 0.93 (95% CI = [0.91-0.95]). Subgroup analyses did not reduce the heterogeneity among studies. Meta-analyses were performed for seven risk factors. Significant differences for the odds of developing sleep disturbances were found for hot flashes (pooled OR (ORp) 2.25, 95% CI = [1.64-3.08], I2 = 0%, p = 0.90), race (ORp 2.31, 95% CI = [1.56-3.42], I2 = 0%, p = 0.47), and menopause (ORp 1.84, 95% CI = [1.11-3.06], I2 = 0%, p = 0.70). After withdrawing the studies that did not rely on the use of a measurement tool with strong psychometric properties, pain (ORp 2.31, 95% CI = [1.36-3.92], I2 = 27%, p = 0.25), depressive symptoms (ORp 3.20, 95% CI [2.32-4.42], I2 = 0%, p = 0.63), and fatigue (ORp 2.82, 95% CI = [1.98-4.02], I2 = 0%, p = 0.60) became significant as well, with a substantial decrease of heterogeneity.Conclusion: Prevalence for sleep disturbances ranged from 0.14 to 0.93 with the vast majority of the studies investigating insomnia and sleep-wake disturbances. High heterogeneity makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Pain, depressive symptoms, hot flashes, fatigue, non-Caucasian race, and menopausal status were significantly associated with increased odds for developing sleep disturbances.

AB  - Purpose: To examine associations of daytime napping and diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal Chinese women.Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional.Setting: 2015 cross-sectional data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Participants were recruited from 150 counties/districts and 450 villages/resident committees.Participants: Six thousand nine hundred and forty women aged 45 years and older (mean age = 61 years) stratified by age and menopausal status.Measures: The outcome was self-reported diagnosed diabetes. The exposure was self-reported daytime napping (0, >0-≤60, or >60 min/d). Participants were stratified to middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal women according to their age (≤60 or >60 years) and menopausal status.Analysis: One-way analysis of variance and χ2 tests were conducted to explore differences on characteristics of middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal women. Multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for diagnosed diabetes according to daytime napping in the total sample, middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal Chinese women.Results: Participants' mean self-reported daytime napping duration was 34 minutes. Women who napped more than 60 minutes were more likely to report diagnosed diabetes (OR = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.76) comparing to those who did not nap, after adjusting for potential confounders. No statistical significance of interaction term between daytime napping and age/menopausal status was detected (P = .602 and P = .558) among total women. The stratified analysis revealed the significant association among middle-aged postmenopausal women napping more than 60 minutes (OR = 1.81, 95% CI, 1.18-2.77). The association, however, was found to be insignificant in middle-aged premenopausal women and older postmenopausal women.Conclusions: Long daytime nap (>60 min/d) was associated with diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged postmenopausal women in China.

AB  - Background: Menopause syndrome generally includes psychological problems. Group treatment delivered via the Internet and mobile phone (imGT) may improve women's physiological and psychological conditions.Objective: To investigate the efficacy of group cognitive behavioural therapy of menopause-related mood swings and quality of life, delivered face to face or via the Internet and mobile phone.Methods: This protocol is for a randomized controlled clinical trial with a sample of 140 menopausal women divided into 2 groups: imGT and face-to-face group treatment (ffGT). The primary outcome will be the improvement in the menopausal symptoms of the two groups, as assessed by the Greene Climacteric Scale. The secondary outcomes will be: quality of life, assessed by the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire; insomnia, assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory; anxiety, assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; and therapeutic alliance, assessed by the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised and Client Sat-is-fac-tion Qes-tion-naire-8. imGT will be performed once a week for 1.5 h for 10 weeks with a daily 'Punched-in' on the WeChat app; ffGT will be performed once a week for 1.5 h for 10 weeks. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at a post-intervention evaluation (week 10), and at a follow-up evaluation (week 22).Discussion: This study will be the first clinical trial to examine the effects of imGT on menopausal women in China. If imGT is found to be non-inferior to ffGT, it will facilitate access to menopausal health services.

AB  - Insomnia, vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and depression often co-occur after the menopause, with consequent health problems and reductions in quality of life. The aim of this position statement is to provide evidence-based advice on the management of postmenopausal sleep disorders derived from a systematic review of the literature. The latter yielded results on VMS, insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless leg syndrome (RLS). Overall, the studies show that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) improves VMS, insomnia, and mood. Several antidepressants can improve insomnia, either on their own or in association with MHT; these include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and mirtazapine. Long-term benefits for postmenopausal insomnia may also be achieved with non-drug strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and aerobic exercise. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advancement devices (MADs) both reduce blood pressure and cortisol levels in postmenopausal women suffering from OSA. However, the data regarding MHT on postmenopausal restless legs syndrome are conflicting.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of transdermal estradiol (E2) plus intermittent progesterone (EPT) for improving self-reported sleep in perimenopausal women, after controlling for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) bother and depressive symptoms.Methods: Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 172 healthy women meeting STRAW+10 criteria for being in the menopausal transition or early postmenopause were randomized to 12 months of transdermal E2 (0.1 mg/d) + 200 mg progesterone (12 d every 3 mo) or placebo. Using standard questionnaires, self-reported sleep, depression, and VMS bother were obtained at baseline and bimonthly postrandomization.Results: Controlling for baseline levels, EPT (vs placebo) led to reductions in minutes to fall asleep (estimate = -0.12, P = 0.002) and number of awakenings (estimate = -0.24, P = 0.04) over the 12 months. Controlling for changes in VMS bother and depressive symptoms, EPT still predicted reductions in minutes to fall asleep (estimate = -0.28, P = 0.02) and number of awakenings (estimate = -0.11, P = 0.02) over the 12 months.Conclusions: We extend existing research by demonstrating that hormone therapy (HT) in subjective sleep cannot be fully explained by improvements in VMS bother or depressive symptoms. Research to examine the mechanism (s) underlying HT's effects on sleep would have public health significance for perimenopausal women and also advance our general understanding of the pathophysiology of impaired sleep.

AB  - Background: Common mental disorders (CMDs) such as somatization and anxiety are prevalent in general practice. These are twice more common in women. Objectives: The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence and determinants of somatization and anxiety among adult women in an urban population of Kochi. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1210 adult women of Kochi in 2016–2017. The Patient Health Questionnaire-15; the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire; the Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream tool; and a semi-structured questionnaire were used to estimate the prevalence of somatization and anxiety. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analysis were done for factors associated with CMDs. Results: Most of the respondents were married (77.7%), with a mean age of 45.24 ± 15.59. In the current study, 40.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] =38.09–43.62) had somatization and 23.9% (95% CI = 21.57–26.37) had anxiety disorders. In the final logistic regression model, hypertension, perception of illness, positive family history of mental illness, and arthritis were the four determinants common to somatization and anxiety. Menstrual problems (odds ratio [OR] =3.19; 95% CI = 1.12–5.9), cardiac illness (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.08–4.9), and history of major surgeries (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.14–2.41) were independent determinants of somatization. The status of being single (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.25–2.32), adverse life circumstances (OR = 5.85; 95% CI = 3.98–8.6), diabetes (OR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.25–3.34), sleep problems (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.77–2.91), and history of drug use (OR = 4.89; 95% CI = 1.92–12.46) were independent determinants of anxiety. Conclusion: Mental health services for urban women deserve immediate attention as the prevalence of somatization and anxiety is high. Hence, it is important to screen for somatization and anxiety among women with noncommunicable diseases.

AB  - Purpose: This study conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the measurement structure of the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and how its components were organized. Methods: Participants were 448 postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 63.3 years. CFA was conducted to test how well several proposed measurement models fit the data. Results: The single-factor model performed poorly, indicating the presence of multiple factors. The model with seven correlated factors fit the data well, although the varying degrees of inter-factor correlations suggested grouping of similar factors. The hierarchical measurement structure, with seven first-order factors organized under two second-order factors of physical health and mental health functioning, demonstrated a good fit with the data (χ2(367) = 694.05, p < 0.001; root mean square error of approximation = 0.05; comparative fit index = 0.95) and a meaningful pattern. The Mental Health factor was represented by Depressed Mood, Anxiety/Fear, Memory/Concentration Problems, and Sleep Problems. The Physical Health factor was manifested mainly by Somatic Symptoms, Menstrual Symptoms, and Vasomotor Symptoms, and, to a lesser extent, also by Sleep Problems and Memory/Concentration Problems. Conclusion: Findings suggested that, in addition to a global index and subscale scores, the WHQ may produce summary scores of physical health and mental health functioning in evaluation of well-being among postmenopausal women.
AB  - 目的：本研究采用验证性因素分析法（CFA）对女性健康问卷（WHQ）的测量结构及其组成进行分析。 方法：研究对象为绝经后448名妇女, 平均年龄63.3岁。进行CFA的目的是测试几种推荐的测量模型与数据的拟合程度。 结果：单因素模型的拟合度不佳, 表明存在多种因素。具有七个相关因子的模型很好地拟合了数据, 尽管不同程度因子间的相关性表明需要对相似因子进行分组。由七个一级因子构成了二个关于生理健康和心理健康功能的二级因子, 由它们组成的分层测量结构与数据（χ2(367）=694.05, P<0.001；近似均方根误差=0.05；比较拟合指数=0.95）具有良好的拟合性和一个有意义的模型。心理健康因素表现为抑郁情绪、焦虑/恐惧、记忆/集中问题和睡眠问题。身体健康因素主要表现为躯体症状、月经症状和血管舒缩症状, 在较小程度上也表现为睡眠问题和记忆/集中问题。 结论：研究结果表明, 除了一个整体指数和子量表评分外, WHQ还可能产生身体健康和心理健康功能的总分用于评价绝经后妇女的健康。

AB  - Objectives: Around the menopause, sleep disturbances frequently occur or worsen and are associated with decreased health quality and physical and psychological problems. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep quality and its association with the impact of menopausal symptoms in Spanish postmenopausal women. Methods: A total of 278 postmenopausal women (age 60.95 ± 8.01 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were used to analyze sleep quality and severity of menopausal symptoms, respectively. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: The linear regression showed that a greater impact of menopausal symptoms (MRS total score) was associated with worse scores regarding sleep adequacy (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.056), snoring (p = 0.020, R2 = 0.036), awaken short of breath (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.089), and quantity of sleep (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.075) domains. Anxiety (p < 0.001) and worse somatic symptoms (p = 0.001) were related to greater sleep disturbances (R2 = 0.164). We also found relationships of heightened psychological symptoms (p < 0.001) and low physical activity level (p = 0.003) with increased daytime somnolence (R2 = 0.064). Finally, higher MRS total score and anxiety levels were associated with worse sleep quality assessed by MOS-SS Sleep Problems Index I (R2 = 0.179, p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) and Sleep Problems Index II (R2 = 0.146, p < 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively). Conclusions: Anxiety and severity of menopausal symptoms were associated with poorer sleep quality. Furthermore, low physical activity level and worse psychological symptoms in menopause were predictors for increased somnolence. Therefore, screening for these factors in postmenopausal women is important, since they may be susceptible for intervention.
AB  - 在女性围绝经期, 睡眠障碍经常出现或恶化, 并且与健康质量下降以及身体和心理问题相关。 本研究的目的是分析西班牙绝经后妇女睡眠质量及其与更年期症状的影响之间的关系。方法：共有278名绝经后妇女（年龄60.95±8.01岁）参加了这项横断面研究。医学结果研究睡眠量表（MOS-SS）和更年期评定量表（MRS）分别用于分析睡眠质量和更年期症状的严重程度。同时使用医院焦虑和抑郁量表测量焦虑和抑郁。结果：线性回归显示更年期症状（MRS总分）越严重与睡眠充足性评分较差（p <0.001, R2 = 0.056）, 打鼾（p = 0.020, R2 = 0.036）, 窒息苏醒（p <0.001, R2 = 0.089）和睡眠量（p <0.001, R2 = 0.075）阈值越相关。 焦虑（p <0.001）和躯体症状严重（p = 0.001）与睡眠障碍严重程度相关（R2 = 0.164）。我们还发现心理症状加重（p <0.001）和低体力活动水平（p = 0.003）与白天嗜睡增加（R2 = 0.064）的关系。 最后, 较高的MRS总分和焦虑水平与MOS-SS睡眠问题指数I（分别为R2 = 0.179, p <0.001和p = 0.001）和睡眠问题指数II（R2 = 0.146, 分别p <0.001和p = 0.011）评估的睡眠质量较差相关。结论：焦虑和更年期症状严重程度与睡眠质量较差相关。 此外, 更年期体力活动水平低和心理症状加重是嗜睡增加的影响因素。 因此, 在绝经后妇女中筛查这些可能易于干预的因素很重要。

AB  - Background: Late preterm and early term births account for ~25% of live births. Infants born prior to term are at significantly higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality.Aims: Determine autonomic regulation differences in infants (35-40 weeks gestation) during sleep at birth and one-month after delivery.Study Design: Consecutive enrollment until at least 20 infants per group: 75 late preterm (35-36 weeks gestation), 110 early term (37-38 weeks), and 130 full term (39-40 weeks). Assess autonomic parameters 12-84 h after delivery and again at one month of life.Subjects: 329 newborns met inclusion criteria.Exclusions: maternal age < 18 years, major maternal medical problems, psychiatric medications, drug use, Apgar <8 at 5 min, medical complications requiring other than standard care, non-English or non-Spanish speaking.Outcome Measures: Heart rate and two measures of heart rate variability in active and quiet sleep at birth and at one month of life.Results: Late preterm and early term newborns demonstrate immature patterns of autonomic regulation at birth. Heart rate decreased with gestational age in both sleep states whereas the standard deviation of R-R intervals and beat-to-beat variability in heart rate both increased with gestational age in both sleep states. One month after delivery, i.e. at term-equivalent age, late preterm infants continued to have higher heart rates than infants born full term; and their heart rate was also significantly higher when compared to that of full term newborns at birth, i.e. their autonomic signature did not "normalize" over the first four weeks of life. Early term infants, however, did not differ from full term infants when they reached a postmenstrual age of 44 weeks.Conclusion: The specific patterns of immature autonomic regulation in late preterm and early term infants during early postnatal life may underlie their increased morbidity and mortality in infancy and later in development. Future studies should address how early autonomic measures might relate to adverse outcomes. Results suggest the need for autonomic nomograms at birth and at one month after delivery that are stratified by both gestational week and sleep state.

AB  - Introduction: Weight gain is one of the consequences of menopause. In addition to hormonal changes, the behavioral and environmental factors intensify this event. This study was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with overweight and obesity in menopause women, using the structural equation model. Methods: This cross-sectional study aimed on 4471 women from baseline data of Ravansar Non Communicable Disease cohort study, in the west region of Iran. The structural equation model was used to examine the relationships, using by IBM SPSS, AMOS version 23. Results: The mean of body fat and visceral fat area in menopause were significantly greater than perimenopause women. In perimenopause women, the direct effect of socioeconomic status on the healthy dietary pattern was larger than that of menopause women (ß = 0.652 vs. ß = 0.530). In both groups, depression and musculoskeletal disorders, decreased the physical activity, which was stronger in menopause women (ß = -0.123 vs. ß = -0.363). In perimenopause women, increased sleep hours per day directly (ß = 0.003) and indirectly (ß = 0.013) increased obesity. Conclusion: The direct and indirect effects of well-known risk factors associated with obesity were different, in perimenopause and menopause women. Some risk factors in menopause women have stronger effects, compared to perimenopause women. Physical activity and healthy dietary pattern had a mediator role in the two study groups.

AB  - Sleep disorders increase in prevalence during the menopausal transition and they constitute a complex phenomenon. Insomnia, the main sleep disorder, can be a primary disorder or it can be secondary to hot flushes (HF), mood disorders, psychosocial factors, medical conditions, and other sleep disturbances, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or restless legs syndrome (RLS). Menopausal women complaining of persistent sleep disorders should be referred to a sleep specialist for comprehensive sleep management because unrecognized and untreated sleep disorders can have dramatic health-related consequences. Women suffering from insomnia related to vasomotor symptoms (VMS) can be treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Primary insomnia will be preferentially improved with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-I) or with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin. CBT-I is a highly efficacious treatment for postmenopausal women with insomnia. Using antidepressants to treat sleep disruption in the absence of depression is not recommended; instead, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved paroxetine as the first non-hormonal treatment for HF. Sleep disorders in menopausal women should not be underestimated. It is necessary to diagnose the specific causal disorder and then to provide treatment to improve sleep quality and quality of life.

AB  - Objective: Childhood maltreatment is related to adverse health outcomes. However, the relation of childhood maltreatment to the menopause transition-a universal transition for women often accompanied by troubling symptoms such as vasomotor symptoms-is relatively underexplored. This study tested whether childhood abuse and neglect are associated with menopausal vasomotor symptoms, utilizing both physiologic and prospective self-report measures of vasomotor symptoms.Methods: In all, 295 nonsmoking perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years with and without vasomotor symptoms completed psychosocial measures, including the Child Trauma Questionnaire, ambulatory physiologic (sternal skin conductance) and self-report measurement of vasomotor symptoms during wake and sleep, and actigraphy measurement of sleep. Relationships between childhood abuse/neglect and vasomotor symptoms during wake and sleep were tested in linear regression models controlling for demographics, body mass index, and menopause stage.Results: 44% of the sample reported abuse or neglect during childhood. Among women reporting vasomotor symptoms, childhood sexual or physical abuse was associated with more frequent physiologically-recorded vasomotor symptoms during sleep (sexual abuse: b [SE] = 1.45 [0.52], P = 0.006; physical abuse: b [SE] = 0.97 [0.47], P = 0.03) in multivariable models. Among these women, women with a physical or sexual abuse history had approximately 1.5 to 2-fold the number of sleep vasomotor symptoms than women without this history.Conclusions: Childhood abuse is associated with more frequent physiologically-detected vasomotor symptoms during sleep.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the association of self-reported physical fitness (PF) and its components with cardiometabolic and mental health in perimenopausal women.Methods: These cross-sectional analyses included 191 participants (53 ± 4 y old) from the FLAMENCO project. Self-reported PF was assessed with the International Fitness Scale (IFIS). Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), waist circumference (WC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and glucose were measured. The Beck's Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Life Orientation Test Revised, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule were used to assess mental health.Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, greater overall PF was associated with lower BMI, FM, WC (P < 0.001), DBP and CRP, and higher HDL-C (P < 0.05). Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), speed-agility, and flexibility were associated with lower BMI, WC, and FM (P < 0.001), and muscle strength (MS) with lower WC and FM (P < 0.05). In addition, CRF, MS, and speed-agility were associated with lower CRP (P < 0.01), and flexibility with enhanced triglycerides and HDL-C (P < 0.05). Overall PF and all its components were associated with lower depression, anxiety, and negative affect (P≤0.01), and greater positive affect (P≤0.05). Overall PF and MS were associated with better sleep quality (P < 0.05), and CRF, MS, and speed-agility with greater optimism (P≤0.05). Finally, overall PF showed evidence of significant association with less pharmaceutical expenditure (B = -7.2, β=-0.145, P = 0.08).Conclusions: Self-reported PF was associated with better cardiometabolic and mental health in perimenopausal women. The IFIS might be proposed as an inexpensive, quick, and easy tool in clinical settings.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and sleep-related symptoms among midlife women from four major racial/ethnic groups in the United States.Methods: The data from 164 participants of two larger Internet survey studies (62 women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 102 women without diabetes) were included. In the original studies, multiple instruments including the questions on background characteristics, health status, and menopause status and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women were used. The data were analyzed using χ tests, independent t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses.Results: The mean total number of sleep-related symptoms was significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes (9.95 ± 5.83) than those without diabetes (7.25 ± 6.08) (t = 2.81, P = 0.006). The mean total severity score of sleep-related symptoms was also significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes (33.42 ± 22.41) than those without diabetes (21.87 ± 21.40) (t = 3.29, P = 0.001). Among postmenopausal women and Asian women, there were significant differences in total numbers and total severity scores between those with type 2 diabetes and those without diabetes (all P < 0.05). When background characteristics, health status, and menopause status were controlled, having a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was positively associated with total numbers (β=0.143, P = 0.047) and total severity scores (β=0.176, P = 0.014) of sleep-related symptoms.Conclusions: This secondary analysis supported significant associations of type 2 diabetes to sleep-related symptoms of midlife women from four major racial/ethnic groups in the United States.

AB  - Objective: Our initial understanding of the menopause transition (MT) has been framed by clinical samples of women seeking treatment rather than by population-based studies. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) initiated in 1996 with an overall goal to define the MT, to characterize its biological and psychosocial antecedents and sequelae in an ethnically and racially diverse sample of midlife women.Methods: This review summarizes the central findings of SWAN to date that can inform women and their healthcare providers about the impact of the MT and midlife aging on overall health and well-being.Results: SWAN characterized changes in reproductive axis and menstrual cycle patterns that informed the development of the reproductive aging staging system Staging of Reproductive Aging Workshop+10; MT-related symptoms and mental health (vasomotor symptoms, sleep complaints, psychological symptoms, cognitive performance, and urogenital and sexual health); and physiological systems and functions (cardiovascular and cardiometabolic health, bone health, physical function performance) that are influenced by the MT. SWAN demonstrated substantial interrelations among these changes and significant racial/ethnic differences in the rate and magnitude of change in multiple health indictors in midlife women. The findings point to midlife as a critical stage for adopting healthy behavior and preventive strategies.Conclusions: Over the past 23 years, SWAN has advanced our understanding of the impact of the MT and midlife aging on health and well-being in women. SWAN will be instrumental to determine whether MT-related changes during midlife are related to unfavorable health and well-being in early old age.

AB  - Summary: Methodological limitations preclude determination of the association between sleep duration and bone mineral density (BMD) from existing literature. This was the first study to use objective sleep duration to determine its association with BMD. Nocturnal sleep duration, assessed objectively (actigraphy) or subjectively (questionnaire), was not independently associated with BMD in postmenopausal women. Introduction: Both long and short self-reported sleep durations are associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women. The association between sleep duration measured by actigraphy and BMD in postmenopausal women is unknown. Methods: The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) ancillary sleep study was used to determine the association between sleep duration and BMD at the total hip and femoral neck in postmenopausal women ≥ 75 years old. Sleep duration was assessed by wrist actigraphy (average 4 nights) and questionnaire. BMD was compared between postmenopausal women with short (< 6 h/night) vs. NIH-recommended (7–8 h/night) sleep durations. Data were analyzed using a 2-sample t test (unadjusted) and multivariate regression model (adjusted). Simple linear regression was used to estimate the difference in BMD per additional hour of sleep when sleep duration was considered as a continuous, rather than dichotomized, variable. Results: Total hip BMD was higher in women with actigraphically assessed shorter sleep duration in unadjusted models only. No clinically or statistically significant differences in total hip or femoral neck BMD were observed according to nocturnal sleep duration after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) in dichotomized (N = 874) or continuous (N = 1624) sleep duration models or when subjective sleep duration was used. When sleep duration included daytime naps, longer sleep duration was associated with lower total hip BMD (β = − 0.005, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Nocturnal sleep duration, whether assessed objectively (actigraphy) or subjectively (questionnaire), was not independently associated with BMD in older postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether sleep state maturity can be estimated accurately using conventional electroencephalography (cEEG) or amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) features concerning sleep in neurologically unimpaired preterm infants.Methods: A total of 51 preterm infants were monitored with cEEG-polygraphy and simultaneous aEEG. Sleep state maturity of EEG corresponded to specific postmenstrual age (PMA). PMA on cEEG was blindly estimated according to cEEG patterns (indicated as background continuity, frequencies, and voltages) as well as developmental markers in specific states. PMA on aEEG was blindly estimated based on the cycling score (cycling representing sleep state transitions) according to a pre-established scoring system.Results: A total of 51 EEGs recorded between 32 and 37 weeks PMA were analysed. A significant relationship between estimated PMA (ePMA) and actual chronological PMA (cPMA) was shown by linear regression both on cEEG (r = 0.93, β = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.09, p < 0.001) and aEEG (r = 0.85, β = 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.98, p < 0.001). The estimation gap (defined as ePMA minus cPMA) was between -2 and +2 weeks both on cEEG and aEEG. The percentage of estimation gap between -1 and +1 weeks was 96% for cEEG, which was higher than the estimate of 88% for aEEG.Conclusion: Estimated maturity of sleep state was well correlated with cPMA both on cEEG and aEEG. PMA corresponding to state maturity could be estimated within two weeks of actual cPMA using either of these two tools. However, cEEG had higher accuracy compared with aEEG in the evaluation of sleep state maturity.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that is characterized by hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity. Affected women have a high prevalence of insulin resistance and related metabolic complications. The frequency of sleep disturbances appears to be increased in women with PCOS, although most studies so far have included more severely affected obese women with PCOS who are referred to tertiary care clinics and may not represent the general population of women with PCOS. This article provides an overview of sleep disturbances in PCOS with the focus on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most commonly reported sleep disturbance among these women. The pathogenesis and risk factors for OSA in PCOS and its association with metabolic disorders is discussed in detail.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze executive function (EF) in postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors and factors that influence it. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 hospitals in Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia. Respondents consisted of 82 breast cancer survivors who had completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy, 81 nonchemotherapy breast cancer survivors, and 80 noncancer female patients, who were determined by consecutive sampling. Data collection tools included patient care documentation, Trail Making Test B, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and Piper Fatigue Scale. Data analysis was done using multiple logistic regression. The mean age of the respondents was 43.06 ± 8.18 years, the mean score of stress was 13.12 ± 5.55, 81.1% of respondents had <12 years of education, 81.1% were not using hormonal therapy, 51.4% were in menopause, 62.6% did not have anemia, 51% had poor sleep quality, and 47.32% experienced mild fatigue. Furthermore, 86.6% of postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors had experienced EF impairment. Variables that had significant relationships with EF impairment were age, stress, length of education, classification of respondents, type of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy usage, menopausal status, hemoglobin level, and sleep quality. It was concluded that most influencing variables that disrupt EF are chemotherapy type, age, and stress (OR 18.089, 1.138, and 1.104, respectively).

AB  - Telomere length is a heritable marker of cellular age that is associated with morbidity and mortality. Poor sleep behaviors, which are also associated with adverse health events, may be related to leukocyte telomere length (LTL). We studied a subpopulation of 3,145 postmenopausal women (1,796 European-American (EA) and 1,349 African-American (AA)) enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative in 1993–1998 with data on Southern blot-measured LTL and self-reported usual sleep duration and sleep disturbance. LTL-sleep associations were analyzed separately for duration and disturbance using weighted and confounder-adjusted linear regression models in the entire sample (AAs + EAs; adjusted for race/ethnicity) and in racial/ethnic strata, since LTL differs by ancestry. After adjustment for covariates, each additional daily hour of sleep beyond 5 hours, approximately, was associated with a 27-base-pair (95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 48) longer LTL in the entire sample. Associations between sleep duration and LTL were strongest among AAs (adjusted β = 37, 95% CI: 4, 70); a similar, nonsignificant association was observed for EAs (adjusted β = 20, 95% CI: −7, 48). Sleep disturbance was not associated with LTL in our study. Our models did not show departure from linearity (quadratic sleep terms: P ≥ 0.55). Our results suggest that longer sleep duration is associated with longer LTL in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for menopausal symptoms (CBT-Meno) compared with a waitlist condition (no active intervention). A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 71 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women who were seeking treatment for menopausal symptoms.Methods: Blind assessments were conducted at baseline, 12 weeks postbaseline, and 3 months post-treatment. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. CBT-Meno sessions included psychoeducation, and cognitive and behavioral strategies for vasomotor and depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and sexual concerns. Primary outcomes were scores on the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Secondary outcomes were scores assessing vasomotor and sexual concerns on the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS-vm, GCS-sex), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).Results: There were significantly greater improvements in CBT-Meno compared with waitlist in vasomotor symptom interference (HFRDIS; P < 0.001, ηP = 0.21) and "bothersomeness" (GCS-vm; P = 0.04, ηP = 0.06), depressive symptoms (BDI-II; P = 0.001, ηP = 0.15), sleep difficulties (PSQI; P = 0.001, ηP = 0.17), and sexual concerns (GCS-sex; P = 0.03, ηP = 0.07). These results were found even when controlling for menopausal staging and medication use. Gains were maintained at 3 months post-treatment.Conclusions: CBT-Meno was particularly effective in improving self-reported vasomotor symptoms, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulties, and sexual concerns. Although future studies will be needed to confirm the impact of CBT-Meno on anxiety symptoms, these results suggest that this protocol is effective in targeting commonly reported menopausal symptoms. : Video Summary: Supplemental Digiatl Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MENO/A416.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and associated factors in climacteric middle-aged women.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Colombian Caribbean women (40-59 y, n = 403), who were surveyed with a form that included sociodemographic information and two validated tools (the Menopause Rating Scale and the SF-36 Health questionnaire). Calf circumference, handgrip, and gait speed were measured. Low muscle mass (calf circumference <31 cm), reduced muscle strength (<20 kg in handgrip), and lower physical performance (<0.8 m/s gait speed) were estimated. Criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People were used to identify sarcopenia. Association between sarcopenia (dependent variable) and menopausal symptoms and health perception (independent variables) was estimated.Results: Median age of surveyed women was 48 years, with 44.5% being postmenopausal. 9.6% had low muscle mass, 18.1% had reduced muscle strength, and 6.9% had lower physical performance. Presarcopenia was identified in 9.6% and sarcopenia in 7.9% (nonsevere sarcopenia 7.1% and severe sarcopenia 0.8%). Most important factors associated with sarcopenia were feeling full of life only sometimes, feeling a lot of energy only sometimes, having joint/muscular discomfort, history of hysterectomy, hot flashes, mestizo ethnic group, age 50 or more, being postmenopausal, and sleep problems.Conclusions: Sarcopenia was present in this middle-aged female Colombian Caribbean sample and associated with various factors such as ethnicity, age, and menopausal symptoms and status.

AB  - Objective: The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) was designed to address gaps in understanding the effects of timely menopausal hormone treatments (HT) on cardiovascular health and other effects of menopause after the premature termination of the Women's Health Initiative.Method: The KEEPS was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that initiation of HT (oral conjugated equine estrogens [o-CEE] or transdermal 17β-estradiol [t-E2]) in healthy, recently postmenopausal women (n = 727) would slow the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT).Results: After 4 years, neither HT affected the rate of increase in CIMT. There was a trend for reduced accumulation of coronary artery calcium with o-CEE. There were no severe adverse effects, including venous thrombosis. Several ancillary studies demonstrated a positive effect on mood with o-CEE, and reduced hot flashes, improved sleep, and maintenance of bone mineral density with both treatments. Sexual function improved with t-E2. There were no significant effects of either treatment on cognition, breast pain, or skin wrinkling. Variants of genes associated with estrogen metabolism influenced the age of menopause and variability in effects of the HT on CIMT. Platelet activation associated with the development of white matter hyperintensities in the brain.Conclusions: KEEPS and its ancillary studies have supported the value and safety of the use of HT in recently postmenopausal women and provide a perspective for future research to optimize HT and health of postmenopausal women. The KEEPS continuation study continues to pursue these issues.

AB  - Objective: This secondary analysis assessed associations between changes in energy balance and sleep behaviors and the risk of weight regain following exercise-induced weight loss.Methods: Of 400 participants initially randomized in the Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA), 227 lost weight following the moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise intervention (-4.2 ± 3.6 kg) and were included in this analysis. Self-reported energy intake (EI), sleep duration, quality and timing, and objective measurements of physical activity (PA) and sedentary time were collected at the end of the intervention and the end of follow-up. Linear regression models assessed associations between changes in these behaviors and risk of weight regain during follow-up.Results: Participants regained 43% of the weight lost during follow-up. Reductions in moderate to vigorous PA (β = -1.00; 95% CI = -1.74 to -0.25 h/d; P = 0.01) and steps per day (β = -0.0003; 95% CI = -0.0005 to -0.0001 steps/d; P = 0.004); increases in sedentary time (β = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.02 h/d; P = 0.03), EI (β = 0.001; 95% CI = 0.0003 to 0.002 kcal; P = 0.01), and fat intake (β = 0.004; 95% CI = 0.001 to 0.006 kcal; P = 0.002); and delayed sleep timing midpoint (β = 0.02; 95% CI = 0.004 to 0.03 min; P = 0.01) were associated with weight regain during follow-up.Conclusions: These exploratory results suggest that reductions in moderate to vigorous PA; increases in EI, fat intake, and sedentary time; and delayed sleep timing midpoint were significantly associated with risk of weight regain.

AB  - The reduction of menopausal "symptoms" (this is in quotation marks because the menopause is not an illness, despite the powerful effects it has on the body and mind) to hot flushes and broken sleep was baffling. I saw a menopause specialist who told me this depression, and my "brain fog" - another reductive phrase for the real cognitive changes the menopause can bring, so unsettling that many women are convinced they have dementia - was simply due to aging. They thought the menopause brought only hot flushes and poor sleep.

AB  - One of the most frequent symptoms in postmenopausal women is sleep disturbance. This study aimed to determine the relationship between sleep quality and lifestyle factors in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (n = 252) in Ahvaz, Iran with an age range of 45–55 years, were enrolled from April to December 2015. The study tools included the Lifestyle Questionnaire (LSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The LSQ contains 10 lifestyle factors: physical health, physical activity, weight control and nutrition, psychological health, spiritual health, social health, medications and narcotics avoidance, illness prevention, accident prevention, and environmental health. Data were analyzed using, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficients, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regressions. In unadjusted analyses, physical health, physical activity, nutrition, mental health, spiritual health, social health, and medication and narcotics avoidance scores were significantly higher in women without sleep disruption than in those with light and moderate sleep disruption (p <.001). Adjusting for confounding factors, sleep disruption was directly related to duration since the final menstrual period (p <.001), and inversely related to physical health (p =.04) and spiritual health (p =.028). Lifestyle factors were related to sleep disruption in postmenopausal women. Policymakers should consider education on healthy lifestyles for women.

AB  - Context: Studies suggest that female reproductive hormones are under circadian regulation, although methodological differences have led to inconsistent findings.Objective: To determine whether circulating levels of reproductive hormones exhibit circadian rhythms.Design: Blood samples were collected across ∼90 consecutive hours, including 2 baseline days under a standard sleep-wake schedule and ∼50 hours of extended wake under constant routine (CR) conditions.Setting: Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit, Brigham and Women's Hospital.Participants: Seventeen healthy premenopausal women (22.8 ± 2.6 years; nine follicular; eight luteal).Interventions: Fifty-hour CR.Main Outcome Measures: Plasma estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), LH, FSH, SHBG, melatonin, and core body temperature.Results: All hormones exhibited significant 24-hour rhythms under both standard sleep-wake and CR conditions during the follicular phase (P < 0.05). In contrast, only FSH and SHBG were significantly rhythmic during the luteal phase. Rhythm acrophases and amplitudes were similar between standard sleep-wake and CR conditions. The acrophase occurred in the morning for P4; in the afternoon for FSH, LH, and SHBG; and during the night for E2.Conclusions: Our results confirm previous reports of ∼24-hour rhythms in many female reproductive hormones in humans under ambulatory conditions but demonstrate that these hormones are under endogenous circadian regulation, defined as persisting in the absence of external time cues. These results may have important implications for the effects of circadian disruption on reproductive function.

AB  - Objective  To determine the risk of long-term neurologic morbidity among children (up to 18 years) born following in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation induction (OI) treatments as compared with spontaneously conceived. Study Design  A population-based cohort analysis was performed, including data from the perinatal computerized database on all singleton infants born at the Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC) between the years 1991 and 2014. This perinatal database was linked and cross-matched with the SUMC computerized dataset of all pediatric hospitalizations. Results  Neurologic morbidity was significantly more common in IVF (3.7%) and OI (4.1%) offspring as compared with those following spontaneous pregnancies (3.1%; p  = 0.017). In particular, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders and headaches were more common in the OI group and sleep disorders in the IVF group, whereas autism and cerebral palsy were comparable between the groups. In the Weibull multivariable analysis, while controlling for maternal age, preterm delivery, birthweight centile, maternal diabetes, and hypertensive disorders, IVF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–1.71; p  = 0.001), but not OI (adjusted HR: 1.17' 95% CI: 0.92–1.48; p  = 0.196), was noted as an independent risk factor for long-term pediatric neurologic morbidity. Conclusion  IVF offspring appear to be at an increased risk of long-term neurologic morbidity up to 18 years of age.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that is characterized by hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity. Affected women have a high prevalence of insulin resistance and related metabolic complications. The frequency of sleep disturbances appears to be increased in women with PCOS, although most studies so far have included more severely affected obese women with PCOS who are referred to tertiary care clinics and may not represent the general population of women with PCOS. This article provides an overview of sleep disturbances in PCOS with the focus on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most commonly reported sleep disturbance among these women. The pathogenesis and risk factors for OSA in PCOS and its association with metabolic disorders is discussed in detail.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Sleep disturbances are increasing in prevalence in North America. There is growing evidence that poor sleep quality and short sleep duration may adversely affect circadian rhythms, which in turn may affect female reproduction. The objective of this review is to evaluate recent literature on the association between sleep disturbances and female reproduction.Recent Findings: There is accumulating evidence that sleep quality and duration are important for female reproduction, but epidemiologic research is limited. Recent studies provide suggestive evidence that sleep disorders are associated with increased menstrual irregularity, subfertility/infertility, and poor pregnancy and birth outcomes. Mechanisms underlying these associations are likely to be multifactorial and complex. In addition to genetics, circadian disruption may impact reproductive outcomes through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. Recommendations for future studies include: use of prospective study designs; assessment of populations not already experiencing reproductive disorders; more detailed and accurate assessments of sleep such as validated self-reported measures or objective sleep measures (e.g. actigraphy); comprehensive assessment of potential confounders and mediators; and elucidation of biologic mechanisms.Summary: There is a growing body of literature showing evidence that sleep disturbances influence female reproduction, although further epidemiologic research is needed.

AB  - Background: Epidemiologic studies suggest a strong link between poor habitual sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Metabolomic profiling may elucidate systemic differences associated with sleep quality that influence cardiometabolic health.Methods: We explored cross-sectional associations between sleep quality and plasma metabolites in a nested case-control study of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; n = 1956) and attempted to replicate the results in an independent sample from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; n = 209). A sleep-quality score (SQS) was derived from self-reported sleep problems asked in both populations. Plasma metabolomics were assayed using LC-MS with 347 known metabolites. General linear regression was used to identify individual metabolites associated with continuous SQS (false-discovery rate <0.05). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms, a metabolite score was created from replicated metabolites and evaluated with CHD risk in the WHI.Results: After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and smoking, we identified 69 metabolites associated with SQS in the WHI (59 were lipids). Of these, 16 were replicated in NHSII (15 were lipids), including 6 triglycerides (TAGs), 4 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 3 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 1 diglyceride (DAG), 1 lysophosphatidylcholine and N6-acetyl-L-lysine (a product of histone acetylation). These metabolites were consistently higher among women with poorer sleep quality. The LASSO selection resulted in a nine-metabolite score (TAGs 45: 1, 48: 1, 50: 4; DAG 32: 1; PEs 36: 4, 38: 5; PCs 30: 1, 40: 6; N6-acetyl-L-lysine), which was positively associated with CHD risk (odds ratio per SD increase in the score: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.28; p = 0.0003) in the WHI after adjustment for matching factors and conventional CHD risk factors.Conclusions: Differences in lipid metabolites may be an important pathogenic pathway linking poor habitual sleep quality and CHD risk.

AB  - Background: Nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) care for critically ill and dying patients. The stressful nature of the work performed by these nurses may affect their spiritual health and sleep quality. Purpose: The purpose of this correlational study was to explore the sleep quality, spiritual health, and related factors in a sample of ICU nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional correlational design with stratified random sampling was applied. A total of 170 clinical nurses were recruited from the ICUs of a medical center in northern Taiwan. A demographic characteristics questionnaire, the spiritual health scale-short form, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used for data collection. Results: The average PSQI score was 7.07, with 62.9% of the participants reporting poor sleep quality. A significantly negative correlation was identified between the spiritual-health-scale item "connections to others" and the PSQI. "Connections to others", "chronic diseases", and "menstrual cycle discomfort" were the important predictive factors of sleep quality in the ICU nurses in this study. Conclusions/Implications for practice: The findings of this study support nurses engaging in regular exercise that is both low-intensity and not subject to time or space restrictions in order to help prevent chronic diseases and relieve dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, education and training related to spiritual health should be incorporated into the wholeperson education curriculum in order to enhance spiritual status and improve sleep quality.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether parenteral nutrition for infants of extremely low birth weight using a mixed lipid emulsion that contains fish oil influences electrophysiological brain maturation.Study Design: The study is a prespecified secondary outcome analysis of a randomized controlled trial of 230 infants of extremely low birth weight receiving a mixed (soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil; intervention) or a soybean oil-based lipid emulsion (control). The study was conducted at a single-level IV neonatal care unit (Medical University Vienna; June 2012 to October 2015). Electrophysiological brain maturation (background activity, sleep-wake cycling, and brain maturational scores) was assessed biweekly by amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (birth to discharge).Results: A total of 317 amplitude-integrated electroencephalography measurements (intervention: n = 165; control: n = 152) from 121 (intervention: n = 63; control: n = 58) of 230 infants of the core study were available for analysis. Demographic characteristics were not significantly different. By 28 weeks of postmenstrual age, infants receiving the intervention displayed significantly greater percentages of continuous background activity. Total maturational scores and individual scores for continuity, cycling, and bandwidth were significantly greater. Maximum maturational scores were reached 2 weeks earlier in the intervention group (36.4 weeks, 35.4-37.5) compared with the control group (38.4 weeks, 37.1-42.4) (median, IQR; P < .001).Conclusions: Using a mixed parenteral lipid emulsion that contains fish oil, we found that electrophysiological brain maturation was accelerated in infants who were preterm.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01585935.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common among women from middle age onwards, into advanced age, and they are connected to menopause. The loss of ovarian hormones can alter cognition directly but probably also through sleep disturbances, which play an important role as a risk factor and a pathogenetic factor in dementia. Alzheimer's disease is common in older women. Knowledge of the fascinating relationship between sleep disturbances and cognitive decline, and in particular the sex/gender differences, is growing but needs to be further investigated.

AB  - The increased prevalence of sleep disorders associated with menopause has been emphasized by multiple international studies. Many factors are associated with insomnia during menopause, among them: hot flashes (HF), anxiety and depression, other medical conditions, behavioral and psychosocial factors and primitive sleep patterns. The domino hypothesis connects various factors and suggests that HF disturb sleep, thereby causing insomnia, which in turn increases vulnerability to depression. Nevertheless, sleep disorders predict mood disturbances more robustly than vasomotor symptoms (VMS), indicating that sleep also influences mood via other mechanisms. The medical conditions that may compromise sleep in this age group are common; they include obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, cancer, urinary incontinence and nocturia, thyroid dysfunction, chronic pain, fibromyalgia (often starting or worsening in menopause), and hypertension. Common causes of sleep disorders in middle-aged women include poor sleep hygiene, volitional factors, environmental disturbances, alcohol intake, marital dissatisfaction, requests for care from children, grandchildren and/or elderly parents, and financial worries. Evidence from other populations suggests that if insomnia is not treated, it may negatively affect the outcome of comorbid conditions. Taken together, these observations suggest that insomnia should be considered a disorder requiring specific attention and treatment. Moreover, recent cross-sectional data link sleep with subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk. It should also be noted that insomnia is common in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

AB  - Objective: Women's sleep at menopause is widely reported to be problematic. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a commonly used tool for quantifying sleep problems in clinical and research settings, but psychometric properties in postmenopausal women have not been reported. Our study aim was to examine the factor structure of the ISI in a large and diverse sample of midlife women with hot flashes.Methods: Baseline data were from 899 women enrolled in one of the three clinical trials using similar entry criteria conducted by the Menopause Strategies Finding Lasting Answers to Symptoms and Health research network. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses for the total sample and within strata defined by race/ethnicity (black and white women).Results: The ISI had two factors in the total sample. The two-factor structure was consistent across black and white women, with the exception of one item "difficulty falling asleep."Conclusions: The ISI in midlife women with hot flashes is composed of two factors that capture dimensions of the insomnia severity and daytime impact. The instrument is a psychometrically sound scale appropriate for use in research and clinical practice to capture the severity and daytime impact of insomnia symptoms in diverse samples of midlife women with hot flashes. An abbreviated screening of two items could be considered to determine if further evaluation is needed of sleep complaints.

AB  - Decreases in s ubjective sleep quality are prevalent among nurses and midwives engaged in rotating shift work. The present study aimed to examine the relationship between differences in work schedules and subjective sleep quality among female nursing staff. A cross-sectional survey design was used for descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Data collection was conducted from December 2016 to September 2017. Participants were recruited from five regional core hospitals in Japan. A total of 1253 nurses and midwives were included in the final analysis. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Chronotype and social jet lag were calculated for both work day and work-free day. Symptoms related to restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease were assessed using the Japanese version of the Cambridge-Hopkins questionnaire short form 13. Participants with the urge to move their legs, though not fulfilling the restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease criteria, were classified as having leg motor restlessness. Logistic regression analyses for poor sleep were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, drinking, menstruation status, the presence of premenstrual syndrome, and the presence of a spouse. Rates of poor sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score ≥6) among those working, day shifts, rotating 12.5 hour night shifts, rotating 16 hour night shifts, and three-shift rotations were 41.2%, 51.1%, 44.5%, and 60.4%, respectively. Approximately 40% of three-shift rotation workers experienced difficulty initiating sleep. Shift workers tended to exhibit evening chronotype, delayed sleep phase, and high social jet lag. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease was 2.5%. Leg motor restlessness was observed in. 15.5% of participants. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of three-shift work (vs. day shift), evening chronotype (vs. morning chronotype), and the presence of leg motor restlessness (vs. no leg motor restlessness) for those with poor sleep were 2.20 (1.47–3.30), 1.95 (1.29–2.94), and 1.66 (1.15–2.39), respectively. Regardless of the working schedules, rates of poor sleep were high among female hospital nurses and midwives. Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality is influenced by three-shift rotation, the evening chronotype, and leg motor restlessness.

AB  - Measurement of serum testosterone (T) level is of utmost importance for the evaluation of hypogonadism in men and androgen excess in women. Despite the advances in steroid hormone assessment, substantial variability exists regarding measurement of T concentrations. Several factors affect T measurement in men, including circadian rhythms, intra-individual daily variability and transient stressors, while T concentrations in women vary mainly according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. Most of the available immunoassays lack the required accuracy when dealing with T concentrations at the lower end of the normal range for men and across the entire range for females. Consequently, there is no universally accepted lower T threshold for healthy adult men and most immunoassays fail to detect states of mild androgen excess in women. Mass spectrometry is considered the gold-standard method for T measurement; however, due to its complexity and cost, it has not been widely adopted. To increase accuracy, T in men should be measured with a fasting morning sample and repeated if the level is found to be low; in women, measurement must be performed at the follicular phase of the cycle. In both cases, borderline results may be clarified by the assessment of free testosterone (fT). Since most fT assays are unreliable, calculated surrogates should be used instead. Collaborative efforts have been undertaken, with rigorous internal and external quality controls and the establishment of reference methods, to harmonise the commercial assays.

AB  - Objectives: Given the neurocognitive hyperarousal observed in patients with insomnia disorder and associations of nocturnal hot flashes with cardiovascular disease risk, we examined whether women with hot flash-associated insomnia disorder demonstrate exaggerated cardiovascular responsivity to acute stressors, and also a profile of psychological hyperarousal.Methods: Peri and postmenopausal women with and without hot flash-associated insomnia disorder underwent assessments of cardiovascular autonomic responsivity to acute stress paradigms and psychological hyperarousal. Hemodynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure) to nociceptive, social-evaluative, and cognitive stress paradigms were measured in the morning. Psychological hyperarousal was evaluated using questionnaires assessing daytime and presleep hyperarousal, anxiety, and sleep-related cognitions.Results: Women (25 with and 15 without hot flash-associated insomnia) aged 53.4 ± 4.8 years reported a range of insomnia symptoms. Resting-state hemodynamics were similar between groups. Heart rate and blood pressure responses to stress paradigms did not differ by group nor did they correlate with insomnia severity. Women with insomnia disorder had higher generalized anxiety disorder scores (mean 2.7 ± 3.0 vs 1.0 ± 1.4; P = 0.05) and sleep-related cognitions than those without insomnia (P ≤ 0.05). Insomnia symptom severity was moderately correlated with presleep and daytime hyperarousal, anxiety, and sleep-related cognition (all r ≥ 0.43).Conclusions: Though hot flash-associated insomnia is characterized by psychological hyperarousal before sleep and during the daytime, it does not relate to cardiovascular responsiveness to acute stressors. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that altered cardiovascular control is a potential mechanism by which hot flash-associated insomnia confers higher cardiovascular disease risk.

AB  - There are 3 common physiological estrogens, of which estradiol (E2) is seen to decline rapidly over the menopausal transition. This decline in E2 has been associated with a number of changes in the brain, including cognitive changes, effects on sleep, and effects on mood. These effects have been demonstrated in both rodent and non-human preclinical models. Furthermore, E2 interactions have been indicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. In normal brain aging, there are a number of systems that undergo changes and a number of these show interactions with E2, particularly the cholinergic system, the dopaminergic system, and mitochondrial function. E2 treatment has been shown to ameliorate some of the behavioral and morphological changes seen in preclinical models of menopause; however, in clinical populations, the effects of E2 treatment on cognitive changes after menopause are mixed. The future use of sex hormone treatment will likely focus on personalized or precision medicine for the prevention or treatment of cognitive disturbances during aging, with a better understanding of who may benefit from such treatment.

AB  - Purpose: Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer often causes hot flashes, impairing quality of life. However, the chronobiological or psychiatric factors associated with the development of chemotherapy-induced hot flashes (CIHFs) remain undetermined. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether chronotype was associated with the incidence of CIHFs.Methods: A total of 119 premenopausal women with non-metastatic breast cancer awaiting adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery without hot flashes were included. The presence of CIHF was defined as having moderate to severe hot flashes, as measured by the subscale of hot flashes in the Menopause Rating Scale, at 4 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. Chronotype (Morning/Intermediate/Evening) was assessed with the Composite Scale of Morningness before adjuvant chemotherapy. To examine the association between chronotype and CIHF, we built logistic regression models, adjusting for age, body mass index, sleep quality, and radiation therapy.Results: CIHF occurred in 50.4% of participants. Morning type was inversely associated with CIHF (reference: Intermediate type, odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.94; p = 0.040) in the univariate model, and the association remained significant (OR, 0.37; CI, 0.13-0.96; p = 0.045) after adjusting for age, body mass index, sleep quality, and radiation therapy.Conclusions: Morning chronotype is a protective factor against the development of CIHF in patients with breast cancer. Chronotypes should be assessed and considered in the prediction and management of CIHF.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity of menopausal symptoms and their impact on the quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants were 112 breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. They completed the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression with SPSS/WIN 23.0. Results: The prevalence of symptoms among the participants were as follows: sleep problems, 88.4%; physical and mental exhaustion, 80.4%; joint and muscular discomfort, 76.8%; and depression, 70.5%. Menopausal symptoms had a significant negative association with QOL. The results of the regression analysis showed that psychological and urogenital symptoms were statistically significant in explaining patients' QOL and accounted for 70% of the total variance. Conclusion: Menopausal symptoms appear to be a significant problem for premenopausal breast cancer patients. Assessment and control of menopausal symptoms played a large role in maintaining the quality of life in breast cancer patients.

AB  - Aim: Hypertension is a common condition contributing to many diseases. Factors influencing blood pressure (BP) classification for adults have changed over time. This study aimed to identify factors influencing BP classification according to gender. Methods: Data from the Sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2014) were used in this descriptive, cross‐sectional study. Participants were 1555 adults (589 men, 966 women). Measures included demographic, health‐related, and lifestyle factors. Results: Compared with the male normal BP group, in the male prehypertension group, body mass index, problem drinking, and reduced sleep duration were higher; and in the male hypertension group, age, poor subjective health status, body mass index, diabetes, problem drinking, smoking, and sodium intake were higher. Compared with the female normal BP group, age, and body mass index were higher in the female prehypertension group; and age, poor subjective health status, body mass index, menopause, and diabetes were higher in the female hypertension group. Conclusion: Hypertension and prehypertension prevention interventions for adults should be distinguished according to gender. SUMMARY STATEMENT: What is already known about this topic? The prevalence of hypertension and prehypertension has increased worldwide.Prevention and management strategies for hypertension and prehypertension are provided to clients without regard to gender. What this paper adds? Many lifestyle factors that affect hypertension and prehypertension showed differences according to gender.Drinking, sodium intake, and sleep duration were significant factors along with body mass index and diabetes in male clients.Rather than lifestyle factors, menopause, body mass index, and diabetes were significant factors in female clients. The implications of this paper: In the prevention and management of hypertension, lifestyle factors should be highlighted differently according to gender.Management of male clients should focus on reducing problem drinking, limiting sodium intake, and having enough sleep, together with weight control and diabetes prevention.Weight control, menopause, and diabetes management should be emphasized for female clients.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder, in which loss of pharyngeal dilator muscle tone during sleep causes recurrent collapse of the upper airway and temporary cessation of breathing. Repeated apneas and hypopneas lead to cycles of intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia, increased negative intrathoracic pressure and arousals from sleep. These consequences of OSA are associated with a cascade of cardiovascular and neurohumoral consequences, including sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, raised heart rate variability, increases in blood pressure, myocardial wall stress, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, platelet aggregation and impaired vascular endothelial function, which contribute, in turn, to increased cardiovascular risk and, in particular, to the development of chronic systemic arterial hypertension and arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF). Given that the prevalence of OSA is modified by age and gender, OSA-related cardiovascular diseases may also be affected by the same factors. This review focuses on the potential role of OSA in systemic arterial hypertension and AF, and discusses the most interesting studies on age and gender as predisposing factors.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic and common adult disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of upper-airway obstruction and reopening during sleep. OSA is associated with intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic overactivity, oxidative stress and high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It is known to be more common in men than women, partly due to differences in anatomy and functional respiratory components. There are also gender differences in reported symptoms, leading to potential under-diagnosis in females. This gender difference tends to decrease after menopause, demonstrating a role of menopausal status itself in OSA phenotypes. Aging, fat mass distribution, sex hormones and upper-airway collapsibility are postulated to play a major role in these findings. This review focuses on the most recent studies exploring gender differences in the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical features of OSA. It discusses the role of menopause in this, and explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

AB  - Objectives: To analyze the effects that a Pilates-based exercise program has on sleep quality, anxiety, depression and fatigue in community-dwelling Spanish postmenopausal women aged 60 and over.Study Design: A total of 110 women (69.15 ± 8.94 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. They were randomly allocated to either a control (n = 55) or a Pilates (n = 55) group.Main Outcome Measures: Sleep quality and self-perceived fatigue were assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Fatigue Severity Scale, respectively. Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Results: Significant improvements were observed after Pilates training in all PSQI domains as well as in the PSQI total score, with small to medium-size effects, while significant between-group differences in post-intervention measures were observed only for sleep duration (d = 0.69) and sleep disturbances (d = 0.78). Moreover, intra- and inter-group statistical differences were observed for depression (d = 0.39 and d = 0.86, respectively) and for anxiety (d = 0.43 and d = 1.27 respectively). Finally, participants in the Pilates group experienced a decrease in self-perceived fatigue after the intervention period (d = 0.32).Conclusions: For community-dwelling Spanish postmenopausal women aged 60 years and over, a twelve-week Pilates exercise intervention has beneficial effects on sleep quality, anxiety, depression and fatigue.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of TX-001HR, a single-capsule 17β-estradiol-progesterone on sleep parameters in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms (VMS) using the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS)-Sleep scale questionnaire in the REPLENISH trial.Methods: In the REPLENISH trial (NCT01942668), women were randomized to one of four doses of TX-001HR or placebo, and the 12-item MOS-Sleep questionnaire (secondary endpoint) was self-administered at baseline, week 12, and months 6 and 12. Changes from baseline in the MOS-Sleep total score and 7 subscale scores were analyzed for treatment groups versus placebo at all time points. Somnolence was also collected as an adverse event.Results: Women (mean age 55 y) were randomized to TX-001HR (estradiol/ progesterone [E2/P4] [mg/mg]) doses: 1/100 (n = 415), 0.5/100 (n = 424), 0.5/50 (n = 421), 0.25/50 (n = 424), or placebo (n = 151). TX-001HR significantly improved MOS-Sleep total score, Sleep Problems Index II subscale, and sleep disturbance subscale versus placebo at all time points, except with 0.25 mg E2/50 mg P4 at week 12. Differences in LS mean changes between TX-001HR and placebo for MOS-Sleep total scores ranged from -6.5 to -7.6 at 12 months (all; P ≤ 0.001). All doses of TX-001HR significantly improved the Sleep Problems Index I subscale at all time points. The sleep somnolence subscale significantly improved from baseline with 0.5 mg E2/100 mg P4 and 0.5 mg E2/50 mg P4 at month 12. The incidence of somnolence as a treatment-emergent adverse event ranged from 0.2% to 1.2% versus 0% with placebo.Conclusion: TX-001HR significantly improved MOS-Sleep parameters from baseline to week 12, which was sustained for up to 12 months, and was associated with a very low incidence of somnolence.

AB  - Objective: To characterize the impact of TX-001HR on the relationship between vasomotor symptom (VMS) improvement and quality of life and sleep.Methods: REPLENISH (NCT01942668) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, which evaluated four daily doses of 17β-estradiol and progesterone (E2/P4) combined in a single, oral, softgel capsule in postmenopausal women (40-65 years) with a uterus and moderate to severe VMS (≥7/day or ≥50/week). In post hoc analyses, growth models were used to examine relationships between linear changes in VMS frequency and severity over 12 weeks and changes from baseline in the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL; total score and VMS domain) and the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep (total score, sleep problems indices I and II) questionnaire outcomes at 12 weeks with treatment compared with placebo.Results: Outcomes with all four E2/P4 doses were combined (n = 591) and compared with placebo (n = 135). In all 5 growth models, the effects of TX-001HR on MENQOL total score and vasomotor domain were significantly associated with changes in VMS frequency and severity observed over 12 weeks (all, P < 0.001). Treatment-mediated effects on MENQOL via VMS frequency and severity models were significant. Similar results were found with Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep total score and sleep problems indices.Conclusions: TX-001HR improvements in quality of life and sleep outcomes are associated with and may be mediated through improvements in VMS frequency and severity.

AB  - Background: The National Institutes of Health estimates the prevalence of insomnia in menopausal women at 40-50%. Some studies have shown that acupuncture might be effective in treating primary insomnia and insomnia related to depression and stroke. Although there are some programs supporting insomnia during the menopausal transition, there are few randomized controlled trials (RCT) to provide evidence regarding their effectiveness. We design a RCT of suitable sample size to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in patients with insomnia during the menopausal transition and to form an optimized acupuncture treatment protocol.Method/design: In this randomized, single-site, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 84 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group (n = 42) or the sham control group (n = 42) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive a total of 18 treatment sessions for eight consecutive weeks. Treatments will be given three times per week in the first four weeks, twice a week for the next two weeks, and finally once weekly for the final two weeks. Treatment will utilize eight main acupoints (GV20, GV24, GV29, RN6, RN4, SP6, HT7, EX-HN22) and extra two acupoints based on syndrome differentiation. The primary outcome will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes will be measured by sleep parameters recorded in the Actigraphy (SE, TST, SA), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Menopause Quality of Life (Men-QOL). The primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and the first and third month after the end of treatment.Discussion: If the results confirm that acupuncture is effective and safe for the treatment on insomnia in menopausal women, this positive outcome could provide evidence for clinical application.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800018645 .

AB  - This prospective repeated-measures study explored potential factors (postmenstrual age, body weight, gender, chronological age, illness severity, and circadian rhythm) related to preterm infants' circadian sleep/wake patterns. Circadian sleep/wake patterns were measured using an Actiwatch for 3 continuous days in preterm infants (gestational age of 28-36.4 weeks) in a neonatal intensive care unit and hospital nursery. Potential factors associated with circadian sleep/wake patterns were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation. For our sample of 30 preterm infants, better sleep/wake patterns were associated with male gender, younger postmenstrual and chronological age, lower body weight, and less illness severity. Preterm infants' total sleep time (B = 41.828, p <.01) and percentage of sleep time (B = 3.711, p <.01) were significantly longer at night than during the day. These findings can help clinicians recognize preterm infants' sleep problems, signaling the need to provide individualized support to maintain these infants' sleep quality during their early life.

AB  - Sleep disorders, resulting from hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms, are common in both peri- and postmenopausal women. Poor sleep quality is associated with increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk, depression and a global impairment in health status.Objectives: Our study aimed to assess sleep quality in a sample of postmenopausal women and to identify the factors associated with poor sleep quality. It also considered the negative impact of sleep disorders such as insomnia, hypersomnia and breathing disturbances.Subjects& Methods: Data came from a cross-sectional study of 195 postmenopausal women conducted at the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Their sociodemographic, gynecological and clinical characteristics were recorded and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Oviedo Sleep Questionnaire (Cuestionario Oviedo de Sueño, COS).Results: The mean PSQI score was 6.90 ± 4.43. Sleep problems were common, with 46.7% of participants scoring over 5 on the PSQI. Snoring was reported by 13% of the patients (PSQI item 10 A). While 10% of the poor sleepers reported episodes of apnea during rest (PSQI item 10B), 7.1% reported leg spasm (PSQ I item 10C). The mean total COS score was 17.57 ± 7. According to COS item 1, all the subjects reported some dissatisfaction with the quality of their sleep. According to the COS, the prevalence of insomnia was 3.6% using ICD-10 criteria and 15.4% using DSM-IV criteria. The mean ESS score was 6.12 ± 4.09.Conclusion: Postmenopausal women are likely to complain of disturbed sleep. Almost half of the women in this survey said their sleep quality was impaired, and most of that group would benefit from medical attention.

AB  - Insomnia is a common and recurring condition during the menopausal transition that negatively affects both quality of life and health. Peri-menopausal insomnia has a multifactorial etiology; previous depression, hormonal changes and age/hormone-related irregularity in circadian rhythms can contribute to menopausal insomnia. Age-related poor health, pain and stress may favor the development of insomnia, while vasomotor symptoms, in particular hot flashes, may contribute to chronic forms of insomnia by activating a vicious cycle. Insomnia increases two- to threefold the risk of developing depressive symptoms during the peri-menopause. In fact, the menopausal transition is a window of vulnerability for the development of depressive symptoms, in which the risk of a major depressive disorder is 2-4 times greater than in the premenopausal period. Depression naturally has a negative impact on daily functioning, quality of life and health. Since the relationship between insomnia and depressive symptoms has been shown to be bidirectional, the aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of their association in the context of the menopausal transition. By exploring the potential pathways of their bidirectional relationship, this overview should be useful for preventive and therapeutic purposes. By treating insomnia we may be able to interrupt the self-reinforcing feedback loop with depressive symptoms, and thereby improve affective symptoms and women's wellbeing in this period of their life.

AB  - Impairment of cognitive function is a common complaint by post-chemotherapy breast cancer survivors, specifically impairment of verbal learning and memory. The objective of this study was to identify the association between age, duration of education, chemotherapy type, hormone therapy usage, menopausal status, sleep quality, fatigue, stress, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels to memory and verbal learning function. This cross-sectional study consisted of 82 postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors, 81 non-chemotherapy survivors, and 80 non-cancer female patients in two hospitals. The data were collected using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test in Indonesian, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, and the Piper Fatigue Scale-12. All instruments were already adopted into Indonesian. Characteristic data were obtained from hospital reports. The mean age of the respondents was 43.06 (8.18) years, 197 (81.1%) had been educated for =12 years, 82 (33.7%) were post-chemotherapy survivors, 46 (18.9%) were using hormonal therapy, and 125 (51.4%) had gone through menopause. Among the remaining respondents, 91 (37.4%) were anemic, 124 (51.0%) had poor sleep quality, and 115 (47.3%) experienced moderate fatigue. Twenty-one (25.6%) of post-chemotherapy survivors had a high possibility of having dementia. The significant variables associated with memory and verbal learning function included age, stress, survivor type, chemotherapy category, sleep quality, and fatigue. The insignificant variables included the length of education, hormone therapy usage, menopausal status, and hemoglobin levels. A logistic regression analysis showed that stress was the most influential variable with an odds ratio of 1.159. It is recommended that nurses consider the significant variables when providing services to post-chemotherapy breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Background: Trauma-related diagnoses such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent in veterans. The identification of mechanisms related to stress vulnerability and development of PTSD specifically in a veteran population may aid in the prevention of PTSD and identification of novel treatment targets.Methods: Veterans with PTSD (n = 27), trauma-exposed veterans with no PTSD (TEC, n = 18) and non-trauma-exposed controls (NTEC, n = 28) underwent single-voxel proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3 Tesla in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) using a two-dimensional (2D) J-resolved point spectroscopy sequence in addition to completing a clinical battery.Results: The PTSD and TEC groups demonstrated lower gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)/H2O (p = 0.02) and glutamine (Gln)/H2O (p = 0.02) in the dACC as compared to the NTEC group. The PTSD group showed a trend towards higher Glu/GABA (p = 0.053) than the NTEC group. Further, GABA/H2O in the dACC correlated negatively with sleep symptoms in the PTSD group (p = 0.03) but not in the TEC and NTEC groups.Limitations: Cross-sectional study design, concomitant medications, single voxel measurement as opposed to global changes, absence of measure of childhood or severity of trauma and objective sleep measures, female participants not matched for menstrual cycle phase.Conclusions: Exposure to trauma in veterans may be associated with lower GABA/H2O and Gln/H2O in the dACC, suggesting disruption in the GABA-Gln-glutamate cycle. Further, altered Glu/GABA in the dACC in the PTSD group may indicate an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Further, lower GABA/H2O in the ACC was associated with poor sleep in the PTSD group. Treatments that restore GABAergic balance may be particularly effective in reducing sleep symptoms in PTSD.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluated the effect of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), with or without therapist support, on the perceived impact of hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS) and overall levels of menopausal symptoms (primary outcomes), sleep quality, HF/NS frequency, sexual functioning, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life in breast cancer survivors with treatment-induced menopausal symptoms.Patients and Methods: We randomly assigned 254 breast cancer survivors to a therapist-guided or a self-managed iCBT group or to a waiting list control group. The 6-week iCBT program included psycho-education, behavior monitoring, and cognitive restructuring. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and at 10 weeks and 24 weeks postrandomization. We used mixed-effects models to compare the intervention groups with the control group over time. Significance was set at P < .01. An effect size (ES) of .20 was considered small, .50 moderate and clinically significant, and .80 large.Results: Compared with the control group, the guided and self-managed iCBT groups reported a significant decrease in the perceived impact of HF/NS (ES, .63 and .56, respectively; both P < .001) and improvement in sleep quality (ES, .57 and .41; both P < .001). The guided group also reported significant improvement in overall levels of menopausal symptoms (ES, .33; P = .003), and NS frequency (ES, .64; P < .001). At longer-term follow-up (24 weeks), the effects remained significant, with a smaller ES for the guided group on perceived impact of HF/NS and sleep quality and for the self-managed group on overall levels of menopausal symptoms. Additional longer-term effects for both intervention groups were found for hot flush frequency.Conclusion: iCBT, with or without therapist support, has clinically significant, salutary effects on the perceived impact and frequency of HF/NS, overall levels of menopausal symptoms, and sleep quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep is of major importance for the athletes' short and long-term health, performance and recovery; however, published studies on athletes' sleep and even fewer before competition are scarce. This study evaluated the risk factors of sleep in young female gymnasts before an international competition. METHODS: Sixty-seven rhythmic gymnasts (M=18.7, SD=2.9 years) of high performance (M=36.6, SD=7.6 h/week) were evaluated regarding training and sport practice, body composition, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, precompetitive anxiety by the Sport Competition Anxiety Test form A, and detailed dietary intake just prior to a world competition. RESULTS: The majority of the participants (83.6%) presented reduced body fat levels (M=9.1, SD=2.1%) and low energy availability (EA, M=31.5, SD= 11.9 kcal/kgFFM/day). They slept 8h40±1h30/night on weekdays and 8h40±00h40/night on weekends, 67% suffered from mild daytime sleepiness and 78% had a reduced sleep quality. Precompetitive anxiety was on average moderate (M=22.7, SD=3.2). The risk factors for short sleep duration were: 1.92 for a training volume>30 hours/week (95% CI 0.84-4.39), 4.57 for menstruation (95% CI 1.17-17.77), 6.62 for bedtime ≥11:00 PM (95% CI 1.74-25.10), 1.40 for BF<12% (95% CI 1.03-1.92), 2.19 for FFM<30 kg (95% IC 0.94-4.94), 2.37 for BMR<1100 kcal/day (95% CI 1.06-5.32), 1.90 for EEE≥700 kcal (95% CI 0.92-3.93) and 3.17 for EA<45 kcal/kg FFM/day (95% CI 0.84-6.59). Age, performance, sleep duration on weekdays and precompetitive stress were also predictors for a reduced sleep quality and/or abnormal daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Age, training regime, menstruation, individual preferences for bedtime, body composition and energy were important predictors of gymnasts' precompetitive sleep with consequences upon their sleep duration, SQ and DS.

AB  - In rodents, the preovulatory LH surge is temporally gated, but the timing cue is unknown. Estrogen primes neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) to secrete kisspeptin, which potently activates GnRH neurons to release GnRH, eliciting a surge of LH to induce ovulation. Deletion of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 results in infertility. Previous studies have found that Bmal1 knockout (KO) females do not display an LH surge at any time of day. We sought to determine whether neuroendocrine disruption contributes to the absence of the LH surge. Because Kiss1 expression in the AVPV is critical for regulating ovulation, we hypothesized that this population is disrupted in Bmal1 KO females. However, we found an appropriate rise in AVPV Kiss1 and Fos mRNA at the time of lights out in ovariectomized estrogen-treated animals, despite the absence of a measureable increase in LH. Furthermore, Bmal1 KO females have significantly increased LH response to kiss-10 administration, although the LH response to GnRH was unchanged. We then created Kiss1- and GnRH-specific Bmal1 KO mice to examine whether Bmal1 expression is necessary within either kisspeptin or GnRH neurons. We detected no significant differences in any measured reproductive parameter. Our results indicate that disruption of the hypothalamic regulation of fertility in the Bmal1 KO females is not dependent on endogenous clocks within either the GnRH or kisspeptin neurons.

AB  - Objective: Women who undergo surgical menopause (SM) experience a relatively more acute and precipitous drop of estrogen compared with women who experience natural menopause (NM). Few studies, however, have compared sleep quality in women who experience natural versus SM.Methods: Participants were 526 postmenopausal women (mean age 60.2 ± 7.64). All participants completed self-report questionnaires about insomnia symptoms, sleep-interfering behaviors, depression, sleep quality, and gynecological history. Analysis of covariance was conducted to compare women who experienced NM versus SM on sleep variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether NM or SM groups predicted insomnia status. Regression-based moderation analysis was conducted to explore the moderating effect of type of menopause on the relationship between sleep-interfering behaviors and insomnia symptoms.Results: Among the sample, 81.6% (n = 429) reported going through NM and 18.4% (n = 97) reported going through SM. The SM group was significantly younger by 7.2 years (P < 0.001). Women in the SM group reported significantly worse sleep quality (P = 0.007), especially for sleep duration (P = 0.001) and habitual sleep efficiency (P = 0.010) compared with women in the NM group. Regression analysis indicated that individuals in the SM group were 2.131 (95% CI 1.055-4.303) times more likely to have insomnia compared with the NM group (P = 0.027). In addition, women in the SM group who displayed more sleep-interfering behaviors also had a higher severity of insomnia symptoms compared with women who experience NM (ß = 0.26, P = 0.03).Conclusions: Menopause can be both physically and psychologically challenging, but women who undergo SM experience worse sleep quality compared with women who experience NM, and may benefit from behavioral interventions.

AB  - Menopause is associated with problematic symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep problems, mood disorders, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and declines in cognitive functioning. Many women seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for symptom management. This article critically reviews the existing literature on CAM treatments most commonly used for menopausal symptoms. Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant, English-language literature published through March 2017. Results indicate that mind and body practices may be of benefit in reducing stress and bothersomeness of some menopausal symptoms. In particular, hypnosis is a mind-body intervention that has consistently shown to have a clinically significant effect on reducing hot flashes. Evidence is mixed in regard to the efficacy of natural products and there are some safety concerns. Health care providers should consider the evidence on CAM in providing an integrative health approach to menopausal symptom management.

AB  - Few studies have experimentally manipulated sleep to study its effect on aggressive behavior. The current study examined how reactive aggression was affected by having sleep restricted to 4-hours on a single night, a level of disruption commonly experienced. Both rested and sleep-restricted participants completed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a laboratory task in which participants seek to earn points, are provoked by a fictitious opponent stealing their points, and may choose to steal points in response. Logistic mixed-effect models were used to investigate the effect of sleep restriction and the role of sex hormones on the odds of choosing to steal. For men, and women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction did not result in significant changes reactive aggression, although the patterns of aggressive behavior appeared less reactive and retaliatory in nature. For women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction was associated with higher levels of reactive aggression. For both men and women in the luteal phase, sleep restriction disrupted an association between hormone change over the task (testosterone and estradiol, respectively) and reactive aggression that was observed in their control participants. In addition, higher testosterone before the PSAP in men was associated with maintaining a high level of stealing over the task. These results indicate a complex dynamic in which sex hormones and sleep interact to predict aggressive behavior in response to provocation.

AB  - Persistent pain conditions, including low back pain (LBP), are often accompanied by alterations in pronociceptive and antinociceptive mechanisms, as quantified by temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). It remains unclear whether altered pain sensitivity, CPM, and/or TSP are a consequence of pain presence or determine the degree of pain development. Pressure pain sensitivity, TSP, and CPM were assessed across an episode of exercise-induced LBP maintained for several days. Thirty healthy individuals participated in 3 experimental sessions: before (day 0), 2 days after fatiguing back muscle exercise with exercise-induced LBP present (day 2), and after pain resolution (day 7). Both handheld and cuff pressure-pain thresholds, along with TSP (10-cuff pain stimuli at .5 Hz) and CPM (cuff pain detection threshold prior versus during painful pressure conditioning) were assessed, alongside questionnaires pertaining to pain, disability, mood, sleep, menstruation, physical activity, and catastrophizing. The exercise-induced LBP model produced mild pain and disability, and reductions in pressure pain thresholds over both the lumbar and distant testing sites (p < .007). No pain-related changes were observed for TSP (p > .44) or CPM (p > .17). The baseline TSP was associated with the peak pain intensity of the exercise-induced LBP (p < .003). Perspective: Pressure-pain sensitivity was impacted by the presence of exercise-induced LBP, whereas TSP seemed to be more stable and was instead associated with the intensity of pain developed. No significant pain-related changes or associations were observed for CPM, suggesting this measure may have less usefulness in mild musculoskeletal pain conditions.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to report the incidence of low-energy fracture since menopause in postmenopausal women ≤70 years and to explore associated risk factors METHODS:: This was a part of the Chinese National Fracture Survey (CNFS), which was carried out in eight provinces of China mainland between January and May 2015. Data on 68,783 postmenopausal women ≤70 years were extracted from the CNFS database for calculations and analyses.Results: A total of 309 women were confirmed to have low-energy fractures in 2014, indicating the incidence of 449.2 (95% CI, 399.3-499.2) per 100,000 women. There were two obvious peaks of fracture incidence at the 4th year and the 9th year since menopause. From the 10th year on, the fracture incidence rate presented the relatively steady trends over years, only with slight interannual fluctuation. After adjustment for confounding variables, advanced age, higher latitude, milk intake ≥1/d, residence ≥2nd floor without elevator, alcohol consumption, sleep duration <7 h/d, history of past fracture, and more births were identified as significant risk factors. Supplementation of calcium or vitamin D or both was associated with 44% of fracture reduction (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.84).Conclusions: These data on low-energy fractures in postmenopausal women provided an updated clinical evidence base for better national healthcare planning and preventive efforts in China.

AB  - Importance: Acupuncture is a key component of therapy in traditional Chinese medicine. Only in the last few decades has acupuncture become popular in the United States. The mechanism behind acupuncture's effects on the body and brain has not been completely elucidated, but there is evidence that acupuncture has effects on the endocrine, immune, and sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It may also act through electrical and mechanical signaling through the connective tissue and fascia. Despite this uncertainty, the positive effects of acupuncture have been well established.Objective: In this review, we discuss the basic concepts of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture and examine the evidence regarding the use of acupuncture in obstetrics and gynecology.Evidence Acquisition: We conducted a literature review of acupuncture in obstetrics and gynecology using PubMed.Results: The available data demonstrate that acupuncture is beneficial in the treatment of labor pain, back pain in pregnancy, and dysmenorrhea. It is unclear if acupuncture is effective for hyperemesis, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and menopausal hot flushes, or if moxibustion is effective in correcting breech presentation. There are limited but positive data regarding menopause-related sleep disturbances, depression in pregnancy, and overactive bladder. Acupuncture is not beneficial for improving outcomes in in vitro fertilization.Conclusions and Relevance: Acupuncture is an increasingly popular therapy with many potential applications in obstetrics and gynecology. A general understanding of the basic principles of acupuncture and the safety and efficacy of its practice is necessary for the general obstetrician and gynecologist to make informed recommendations to patients.

AB  - Many symptoms of menopause may contribute to poor sleep and insomnia. These symptoms may also be associated with anxiety and affect the quality of women's lives. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a polarity therapy on insomnia and anxiety for women aged 40 to 60 years old. Forty-seven women participated in this experimental study. The participants were randomly assigned to the experiment group (n = 25)--receiving 4 sessions on polarity-or to the control group (n = 22)--receiving information on healthy sleep habits. Data were collected during the pre-test and the post-test using the Morin Insomnia Severity Index and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (FormY). A significant difference was found between the groups and the measurement time with respect to insomnia scores (F = 28.66 ; p < 0.0001) and anxiety scores (F = 14.14 ; p < 0.0001). Women who received the polarity intervention showed a significant decrease in the severity of their insomnia and of their state of anxiety compared to those in the control group during post intervention. The polarity intervention was effective in reducing the women's symptoms of insomnia and anxiety in the middle-aged women.
AB  - De nombreux symptômes associés à la ménopause peuvent perturber le sommeil et occasionner de l'insomnie. Ces symptômes peuvent également s'accompagner d 'anxiété et nuire à la qualité de vie des femmes. Cette étude avait pour but d'évaluer l'efficacité d 'une intervention en polarité sur l'insomnie et l'anxiété des femmes âgées de 40 à 60 ans. Dans ce devis expérimental, 47 femmes ayant des symptômes d 'insomnie ont été réparties aléatoirement dans un groupe expérimental (n = 25) recevant quatre séances en polarité ou dans le groupe contrôle (n = 22) recevant de l'information sur les saines habitudes de sommeil. Les données ont été recueillies avant et après l'intervention en utilisant l'Index de sévérité de l'insomnie et l'Inventaire d'anxiété situationnelle. Une différence significative a été observée entre les groupes et entre les temps de mesure en ce qui a trait aux scores d'insomnie (F = 28,66 ; p < 0,0001) et d 'anxiété (F = 14,14 ; p < 0,0001). Les participantes du groupe expérimental présentent une diminution significative de la sévérité de leur insomnie et de leur niveau d'anxiété situationnelle comparativement à celles du groupe contrôle en post-intervention. Cette intervention de polarité s'est avérée efficace pour réduire l'insomnie et l'anxiété des femmes d'âge moyen.

AB  - Introduction: Depression increases during menopause, and subclinical depressive symptoms increase risk for major depression. Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious.Materials and Methods: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34 ± 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up.Results: CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects.Conclusions: CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI. NAME: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: Women with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living longer as a result of advances in the care of their underlying disease. With the population growing of women living with SCD, reproductive health issues in this population have become an emphasized area of medical care. We sought to describe current patterns of contraception use, menstruation, and quality-of-life (QOL) measures in women with SCD.Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we administered paper surveys at two academic medical centers to women aged 10 to 55 years with SCD to capture current contraceptive use, characteristics of menstrual cycles, and QOL metrics.Results: Of the 103 women who participated, 12.7% (13/102) experienced a duration of menses >7 days (defined here as prolonged menstrual bleeding). Approximately half of women (51.5%, 53/103) used some form of contraception, with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections and condoms being the most common. During their last menstrual periods, women with both dysmenorrhea and prolonged menstrual bleeding (6.9%, 7/102) were more likely to experience more days of poor QOL, with more nights with sleep disturbance (P = 0.001) and more days with trouble taking care of themselves (P = 0.003), as well as being unable to do things they previously enjoyed (P = 0.001), compared with those with neither phenomenon (28.2%, 29/103).Conclusions: Dysmenorrhea and prolonged menstrual bleeding negatively affect the QOL of women with SCD. Menstrual histories and preventive measures for menstruation-related morbidity should be incorporated into routine evaluations of women with SCD.

AB  - For 15 years, the Collaborative Group for Research of the Climacteric in Latin America (REDLINC) has been conducting research on several topics including age of menopause, metabolic syndrome, quality of life and climacteric symptoms, sexual dysfunction, poor quality of sleep and insomnia, and use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in the general population and among gynecologists. Examples of data to have emerged for this region include the age of menopause (49 years), a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (42.9%), and a new waist circumference cut-off value for the Latin American population (88 cm). Sexual dysfunction, poor quality of life, and sleep disorders have a prevalence of over 50%, with obesity and sedentary lifestyles affected importantly. MHT use is still low (12.5%), lack of prescription the most important reason for not using it, and gynecologists use MHT for themselves but do not recommend it often to their patients. The prevalence of alternative therapy use, recommended by physicians, is high.

AB  - Hot flushes remain a debilitating aspect of menopause, disrupting daytime activities and sleep, and may last for years. Estrogen replacement is an effective treatment, but takes time to become maximally effective and is contraindicated in a significant proportion of women, most notably after breast cancer. Effective, non-hormonal therapies are therefore required. Recent years have seen substantial increases in understanding of the role of novel neuropeptides and tachykinins in hypothalamic function, particularly in the regulation of the reproductive axis through control of gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion, but with links to the control of vasomotor function. Neurokinin B, often co-expressed with kisspeptin in hypothalamic neurons, appears to be a key factor in the control of both systems. Several neurokinin B antagonists have been developed; data are emerging as to their effectiveness in the treatment of menopausal hot flushes. While data remain limited, these agents appear to have a remarkably fast onset of action, with the first 1 or 2 days of administration, and with a dramatic effect on both daytime flushes and night sleep disturbance. If safety and long-term function can be confirmed, these novel agents will be an important advance in therapy.

AB  - Menopause-related symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, weight gain, and decreased sexual functioning all have negative impacts on quality of life and affect daily activities such as sleep, work, and leisure activities. During the menopause transition, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurosteroids undergo important changes as a consequence of the failure of gonadal hormone production, at a time when many central nervous system activities deteriorate. Sex hormones have been implicated in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, dendritic branching, myelination, and other important mechanisms of neural plasticity. Knowledge of interactions between sex steroid hormones and the dominant neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and glutamate, will give women and health providers an important tool for improving their health and well-being. From the concept of neurosteroids derives another treatment strategy: the use of pharmaceutical agents that increase the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids within the nervous system. This approach has so far been hampered by lack of knowledge concerning the regulation of the biosynthetic pathways of neurosteroids and their relationship with sex steroids produced by the peripheral gland or with exogenous steroids. The present review summarizes some of the available clinical and experimental findings supporting the critical role of neurosteroids in postmenopausal women and their impact on quality of life.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that is characterized by hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity. Affected women have a high prevalence of insulin resistance and related metabolic complications. The frequency of sleep disturbances appears to be increased in women with PCOS, although most studies so far have included more severely affected obese women with PCOS who are referred to tertiary care clinics and may not represent the general population of women with PCOS. This article provides an overview of sleep disturbances in PCOS with the focus on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most commonly reported sleep disturbance among these women. The pathogenesis and risk factors for OSA in PCOS and its association with metabolic disorders is discussed in detail.

AB  - In this review, we discussed the types and frequencies of trigger factors of primary headache [migraine and tension-type headache (TTH)] among adult patients. We assessed the influence of geographical location, ethnicity and gender on the various trigger factors of a migraine and a TTH. We also evaluated the trigger factors among the multi-ethnic Southeast Asian adult patients. In a recent study, odor triggered more migrainous headaches compared to the other primary headaches. Odor was observed to be specific of migraines. Moreover, stress is one of the most common trigger factors for patients with migraines and TTHs worldwide. Migrainous patients have an increased sensitivity in comparison to non-migrainous patients. Furthermore, these patients have much difficulty in adapting to the high level of sensitivity, and the sensitized brain is therefore more vulnerable to trigger factors. In addition, the presence of one trigger factor may increase the exposure of other trigger factors. This phenomenon is more marked in the patients with migraines who have stress and menstruation as triggers, predisposing them to be more sensitive to other triggers. In conclusion, the geographical location factor has an influence on the trigger factors of headaches. Ethnicity may have an effect due to the cultural differences. Change in weather and sunlight are important commonly identified trigger factors for headaches. Moreover, gender differences in some trigger factors are present among the patients with headaches, especially sunlight and sleep deprivation. More research studies can be conducted to have a better understanding on trigger factors in the future. This will enable proper identification of trigger factors, leading to a decrease in the number of headache episodes and an improvement in quality of life for patients.

AB  - The call for increased attention to the biopsychosocial perspective in social work practice is now decades old in the USA. And yet the challenge of teaching and learning from this perspective for those with limited background in biology calls for more inter-disciplinary examples to assist students with the process of engaging in theory-informed practice. In addition to identifying the key elements of human biology, this review of the literature focuses on four examples of client behaviors that receive little or no attention in most current textbooks on the inter-disciplinary nature of human behavior in the social environment; namely, the psychobiology of sleep, the sociobiology of eating, the neurobiology of post-partum depression, and the behavioral endocrinology of menopause. This review concludes with implications for practice.

AB  - Sirt1 is an NAD-dependent, class III deacetylase that functions as a cellular energy sensor. In addition to its well-characterized effects in peripheral tissues, emerging evidence suggests that neuronal Sirt1 activity plays a role in the central regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. In this study, we generated mice expressing an enzymatically inactive form (N -MUT) or wild-type (WT) SIRT1 (N -OX) in mature neurons. N -OX male and female mice had impaired glucose tolerance, and N -MUT female, but not male, mice had improved glucose tolerance compared with that of WT littermates. Furthermore, glucose tolerance was improved in all mice with caloric restriction (CR) but was greater in the N -OX mice, who had better glucose tolerance than their littermates. At the reproductive level, N -OX females had impaired estrous cycles, with increased cycle length and more time in estrus. LH and progesterone surges were absent on the evening of proestrus in the N -OX mice, suggesting a defect in spontaneous ovulation, which was confirmed by the ovarian histology revealing fewer corpora lutea. Despite this defect, the mice were still fertile when mated to WT mice on the day of proestrus, indicating that the mice could respond to normal pheromonal or environmental cues. When subjected to CR, the N -OX mice went into diestrus arrest earlier than their littermates. Together, these results suggested that the overexpression of SIRT1 rendered the mice more sensitive to the metabolic improvements and suppression of reproductive cycles by CR, which was independent of circadian rhythms.

AB  - There is a new appreciation of the perimenopause—defined as the early and late menopause transition stages as well as the early postmenopause—as a window of vulnerability for the development of both depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes. However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: (1) epidemiology; (2) clinical presentation; (3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; (4) effects of hormone therapy; and (5) efficacy of other therapies (e.g., psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (i.e., vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (i.e., antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Data on estrogen plus progestin are sparse and inconclusive.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to describe the major complaints of menopausal symptoms among middle-aged women who initiated healthcare seeking for menopausal symptoms and to understand the factors influencing women's decisions to seek perimenopausal health care in Shanghai, China.Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in five hospitals in Shanghai. Women aged 40 to 60 years at their first visit to the perimenopausal outpatient departments/clinics were investigated in person over a 3-month period. Information on sociodemographics, menopausal symptoms, and experiences in seeking perimenopausal health care was collected using a structured questionnaire. Menopausal symptoms were assessed with the modified Kupperman Menopausal Index (mKMI).Results: A total of 316 women were enrolled in the study, with an average age of 50.5 years (SD: 5.1 y). The prevalence of menopausal syndrome (mKMI >6 points) was 80%, with 7% of the cases being severe. The top five reported symptoms were hot flushes/sweating (62%), fatigue (54%), sleep disturbance (51%), mood swings (40%), and joint/muscle pain (40%). The median interval between symptom occurrence and seeking perimenopausal health care was 5.0 months (IQR: 2.0-23.3 mo). Cox regression analysis revealed that older age, no health insurance, employment, multiple symptoms, sleep disturbance, urinary incontinence, and visits to nonspecialized departments were significantly associated with a longer delay in seeking perimenopausal health services (P < 0.05).Conclusions: The prevalence of menopausal syndrome was relatively high among 40- to 60-year-old women who initiated healthcare seeking in Shanghai. Months of delay occurred before they sought perimenopausal health services. The delay was related to age, the nature and number of symptoms, working status, and health insurance. Improvement of the menopausal health knowledge in Chinese middle-aged women may lead to more timely healthcare seeking. Professional and accessible perimenopausal health services are in high demand in Shanghai.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep has been closely linked to breast cancer risk. However, the association between sleep and breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the separate and joint effects of multiple sleep characteristics on breast cancer prognosis among Chinese women.Methods: A total of 1580 breast cancer patients were recruited between October 2008 and December 2014 and followed up until December 31, 2017 in Guangzhou. Multivariate Cox models were conducted to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for breast cancer prognosis in association with sleep characteristics.Results: Long sleep duration at night (>9 h) (HR = 2.33, 95%CI: 1.01-5.42), poor sleep quality (HR = 3.08, 95%CI: 1.74-5.47), and impaired daytime function (HR = 2.49, 95%CI: 1.65-3.79) after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression. Both short sleep duration (<6 h) (HR = 2.00, 95%CI: 1.06-3.77, Pinteraction = 0.011) and long sleep duration (>9 h) (HR = 4.69, 95%CI: 1.31-16.78, Pinteraction = 0.187) increased the progression risk only among patients with impaired but not normal daytime function. In addition, daytime napping significantly modified the effect of short sleep duration on the progression (HR = 3.55, 0.59, 95%CI: 1.55-7.97, 0.23-1.53 for patients without and with daytime napping, respectively, Pinteraction = 0.005). Stratification results suggested that the associations were more evident among pre-menopausal patients, although no significant interaction was observed.Conclusion: Our findings suggested that inadequate sleep duration to feel one's best and poor sleep quality after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression, particularly for pre-menopausal women.

AB  - Context: During puberty, LH pulse frequency increases during sleep; in women, LH pulse frequency slows during sleep in the early/middle follicular phase (FP) of the menstrual cycle. The origin and significance of this developmental transition are unknown.Objective: To determine the relationship between progesterone (P4) exposure, sleep-related slowing of LH pulses in the FP, and the intercycle FSH rise, which promotes folliculogenesis, in early postmenarchal girls.Methods: 23 girls (gynecologic age 0.4 to 3.5 years) underwent hormone measurements and pelvic ultrasounds during two consecutive cycles and one frequent blood sampling study with concurrent polysomnography during the FP.Results: Subjects demonstrated one of four patterns during cycle 1 that represent a continuum of P4 exposure: ovulatory cycles with normal or short luteal phase lengths or anovulatory cycles ± follicle luteinization. Peak serum P4 and urine pregnanediol (Pd) in cycle 1 were inversely correlated with LH pulse frequency during sleep in the FP of cycle 2 (r = -0.5; P = 0.02 for both). The intercycle FSH rise and folliculogenesis in cycle 2 were maintained after anovulatory cycles without P4 or Pd exposure or nocturnal slowing of LH pulse frequency in the FP.Conclusions: During late puberty, rising P4 levels from follicle luteinization and ovulation may promote a slower LH pulse frequency during sleep in the FP. However, a normal FSH rise and follicle growth can occur in the absence of P4-associated slowing. These studies therefore suggest that an immature LH secretory pattern during sleep is unlikely to contribute to menstrual irregularity in the early postmenarchal years.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial and health-related risk factors for depressive symptoms are known. It is unclear if these are associated with depressive symptom patterns over time. We identified trajectories of depressive symptoms and their risk factors among midlife women followed over 15 years. Methods: Participants were 3300 multiracial/ethnic women enrolled in a multisite longitudinal menopause and aging study, Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Biological, psychosocial, and depressive symptom data were collected approximately annually. Group-based trajectory modeling identified women with similar longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms. Trajectory groups were compared on time-invariant and varying characteristics using multivariable multinomial analyses and pairwise comparisons. Results: Five symptom trajectories were compared (50% very low; 29% low; 5% increasing; 11% decreasing; 5% high). Relative to whites, blacks were less likely to be in the increasing trajectory and more likely to be in the decreasing symptom trajectory and Hispanics were more likely to have a high symptom trajectory than an increasing trajectory. Psychosocial/health factors varied between groups. A rise in sleep problems was associated with higher odds of having an increasing trajectory and a rise in social support was associated with lower odds. Women with low role functioning for 50% or more visits had three times the odds of being in the increasing symptom group. Conclusions: Changes in psychosocial and health characteristics were related to changing depressive symptom trajectories. Health care providers need to evaluate women's sleep quality, social support, life events, and role functioning repeatedly during midlife to monitor changes in these and depressive symptoms.

AB  - Introduction. Urinary incontinence (UI) is a health problem affecting the quality of women's lives (QOL) at various life stages. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) can be caused by previous vaginal deliveries and is especially likely to occur in the perimenopausal period. The most commonly recommended first-choice treatment methods involve exercises for the pelvic floor muscles (PFM). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of isolated PFM exercises and combined training of the PFM and the m.transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle on the QoL of patients with SUI with regard to the number of vaginal deliveries. Material and Methods. 137 women with SUI were qualified for analysis (mean age 53,1 ± 5,5). To assess the effectiveness of PFM training QOL questionnaire was used (ICIQ-LUTS qol). PFM training for groups A (PFM+TrA) and B (PFM) was intended for 12 weeks. Statistica v. 12.0 PL, StatSoft, USA, was used for statistical calculations. Results. The analysis demonstrated that conservative treatment based on the A training program (PFM + TrA) yielded statistically significantly better results than the B program (PFM), with the improvement observed in such QoL domains as the performance of household duties, physical activity and travelling, social limitations, emotions, sleep problems and fatigue, the frequency of changing panty liners, fluid intake control, and embarrassment. Conclusion. Both the combined training of the PFM and the synergistic (TrA) muscle and the isolated PFM exercises improve the QoL of women with SUI. Nonetheless, the combined PFM and TrA muscle physiotherapy is more effective. The exercises for the PFM and the synergistic muscle give better results in women who have given birth fewer than three times than isolated PFM exercises.

AB  - Background: Although the 2017 Endocrine Society Guidelines for gender dysphoria stipulated that cross-sex hormone therapy (CHT) achieve gonadal steroid levels equivalent to those of a cisperson of the chosen sex, for transgender women (male-to-female gender dysphoria), current gonadal therapy is usually estradiol. Accumulated evidence indicates that normally ovulatory menstrual cycles are necessary for ciswomen's current fertility, as well as for later-life bone and cardiovascular health and the prevention of breast and endometrial cancers.Evidence Acquisition: Extensive past clinical experience with transgender women's CHT using estradiol/estrogen combined with progesterone/medroxyprogesterone and pioneering the addition of spironolactone. Comprehensive progesterone physiology research plus a brief review of transgender women's literature to assess current therapy and clinical outcomes, including morbidity and mortality.Purpose: To emphasize that both ovarian hormones, progesterone as well as estradiol, are theoretically and clinically important for optimal transgender women's CHT.Evidence Synthesis: It is important to add progesterone to estradiol and an antiandrogen in transgender women's CHT. Progesterone may add the following: (i) more rapid feminization, (ii) decreased endogenous testosterone production, (iii) optimal breast maturation to Tanner stages 4/5, (iv) increased bone formation, (v) improved sleep and vasomotor symptom control, and (vi) cardiovascular health benefits.Conclusions: Evidence has accrued that normal progesterone (and ovulation), as well as physiological estradiol levels, is necessary during ciswomen's premenopausal menstrual cycles for current fertility and long-term health; transgender women deserve progesterone therapy and similar potential physiological benefits.

AB  - Introduction: Night urination is an extremely niggling condition affecting men and women of all ages. Multiple medical conditions are associated with nocturia and negatively impact the quality of life. However people often hesitate to seek the healthcare and consider as an untreatable condition and part of aging process. Understanding the underline illness and its associated factors are vital aspects in the management of Nocturia. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the Co-morbidity, Precipitating and associated factors of Nocturia among adults. Materials and Method: An exploratory descriptive design was carried out among 54 adult clients of 35-65 years of age. The data was collected using self-assessment tool of Co-morbidity, Precipitating and associated factors of Nocturia and interview technique was adopted. The data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The finding of the study showed that the Proportion of Nocturia among adult clients was 54%. More than half 58.6% of the subjects were males and the mean age 55.4±8.8. The highest respondents were with primary education. The Majority of the respondents( 96.6%) were married. The severity of Nocturia assessment shows 48.3% had moderate form of nocturia. The Co-morbidity assessment reveals that the 35% of subjects equally had increased blood pressure and constipation and 21% of subjects equally had Diabetes Mellitus and incontinence of urine. Among 12 females 25% of subjects had uterus related diseases and among 17 males, 35% of subjects had disease related to prostate gland. The results related to Precipitating factors of Nocturia shows that 38 % of subjects were consuming coffee, 28% were smokers, and 69% were taking Afternoon Naps, 97 % were consuming more water / fluids before bedtime, 93% were getting anxious easily, 90% were consuming spicy foods, 87% were urinating before going bed. The Associated factors of Nocturia result shows 100% of the subjects had insomnia, 55% had frightening or unpleasant dream during sleep, and 41% were reported that they snore. The study found that there was significant association between the Co-morbidity of Nocturia and the selected demographic variables such as age (p≤0.043), Marital status(p≤0.001) ,number of children (p≤0.013) , occupation (p≤0.001), Diet (p≤0.001), BMI (p≤0.001), Type of attainment of menopause (p≤0.003) and Type of delivery(p≤0.003) . Conclusion: The study found that numerous factors contribute to the night urination.

AB  - Hot flashes (HFs) are a prominent symptom of menopause known to unfavorably influence mood, sleep, and quality of life. More womenliving with HIV are entering menopause andmay experience a greater prevalence of HFs and more severe HFs compared with uninfected women. This integrative review evaluated existing evidence on potential health characteristics associated with HFs in women living with HIV during menopause. A search strategy was conducted within 6 databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the review, and the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice model was used to evaluate methodological quality and appraisal of the evidence. Five articles met the review eligibility criteria. Three content categories emerged from the key findings of the 5 articles: HIV-specific characteristics, mental health and cognitive characteristics, and quality of life and social characteristics. Implications for research and clinical care were identified.

AB  - Although evidence exists for a daily rhythm in bone metabolism, the contribution of factors such as melatonin levels, the light-dark cycle, and the sleep-wake cycle is difficult to differentiate given their highly correlated time courses. To examine these influences on bone resorption, we collected 48-h sequential urine samples under both ambulatory (8-h sleep:16-h wake) and constant routine (CR) (constant wake, posture, nutrition and dim light) conditions from 20 healthy premenopausal women. Urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s; ng/h) and the bone resorption marker amino-terminal cross-linked collagen I telopeptide (NTx; bone collagen equivalents nM/h) were assayed and fit by cosinor models to determine significant 24-h rhythms and acrophase. Most participants had significant 24-h aMT6s rhythms during both ambulatory and CR conditions (95 and 85%, respectively), but fewer had significant 24-h NTx rhythms (70 and 70%, respectively). Among individuals with significant rhythms, mean (± SD) aMT6s acrophase times were 3:57 ± 1:50 and 3:43 ± 1:25 h under ambulatory and CR conditions, respectively, and 23:44 ± 5:55 and 3:06 ± 5:15 h, respectively, for NTx. Mean 24-h levels of both aMT6s and NTx were significantly higher during CR compared with ambulatory conditions (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Menstrual phase (follicular versus luteal) had no impact on aMT6s or NTx timing or 24-h levels. This study confirms an endogenous circadian rhythm in NTx with a night-time peak when measured under CR conditions, but also confirms that environmental factors such as the sleep-wake or light-dark cycles, posture or meal timing affects overall concentrations and peak timing under ambulatory conditions, the significance of which remains unclear.

AB  - Menopause is associated with problematic symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep problems, mood disorders, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and declines in cognitive functioning. Many women seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for symptom management. This article critically reviews the existing literature on CAM treatments most commonly used for menopausal symptoms. Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant, English-language literature published through March 2017. Results indicate that mind and body practices may be of benefit in reducing stress and bothersomeness of some menopausal symptoms. In particular, hypnosis is a mind-body intervention that has consistently shown to have a clinically significant effect on reducing hot flashes. Evidence is mixed in regard to the efficacy of natural products and there are some safety concerns. Health care providers should consider the evidence on CAM in providing an integrative health approach to menopausal symptom management.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the prevalence and predictors of sexual frequency, sexual desire in midlife partnered Chinese women. Methods: Sexual frequency, sexual desire over the past 3 months, menopausal symptoms and other socioeconomic information were assessed for women aged 40–65 years in the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Results: Among 3485 eligible partnered participants, the prevalence of low sexual frequency (less than once per week) and low sexual desire (less than 5 scores) were 72.74% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 71.16%–74.23%) and 71.79% (95% CI = 70.30–73.17%), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.17–1.23), more educated (>15 years) (compared with<10 years, OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48–0.82), perimenopause, postmenopause (compared with premenopause, OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.02–2.15, OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.80–4.23), sleep disorder (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.02–1.50), unemployment (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.45–2.92) were independently associated with low sexual frequency, while multiple linear regression revealed that age β = –0.126, 95% CI = –0.139––0.114), unemployment (β = –0.792, 95% CI = –0.954 to –0.629),chronic diseases (compared with no disease, single disease (β = –0.200, 95% CI = –0.020 to –0.077, multiple diseases (β = –0.792, 95% CI = –0.859 to –0.372), body mass index (β = –0.615, 95% CI = –0.859 to –0.372), postmenopause (β = –0.915, 95% CI = –1.143 to –0.759) were independent indicators for low sexual desire after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Low sexual frequency and low sexual desire were quite prevalent in midlife Chinese partnered women. Some factors, such as sleep disorder, obesity are modifiable or can be prevented or treated with safe and effective therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND Women in menopause experience dramatic alterations in gonadal hormone concentrations, including diminished estradiol levels. It has been hypothesized that these hormonal changes may be responsible for the occurrences of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, sleep disruption, night sweats, and irritability, as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in postmenopausal women. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine if there is any association between hormonal changes and menopausal symptoms, including MCI in postmenopausal women. METHODS A total of 245 postmenopausal women were recruited for this crosssectional study and classified into 2 groups; MCI and non-MCI groups. Diagnosis of MCI was made using the modified Petersen criteria. Variables such as subjects' age, duration of menopause, menopausal symptoms, anthropometric status, hormone levels, and cognitive status were assessed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Of the 245 subjects enrolled in this study, 53.9% had MCI. Multivariate analysis found that sleep disruption and estradiol levels were independent risk factors of MCI in postmenopausal women. No significant correlation was found between menopausal symptoms and estradiol concentration. CONCLUSIONS Low estradiol levels were associated with higher risks of experiencing menopausal symptoms and MCI. Sleep disruption and estradiol levels were the most influential factors in the development of MCI in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective (s): Premenstrual syndrome is one of the most common disorders of women in reproductive age and is associated with decreased quality of life. However, how this syndrome affects the quality of life in women is not well defined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the consequence of premenstrual syndrome on women's quality of life. Methods: This was a qualitative study. We reviewed experiences of 21 women with premenstrual syndrome. And were asked to express their perceptions. The data obtained from interviews. To explore the data content analysis was performed. Results: The findings showed premenstrual syndrome affected quality of life in women in several areas including physical health (cardio-pulmonary, genitourinary, neurological, skin and hair, digestive, musculoskeletal and general health); psychological health (mood, cognitive and emotions)", behaviors (sleep and nutrition patterns); and family-social issues (inadequate interpersonal relationships, sexual dysfunction and social isolation). Conclusion: The findings suggest that special attention should be given to consequences of premenstrual syndrome on the quality of life in women. Improving quality of life in this population needs essential consideration.

AB  - Objective: Sleep quality is closely related to bone health. Aging and estrogen deficiency are known determinants of poor sleep quality and osteoporosis. However, the impact of aging and menopause on the associations between sleep quality and bone mineral density (BMD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between sleep quality and BMD in Chinese women vary by age groups and menopausal status.Methods: A total of 2067 women aged 18-80 years were included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the score >7 was indicative of poor sleep quality. BMD was determined using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants were categorized into three age groups. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations between sleep quality and BMD. Covariates included in the models were age, menopausal status, weight, height, percent body fat, physical activity, alcohol drinking, calcium supplement use, marital status, education and metabolic diseases.Results: We observed that poor sleep quality was correlated to low total BMD and legs BMD in middle-aged women after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, when we reran the regression models based on menopausal status in middle-aged women, significant associations between BMD and sleep quality were observed in premenopausal and early postmenopausal groups.Conclusion: Our findings showed a more robust association between sleep quality and BMD in premenopausal and early menopausal groups. Further studies should be conducted to explore whether sleep quality intervention would improve bone health of women in these periods and prevent osteoporosis in their late life.

AB  - Background: Sleep apnea is a common health disorder that is strongly associated with many serious comorbidities. At Patel Medical Clinic located in rural southwestern Arizona, the clinic director acknowledged the need to identify individuals that may have this condition but may go undetected. Presentation of symptoms in women can be misleading for diagnosis and conceals the need for further workup. Although men are more commonly recognized for having this condition, women of 50 years of age and older are vulnerable as the risk for sleep apnea increases significantly after menopause. In this study, women 50 years of age and older were asked to volunteer to determine sleep apnea risk and to identify barriers to diagnosis. Methods: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the use of a validated screening tool in identifying women 50 years of age and older in a rural southwestern internal medicine practice who are at moderate to high-risk of sleep apnea using a cross-sectional quantitative survey design. The study took place at Patel Medical Clinic, a private medical establishment located in rural Arizona. All clinic patients who are female and 50 years of age and older and patients of this clinic during data collection times were able to participate in the study, regardless of sleep apnea status. Results: Most participants were of the 60--69 and 70--79 age groups. Study subjects consisted of 54 women. Of these, (37) 68.5% of participants scored at moderate or high-risk of sleep apnea. A total of (27) 50% participants scored as "moderate-risk," (10) 18.5% scored as high-risk. Of the 54 participants, (13) 24% had a previous diagnosis of sleep apnea. Of those 13 with an established diagnosis, (7) 53% scored in the moderate-risk category, and (5) 38 % scored in the high-risk category. Out of those that were referred for sleep study but unable to participate, various barriers were identified that were unique to each individual participant. Discussion/Recommendations: Symptoms of sleep apnea are vastly present among participants. Many participants that scored as having moderate to high-risk have not been referred for sleep study. A screening tool could potentially reduce the number of moderate-to-high-risk patients from going unrecognized. Additional long-term studies are necessary to further examine barriers for diagnostic testing and how to better ensure that these tests are completed. Women with sleep apnea often present with gender-specific symptoms and could greatly benefit from a female-focused questionnaire.

AB  - Up to 25% of ovulating women suffer from primary dysmenorrhea, a condition associated with pain and transient-reduced quality of life, along with greater irritability and impaired sleep. In the present study, we asked whether and if so to what extent melatonin and meloxicam can improve subjective and objective sleep and reduce pain among women with primary dysmenorrhea (PD). To this end, we conducted a double-blind cross-over clinical trial lasting for three menstrual cycles. A total of 14 women (mean age M = 27.5 years) with primary dysmenorrhea took part in the study. At baseline, that is, during the first menstruation, they completed a visual analogue scale to rate pain; sleep continuity was assessed via actigraphs, and overall sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Next, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either melatonin during the second, and meloxicam during the third menstruation, or meloxicam during the second, and melatonin during the third menstruation. Neither participants nor investigators were aware of participants’ study assignment. During the second and third menstruations, the assessments described above were repeated. At baseline, sleep assessed both objectively and subjectively was impaired, and pain was high. Subjective sleep improved and pain decreased during the second and third menstruations irrespective of whether melatonin or meloxicam was administered first or second. Likewise, objective sleep efficiency increased and objective sleep latency shortened. The efficacy of melatonin was superior to that of meloxicam. The present pattern of results suggests that both melatonin and meloxicam are suitable to treat pain and PD-related sleep complaints among women with primary dysmenorrhea.

AB  - This study aimed to examine whether the characteristics of mental health and sleep duration, alone or in combination, are associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. This population-based, cross-sectional study analyzed the data from 4445 women aged 19-49 years, who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012. A structured questionnaire was used to assess mental health characteristics, sleep duration, and menstrual cycle irregularity. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. High stress, depressive mood, and suicidal ideation were associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity after adjusting for confounding variables (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.33 [1.07-1.65], 1.56 [1.17-2.07], and 1.37 [1.01-1.87], respectively). Short sleep duration (≤ 5 h a day) was significantly associated with higher odds of severe menstrual cycle irregularity with menstrual interval of greater than 3 months (2.67 [1.35-5.27]). Participants with sleep duration of ≤ 5 h a day with psychological stress, depressive mood, or suicidal ideation had higher odds of menstrual cycle irregularity (1.96 [1.26-3.05], 2.86 [1.50-5.44], and 2.25 [1.18-4.29]). This study suggests positive associations of mental health problems and short sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adults. Therefore, strategies to deal with psychological stress, depressive mood, and sleep duration are needed for improving the reproductive health of women suffering from menstrual disturbances.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: A wide variety of triggers prompt attacks in episodic migraine. Although experimental triggers such as glyceryl trinitrate reliably produce migraine, natural triggers are much less predictable and vary in importance between individuals. This review describes the most common triggers in episodic migraine and provides strategies for managing them in clinical practice.Recent Findings: Multiple migraine attack triggers have been established based on patient surveys, diary studies, and clinical trials. Stress, menstrual cycle changes, weather changes, sleep disturbances, alcohol, and other foods are among the most common factors mentioned. Clinical studies have verified that fasting, premenstrual periods in women, "letdown" after stress, and most likely low barometric pressures are migraine triggers. Premonitory symptoms such as neck pain, fatigue, and sensitivity to lights, sounds, or odors may mimic triggers. Multiple studies clearly demonstrate triggers in episodic migraine, often related to change in homeostasis or environment. Many common migraine triggers are not easily modifiable, and avoiding triggers may not be realistic. Healthy lifestyle choices such as exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and eating regularly may prevent triggers and transformation to chronic migraine over time.

AB  - Purpose: To identify factors associated with menstrual distress and characterize the relationship between menstrual distress and sleep disturbance in middle-school girls. Methods: Participants in this correlational study were 117 middle-school girls who were recruited through convenience sampling. Data were collected from March 2018 to April 2018 using self-reported structured questionnaires and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0. Factors associated with menstrual distress included physiological, psychological, and situational factors based on the theory of unpleasant symptoms. Results: Age of menarche (β=-.28, p<.001), amount of menstruation (β=.23, p=.004), lifestyle- related exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (β=.21, p=.027), and academic and peer-relationship stress (β=.19, p=.025) influenced menstrual distress, explaining 47.4% of the variance in this regression model. The relationship between menstrual distress and sleep disturbance was statistically significant. Sleep disturbance was increased 1.26 folds when dysmenorrhea score increased by one unit (OR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.01~1.58). However, parental support was not a significant moderating factor of sleep disturbance. Conclusion: This study provides basis to develop an intervention strategy to alleviate menstrual discomfort in adolescents and improve their quality of sleep.

AB  - Cancer treatment may result in loss of ovarian function through surgical removal of the ovaries, chemotherapy or radiation. While menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, memory concerns and mood issues can be extremely bothersome to some women going through menopause naturally, women who undergo an induced menopause usually experience more sudden and severe symptoms. Pain and vaginal dryness can occur whether a woman has a sexual partner or not. In women with breast cancer, the aetiology of impaired sexual functioning, and lowered sexual desire, is often multifactorial, and may be related to physical and/or psychological reasons. Pain and vaginal dryness in women without a history of breast cancer can usually be safely treated with vaginal estrogens, in the form of a cream, pessary or ring, and simple lubricants or vaginal moisturisers. Safe usage of vaginal estrogen replacement therapy in breast cancer patients has not been studied within randomised clinical trials of long duration; the guidelines below reflect a clinical consensus.

AB  - Objective: To identify through telephone counselling the signs and symptoms presented by patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy with the protocol composed by doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine and to compare severity scores of the signs and symptoms presented in the cycles of the protocol. Methods: Descriptive, prospective, quantitative study. Seven patients received telephone counselling in 24 scheduled and unscheduled calls, corresponding to 6 ABVD chemotherapy cycle. The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were used for scoring the symptoms, along with a conduct protocol. A descriptive and analytical analysis was conducted. Results: Two hundred and eighty-six telephone calls generated 1,870 symptomatic complaints. In scheduled calls, the most prevalent complaints were fatigue, distress, lack of appetite, vomiting and nausea. As for the interference in daily life activities, the items related to general activities, work, difficulty walking, and mood changes were reported more frequently. In unscheduled calls, lack of appetite and irregular menstruation were the most recurring complaints. The analysis of the progression of symptoms showed an increase in nausea and vomiting (p=0.02), decrease in fatigue and shortness of breath (p≤0.03), improvement in sleep (p=0.02) and decrease of stress (p=0.02). Conclusion: Fatigue, nausea, vomiting and alterations in work activities were frequently reported. There was progression of nausea and vomiting but regression of fatigue and stress. Telephone consultation allowed a rapid communication and management of an expressive number of symptoms.
AB  - Objetivo: Identificar los signos y síntomas presentados por pacientes con linfoma de Hodgkin sometidos al protocolo quimioterápico compuesto por doxorrubicina, bleomicina, vinblastina y dacarbazina (ABVD) mediante consulta telefónica, y comparar los puntajes de graduación de los signos y síntomas presentados en los ciclos del protocolo. Métodos: Descriptivo, prospectivo, cuantitativo. Siete pacientes recibieron asesoramiento telefónico en 24 momentos de llamadas programadas y no programadas, correspondientes a 6 ciclos de quimioterapia con protocolo ABVD. Se utilizó el Inventario de Síntomas de M. D. Anderson y el Criterio de Terminología Común para Efectos Adversos, para la puntuación de lis síntomas, y un protocolo de conductas. Se realizó análisis descriptivo y analítico. Resultados: Doscientas ochenta y seis llamadas telefónicas determinaron 1.870 quejas sintomáticas. En las llamadas programadas, las quejas más prevalentes fueron: fatiga, preocupaciones, falta de apetito, vómitos y náuseas. Respecto a interferencia en actividades cotidianas, los ítems relacionados con actividad en general, laboral y dificultad para caminar, además de cambios del humor, fueron informados con mayor frecuencia. En llamadas no programadas, la falta de apetito y la irregularidad menstrual resultaron las quejas más habituales. En el análisis de progresión de los síntomas se observó aumento de náuseas y vómitos (p=0,02), disminución de fatiga y falta de aire (p≤0,03), mejora del sueño (p=0,02) y disminución del estrés (p=0,02). Conclusión: Hubo informe frecuente de fatiga, náuseas, vómitos y cambios en actividades laborales. Existió progresión de náuseas y vómitos, y regresión de fatiga y estrés. La consulta telefónica permitió comunicación y rápido manejo de una expresiva cantidad de síntomas.

This study examines change in women's HRQL over 11 years from ages 47-59 to 57-69 and identifies midlife characteristics that predict HRQL at older ages.Methods: Physical (PCS) and mental component summaries (MCS) of the SF-36 were used to assess HRQL from 2002 to 2013 in 2,614 women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multiethnic/racial cohort study. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) models to obtain unadjusted predicted mean trajectories of PCS and MCS as a function of age.Results: LOESS predicted PCS declined from 51.6 to 47.1, whereas MCS increased from 49.2 to 53.1. In multivariable models, controlling for baseline PCS, higher baseline physical activity (p = .002) and increase in physical activity from baseline (p < .0001) predicted better PCS. Time since baseline (ie, aging; p < .001), higher baseline body mass index (p < .0001), increased body mass index over time (p < .0001), smoking (p < .05), two or more medical conditions (p < .0001), sleep problems (p < .0001), and urinary incontinence (p < .0001) were related to lower PCS. Early (p = .004) and late postmenopause (p = .001; vs. premenopause) and aging (p = .05) predicted higher MCS. Predictors of lower MCS were less than very good health (p < .0001), sleep problems (p < .0001), stressful life events (p < .0001), higher perceived stress (p < .0001), and higher trait anxiety (p = .004). Race/ethnicity was related to MCS, but not PCS.Conclusions: Several potentially modifiable midlife factors, such as improved sleep hygiene, physical activity, and body mass index, might improve HRQL for older women.

AB  - Background: Many women experience both vasomotor menopausal symptoms (VMS) and depressed mood at midlife, but little is known regarding the prospective bi-directional relationships between VMS and depressed mood and the role of sleep difficulties in both directions. Methods: A pooled analysis was conducted using data from 21 312 women (median: 50 years, interquartile range 49−51) in eight studies from the InterLACE consortium. The degree of VMS, sleep difficulties, and depressed mood was self-reported and categorised as never, rarely, sometimes, and often (if reporting frequency) or never, mild, moderate, and severe (if reporting severity). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the bi-directional associations adjusted for within-study correlation. Results: At baseline, the prevalence of VMS (40%, range 13–62%) and depressed mood (26%, 8–41%) varied substantially across studies, and a strong dose-dependent association between VMS and likelihood of depressed mood was found. Over 3 years of follow-up, women with often/severe VMS at baseline were more likely to have subsequent depressed mood compared with those without VMS (odds ratios (OR) 1.56, 1.27–1.92). Women with often/severe depressed mood at baseline were also more likely to have subsequent VMS than those without depressed mood (OR 1.89, 1.47–2.44). With further adjustment for the degree of sleep difficulties at baseline, the OR of having a subsequent depressed mood associated with often/severe VMS was attenuated and no longer significant (OR 1.13, 0.90–1.40). Conversely, often/severe depressed mood remained significantly associated with subsequent VMS (OR 1.80, 1.38–2.34). Conclusions: Difficulty in sleeping largely explained the relationship between VMS and subsequent depressed mood, but it had little impact on the relationship between depressed mood and subsequent VMS.

AB  - Objective: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is currently considered as a unique condition, but it has been suggested that the prevalence, clinical presentation, and associated conditions may differ by sex or by menopausal status in women. We aimed to assess the prevalence of SDB and associated comorbidities in pre- and postmenopausal women compared with men.Methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort study underwent polysomnography in their home environment and had extensive phenotyping for diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression.Results: A total of 2121 subjects (age 40-85 [59 ± 11] years, body mass index 25.6 ± 4.1 kg/m2, 1024 men and 1097 women [769 postmenopausal]) were included. SDB prevalence based on an apnea-hypopnea index of >5/h, >15/h, >20/h, and ≥30/h, respectively, was 83.8%, 49.7%, 37.5%, and 22.0% in men; 35.1%, 8.6%, 3.3%, and 1.3% in premenopausal women; and 71.6%, 29.4%, 20.7%, and 10.1% in postmenopausal women. In multivariable models, SDB severity was significantly associated with hypertension in women (p = 0.007) (mainly in postmenopausal women) but not in men (p = 0.065), with diabetes in men (p = 0.021) but not in women overall (p = 0.853) or in postmenopausal women (p = 0.725), with metabolic syndrome in men (p = 0.002) and women (p < 0.001), and with depression in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.853).Conclusion: SDB prevalence in this middle-aged to-older population was high, particularly in men and postmenopausal women. SDB was associated with hypertension and depression exclusively in women, whereas an association with diabetes was present only in men. These findings suggest that the SDB definition and management recommendations may need to be adapted to these groups' specificities.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive, endocrine, and metabolic disorder affecting millions of women worldwide. Women with PCOS are often identified in adolescence or early adulthood with symptoms of oligomenorrhea or hirsutism or when presenting for infertility care. The health risks associated out of PCOS, however, go far beyond management of these common presenting symptoms or fertility treatment and likely extend past the reproductive years through and beyond menopause. International surveys suggest that most patients are dissatisfied with long-term counseling related to medical and psychologic issues. We performed a review of comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, depression, anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular disease, in both reproductive-age and older women with PCOS. Most meta-analyses in reproductive-age women demonstrate increased risks independent from obesity. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies including women with PCOS >40 years of age are limited in number and design, but many demonstrate that some of these comorbidities persist. All providers involved in the multidimensional care of women with PCOS should be aware of these long-term health risks to provide appropriate counseling, screening, and management options. We identify limitations that should be the focus of future studies designed to study health outcomes in postmenopausal women with PCOS.

AB  - Bathing is a routine care procedure that exposes preterm infants to prolonged handling, which could cause stress and potentially disrupt infants' biobehavioral responses. The aim of this double-blind randomized crossover trial was to compare the preterm infant's body temperature, heart rate (HR), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (Spo2), salivary cortisol levels, and sleep-wake states during and after swaddled and conventional tub baths. Forty-three infants born at 32 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age, weighing 2225 g or less, were enrolled in the study. Infants were videotaped before and after each type of baths. The time interval between baths ranged from 24 to 72 hours to allow a washout period. Physiological, hormonal, and behavioral responses were collected at baseline and during recovery from baths. No significant differences in the mean body temperature, HR, Spo2, salivary cortisol levels, and sleep-wake states between the bath types were observed in the baseline or recovery responses during the first 20 minutes after bath. Regardless of bath type, salivary cortisol levels showed a nonstatistical significant increase.

AB  - There is a new appreciation of the perimenopause - defined as the early and late menopause transition stages as well as the early postmenopause - as a window of vulnerability for the development of both depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes. However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: 1) epidemiology; 2) clinical presentation; 3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; 4) effects of hormone therapy; and 5) efficacy of other therapies (eg, psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (ie, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (ie, antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Data on estrogen plus progestin are sparse and inconclusive.

AB  - Background/objective: Many studies have shown a U-shaped association of sleep duration with mortality; however, this association is difficult to interpret owing to possible reverse causation, residual confounding, and measurement issues. We used data from the Women's Health Initiative to examine the associations of sleep duration, insomnia, and use of sleep aids with death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, "other" causes, and all causes combined.Methods: Cox proportional hazards models were used in the analysis of baseline data and in time-dependent analyses of repeated measures to estimate associations of sleep-related factors with mortality. Among 158,203 women with information regarding sleep, 30,400 total deaths, 8857 CVD deaths, 9284 cancer deaths, and 11,928 other deaths were ascertained over a median of 17.8 years.Results: In both baseline and time-dependent analyses, both short (≤5 h) and long sleep (≥9 h) durations were associated with increased risk of total, CVD, and "other" deaths, but not with cancer deaths. Insomnia showed no association with mortality, whereas use of sleep medications was associated with an increased mortality risk.Conclusions: While our findings showed a small but robust association of sleep duration with mortality in postmenopausal women, studies including objective measurements of sleep quality and efficiency are needed to clarify these associations.

AB  - Objective To investigate the clinical efficacy of auricular point pressing with beans and nursing by syndrome differentiation in treatment of menopausal insomnia. Methods Totally 100 perimenopausal women with insomnia were assigned to the observation group and the control group, with 50 cases in each group. Patients in both two group received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nursing interventions, and those in the observation group were given auricular point pressing with beans and nursing interventions based on TCM syndrome differentiation. The sleep quality and clinical efficacy of interventions were evaluated. Results The score of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was decreased in both two groups after intervention, and was lower in the observation group than that in the control group (P <0. 05). The overall efficacy rate in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (94. 00% vs. 78. 00%, P <0. 05). Conclusion The auricular point pressing with beans and TCM nursing by syndrome differentiation are effective to improve the sleep quality of perimenopausal women with insomnia.

AB  - Numerous physiological processes of mammals, including bone metabolism, are regulated by the circadian clock system, which consists of a central regulator, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the peripheral oscillators of the BMAL1/CLOCK-PERs/CRYs system. Various bone turnover markers and bone metabolism-regulating hormones such as melatonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) display diurnal rhythmicity. According to previous research, disruption of the circadian clock due to shift work, sleep restriction, or clock gene knockout is associated with osteoporosis or other abnormal bone metabolism, showing the importance of the circadian clock system for maintaining homeostasis of bone metabolism. Moreover, common causes of osteoporosis, including postmenopausal status and aging, are associated with changes in the circadian clock. In our previous research, we found that agonism of the circadian regulators REV-ERBs inhibits osteoclast differentiation and ameliorates ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice, suggesting that clock genes may be promising intervention targets for abnormal bone metabolism. Moreover, osteoporosis interventions at different time points can provide varying degrees of bone protection, showing the importance of accounting for circadian rhythms for optimal curative effects in clinical treatment of osteoporosis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about circadian rhythms and bone metabolism.

AB  - Background: Women after menopause increase risk for cardiovascular disease and several factors may be related. The purpose was to study biological and psychosocial factors associated with early cardiovascular damage in pre- and postmenopausal women, assessed with carotid intima-media thickness vs flow-mediated dilatation.Methods: Women 45 to 57 years old were grouped in the pre- (n = 60), early (n = 58) and late post-menopause (n = 59). Anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal data were registered, as well as measures of depression, anxiety, submission, perceived stress, and sleep alterations. Heart Rate Variability was recorded to obtain the information regarding sympathovagal balance. Carotid intima-media thickness and flow-mediated dilatation were assessed by ultrasound. Two-way ANOVA and multiple regression model were used.Results: At late postmenopause, the carotid intima-media was thicker (p < 0.001) and flow-mediated dilatation decreased (p < 0.001). Carotid intima-media thickness was associated positively with age (p < 0.001), submission score (p = 0.029), follicle stimulating hormone levels (p < 0.001), and body mass index (p = 0.009). Flow-mediated dilatation was associated only with age (p < 0.001). Regarding heart rate variability, the time domain pNN50 measurement was higher in premenopausal women (p = 0.001), Low Frequency (LF) was higher in the two groups of postmenopausal (p = 0.001) and High Frequency (HF) higher in the early postmenopausal women (p = 0.042).Conclusions: Under our conditions carotid intima-media thickness had higher predictive value for early cardiovascular damage at menopause. The finding of the association of the submission score, indicates de influence of stress on vascular damage.

AB  - Background: Cervical spondylosis adversely affects life quality for its heavy disease burden. The report on the community-based prevalence and associated factors of cervical spondylosis is rare, especially in Chinese population. Whether prevention is needed and how to prevent it is not clear. This study aims to explore its prevalence and related lifestyle factors and provide evidence on prevention of cervical spondylosis.Methods: A community-based multistage cross-sectional survey of six communities from the Chinese population was conducted. A face-to-face interview was conducted to obtain individual information, and prevalence was calculated. Single-factor analysis and multivariable logistic regressions were used to explore the associated factors in total and subgroup populations.Results: A total of 3859 adults were analyzed. The prevalence of cervical spondylosis was 13.76%, although it differed significantly among the urban, suburban, and rural populations (13.07%, 15.97%, and 12.25%, respectively). Moreover, it was higher in females than in males (16.51% vs 10.49%). The prevalence among different age groups had an inverted U shape. The highest prevalence was in the age group from 45 to 60 years old. The associated factors differed by subgroups. There were positive associations between engaging in mental work, high housework intensity, and sleep duration of less than 7 h/day with cervical spondylosis. Going to work on foot was a negative factor of cervical spondylosis in the total population. For people aged less than 30 years, keeping the same work posture for 1-2.9 h/day was a special related factor. Exposure to vibration was an associated factor for females aged 45-60 years. Menopause was a special related factor for women.Conclusions: Prevalence of cervical spondylosis was high in Chinese population. People younger than 60 years were the focus of prevention for cervical spondylosis. Moreover, the characters between male and female and among different age groups were different and required targeted interventions.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cancer in women with more than 70% of BC patients being treated with hormonal therapy (HT). Among these patients, some report difficulties in remembering what they are supposed to do at the right moment, referring to prospective memory (PM). PM is essential for autonomy and medical adherence of patients, and requires an ecological assessment. Virtual reality, that recreates naturalistic environment, seems to be a promising method to evaluate PM. Several BC patients also report sleep disturbances. Given the role of sleep on memory consolidation, it is imperative to explore the influence of sleep quality on PM in BC patients treated with HT. The purpose of PROSOM-K study is to assess PM functioning using virtual reality and sleep quality in BC treated or not with HT.Methods: PROSOM-K is a prospective study including post-menopausal BC patients ≤70 years old treated with radiotherapy (n = 25) or with radiotherapy and HT (n = 25), and healthy post-menopausal women (n = 25) matched for age and education. PM will be assessed using a virtual reality based task. Other cognitive functions and psychosocial factors will be assessed with validated questionnaires and neuropsychological tests. The study is divided in 3 sessions: a session of familiarisation with the virtual environment and the PM task: a day-time session during which participants learn intentions during the morning and recall them in the evening; and a night-time session during which participants learn intentions in the evening and recall them the following morning. Women will be monitored by wrist actigraphy; during the night-time session, objective sleep quality and quantity will be measured by polysomnography.Discussion: This is a novel study aiming to assess PM using virtual reality, coupled with the evaluation of other cognitive functions. Polysomnographic study of sleep will provide further information about architectural sleep disturbances in BC. Association between sleep architecture parameters and PM mechanism in BC women treated with HT will be described in detail. We expect our results will provide knowledge for patients and clinicians and further help to improve patient care and cognitive therapy.Trial Registration: NCT03420105 , registered: January 10, 2018.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Menstrual irregularities in adolescents are a concern because they are considered a subjective indicator of poor physical and reproductive health. Menstrual regularity is associated with many genetic and mental health factors, and lifestyle changes can markedly influence an individual's level of menstrual regularity. Therefore, we investigated associations between lifestyle factors and menstrual irregularities in Korean adolescents by analysing data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2009 to 2013.Methods and Study Design: A total of 463 female adolescents aged 15-18 years participated in this study; they were divided into two groups based on their menstrual regularity. We assessed the between-group differences in relation to lifestyle-related factors, fast food consumption, and diet quality.Results: The frequencies of consumption of soda, coffee, and fried foods were significantly higher in the irregular menstruation group. However, the nutritional quality index was not significantly different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age at menarche (odds ratio [OR]=0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.54-0.88), higher family income (OR=0.37, 95% CI=0.15-0.91), lack of exercise (OR=10.42, 95% CI=2.73-39.8), and high stress levels (OR=4.18, 95% CI=1.02-17.12) were associated with menstrual irregularity, whereas sufficient sleep (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.39-0.60) and low frequency of eating out accounted for menstrual regularity.Conclusions: Lifestyle factors and stress levels influence menstrual regularity in Korean adolescents. Appropriate and accessible education on lifestyle management is required.

AB  - Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, represents a period of time during which newly arising symptoms can present complex management decisions for providers. Many women present to care with complaints of hot flashes, vaginal and sexual changes, altered mood and sleep, and changing bleeding patterns. The effect of these symptoms on quality of life, even before a woman enters menopause, can be significant. The appropriate evaluation and evidence-based management of women in this transition is reviewed in this article. Two case vignettes are used to highlight certain evaluation and treatment challenges.

AB  - Vasomotor symptoms are the most common manifestation of the menopause transition and postmenopausal phases of reproductive life. They interfere not only in quality of life, but also contribute to sleep and mood disturbances that potentially compromise home and work effectiveness. Treatment options include hormone therapy (HT), nonhormonal prescription drugs, mind body and behavior therapies, and over-the-counter preparations. Evidence confirms that HT is the most effective option. The initial reticence to prescribe HT immediately following publication of the Women’s Health Initiative has been replaced by clear guidelines for confidently identifying women for whom this therapy will be safe.

AB  - Aim: Fatigue is scarcely studied in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and the aims were to investigate its prevalence compared to the background population, potential associations, and to validate the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) in type 1 diabetes.Methods: Persons with T1D were recruited from three outpatient clinics in Norway. Fatigue was measured using the FQ, and FQ data from the Norwegian background population were used for comparison. Socio-demographic and clinical variables were obtained by self-report, clinical investigation, medical records and laboratory tests.Results: Of 332 eligible patients, 288 (87%) were included. Mean age was 44.65/44.95 years (SD 13.34/13.38) for females/males, respectively. Total fatigue (TF) was 15.31 (SD 5.51) compared to 12.2 (SD 4.0) in the background population (p < 0.001). HADS ≥ 8, current menstruation, increased leukocytes and sleep problems were associated with increased TF. Chronic fatigue (CF) was reported in 26.4% compared to 11% in the background population (p < 0.001). HADS ≥ 8, increased time since diagnosis and decreased sleep quality were associated with CF. The validity, internal consistency and repeatability of the FQ was confirmed.Conclusions: Fatigue was more common in T1D than in the background population, and associated with increased anxiety, depression and sleep problems. The FQ demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the effect of omega-3 supplements on relief of vasomotor symptoms among menopausal women.Study Design: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Web of Science, CINAHL, IranMedex and SID databases were searched until September 2017. Inclusion criteria were (1) women were experiencing vasomotor symptoms in the menopause period, (2) intervention was omega-3 supplements (3) randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-RCT, and (4) outcome measures included changes in the frequency and severity of hot flush or night sweats, sleep problems and side effects.Results: Three randomized controlled trials involving 483 women in the age range of 51 to 54.7 years were included in the review. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was moderate. All the participants were found to be blinded. Meta-analysis of the data showed no difference in the frequency and severity of hot flushes, insomnia severity, sleep quality, quality of life and adverse effects between the two groups. Compared to placebo group, women who received omega-3 supplements experienced lower frequency (mean difference: -1.82, 95% CI: -2.81, -0.83) and severity (mean difference: -.89, 95% CI: -1.25, -0.53) of night sweats.Conclusions: RCTs which investigate the impact of omega-3 supplements on vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women are scarce. A comprehensive search in a wide range of databases found only three relevant papers. Our analysis suggests that omega-3 supplements may alleviate night sweats but have no benefit in reducing hot flushes, or improving sleep quality and quality of life during the menopausal period. We recommend high quality RCTs along with a longer follow-up period to investigate this important subject, as there was insufficient evidence to conclude that omega-3 supplements are of benefit in alleviating vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of mindfulness and relaxation training for insomnia on insomnia and quality of life in postmenopausal women.Methods: Thirty postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years, who were not using hormone therapy, and had a diagnosis of insomnia and an apnea-hypopnea index of less than 15, were randomly assigned to two groups: a mindfulness intervention group and a control group. They were assessed before the intervention, and 8 weeks after its completion using questionnaires assessing sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), quality of life in menopause (Menopause-Specific Quality of Life), menopausal symptoms (Kupperman Menopausal Index), and level of attention (Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale). They were also assessed through ambulatory polysomnography. This is a pilot study and is limited by its small sample size.Results: The results of the questionnaires showed significant differences in the group that received mindfulness training compared with the control group, namely, improvements in sleep quality, a reduction in the severity of insomnia, a better quality of life, improved attention levels, and a reduction in menopausal and vasomotor symptoms. Polysomnography results showed no differences between the groups.Conclusions: Eight weeks mindfulness meditation training improved sleep quality, quality of life, attention levels, and reduced vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women with insomnia.

AB  - This trial compared the effects of lavender and bitter orange on sleep quality in postmenopausal women. This trial was conducted in 2015. Eligible postmenopausal women were allocated into one of two intervention groups or a control group (n = 52 per group) in a 1:1:1 ratio using a randomized block design. Intervention groups received 500 mg capsules containing only bitter orange or lavender flower powder, and the control group received 500 mg capsules containing starch. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory was used before and eight weeks after starting the intervention. Data analyses were based on intention to treat. A one-way ANOVA showed a slightly significant difference in mean sleep score among the three groups before the intervention (p = .045). The general linear model, adjusted for baseline sleep score and confounding factors, showed significant differences among the groups in the mean sleep score after eight weeks of treatment (p < .001). Bitter orange and lavender significantly improved the mean sleep score compared with the control group (p < .001 and p = .003, respectively). The positive effect of bitter orange and lavender on sleep quality in postmenopausal women suggests that they can be used to improve sleep quality in such women.

AB  - Background: The first-line agents comprising antihistamines for chronic urticaria, are not completely satisfactory. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF), a Chinese herb, has been developed into several Tripterygium agents and have definite effects on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In chronic urticaria, however, their values of practical application remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TwHF in patients with chronic urticaria. Methods: Several databases were systematically searched including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wan Fang Database, and Chinese Biomedicine. Randomized controlled trials comparing antihistamines with TwHF or Tripterygium agents in combination with antihistamines were included. Revman5.3 was utilized to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091595. Results: Twenty-one trials with 2565 participants were included in this analysis. Meta-analysis showed that, when antihistamines were combined with TwHF and Tripterygium agents, the curative effect in cases of chronic urticaria was superior to that of antihistamines alone (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.33–1.46). The incidence rates of gastrointestinal disorder (RR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.70–4.99) and menstrual disorder (RR: 6.00; 95% CI: 1.79–20.13) in drug combination groups were higher than those in controls, while other adverse events were similar between the two groups. After treatment, Dermatology Life Quality Index (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.09–1.40), quality of sleep (RR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.07–2.12), and daily activity (RR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.25–1.78) were all improved. Furthermore, drug combination groups demonstrated less relapse (RR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.25–0.45). Conclusions: TwHF and Tripterygium agents, in combination with antihistamines, appear to be more effective than antihistamines alone. Nevertheless, adverse events cannot be ignored. Large sample, multi-center, high-quality clinical studies are needed to verify the exact effects and safety of TwHF and Tripterygium agents in treatment of chronic urticaria.

AB  - Objective To analyze the effect of head and face massage combined with breathing guidance on insomnia in perimenopausal women. Methods A total of 60 perimenopausal women with insomnia were randomly divided into the observation group (n = 30) and the control group (n =30) according to a random number table. Patients of both two groups received oral administration of estazolam tablets and routine health education, and those in the observation group were given a combination treatment of head and face massage and breathing guidance. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scale (PSQI) was used to analyze the sleep quality of patients before and after the intervention. Results The score of PSQI was decreased in both two groups at two weeks after the intervention，and patients in the observation group achieved lower scores in assessment of hypnotic drugs use，sleep efficiency，sleep quality and total PSQI score compared with those in the control group (P <0.05). Conclusion The combination treatment of head and face massage and breathing guidance is effective to relieve the insomnia and improve sleep quality of perimenopausal women.

AB  - Background: Women with a gynecologic cancer tend to be older, obese, and postmenopausal, characteristics that are associated with an increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. However, there is limited investigation regarding the condition's prevalence in this population or its impact on postoperative outcomes. In other surgical populations, patients with obstructive sleep apnea have been observed to be at increased risk for adverse postoperative events.Objective: We sought to estimate the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among gynecologic oncology patients undergoing elective surgery and to investigate for a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative outcomes.Study Design: Patients referred to an academic gynecologic oncology practice were approached for enrollment in this prospective, observational study. Patients were considered eligible for study enrollment if they were scheduled for a nonemergent inpatient surgery and could provide informed consent. Enrolled patients were evaluated for a preexisting diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Those without a prior diagnosis were screened using the validated, 4-item STOP questionnaire (ie, Snore loudly, daytime Tiredness, Observed apnea, elevated blood Pressure). All patients who screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the prevalence of women with obstructive sleep apnea or those who screened at high risk for the condition. Secondary outcomes examined the correlation between body mass index (kg/m2) with obstructive sleep apnea and assessed for a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative outcomes.Results: Over a 22-month accrual period, 383 eligible patients were consecutively approached to participate in the study. A cohort of 260 patients were enrolled. A total of 33/260 patients (13%) were identified as having a previous diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. An additional 66/260 (25%) screened at risk for the condition using the STOP questionnaire. Of the patients who screened positive, 8/66 (12%) completed polysomnography, all of whom (8/8 [100%]) were found to have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea or screening at risk for the condition increased as body mass index increased (P < .001). Women with untreated obstructive sleep apnea and those who screened at risk for the condition were found to have an increased risk for postoperative hypoxemia (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.7; P = .011) and delayed return of bowel function (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.5; P = .009).Conclusion: The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea or screening at risk for the condition is high among women presenting for surgery with a gynecologic oncologist. Providers should consider evaluating a patient's risk for obstructive sleep apnea in the preoperative setting, especially when risk factors for the condition are present.

AB  - This review's purpose is to highlight evidence that oral micronized progesterone (progesterone) is effective for hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms, VMS), improves sleep and is likely safe in menopausal women (who are more than 1 year since last menstruation). Methods include randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) supplemented with basic science, population and observational data as needed. The barrier to use of progesterone is lack of awareness that safety concerns with estrogen-including 'menopausal hormone therapy' (MHT) are not applicable to progesterone. In a single 3-month RCT, progesterone (300 mg at bedtime) was effective treatment of VMS in 133 healthy menopausal women. It caused an overall 55% VMS decrease, no withdrawal-related VMS rebound and a greater VMS decrease in 46 women with ≥50 moderate-intense VMS/week. Progesterone is equally or more effective than estradiol in improving cardiovascular endothelial function and caused no cardiovascular safety concerns in a 3-month RCT. An 8-year prospective cohort study (E3N) in more than 80 000 menopausal women showed progesterone prevented breast cancer in estrogen-treated women. Multiple RCTs confirm that progesterone (300 mg daily at bedtime) does not cause depression and improves deep sleep. In conclusion, progesterone effectively treats VMS, improves sleep and may be the only therapy that symptomatic women, who are menopausal at a normal age and without osteoporosis, need.

AB  - Aim: This study used a randomized controlled trial model to determine the effect of progressive relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene training given to postmenopausal women with insomnia. Methods: A total of 161 postmenopausal women with insomnia were recruited and randomly assigned to experimental (n = 81) and control (n = 80) groups. The experimental group received sleep hygiene and progressive relaxation exercise training, but the control group only received routine health care. The relaxation exercise training was repeated once a week for 8 weeks. The study determined the effect of the intervention on insomnia symptoms. The data were collected between 15 June and 15 September 2015 and evaluated using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, chi-squared test, and Cronbach alpha analysis. Results: The mean (SD) score of the experimental group on the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale was 14.03 (3.4) pretest and 7.09 (3.4) posttest. The difference between the pretest and posttest scores was statistically significant (P < .001), as was the difference between the rates of insomnia symptoms between the groups posttest (P < .001). Conclusion: The findings of study suggest that nurses teaching progressive relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene would benefit postmenopausal women who suffer from insomnia.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome in young women, the status of physical activity and quality of life. Methods: The trial planned as a descriptive, crosssectional study was carried out at Higher Education Credit and Hostels Institution of Uşak University. The sample of the study consisted of 617 single, menstruating students who were volunteered to participate in the study. Data were collected by self-reporting method using information form prepared by the investigators in line with the literature information, Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), SF-36 Quality of Life Scale and International Physical Activity Questionnaire Numbers, percentages, mean, standard deviation, chi-square test, Student's t test were used in the evaluation of data. Results: The mean age of the students was found to be 21.03±1.54 (18-24) and the mean age at menarche was 13.25±1.32 (10-18). PMS prevalence was 65.2% and the mean score of the scale was determined as 122.14±32.60 (44-214) in the study. During premenstrual period, the students experienced in order of decreasing frequency had fatigue (98.2%), depressive affect (95.5%), altered appetite (93.4%), nervousness (93.2%), edema (92.2%), anxiety (91.7%), depressive thoughts (90.6%), pain (89.1%) and sleep changes (88.2%). In the study, it was determined that those who had PMS had significantly lower scores on all subscales of the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale and 64.7% of those participated in the study were inactive. Conclusion: It is seen that PMS is an important health problem that is common among university students and that the quality of life of those with PMS is low and the activity levels are not different from those without PMS.
AB  - Amaç: Çalışma, genç kadınlarda premenstrual sendrom görülme sıklığını, fiziksel aktivite ve yaşam kalitesi durumlarını belirlemek amacıyla yapılmıştır. Yöntem: Tanımlayıcı-kesitsel olarak planlanan çalışma 20.03.2016-20.06.2016 tarihleri arasında Uşak Üniversitesi Kredi Yurtlar Kurumunda ikamet eden, adet gören, bekar ve çalışmaya gönüllü katılmayı kabul eden 617 öğrenci ile yürütülmüştür. Veri toplanmasında araştırmacılar tarafından literatür doğrultusunda hazırlanmış bilgi formu, Premenstrual Sendrom Ölçeği (PMSÖ), SF-36 Yaşam Kalitesi Ölçeği ve Uluslararası Fiziksel Aktivite Anketi kullanılarak, veriler öz bildirim yöntemiyle elde edilmiştir. Verilerin değerlendirilmesinde sayı, yüzde, ortalama, standart sapma, ki-kare, student's t- test analiz teknikleri kullanılmıştır. Bulgular: Öğrencilerin yaş ortalamalarının 21,03±1,54 (18-24) ve ortalama menarş yaşının 13,25±1,32 (10-18) olduğu saptanmıştır. Çalışmada, PMS prevalansı %65,2 ve ölçekten alınan puan ortalaması ise 122,14±32,60 (44-214) olarak belirlenmiştir. Premenstrual dönemde öğrencilerin en çoktan aza doğru %98,2'sinin yorgunluk, %95,5'inin depresif duygulanım, %93,4'ünün iştah değişimleri, %93,2'sinin sinirlilik, %92,2'sinin şişkinlik, %91,7'sinin anksiyete, %90,6'sının depresif düşünceler, %89,1'inin ağrı ve %88,2'sinin uyku değişiklikleri yaşadıkları belirlenmiştir. Çalışmada öğrencilerden PMS olanların SF-36 Yaşam Kalitesi Ölçeğinin tüm alt boyutlarından anlamlı olarak düşük puanlar aldıkları ve bu grupta yer alanların %64,7'sinin inaktif olduğu saptanmıştır. Sonuç: PMS üniversite öğrencileri arasında yaygın olarak görülen önemli bir sağlık sorunu olup, PMS olanların yaşam kalitesinin düşük olduğu, aktivite düzeylerinin ise PMS olmayanlardan farklı olmadığı görülmektedir.

AB  - Objective: Only a few extended follow-up studies have investigated the natural progress of climacteric-related symptoms. The results have been conflicting. Thus, our aim was to evaluate, through a 19-year longitudinal study, whether these symptoms decrease or disappear as time elapses after menopause.Methods: Our study was a prospective follow-up survey of 65 hysterectomized peri or postmenopausal women. The women were interviewed at the baseline, and at 6 and 19 years thereafter. Changes in various climacteric-related symptoms were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance with time as the independent variable. The analyses were adjusted for baseline age, body mass index, employment, and use of hormone therapy. Climacteric-related symptoms were evaluated with the Women's Health Questionnaire, of which we included seven symptom domains (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety/fears, cognitive, sexual, and somatic).Results: Vasomotor symptoms decreased remarkably during the follow-up period. In addition, a statistically significant decrease was found in sleep problems and cognitive difficulties. However, the decrease was minor, and thus probably clinically insignificant.Conclusions: The only symptom with notable decrease was vasomotor symptoms. The etiology of other symptoms, commonly connected to menopause transition, is probably multifactorial and not substantially dependent on the climacteric.

AB  - Purpose: After cancer treatment, it is desirable to maintain or regain a high quality of life (QoL) and the ability to accomplish everyday tasks well. Therefore, we substantiated the scarce knowledge regarding long-term QoL after breast cancer, burdensome problems, and unmet needs for more support.Methods: Disease-free breast cancer survivors (n = 190) who had participated in two randomized controlled exercise trials during primary treatment were followed up to 5 years post-diagnosis. QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQ scores were compared with age-matched normative values from the general population in Germany.Results: QoL-related functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatment were worse compared to healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet, cognitive function and sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-year follow-up. Other common long-term problems included sexual issues (45% of survivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy (21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue having the strongest impact on global QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for menopausal disorders (43%), physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), arthralgia (37%), cognitive problems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue (31%).Conclusions: While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years post-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, still many survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need for ongoing screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive problems, arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.

AB  - Objective/background: To determine the prevalence of positional obstructive sleep apnea (POSA) and exclusive POSA (ePOSA) in the general population and to assess the factors independently associated with POSA and ePOSA according to gender and menopausal status.Patients/methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort underwent full polysomnography at home. POSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5/h, and supine/non-supine AHI ratio (sAHI/nsAHI) ≥2 (ePOSA when non-supine AHI was normalized).Results: In this study, 1719 subjects (40-85y.o. 46% men) with at least 30 min spent in both the supine and non-supine positions were included. OSA was present in 1224 subjects (71%) (AHI >5/H). POSA was present in 53% of all subjects, and in 75% of OSA subjects. ePOSA was present in 26% of all subjects and in 36% of OSA subjects. In multivariate analyses, lower AHI and lower BMI were both associated with POSA and ePOSA in males. In premenopausal females, no single factor was associated with POSA while a lower AHI and an Epworth sleepiness scale >10 were associated with ePOSA. In postmenopausal women, a lower BMI was associated with POSA and a lower AHI and a lower Mallampati score with ePOSA.Conclusions: In this large population-based study, we found that POSA is present in 53% of the middle-to-older age general population, and in 75% of OSA subjects. ePOSA was present in 36% of OSA subjects, suggesting that a large proportion of them could be treated with positional therapy. AHI and BMI were differently associated with POSA in men, and pre or post-menopausal women.

AB  - Despite established sex differences and longstanding hypotheses of sex hormone influence in the etiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), we have found no studies that evaluated type of menopause and age at menopause, which affect postmenopausal hormonal milieu, in relation to OSA risk in women. We followed 50,473 postmenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study during 2002-2012 and 53,827 postmenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study II during 1995-2013, with 1,712 and 2,560 incident OSA diagnoses, respectively. Compared with natural menopause, the pooled hazard ratio for OSA was 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 1.38) for surgical menopause by hysterectomy/oophorectomy. The association remained the same after further accounting for age at menopause (hazard ratio = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.38). The risk associated with surgical menopause was higher among women who were not obese as well as among women who never used hormone therapy (P for interaction < 0.05). Earlier menopause was associated with higher OSA risk prior to adjustment for type of menopause (comparing those aged <40 years versus those aged 50-54 years, hazard ratio = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.35; P for trend = 0.008), although no association was observed after the adjustment. Surgical as compared with natural menopause was independently associated with higher OSA risk in postmenopausal women. Our results provide additional evidence for a role for sex hormones, particularly abrupt hormonal changes, in modulating OSA risk.

AB  - There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders, as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

AB  - Introduction: Primary dysmenorrhea is a prevalent condition causing quality of life (QOL) reduction for many women, resulting from pain as well as parallel social and psychological distress. Yoga reduces pain and sympathetic reactivity, thus promoting QOL. This article reports a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of yoga as a QOL improvement method for women with primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were used in preparation of this review. Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were screened through January 2017 using the keywords yoga, meditation, menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and prostaglandins. English‐language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐experimental studies regarding yoga, primary dysmenorrhea, and QOL were eligible; all yoga styles were included. Two independent reviewers rated the methodological quality of each study selected for review using the Downs and Black checklist; possible scores ranged from 0 to 32. Ratings were established through consensus. Results: The search yielded a total of 378 articles, of which 14 (age range 13‐45 years, N = 1409) met the criteria for final review: 8 RCTs and 6 quasi‐experimental studies. Downs and Black ratings were predominantly moderate in quality with moderate risk of bias, ranging from 15 to 23 (RCTs) and 10 to 17 (quasi‐experimental studies). Statistically significant improvements along most QOL domains, including physical pain, sleep, concentration, negative feelings, social relationships, work capacity, and overall QOL, were identified after a yoga intervention. Results indicate preliminary evidence for yoga as a safe and effective QOL improvement method for women with primary dysmenorrhea. Discussion: Practitioners may consider yoga for management of primary dysmenorrhea. However, future research using larger RCTs of high methodological quality is needed to ascertain the magnitude of yoga's clinical significance.

AB  - Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) may develop due to severe anaemia and hypotension which is seen in acute blood loss. The devastating visual loss is often irreversible. We report a case of NAION in a 20-year-old healthy woman, who presented on the third day of a heavy menstrual cycle with hypovolaemic shock. On day 2 of admission, she had sudden right eye blurring of vision at the superior field on awakening from sleep. Funduscopy revealed a pale and swollen right optic disc. There was a dense right superior altitudinal visual field defect. Her haemoglobin level was low (3.6 g/dL), but she refused blood transfusion due to her religious belief (Jehovah's Witness) and opted for conservative management. She later developed right optic atrophy with persistent visual field defect despite an improved haemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL.

AB  - Background Endocrine treatment (ET) with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is the treatment of choice in post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer (EBC). However, adverse events (AEs) often lead to treatment discontinuation. This analysis aimed to identify side-effects that lead to patients failing to persist with letrozole treatment. Patients and methods Post-menopausal hormone receptor–positive EBC patients starting ET with letrozole were enroled in EvAluate-TM, a non-interventional study. Information regarding treatment compliance and persistence was gathered in months 6 and 12. Persistence was defined as the time from 30 d after the start to the end of treatment. The influence on persistence of musculoskeletal syndrome, menopausal disorder, sleep disorder and other AEs within the first 30 d was analysed using Cox regression analyses. Results Among 3887 patients analysed, the persistence rate after 12 months was >85%. In all, 568 patients (14.6%) discontinued the treatment, 358 of whom (63.0%) did so only because of side-effects. The main AEs influencing persistence were musculoskeletal symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90–3.42), sleep disorders (HR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.41–2.70) and other AEs (HR 2.03; 95% CI, 1.51–2.73). Menopausal disorder was not associated with non-persistence (HR 1.17; 95% CI, 0.74–1.84). Conclusions These results suggest that side-effects of AIs such as musculoskeletal syndrome and sleep disorder lead to ET discontinuation within the first treatment year in significant numbers of EBC patients. Compliance programmes adapted for subgroups that are at risk for early non-persistence might help to ensure the recommended therapy duration. Clinical Trials Number CFEM345DDE19.

AB  - Sleep, body composition and dietary intake are crucial for athletes' health and performance but have never been investigated in acrobatic gymnasts. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate sleep, body composition, dietary intake and eating behaviours of acrobatic gymnasts. Using a cross-sectional study, 82 Portuguese acrobatic gymnasts (12.8 ± 3.1 years, 61 females and 21 males) were evaluated during the competitive period to collect training data, sleep duration, body composition, dietary intake and eating behaviours before, during and after practices. Most of the gymnasts (91.5%) slept less than 8 h/night. Female adolescents slept significantly less on weekdays than female children (P = 0.024). Female adolescents' mean body mass was below the normal and 60.0% showed menstrual irregularities; 4.9% of females bases were overweight and 2.4% obese. Male adolescents slept significantly less on weekdays than male children (P = 0.001); significant differences were shown for fat-free mass (P = 0.014); however, 3.7% were overweight. All daily energy and macronutrient intakes were significantly different according to age and gender, with exception for fibre and energy intake in females (P = 0.057 and P = 0.052, respectively), and for protein in males (P = 0.068). Female and male adolescents demonstrated significant lower energy availability (32.8 ± 9.4 kcal/kg FFM/day and 45.1 ± 14.7 kcal/kg FFM/day) than children (45.8 ± 8.7 kcal/kg FFM/day and 53.8 ± 9.1 kcal/kg FFM/day), respectively. Significant low intakes of important vitamins and minerals were reported. Most of the participants did not eat or drink during or immediately after training sessions.Conclusion: Acrobatic gymnasts revealed low BF, short sleep duration and macro- and micronutrients inadequate intakes. The Female Athlete Triad was demonstrated by female adolescent gymnasts. What is Known: • Adequate dietary intake is an important resource for athletes' short and long-term health and performance. • There are no published studies in acrobatic gymnasts' sleep, body composition or dietary intake. What is New: • This study provides the first data on significant differences in energy intake and availability between acrobatic gymnasts; overweight and obesity were present in females. • Macro and micronutrients were inappropriate. Female Athlete Triad was observed in female adolescent acrobatic gymnasts.

AB  - Background: Perimenopausal insomnia (PI) is one of the most common complaints in women. Acupuncture is used to treat PI increasingly considering its less side effect. The subject of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for PI.Methods: All the randomized controlled trials(RCT) literatures of acupuncture for PI will be searched in the databases of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Springer, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan fang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and other available resources using the subject terms of 'acupuncture" and "perimenopausal insomnia" and their synonyms. The languages are limited as English and Chinese. Non-RCT literatures will be screened and relative information will be extracted. Sleep quality values is considered as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include biochemical indicators, such as hormone levels, side effects caused by acupuncture, total scores on the insomnia severity index and traditional Chinese medicine symptom changes.Results: This systematic review study will provide an evidence of acupuncture for PI.Conclusion: The study will give an explicit evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of acupuncture for PI.Prospero Registration Number: CRD42018092917.

AB  - Hot flashes have typically been classified as "symptoms of menopause" that should be tolerated or treated until they resolve. However, mounting evidence points to hot flashes as a manifestation of one or several underlying pathophysiological processes. Associations exist between the presence, timing of onset, severity, and duration of hot flashes, and the risk of several neurological (affecting sleep, mood, and cognition) and cardiovascular conditions. In addition, four consistent patterns of vasomotor disturbances have been identified across different countries, making it unlikely that these patterns are solely explained by socioeconomic or cultural factors. The changing hormonal environment of menopause may unmask differences in the autonomic neurovascular control mechanisms that put an individual woman at risk for chronic conditions of aging. These differences may have a genetic basis or may be acquired across the life span and are consistent with the variability of the clinical manifestations of aging observed in women after bilateral oophorectomy. It is time to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the four patterns of vasomotor symptoms more closely, and to shift from describing hot flashes as symptoms to be tolerated to manifestations of an underlying autonomic neurovascular dysregulation that need to be addressed.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy of an unguided, self-help cognitive behavior therapy (SH-CBT) booklet on hot flush and night sweat (HFNS) problem rating, delivered in a work setting.Methods: Women aged 45 to 60 years, having 10 or more problematic HFNS a week, were recruited to a multicenter randomized controlled trial, via the occupational health/human resources departments of eight organizations. Participants were 1:1 randomized to SH-CBT or no treatment waitlist control (NTWC). The primary outcome was HFNS problem rating; secondary outcomes included HFNS frequency, work and social adjustment, sleep, mood, beliefs and behaviors, and work-related variables (absence, performance, turnover intention, and work impairment due to presenteeism). Intention-to-treat analysis was used, and between-group differences estimated using linear mixed models.Results: A total of 124 women were randomly allocated to SH-CBT (n = 60) and NTWC (n = 64). 104 (84%) were assessed for primary outcome at 6 weeks and 102 (82%) at 20 weeks. SH-CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 6 weeks (SH-CBT vs NTWC adjusted mean difference, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.11 to -0.86; P < 0.001) and at 20 weeks (-1.09; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.31; P < 0.01). SH-CBT also significantly reduced HFNS frequency, improved work and social adjustment; sleep, menopause beliefs, HFNS beliefs/behaviors at 6 and 20 weeks; improved wellbeing and somatic symptoms and reduced work impairment due to menopause-related presenteeism at 20 weeks, compared with the NTWC. There was no difference between groups in other work-related outcomes.Conclusions: A brief, unguided SH-CBT booklet is a potentially effective management option for working women experiencing problematic HFNS.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep is one of the most common problems reported during menopause, and is known to vary throughout the menopause transition. The objective of this study was to describe the dynamics of poor sleep among participants of the Midlife Women's Health Study and to identify risk factors associated with poor sleep during the menopausal transition.Methods: Annual responses to surveys that included questions about the frequency of sleep disturbances and insomnia were analyzed to determine the likelihood of persistent poor sleep throughout the menopausal transition and the correlation of responses to the different sleep-related questions, including frequency of restless sleep during the first year of the study. Responses to questions about a large number of potential risk factors were used to identify risk factors for poor sleep.Results: Poor sleep in premenopause was not predictive of poor sleep in perimenopause, and poor sleep in perimenopause was not predictive of poor sleep in postmenopause. Frequencies of each of the measures of poor sleep were highly correlated. For all sleep outcomes, high frequency of depression was related to a high frequency of poor sleep. Vasomotor symptoms were also significantly related with a higher frequency of all poor sleep outcomes. A history of smoking was also associated with higher frequencies of insomnia and sleep disturbances.Conclusions: The risk factors identified for poor sleep, depression and vasomotor symptoms, were consistently associated with poor sleep throughout the menopausal transition. The likelihood of these risk factors changed from premenopause, through perimenopause, and into postmenopause, however, which could explain changes in sleep difficulties across the menopausal transition. Treatment of these risk factors should be considered when addressing sleep difficulties in menopausal women.

AB  - Introduction: Adherence to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is poor, often because of treatment-emergent side effects, including musculoskeletal symptoms, fatigue, and insomnia. In the present analysis, we examined the sleep patterns and daytime function both objectively using actigraphy and subjectively using validated questionnaires in women initiating AI therapy.Patients and Methods: Postmenopausal women with stage 0-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were initiating AI therapy were eligible. The patients wore actigraphy devices for 10 consecutive days and completed questionnaires at baseline before the initiation of AI and after 3 months of AI therapy. Associations between the baseline demographics and symptoms, changes in patient-reported outcomes and actigraphy measures from baseline to 3 months of AI therapy and discontinuation of AI therapy were examined using sign tests, logistic regression models, Spearman's correlation, and linear mixed models.Results: Forty-two patients (86%) completed the baseline assessments and 23 patients (47%) completed both the baseline and the 3-month assessments. Objectively measured daytime function as measured by total daytime activity decreased during the 3 months after starting AI (232,566 activity count vs. 204,205 activity count; P = .023), and the decrease was more evident in women with higher baseline physical function. Reduced daytime activity correlated with increased fatigue (ρ = -0.49; P = .017).Conclusion: Daytime function decreased after initiation of AI therapy and correlated moderately with increased fatigue, although no association was identified with changes in pain or sleep quality. Additional studies are required to understand why function is reduced, which could have implications for interventions to improve patient tolerance of, and persistence with, AI therapy.

AB  - Background & aim: Menopause is considered as a stage of life that is often encountered by all women with symptoms as hot flashes, sweating, palpitations, sleep disorders, and urinary tract problems. The improvement of healthpromoting lifestyle behaviors is one of the effective measures to moderate these symptoms by facilitating the women to enhance their lifestyle behaviors through making proper choices. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of training based on choice theory on health-promoting lifestyle behaviors in menopausal women. Methods: This two-group pretest-posttest design was conducted on 40 menopausal women within the age range of 45-55 years, referring to healthcare centers in Mashhad, Iran, in 2016. The subjects were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups using simple random sampling method. The data collection instruments included a demographic questionnaire, a menopause knowledge/attitude questionnaire, as well as Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLPII), which consisted of six dimensions of nutrition, physical activity, responsibility for health, stress management, interpersonal relationships, and spiritual growth. The intervention group received training in seven 90-minute sessions based on choice theory. The data were analyzed in SPSS software using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, independent t-test, paired sample t-test, and Friedman test. Results: According to the results, after the intervention, the mean scores of total health-promoting lifestyle behaviors (P<0.03) and responsibility for health (P=0.005) showed a significant increase in the intervention group, compared to those in the control group. Conclusion: As the findings of this study indicated, the midwives could play an effective role in the moderation of menopausal side effects using choice theory. In this regard, the needs of the menopausal women in terms of boosting their awareness and practicing health-promoting lifestyle behaviors should be identified to deal with menopausal problems.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the association between self-reported vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk.Methods: The STOP-BANG to evaluate OSA and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were administered to 2,935 women seen in the Women's Health Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, between May 2015 and December 2016. Of these, 1,691 women were included in the analysis. Total MRS and VMS ratings were compared using logistic regression, with age, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) included as covariates between women at intermediate/high risk versus low risk for OSA.Results: Total MRS scores were significantly higher in women with intermediate/high-risk OSA scores versus those with low-risk scores [mean (SD): 16.8 (8.0) vs 12.9 (7.0), P < 0.001]. Women at intermediate/high OSA risk were older, had more education, self-reported hypertension, BMI >35 kg/m, and were less likely to be married or employed. Self-reported severe/very severe VMS were significantly associated with intermediate/high risk versus low risk for OSA (26.6% vs 15.0%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, and self-reported hypertension, the odds of having intermediate/high risk for OSA were 1.87 times higher for those with severe/very severe VMS compared with those with none/mild/moderate VMS (95% CI, 1.29-2.71, P < 0.001). This association persisted upon subgroup analysis based on BMI <25 kg/m (odds ratio 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.16, P = 0.022).Conclusions: Self-reported severe/very severe VMS were associated with intermediate/high risk for OSA in midlife women, even in women with BMI <25 kg/m. Given the limitations of the STOP-BANG tool, OSA risk may, however, have been overestimated.

AB  - Background: Endometriosis symptoms often start at a young age, and the time between symptom onset and endometriosis diagnosis can be several years. It is not clear whether the symptoms that are experienced by adolescents differ from adults. Better understanding may shorten the often lengthy delay in diagnosis.Objective: The purpose of the study was to further elucidate the symptom presentation of adolescents as compared with adults to determine whether differences existed, based on age at surgical diagnosis that could impact time to diagnosis.Study Design: This investigation was a cross-sectional study at enrollment within a longitudinal cohort of adolescents and women with endometriosis. The population-based cohort was recruited from 2 tertiary care centers and the surrounding communities. Participants included adolescents (diagnosed at ≤18 years old; n=295) and adults (diagnosed at >18 years old; n=107) with surgically confirmed endometriosis who were enrolled into The Women's Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood. Participants completed an expanded version of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonization Project standard clinical questionnaire that included items regarding menstrual history, associated symptoms, and pain. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were applied to categoric data; Wilcoxon rank sum tests were applied to continuous data.Results: Most participants (90%) experienced moderate-severe menstrual pain. On average, 3 doctors were seen before diagnosis, regardless of age at presentation (range, 0-25 years). Time from symptoms to diagnosis averaged 2 years for adolescents and 5 years for adults (P<.001). More adolescents (50%) than adults (33%) reported pain starting at menarche (P=.002) and nausea accompanying pain (69% vs 53%; P=.01). Noncyclic, general pelvic pain was prevalent. One-half of the participants reported relief of their general pelvic pain after a bowel movement. Pain interfered with work/school, daily activities, exercise, and sleep to a moderate-extreme degree; difficulties were similar by age at diagnosis.Conclusions: Pelvic pain was severe and noncyclic and negatively impacted quality of life. At our tertiary care centers, symptoms of endometriosis did not differ between women surgically diagnosed during adolescence compared with those diagnosed as adults. Adolescents had more nausea and symptom onset at menarche. Multi-year delays in diagnosis were common. Clinicians should be aware of these alternate symptom patterns and include endometriosis in their differential diagnosis for both adolescent and young adult women who experience noncyclic pelvic pain and nausea.

AB  - During the menopausal transition and early postmenopause, participants in the Seattle Midlife Women’s Health Study (SMWHS) experienced one of the three symptom severity clusters identified through latent class analysis: severe hot flashes with moderate sleep, mood, cognitive, and pain symptoms (high-severity hot flash); low-severity hot flashes with moderate levels of all other symptom groups (moderate severity); and low levels of all symptom groups (low severity). In an effort to determine whether gene polymorphisms were associated with these symptom severity classes, we tested associations between gene polymorphisms in the estrogen synthesis pathways (cytochrome P450 19 [CYP 19] and 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [17HSDB1]) and the three symptom severity clusters. SMWHS participants (N = 137) recorded symptoms monthly in diaries and provided buccal smears for genotyping. Multilevel latent class analysis with multinomial regression was used to determine associations between gene polymorphisms and symptom severity clusters. Only the 17HSDB1 polymorphisms (rs615942 and rs592389) were associated significantly with the high-severity hot flash cluster versus the low-severity symptom cluster. None of the polymorphisms was associated with the moderate-severity cluster versus the low-severity symptom cluster. Findings of associations of the 17HSDB1 polymorphisms with the high-severity hot flash symptom cluster are consistent with those of an association between 17HSDB1 polymorphisms and hot flashes in the Study of Women and Health Across the Nation population and our previous findings of associations between these polymorphisms with greater estrone levels.

AB  - Background: Menopause-associated estrogen deficiency results in climacteric symptoms like vasomotor, psychological and sleep disturbances that cause a decline in the quality of life. Electrodermal activity (EDA), a psychophysiological measure, reflects sympathetic activity, which provides information associated with individual’s emotions, phobias, arousal, cognition and stress. The study compared electrodermal response to auditory stimuli between postmenopausal and perimenopausal women with and without symptoms and also correlated the association of scores of the menopausal transition symptoms with indices of EDA. Methods: Seventy-five women volunteers in the age group of 45–60 years, 25 in each group who were postmenopausal, perimenopausal with symptoms and perimenopausal without symptoms, were recruited. Indices of EDA such as latency, amplitude, rise time and half recovery time for auditory stimuli were quantified using standard techniques. Symptoms of menopausal transition were assessed using Women Health Questionnaire. Results: Analysis using one-way analysis of covariance after controlling for variables showed that mean skin conductance level of EDA was significantly higher among perimenopausal women with symptoms compared with perimenopausal women without symptoms and postmenopausal women. Perimenopausal women with symptoms had significantly lower latency of response when compared with other groups. Analysis using Pearson correlation test showed that latency of EDA had significant positive correlation and amplitude had significant negative correlation with menopausal transition symptom scores. Conclusions: Perimenopausal women with symptoms exhibited increased sympathetic sudomotor activity when compared with perimenopausal women without symptoms and postmenopausal women as measured by EDA. Further, select measures of EDA exhibited significant association with the symptoms of menopausal transition.

AB  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at <28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9,18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants.

AB  - Objective: We aim to establish a simple risk score based on sleep quality for predicting depressive symptoms in menopausal women through a cross-sectional investigation.Materials and Methods: A total of 705 Chinese women aged 40-60 years were included in this cross-sectional investigation of a self-report questionnaire from the Physical Examination Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital. Depressive symptoms and sleep quality were evaluated using self-rating depressive symptom scale (SDS)and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. After setting up a logistic regression model and computing the odds ratio value, we further calculated and predicted the risk score for depressive symptoms and then established a risk score system. Finally, we validated the risk score in two investigations (Validation 1 and Validation 2).Results: The risk scoring system for predicting depressive symptoms included a history of cancer, subjective sleep quality, sleep disorder and daytime dysfunction, with total scores ranging from 0-35 points. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) sample curve was 0.801 (95% CI 0.753-0.848). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.832 (95% CI 0.738-0.925) in Validation 1 and 0.799 (95%CI 0.667-0.930) in Validation 2. The best cutoff point for depressive symptoms in the sample population was ≥8 points, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.698 and 0.824, respectively. The sensitivity was 0.775 and 0.667 in Validation 1 and Validation 2, respectively.Conclusions: The risk score for predicting depressive symptoms in menopausal women based on sleep is convenient. Because there is no complex assessment of multiple scales requiredIt may be a preliminary screening tool for depressive symptoms in menopausal women.

AB  - Objective/background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), an independent risk factor for stroke, is associated with worse post-stroke outcomes. Differences in the relationship between SDB and stroke may exist for women versus men. In this population-based study, we compared the prevalence of both pre- and post-stroke SDB by sex. We also explored whether menopausal status is related to post-stroke SDB.Patients/methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of subjects enrolled in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Each subject (n = 1815) underwent a baseline interview including the Berlin Questionnaire to assess pre-stroke SDB risk and, if relevant, questions regarding menopausal status. Subjects were offered overnight SDB screening with a validated portable respiratory device (n = 832 with complete data). Log Poisson and linear regression models were used to assess the differences in SDB between men and women with adjustment for demographics, stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and other potential confounders.Results: Women were less likely than men to be at high risk for pre-stroke SDB (56.6% versus 61.9%) (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.87 for women; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.95). A lower proportion of women than men (50.8% versus 70.2%) had post-stroke SDB by respiratory monitoring (PR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63-0.80). SDB severity was higher for men than for women (mean difference in respiratory event index [REI] 6.5; 95% CI, 4.3-8.7). No significant association existed between post-stroke SDB and either menopausal status or age at menopause.Conclusions: After acute ischemic stroke, SDB was more prevalent and more severe in men than in women.

AB  - This study assessed factors associated with quality of life (QOL) among Serbian peri- and postmenopausal women using two menopause-specific scales. This cross-sectional study included 500 women aged 40–65 years who had a gynecologic check-up in one of two Community Health Centers in Belgrade during February 2014 to January 2015. Women completed: a questionnaire about socio-demographics, habits, and health status; a menopause-specific questionnaire, Utian’s Quality of Life Scale (UQOL); and a Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI). Higher education was associated with better occupational UQOL and memory/concentration, but with lower emotional UQOL and more anxiety/fears. City center residency was associated with better occupational and sexual UQOL. Being employed was associated with better occupational UQOL and lower anxiety/fears. Higher income was associated with better emotional UQOL. Not having uterine prolapse, insomnia, or tachycardia was associated with better occupational UQOL and fewer sleep problems. Higher parity was associated with better sexual UQOL. Having regular recreation was associated with better health and sexual UQOL but with more frequent vasomotor symptoms. Leaner women felt more attractive. QOL during the menopausal transition does not entail only somatic symptoms and therefore requires a more comprehensive approach that includes psychosocial underpinnings.

AB  - Hormone therapy (HT) was widely prescribed in the 1980s and 1990s and has been controversial since the initial results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial in the early 2000s suggested that it increased risk for breast cancer and coronary heart disease and did not prolong life. However, more recent data and reexamination of the WHI results suggest that HT is safe and effective for many women when used around the time of menopause. Two experts debate the 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society, which recommends HT as first-line treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and apply it to the care of Ms. R, a 52-year-old woman with severe hot flashes, sleep disturbance, and irritability.

AB  - Purpose Given the inter-relatedness among symptoms, research efforts are focused on an evaluation of symptom clusters. The purposes of this study were to evaluate for differences in the number and types of menopausal-related symptom clusters assessed prior to and at 12-months after surgery using ratings of occurrence and severity and to evaluate for changes in these symptom clusters over time. Methods Prior to and at 12 months after surgery, 392 women with breast cancer completed the Menopausal Symptoms Scale. Exploratory factor analyses were used to identify the symptom clusters. Results Of the 392 women evaluated, the mean number of symptoms (out of 46) was 13.2 (±8.5) at enrollment and 10.9 (±8.2) at 12 months after surgery. Using occurrence and severity, three symptom clusters were identified prior to surgery. Five symptom clusters were identified at 12 months following surgery. Two symptom clusters (i.e., pain/discomfort and hormonal) were relatively stable across both dimensions and time points. Two symptom clusters were relatively stable across both dimensions either prior to surgery (i.e., sleep/psychological/cognitive) or at 12 months after surgery (i.e., sleep). The other four clusters (i.e., irritability, psychological/cognitive, cognitive, psychological) were identified at one time point using a single dimension. Conclusions While some menopausal-related symptom clusters were consistent across time and dimensions, the majority of symptoms clustered together differently depending on whether they were evaluated prior to or at 12 months after breast cancer surgery. An increased understanding of how symptom clusters change over time may assist clinicians to focus their symptom assessments and management strategies.

AB  - There is limited and inconclusive evidence surrounding the physiological and perceptual responses to heat stress while sleep deprived, especially for females. This study aimed to quantify the effect of 24 h sleep deprivation on physiological strain and perceptual markers of heat-related illness in females. Nine females completed two 30-min heat stress tests (HST) separated by 48 h in 39°C, 41% relative humidity at a metabolic heat production of 10 W · kg−1. The non-sleep deprived HST was followed by the sleep deprivation (SDHST) trial for all participants during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Physiological and perceptual measures were recorded at 5 min intervals during the HSTs. On the cessation of the HSTs, heat illness symptom index (HISI) was completed. HISI scores increased after sleep deprivation by 28 ± 16 versus 20 ± 16 (P = 0.01). Peak (39.40 ± 0.35°C vs. 39.35 ± 0.33°C) and change in rectal temperature (1.91 ± 0.21 vs. 1.93 ± 0.34°C), and whole body sweat rate (1.08 ± 0.31 vs. 1.15 ± 0.36 L · h−1) did not differ (P > 0.05) between tests. No difference was observed in peak, nor rise in: heart rate, mean skin temperature, perceived exertion or thermal sensation during the HSTs. Twenty-four hours sleep deprivation increased perceptual symptoms associated with heat-related illness; however, no thermoregulatory alterations were observed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between obesity and sleep architecture in postmenopausal women.Methods: One hundred seven postmenopausal women from the Ambulatory of Integrative Treatment for Female Sleep Disorders were invited by telephone to participate in this study. Fifty-three completed the study. We included women aged 50 to 70 years, and excluded women on hormone therapy or missing data. The study consisted of two meetings, including a full-night polysomnography. Menopause status was confirmed by amenorrhea for at least 1 year. Anthropometric measurements included: body mass, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and neck circumference. Participants were allocated into two groups according to BMI: nonobese group (BMI <30 kg/m) and obese group (BMI ≥30 kg/m).Results: The obese group had significantly (P < 0.01) increased values of BMI, neck circumference, waist circumference, and hip circumference. WHR was similar between the groups (P = 0.77). Obese participants had significantly increased values of respiratory disturbance index (16.4 vs 9.3 n°/h) and apnea-hypopnea index (14.2 vs 5.6 n°/h). Rapid eye movement sleep latency was positively correlated to body mass (r = P < 0.01), BMI (P < 0.01), and hip circumference (P = 0.01). WHR was negatively correlated to sleep efficiency (P = 0.03). The linear regression model showed that BMI (P < 0.01) and WHR (P < 0.01) were positive predictors of rapid eye movement sleep latency.Conclusion: In postmenopausal women, high BMI and abdominal obesity are sources of sleep disturbances, decreasing deep sleep, and sleep efficiency, while increasing the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.

AB  - Objective: This study determined whether two different formulations of hormone therapy (HT): oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE; 0.45 mg/d, n = 209), transdermal 17β-estradiol (t-E2; 50 μg/d, n = 201) plus cyclic progesterone (Prometrium, 200 mg) or placebo (PBO, n = 243) affected sleep domains in participants of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study.Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline and during the intervention at 6, 18, 36, and 48 months. Global sleep quality and individual sleep domain scores were compared between treatments using analysis of covariance, and correlated with vasomotor symptom (VMS) scores using Spearman correlation coefficients.Results: Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (mean 6.3; 24% with score >8) were similar across groups at baseline and were reduced (improved sleep quality) by both HT (average change -1.27 [o-CEE] and -1.32 [t-E2]) when compared with PBO (-0.60; P = 0.001 [o-CEE vs PBO] and P = 0.002 [t-E2 vs PBO]). Domain scores for sleep satisfaction and latency improved with both HT. The domain score for sleep disturbances improved more with t-E2 than o-CEE or PBO. Global sleep scores significantly correlated with VMS severity (rs = 0.170, P < 0.001 for hot flashes; rs = 0.177, P < 0.001 for night sweats). Change in scores for all domains except sleep latency and sleep efficiency correlated with change in severity of VMS.Conclusions: Poor sleep quality is common in recently menopausal women. Sleep quality improved with both HT formulations. The relationship of VMS with domains of sleep suggests that assessing severity of symptoms and domains of sleep may help direct therapy to improve sleep for postmenopausal women.

AB  - Background: The real-world experience of women receiving extended-cycle combined oral contraception (COC) versus monthly-cycle COC has not been reported.Methods: Data were from the United States 2013 National Health and Wellness Survey. Eligible women (18-50 years old, premenopausal, without hysterectomy) currently using extended-cycle COC (3 months between periods) were compared with women using monthly-cycle COC. Treatment satisfaction (1 "extremely dissatisfied" to 7 "extremely satisfied"), adherence (8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale©), menstrual cycle-related symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health state utilities (Medical Outcomes Short Form Survey-36v2®), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), sleep difficulties, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-General Health, and healthcare resource use were assessed using one-way analyses of variance, chi-square tests, and generalized linear models (adjusted for covariates).Results: Participants included 260 (6.7%) women using extended-cycle and 3616 (93.3%) using monthly-cycle COC. Women using extended-cycle COC reported significantly higher treatment satisfaction (P = 0.001) and adherence (P = 0.04) and reduced heavy menstrual bleeding (P = 0.029). A non-significant tendency toward reduced menstrual pain (39.5% versus 47.3%) and menstrual cycle-related symptoms (40.0% versus 48.7%) was found in women using extended-cycle versus monthly-cycle COC. Significantly more women using extended-cycle COC reported health-related diagnoses, indicating preferential prescription for extended-cycle COC among women reporting more health problems. Consistent with this poorer health, more women using extended-cycle COC reported fatigue, headache, and activity impairment (P values < 0.05). There were no other significant differences between groups.Conclusions: This real-world observational study supports extended-cycle COC as a valuable treatment option with high satisfaction, high adherence, and reduced heavy menstrual bleeding.

AB  - Background: Lecithin is a complex mixture of phospholipids which compose lipid bilayer cell membranes. Lipid replacement therapy, or administration of phospholipids for the purpose of repairing the dmaged cell membranes, had been shown to alleviate fatigue. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of soy lecithin on fatigue in middle-aged women, as well as other menopausal symptoms and various health parameters.Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 96 women aged 40 to 60 years who complained of fatigue. The participants were randomized to receive active tablets containing high-dose (1200 mg/day; n = 32) or low-dose (600 mg/day; n = 32) soy lecithin, or placebo (n = 32), for 8 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: age, menopausal status, lifestyle factors, physical and psychological symptoms of menopause, subjective symptoms of insomnia and fatigue, body composition, cardiovascular parameters, and physical activities and objective sleep states obtained from actigraphy before and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Fatigue was evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS)-brief, Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Brief Fatigue Inventory.Results: Eighty-nine women completed the study. There were no significant differences in the changes in Chalder Fatigue Scale score (placebo vs low-dose vs high-dose groups: -2.9 ± 1.1, -3.2 ± 1.1, and -3.5 ± 1.0; P = 0.79). On the other hand, the improvements were greater in the high-dose group compared with the placebo group concerning vigor scores in the POMS-brief (1.9 ± 0.7 vs 0.2 ± 0.6; P = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure (-4.1 ± 1.8 vs 1.2 ± 1.9; P = 0.05), and cardio-ankle vascular index (-0.4 ± 0.2 vs 0.07 ± 0.1; P = 0.03) after 8 weeks of treatment.Conclusions: High-dose (1200 mg/day) soy lecithin not only increases vigor, but also lowers the diastolic blood pressure and cardio-ankle vascular index in middle-aged women who present with fatigue.Trial Registration: UMIN-CTR UMIN000017127 .

AB  - The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.

AB  - Purpose: MultIethNic Study of BrEast ARterial Calcium Gradation and CardioVAscular Disease (MINERVA) was designed to answer the question of whether a novel continuous breast arterial calcification (BAC) mass score improves cardiovascular risk stratification among asymptomatic postmenopausal women. This article describes recruitment and baseline characteristics.Methods: MINERVA is a multiethnic longitudinal cohort study. The phenotype data include BAC mass by densitometry applied to digital mammograms, sociodemographic factors, self-reported medical history, medications, parental history, reproductive history, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, anthropometry, ankle-brachial index, blood pressure, laboratory panel, breast volumes, cognitive function, bioelectrical impedance, habitual diet, dietary supplements, sleep, psychosocial factors, and sun exposure.Results: A total of 5145 women aged 60 to 79 years with available digital, uncompressed mammograms were recruited from the membership of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California between October 24, 2012 and February 13, 2015 and completed a baseline clinic visit or an abbreviated phone questionnaire. Of those, 4153 underwent phlebotomy and have blood biomarkers. Overall prevalence of BAC was 26%, and it varied by age and race. The mean (SD) BAC mass was 12 (23) mg and the range 0-342 mg.Conclusions: MINERVA is the first cohort with a continuous measure of BAC. The cohort is large, ethnically diverse, and deeply phenotyped in terms of socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors, and blood biomarkers.

AB  - Purpose: Mechanistic and observational data together support a role for prolactin in breast cancer development. Determinants of prolactin in Asian populations have not been meaningfully explored, despite the lower risk of breast cancer in Asian populations.Methods: Determinants of plasma prolactin were evaluated in 442 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based prospective cohort study. At baseline all cohort members completed an in-person interview that elicited information on diet, menstrual and reproductive history, and lifestyle factors. One year after cohort initiation we began collecting blood samples. Quantified were plasma concentrations of prolactin, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Analysis of covariance method was used for statistical analyses with age at blood draw, time since last meal, and time at blood draw as covariates.Results: Mean prolactin levels were 25.1% lower with older age at menarche (p value = 0.001), and 27.6% higher with greater years between menarche and menopause (p value = 0.009). Prolactin levels were also positively associated with increased sleep duration (p value = 0.005). The independent determinants of prolactin were years from menarche to menopause, hours of sleep, and the plasma hormones estrone and SHBG (all p values < 0.01).Conclusion: The role of prolactin in breast cancer development may involve reproductive and lifestyle factors, such as a longer duration of menstrual cycling and sleep patterns.

AB  - The Women's Health Clinic (WHC) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, has provided consultative care to women with menopausal and sexual health concerns since 2005. Clinical information on the 8688 women seen in the WHC through May 2017 who gave consent for the use of their medical records in research is contained in the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality (DREAMS). Initially, DREAMS was created to improve the clinical care of women, but it has become a valuable research tool. About 25% of the DREAMS women have been seen in the WHC 2 or more times, allowing for passive longitudinal follow-up. Additionally, about 25% of the DREAMS women live in the 27-county region included in the expanded Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system, providing additional information on those women. The cohort has been used to investigate associations between: caffeine intake and vasomotor symptom bother; recent abuse (physical, sexual, verbal, and emotional) and menopausal symptoms; specific menopausal symptoms and self-reported view of menopause; and obstructive sleep apnea risk and vasomotor symptom severity and the experience of vasomotor symptoms in women older than 60 years. A study nearing completion describes a clinical series of over 3500 women presenting for sexual health consultation by sexual function domain and by decade of life. Other studies under way are determining correlates with sexual health and dysfunction. Planned studies will investigate associations between the experience with menopause and the risk of disease.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the association of sleep quality with postural balance, as measured with objective stabilometric parameters, and fear of falling (FoF), among Spanish postmenopausal women.Methods: In all, 250 women (60 ± 8 years) took part in this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data were collected, as well as information concerning history of falls and FoF. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to analyze sleep quality. Measurements of sway area (S), velocity (V), and mediolateral (RMSX) and anteroposterior (RMSY) displacements of the center of pressure were obtained with a resistive multisensor platform under both eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions to assess postural control. The independent associations of sleep quality with FoF and postural control were evaluated by multivariate linear and logistic regressions, respectively, adjusting for potential confounding variables.Results: SEO was independently associated (adjusted R = 0.073) with sleep duration (P < 0.001) and subjective sleep quality (P = 0.001), VEO (adjusted R = 0.156) with daytime dysfunction (P = 0.006) and sleep duration (P = 0.013), RMSXEO (adjusted R = 0.118) with subjective sleep quality (P = 0.005), and RMSYEO (adjusted R = 0.166) with sleep duration (P = 0.001) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.046). Under EC condition, SEC (adjusted R = 0.014) was independently related with anxiety (P = 0.034), VEC (adjusted R = 0.148) with daytime dysfunction (P = 0.002) and sleep duration (P = 0.024), RMSXEC (adjusted R = 0.134) with subjective sleep quality (P < 0.001), and RMSYEC (adjusted R = 0.128) with sleep duration (P = 0.013) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.033). Logistic regression showed that time since menopause (P = 0.003), body mass index (P = 0.001), and anxiety (P < 0.001), unlike sleep quality, were independently associated with FoF. The effect size of the model was medium (adjusted R= 0.162).Conclusions: In Spanish postmenopausal women, sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, and daytime dysfunction were independent risk factors for worsened postural stability. FoF, anxiety, time since menopause onset, and body mass index, unlike sleep quality, were independently associated with poor postural stability.

AB  - Objective: To explore the nature of the bidirectional relationship between vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and depression, and to determine whether hot flashes and night sweats differentially affect the association between VMS and depression through their effect on sleep disruption.Methods: Multiple databases were searched from 1961 until July 31, 2016, and a manual search of reference lists of identified articles was conducted. Sixteen articles that involved 10,008 participants were identified and analyzed.Results: The methods of analyses and measurement of VMS and depression varied across the studies. Two studies explored the bidirectional association, but only one was significant in both directions (odds ratio [OR] depression to VMS 3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-6.58; OR VMS to depression 8.88, 95% CI 2.57-30.68). In both cases, the association between VMS leading to depressive symptoms was stronger than the opposite. Eleven studies examined VMS leading to depression, but only five showed a significant effect (OR 1.57-1.81, P ≤ 0.02). Treating VMS and depressive symptoms as continuous variables (n = 3) diminished the relationship. Three studies showed a significant association of depression leading to VMS (OR 1.62-1.94, P ≤ 0.01). We found little evidence for a specific effect of night sweats on the association between VMS and depressive symptoms. The effect might not be related to sleep disruption.Conclusions: There is a bidirectional association between VMS and depressive symptoms. The menopausal transition appears to increase the risk of recurrent episodes of depression that might not be explained only by VMS. Further investigation is needed to explain the differential effect of night sweats and hot flashes on depression.

AB  - Context: During normal, early puberty, luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency is low while awake but increases during sleep. Mechanisms underlying such changes are unclear, but a small study in early pubertal girls suggested that differential wake-sleep sensitivity to progesterone negative feedback plays a role.Objective: To test the hypothesis that progesterone acutely reduces waking LH pulse frequency more than sleep-associated pulse frequency in late pubertal girls.Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study.Setting: Academic clinical research unit.Participants: Eleven normal, postmenarcheal girls, ages 12 to 15 years.Intervention: Subjects completed two 18-hour admissions in separate menstrual cycles (cycle days 6 to 11). Frequent blood sampling for LH assessment was performed at 1800 to 1200 hours; sleep was encouraged at 2300 to 0700 hours. Either oral micronized progesterone (0.8 mg/kg/dose) or placebo was given at 0700, 1500, 2300, and 0700 hours, before and during the first admission. A second admission, performed at least 2 months later, was identical to the first except that placebo was exchanged for progesterone or vice versa (treatment crossover).Main Outcome Measures: LH pulse frequency during waking and sleeping hours.Results: Progesterone reduced waking LH pulse frequency by 26% (P = 0.019), with no change observed during sleep (P = 0.314). The interaction between treatment condition (progesterone vs placebo) and sleep status (wake vs sleep) was highly significant (P = 0.007).Conclusions: In late pubertal girls, progesterone acutely reduced waking LH pulse frequency more than sleep-associated pulse frequency. Differential wake-sleep sensitivity to progesterone negative feedback may direct sleep-wake LH pulse frequency changes across puberty.

AB  - Background: Women's physical and mental ill-health such as stress-related symptoms, depression, pain, hypertension and urogenital health shows a marked increase around the ages 45-55 years. These women are an important group for Primary Health Care (PHC) due to their prevalent symptoms and illnesses. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of somatic, psychological and urogenital symptoms in women aged 45-55 attending PHC and evaluate factors associated with severe symptoms.Methods: One hundred and thirty-one women were recruited from PHC in southwestern Sweden. Data were obtained from two self-reported questionnaires, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).Results: Exhaustion, depressive mood, muscle and joint problems, sleep and sexual problems were the most prevalent reported symptoms. Half of the women reported heart discomfort. Depression and increasing age were correlated to more severe symptoms.Conclusion: We recommend that cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal symptoms, sexual problems, sleeping problems and mental health should be actively asked for when women aged 45 to 55 attend PHC. We propose that preventive counselling of women in PHC before the age 45 should be evaluated in future studies.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cut-off value of parameters related to menopause in women recruited through the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study. Materials and Methods: A household survey sample of 397 women was submitted to biochemical analysis after overnight fasting for determination of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol levels. Volunteers were randomly selected to represent the population of São Paulo according to gender, age, and socioeconomic status. The cut-off values were determined from the receiver operating characteristic curve and by determining the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the parameters. Results: FSH, LH, and age provided >90% accuracy for defining the menopause group. Classification of menopause according to FSH level provided the highest level of accuracy (97.0%) based on a cut-off value of 21 mIU/mL as a classifier. Conclusions: The cut-off value for FSH alone was able to distinguish with higher efficiency premenopause and postmenopause groups. FSH levels provided greater accuracy in the diagnosis of natural menopause, compared to the other parameters. (J GYNECOL SURG 33:236) This study was registered with (NCT00596713).

AB  - Background: Sleep duration has been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but its association with liver cancer remains unknown. Material and Methods: In the prospective Women's Health Initiative Study, 139,368 postmenopausal women reported sleep habits at baseline (1993-1998). We ascertained 175 incident liver cancer cases during an average 13.8 years of follow-up through August 2014. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate a hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for risk of liver cancer in association with nocturnal sleep duration. Results: Compared to women reporting 6-8 hours of sleep, the HR for liver cancer was 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.53) for women reporting ≥9 hours of sleep. Among the obese women, the HR associated with ≥9 hours of sleep was 3.18 (95% CI 1.84-8.60). The HR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.34-2.53) among nonobese women ( p value for interaction = 0.18). Short sleep duration (≤5 hours) was not associated with liver cancer risk. Conclusion: Long sleep duration was associated with a moderate increase in liver cancer risk in obese postmenopausal women in the United States. Larger study is needed to confirm our observation on effect modification by adiposity status.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge.Methods: Infants born ≤32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their respiratory stability once they were ≥35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive apnoea indices and correlations tested.Results: Twenty-four infants completed the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the modified polysomnography.Conclusion: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in preterm infants ready for discharge.

AB  - Sleep is mandatory for life and therefore any sleep deprivation or disruption might carry ill-health outcomes. The optimal night’s sleep duration seems to be around 7 h, as too little sleep and too much sleep have been found to be associated with a variety of changes in well-being, physical and psychological parameters. This mini-review enlightens the potential health consequences of sleep disturbance relevant to menopause and midlife women’s health. These include cardiovascular and metabolic derangements, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, and cancer-related perspectives. Still, the current knowledge suggests that, even if statistically significant associations are detected, the absolute excessive risks are relatively small or modest.

AB  - Objective To describe the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among women during perimenopause and to examine differences in self-reported insomnia symptoms at different stages of perimenopause over 10 years. Design Secondary analysis of self-reported sleep symptoms and clinical variables using 10 years of publicly available data from the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN). Setting The data set of women’s insomnia symptoms was obtained from publicly available data from the SWAN. The parent study settings included Detroit, Michigan; Northern New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants Multiethnic midlife women with a mean age of 46 years ( N = 3,302) categorized as pre- and perimenopausal at baseline. Methods Dependent variables included self-reported insomnia symptoms: difficulty falling asleep (sleep latency), wake after sleep onset, early morning awakenings, and sleep quality. Descriptive analysis was completed for each 1-year study interval. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to identify whether insomnia symptoms changed over time by stage of perimenopause. Results Insomnia symptoms were present in 31% to 42% of perimenopausal women at any 1-year study interval. Insomnia symptoms were more prevalent in the late stage of perimenopause than the early stage ( p < .001). The odds of having any insomnia symptoms were 1.3 times greater for women in the late stage of perimenopause than in the early stage (95% confidence interval [1.2, 1.5], p < .001). Conclusion Insomnia symptoms are prevalent in women transitioning to menopause, and stage of perimenopause may heighten the risk to develop symptoms of insomnia disorder, which is associated with negative cardiometabolic outcomes.

AB  - The design of an early mobile health application (app) prototype to manage interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pain/discomfort in the bladder and pelvic floor, is described. The purpose of this app prototype is to help people who have IC/PBS manage and learn what triggers their symptoms. Another aim of this research was to provide an example of how sex and gender could be included into the design of a health information system. Based on a literature search of common symptoms and challenges faced by people living with IC/PBS, the researcher created an app prototype design including many features: resources for relaxation, mental health, intimacy, pregnancy, and daily life; reminders for appointments, and medication; logs for diet, activity, sleep, pain, menstruation; and a link to a public washroom locator. This prototype will later undergo usability and content evaluation.

AB  - As an approach of unobtrusive assessment of neonatal sleep state we aimed at an automated sleep state coding based only on heart rate variability obtained from electrocardiography used for regular patient monitoring. We analyzed active and quiet sleep states of preterm infants between 30 and 37weeks postmenstrual age. To determine the sleep states we used a nonlinear kernel support vector machine for sleep state separation based on known heart rate variability features. We used unweighted and weighted misclassification penalties for the imbalanced distribution between sleep states. The validation was performed with leave-one-out-cross-validation based on the annotations of three independent observers. We analyzed the classifier performance with receiver operating curves leading to a maximum mean value for the area under the curve of 0.87. Using this sleep state separation methods, we show that automated active and quiet sleep state separation based on heart rate variability in preterm infants is feasible.

AB  - Background. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder among adult people. It causes tiredness, difficulties in focusing, loss of energy, increased sensitivity, and irritability. Insomnia may develop into a chronic sleep disorder which has a direct negative impact on the quality of life of the affected person and it limits their capabilities of functioning in society. Objectives. The study objective was to seek relationships between age, the use of HRT , occurrence of depression symptoms and chronic conditions and insomnia in postmenopausal women. Material and methods. The study was conducted on 128 women, students of the University of the Third Age in Stargard. The median age was 65 years and ranged from 47 to 82 years old. The study was conducted with the use of the Insomnia Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory and the authors' own questionnaire. Results. Various degrees of insomnia were diagnosed in 69 women (53.91%). A statistically significant relationship was found between insomnia and age (x2 = 27.48; p = 0.007), occurrence of depression (x2 = 12.93; p = 0.005), and depression symptoms (x2 = 81.86; p < 0.001). The study revealed no statistically significant relationship between insomnia and the use of HRT , or the existence of chronic conditions. Conclusions. Age and depression symptoms have a significant impact on the occurrence of insomnia. However, the use of HRT or preexisting chronic conditions have no key influence on the occurrence of insomnia.

AB  - Increasing life expectancy means that most Western women will experience the menopausal transition. This phase of reproductive life involves a biopsychosocial process where the majority of women experience physiological changes, influenced by a wide range of ethnic, psychological, social and cultural factors. With relatively similar endocrine changes, symptom reporting should be correspondingly similar, yet more women in Western cultures report vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) compared to women in Asian cultures. Different approaches to menopause based on biological, medical, psychological or psychosocial premises result in different treatments for women who have troublesome symptoms. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is widely used in the management of symptoms associated with oestrogen withdrawal such as hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, but has no proven role in the treatment of midlife depression or arthritis. HRT prevents menopausal bone loss and osteoporotic fracture, though long-term use remains controversial because of the increased risk of breast cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, as reported by the Women's Health Initiative. An understanding of the pathophysiology of menopausal symptoms and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal treatments assists in the individual management of patients.

AB  - Background: Menopause is an inevitable stage affecting every middle-aged woman. China has a large and increasing group of post-menopausal women. Most post-menopausal women suffer from increased risks for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and sleep problems. Previous studies have demonstrated the associations between sleep disorders and increased CVD risks in general population. The current study is to examine the relationship between sleep quality and CVD risks among Chinese post-menopausal women.Methods: This study was a sub-study nested in a cross-sectional study that investigated the sleep quality of community-dwelling adults in Xian, Shaanxi Province, China. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Framingham 10-year risk score (FRS) were used to measure sleep quality and CVD risk among 154 Chinese post-menopausal women. Multivariate regression and logistic regression were used to determine the association between sleep quality and CVD risk.Results: The participants (age: 63.65 ± 4.47 years) experienced poor sleep quality (mean score of global PSQI = 8.58) and a 10-year risk of CVD of 12.54%. The CVD risk was significantly associated with sleep duration (β = - 0.18, p = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (β = 0.33, p < 0.001). Women with good sleep quality (PSQI ≤5) were less likely to be at high risk for CVD (FRS > 10%) (odds ratio = 0.51, p = 0.04).Conclusions: Poor sleep quality might increase the CVD risk in post-menopausal women. Interventions to promote the cardiovascular health of Chinese post-menopausal women may need to include sleep promotion strategies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and fatigue in women with endometrial cancer. Participants were 95 women (mean age = 57.44 ± 10.15 years) diagnosed with endometrial cancer and who had completed their treatment before data collection. Each woman completed three structured questionnaires: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (endocrine symptom subscale), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue. Participants' worst menopausal symptom was sexual pain. In addition, menopausal symptoms were worse in women with surgical menopause than with natural menopause. The majority of women had poor sleep quality (55%), and women with fatigue reported worse sleep quality and menopausal symptoms than those without fatigue. However, higher fatigue was significantly related to shorter time since diagnosis. Together, three variables (time since diagnosis, menopausal symptoms and sleep quality) explained 39% of the variance in fatigue, with menopausal symptoms being the strongest predictor. Healthcare providers can assess menopausal symptoms and sleep quality during and after treatment of women with endometrial cancer. Such assessments would allow timely interventions to alleviate fatigue and menopausal symptoms in this population, thus improving their quality of life.

AB  - Objective To investigate associations between photophobia and seasonal variation of migraine. Methods In this cross-sectional study, migraineurs consecutively recruited were referred to a specialist center located above the Arctic Circle at 68-71 degrees North during a 2.5-year period. Data were obtained through a structured interview. Results In total, 302 migraineurs with a mean (±SD) age of 35.5 (±12.6) years were included. Patients who reported seasonal variation of migraine ( n = 90; 29.8%) also reported more often interictal photophobia than the others (61/90, 67.8% vs 92/212, 43.4%, P < .0001). Patients reported sunlight or other bright light to trigger migraine attacks in 74.4% with seasonal migraine (SM) compared with 40.6% in patients with non-seasonal migraine (NSM) ( P < .0001), but there were similar frequencies of attacks reported to be triggered by sleep, menstruation, and other precipitating factors. After adjusting for migraine with aura, migraine disability, chronic migraine, interictal photophobia, and insomnia, sunlight or other bright light, photophobia was still associated with SM (OR; 3.47, CI [95%]; 1.83-6.59, P < .0001). Conclusions Migraineurs in a subarctic area reporting seasonal variation of attack frequency also report increased interictal photophobia independent of other clinical factors. Chronobiological mechanisms and/or increased activity in the visual system may be responsible for this phenomenon.

AB  - Introduction: Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, a time when women are likely to be in the paid workforce. Most women have menopausal symptoms and these may impact on daytime function and work performance. This study examines the relationship between reproductive stage, menopausal symptoms and work, and advises how employers can best support menopausal women.Methods: An online and paper-based survey was completed in 2015-16 by 1092 women (22% response rate) aged 40 years plus employed in three hospitals in metropolitan Australia. Survey questions examined demographics, health and lifestyle variables, menopausal symptom reporting, and work-related variables. Reproductive stage was determined using modified STRAW +10 principal and descriptive criteria.Results: Reproductive stage was not significantly associated with work engagement, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, work limitations and perceived supervisor support. Postmenopausal women had lower intention to leave their organizations than pre- and peri-menopausal women. While sleep problems were the most commonly reported menopausal symptom by peri-menopausal women, for postmenopausal women it was joint and muscular discomfort. Only hot flushes and vaginal dryness were significantly more frequent in peri- and post, compared to pre-menopausal women. In general, women rated their work performance as high and did not feel that menopausal symptoms impaired their work ability. Most women would appreciate greater organizational support, specifically temperature control, flexible work hours and information about menopause for employees and managers.Discussion: Most women did not believe that menopausal symptoms negatively impacted on their work. Organizational changes may reduce the burden of menopausal symptoms in the workplace.

AB  - Background: Perimenopausal insomnia is one of the core symptoms of the menopausal transition. Acupuncture is considered to exert a positive effect on restoring the normal sleep-wake cycle. However, there is little intuitive evidence besides evaluation using clinical effectiveness scales. We therefore designed this study, aiming to use more intuitive and reliable detection techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after applying acupuncture to provide neuroimaging evidence, as well as to verify the effectiveness with other curative effect indicators.Methods/design: This study is a randomized, assessor-statistician-blinded, positive medicine controlled trial involving 40 participants. A total of 40 eligible patients with perimenopausal insomnia will be randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio as an intervention group using acupuncture and a control group taking estazolam. Participants in the intervention group will receive six acupuncture treatment sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks, for a total of 24 sessions during the study. Meanwhile, the medicine control group will be prescribed estazolam 1-2 mg/day to be taken 30 minutes before sleep for 4 weeks. The primary outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Secondary outcomes are the micro-movement sensitive mattress-type sleep monitoring system, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. All outcomes will be evaluated before and after treatment. The safety of interventions will be assessed at every visit.Discussion: The results of this trial, which will be available in 2018, will investigate the impact of acupuncture treating perimenopausal insomnia from assessment of the sleep architecture, hormone level, and emotional-circuit neurological function, and will uncover the effective mechanism of acupuncture regulating the emotional center integrated effect.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trials Register, ChCTR-IPC-16007832 .

AB  - Objective: Review evidence to guide management of menopausal signs and symptoms in women after breast cancer and make recommendations accordingly.Evidence: Randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies.Background: Symptoms and clinical problems associated with estrogen depletion-sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis-confront the estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors globally.Recommendations: Following breast cancer, women should not generally be treated with menopausal hormone therapy or tibolone but should optimize lifestyle. Women with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit from mind-brain behavior or nonhormone, pharmacologic therapy. The selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentenoid agents improve VMS and quality of life. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. Treatment of VVA remains an area of unmet need. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels remaining within the normal postmenopausal range but could potentially stimulate occult breast cancer cells, and although poorly studied, is not generally advised, particularly for those on aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been approved to treat dyspareunia, but safety after breast cancer has not been established. Vaginal laser therapy is being used for VVA but efficacy from sham-controlled studies is lacking. Therapies undergoing development include lasofoxifene, neurokinin B inhibitors, stellate ganglion blockade, vaginal testosterone, and estetrol.Conclusions: Nonhormone options and therapies are available for treatment of estrogen depletion symptoms and clinical problems after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Individualization of treatment is essential.

AB  - Objective: Hormonal variations during the menstrual cycle may affect emotional regulation. We aimed to investigate the association between dysmenorrhea (the severe abdominal pain and cramps associated with menstruation) and cognitive abilities, emotional function and sleep patterns in adolescent girls. Moreover, we evaluated the frequency of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in our population and then divided them into 4 groups: subjects with only PMS; subjects with only dysmenorrhea; individuals with both PMS and dysmenorrhea and normal subjects.Study Design: In this cross sectional study, 897 adolescent girls who had entered menarche were recruited. Of these, 35.9% had only dysmenorrhea, 14.9% had only PMS, 32.7% had both PMS and dysmenorrhea while 16.5% had no PMS and/or dysmenorrhea (Normal). We assessed the tests for cognitive, emotional function and sleep patterns were compared for these groups.Results: Individuals in the dysmenorrhea group had significantly higher depression, aggression, insomnia, daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea scores compared to normal controls and the PMS group, but did not have significantly different cognitive ability (P value <0.05). These differences were strongly correlated to pain intensity (P<0.001). However, there were no significant differences between those with only PMS and control subjects with regard to cognitive ability, emotional function and sleep pattern tests.Conclusions: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent among adolescents and appears to be associated with depressive mood, a tendency to aggressive behavior and sleep disorders among adolescent girls.

AB  - Objectives: To conduct psychometric analyses to condense the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) into a shorter form termed the Hot Flash Interference (HFI) scale; evaluate cut-points for both scales; and establish minimally important differences (MIDs) for both scales.Methods: We analyzed baseline and postrandomization patient-reported data pooled across three randomized trials aimed at reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in 899 midlife women. Trials were conducted across five MsFLASH clinical sites between July 2009 and October 2012. We eliminated HFRDIS items based on experts' content validity ratings and confirmatory factor analysis, and evaluated cut-points and established MIDs by mapping HFRDIS and HFI to other measures.Results: The three-item HFI (interference with sleep, mood, and concentration) demonstrated strong internal consistency (alphas of 0.830 and 0.856), showed good fit to the unidimensional "hot flash interference factor," and strong convergent validity with HFRDIS scores, diary VMS, and menopausal quality of life. For both scales, cut-points of mild (0-3.9), moderate (4-6.9), and severe (7-10) interference were associated with increasing diary VMS ratings, sleep, and anxiety. The average MID was 1.66 for the HFRDIS and 2.34 for the HFI.Conclusions: The HFI is a brief assessment of VMS interference and will be useful in busy clinics to standardize VMS assessment or in research studies where response burden may be an issue. The scale cut-points and MIDs should prove useful in targeting those most in need of treatment, monitoring treatment response, and interpreting existing and future research findings.

AB  - Objective: Pain is a common complaint among postmenopausal women. It has been postulated that vascular dysfunction caused by estrogen decline at menopause plays a key role in the initiation and progression of degradative joint disease, namely age-related osteoarthritis. We evaluated whether supplementation with resveratrol, a phytoestrogen, could improve aspects of well-being such as chronic pain that is commonly experienced by postmenopausal women.Methods: A 14-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention with trans-resveratrol (75 mg, twice daily) was conducted in 80 healthy postmenopausal women. Aspects of well-being, including pain, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, mood states, and quality of life were assessed by Short form-36 at baseline and at the end of treatment. Rating scales were averaged to provide a composite score representing overall well-being. Cerebral vasodilator responsiveness to hypercapnia was also assessed as a surrogate marker for cerebrovascular function.Results: Compared with placebo treatment, there was a significant reduction in pain and an improvement in total well-being after resveratrol supplementation. Both benefits, including measures of quality of life, correlated with improvements in cerebrovascular function.Conclusions: Our preliminary findings indicate potential for resveratrol treatment to reduce chronic pain in age-related osteoarthritis. Resveratrol consumption may also boost perceptions of well-being in postmenopausal women. Further investigation to elucidate underlying mechanisms is warranted.

AB  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at ≤28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BackgroundPsychosocial and inflammatory factors have been associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors. Nevertheless, the relative contribution and/or interaction of these factors with cancer-related fatigue have not been well documented.MethodThis cross-sectional study enrolled 111 stage 0–III breast cancer patients treated with breast surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy. Fatigue was measured by the total score of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20. Potential risk factors included inflammatory markers (plasma cytokines and their receptors and C-reactive protein; CRP), depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self Reported), sleep (as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and perceived stress (as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale) as well as age, race, marital status, smoking history, menopause status, endocrine treatment, chemotherapy and cancer stage. Linear regression modeling was employed to examine risk factors of fatigue. Only risk factors with a significance level <0.10 were included in the initial regression model. A post-hoc mediation model using PROCESS SPSS was conducted to examine the association among depressive symptoms, sleep problems, stress, inflammation and fatigue.ResultsAt 1 year post-radiotherapy, depressive symptoms (p<0.0001) and inflammatory markers (CRP: p = 0.015; interleukin-1 receptor antagonist: p = 0.014; soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2: p = 0.009 in separate models) were independent risk factors of fatigue. Mediation analysis showed that depressive symptoms also mediated the associations of fatigue with sleep and stress.ConclusionsDepressive symptoms and inflammation were independent risk factors for cancer-related fatigue at 1 year post-radiotherapy, and thus represent independent treatment targets for this debilitating symptom.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to analyze the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), and its ability to discriminate between poor and good sleepers among a Spanish population with vestibular disorders.Methods: In all, 121 women (50-76 years old) completed the Spanish version of the MOS-SS. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity (exploratory factor analysis) were analyzed. Concurrent validity was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. To analyze the ability of the MOS-SS scores to discriminate between poor and good sleepers, a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed.Results: The Spanish version of the MOS-SS showed excellent and substantial reliability in Sleep Problems Index I (two sleep disturbance items, one somnolence item, two sleep adequacy items, and awaken short of breath or with headache) and Sleep Problems Index II (four sleep disturbance items, two somnolence items, two sleep adequacy items, and awaken short of breath or with headache), respectively, and good internal consistency with optimal Cronbach's alpha values in all domains and indexes (0.70-0.90). Factor analysis suggested a coherent four-factor structure (explained variance 70%). In concurrent validity analysis, MOS-SS indexes showed significant and strong correlation with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total score, and moderate with the 36-item Short Form Health Survey component summaries. Several domains and the two indexes were significantly able to discriminate between poor and good sleepers (P < 0.05). Optimal cut-off points were above 20 for "sleep disturbance" domain, with above 22.22 and above 33.33 for Sleep Problems Index I and II.Conclusions: The Spanish version of the MOS-SS is a valid and reliable instrument, suitable to assess sleep quality in Spanish postmenopausal women, with satisfactory general psychometric properties. It discriminates well between good and poor sleepers.

AB  - Objective: The association between sleep and the menstrual cycle in the adolescent population has been scarcely studied. This study aimed to investigate the association between sleep duration and menstrual cycle irregularity among female adolescents using nationwide representative data from the South Korean population.Methods: This population-based, cross-sectional study used the data collected from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012, and the data from 801 female adolescents were analyzed. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk of menstrual cycle irregularity in relation to sleep duration.Results: Subjects with menstrual cycle irregularity accounted for 15% (N = 120). The mean sleep duration in subjects with menstrual cycle irregularity was significantly shorter than that in those without (p = 0.003). Menstrual cycle irregularity prevalence tended to decrease as sleep duration increased (p for trend = 0.004), which was significantly different based on sleep duration and presence of depressive mood (p = 0.011). Sleep duration ≤5 h per day was significantly associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity compared with that in the subjects whose sleep duration is ≥8 h per day even after adjusting for confounding variables. The odds ratios of menstrual cycle irregularity tended to increase for shorter sleep duration in all adjusted models.Conclusion: This study found a significant inverse association between sleep duration and menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adolescents. Increasing sleep duration is required to improve the reproductive health of female adolescents.

AB  - Background: Early sensitivity training for mothers of preterm infants has been attracting attention as a means of improving the quality of interactions between mothers and their infants as well as infants' socioemotional development. However, little is known about the early process of preterm parent-infant interactions and the parental views of infants' behaviors. Purpose: This study aimed to identify behavioral characteristics observed in parent-infant dyads at 33- to 35-week corrected age together with parental perceptions and to explore some significant elements that associate the progression of both father-infant and mother-infant interactions. Methods: Longitudinal descriptive design was used. Participants were 3 couples and their preterm infants born at 29 and 30 weeks' gestation. The infants were free of neurological anomalies or complications. The original observational method was developed on the basis of "Als's Synactive Theory" to describe infants' stress-coping behavior. At the same time, infants' sleep-awake states, postural stability, respiratory change, and skin color were observed. Parent-infant interactions were observed 2 to 3 times during 33 to 35 weeks postmenstrual age. In addition, parents were interviewed regarding their feelings and perceptions of their infant's behavior at each observation. Within 2 weeks of the final observation, parents participated in an additional semistructured interview. Specific interactional behaviors of both mother-infant and father-infant were extracted from the data set of each observation, including parents' perceptions of their infant's behavior and growth connected with each interactional behavior. Interactional behavior was then transformed into equivalent codes and placed in a table to analyze. All procedures were approved by the institutional review board of the authors' university (no. 26-73). Results: Three preterm infants, including 1 female and 2 males, and their parents were study participants. Birth weight ranged between 1350 and 1450 g. Four themes were identified from parent-infant interactions and parental perceptions. These include "subconsciously occurring interactions," "imagining infant's thoughts and desires," "developing internal awareness for the new existing child," and "purposeful interactions." Also, 9 mutually held categories emerged from the interviews to reflect both mothers' and fathers' perceptions of their infant's behavior. Through the ongoing interactions, parents gained understanding of their infant's behavior; thus, "purposeful interactions" began to play a significant role in fostering infant's stability. Parental views of their developing preterm infants and the act of sharing the views and perceptions with the spouse or partner remained visible throughout the progression of parent-infant interactions. Parental views of their infant's growth and the act of sharing further facilitated the parents to "subconsciously" draw attention to their infant's behaviors, "picture" their infant's thoughts and desires, and "develop stronger internal awareness" for their new family member. Implications for Practice: We can encourage parents to picture their infant's thoughts and desires by facilitating them to share their views on their infants with their spouse, partner, or other family members. And, we can support parents to develop stronger internal awareness for their infants by sharing perceptions of growing infants with them. Implications for Research: Future research should examine influences of parental views of their growing infant and the act of sharing on their infant's development.

AB  - Background: Exercise generally improves quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial functioning in adult populations but few randomized trials have examined dose-response effects.Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to report the QoL and psychosocial outcomes from the Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA).Methods: Healthy but inactive postmenopausal women at risk for breast cancer were randomized to a year-long aerobic exercise intervention consisting of either 150 min/week (moderate volume group, n = 200) or 300 min/week (high volume group, n = 200). QoL was assessed at baseline and 1 year using the short form-36 health survey. Sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and happiness were also assessed. Participant preference for group assignment (i.e., exercise volume) was assessed at baseline and tested as a moderator.Results: There were no statistically significant dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on any QoL, sleep quality, or psychosocial outcome. Participant preference for group assignment did not moderate any QoL, sleep quality, or psychosocial responses. Marital status was a significant moderator (p for interaction = 0.01) and obesity showed a trend towards being a moderator (p for interaction = 0.08) of the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on global sleep quality such that unmarried and obese women improved sleep quality with the higher volume of aerobic exercise.Conclusions: A higher volume of aerobic exercise, approximately double the minimum public health guideline, did not provide additional QoL or psychosocial benefits compared to the minimum public health guideline in inactive postmenopausal women, even for women who preferred the higher volume of exercise at baseline.Trial Registration: Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT1435005.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances and pain are assumed to be reciprocally linked. Insomnia and pain are central symptoms of the postmenopausal period and are closely related. Insomnia affects quality of life, increases pain sensitivity, the risk of pain-related disability, and other health problems.Objective: To investigate whether insomnia influences aspects of pain (pain intensity and the effect of pain on daily function) in postmenopausal women, and to evaluate the objective sleep pattern of insomniacs with pain.Methods: Fifty-seven women completed questionnaires about insomnia, climacteric symptoms, and pain. Polysomnography data were collected as well as their medical history. Patients were allocated into three groups: control, subthreshold insomnia, and insomnia. Pain intensity, climacteric symptoms and objective sleep pattern were compared between groups.Results: Postmenopausal women with insomnia had statistically significant higher pain interference in their activities (e.g. relationships with other people, enjoyment of life and sleep) than controls, and had more severe climacteric symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences in pain intensity and objective sleep pattern between groups.Conclusions: Insomnia status affected climacteric symptoms and pain interference, but not pain intensity in postmenopausal women. Women with insomnia had higher rates of climacteric symptoms than those without insomnia or those with subthreshold insomnia. No changes in objective sleep pattern were found.

AB  - Women are exposed to indoor and outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) in urban and rural environments. Excessive exposure to hazardous ALAN containing short wavelength light may suppress pineal melatonin production and lead to an increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Our objective was to address the differences in BC risks related to light exposure in urban and rural communities. We examined indoor and outdoor light habits of BC patients and controls that had lived in urban and rural areas in a 5-year period, 10 to 15 years before the time of the study. Individual data, night time sleeping habits and individual exposure to ALAN habits were collected using a questionnaire. A total of 252 women (110 BC patients and 142 controls) participated in this study. The sample was divided to subgroups according to dwelling area and disease status. Age matching was completed between all subgroups. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for urban and rural women separately, using binary logistic regression. OR results of urban population (92 BC patients and 72 control) revealed that BC risk increases with daily use of cellphone (OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.01-4.49, P < .05) and residence near strong ALAN sources (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.99-2.30, P < .06). Nevertheless, BC risk decreases if a woman was born in Israel (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.21-0.93, P < .03), longer sleep duration (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.53-1.05, P < .1), and reading with bed light illumination before retiring to sleep (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61-0.96, P < .02). Furthermore, in the rural population (18 BC patients and 66 control) BC risk increases with the number of years past since the last menstruation (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.22, P < .01). However, BC risk decreases with longer sleep duration (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.24-1.14, P < .1), reading with room light illumination before retiring to sleep (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.29-1.06, P < .07), and sleeping with closed shutters during the night (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.41-1.04, P < .08). These data support the idea that indoor and outdoor nighttime light exposures differ between urban and rural women. Therefore, we suggest that women can influence BC risk and incidence by applying protective personal lighting habits. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to strengthen the results.

AB  - Objective: Sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction are common in menopause; however, the nature of their association is unclear. The present study aimed to determine whether sleep characteristics were associated with sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.Methods: Sexual function in the last year and sleep characteristics (past 4 wk) were assessed by self-report at baseline for 93,668 women age 50 to 79 years enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS). Insomnia was measured using the validated WHI Insomnia Rating Scale. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) risk was assessed using questions adapted from the Berlin Questionnaire. Using multivariate logistic regression, we examined cross-sectional associations between sleep measures and two indicators of sexual function: partnered sexual activity and sexual satisfaction within the last year.Results: Fifty-six percent overall reported being somewhat or very satisfied with their current sexual activity, and 52% reported partnered sexual activity within the last year. Insomnia prevalence was 31%. After multivariable adjustment, higher insomnia scores were associated with lower odds of sexual satisfaction (yes/no) (odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI, 0.87-0.96). Short sleep duration (<7-8 h) was associated with lower odds of partnered sexual activity (yes/no) (≤5 h, OR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.80-0.96) and less sexual satisfaction (≤5 h, OR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.81-0.95).Conclusions: Shorter sleep durations and higher insomnia scores were associated with decreased sexual function, even after adjustment for potential confounders, suggesting the importance of sufficient, high-quality sleep for sexual function. Longitudinal investigation of sleep and its impact on sexual function postmenopause will clarify this relationship.

AB  - Objectives: This analysis examined climacteric symptoms clusters in women with and without breast cancer, and explored how sociodemographic, health, and modifiable lifestyle factors predicted symptom clusters.Methods: This pooled analysis of four Women's Wellness Research Program (WWRP) studies comprised individual-level data from 969 Australian women aged 40 to 63 years, 293 of whom had been previously treated for breast cancer and 678 without a breast cancer history. Climacteric symptoms, menopausal status, sociodemographic characteristics, and health and lifestyle factors were assessed. Principal component analysis was used to determine symptom clusters for each group separately before linear regression with backwards selection was used to identify the significant correlates of the identified clusters.Results: Women with a history of breast cancer reported more sleep disturbance (P < 0.01), difficulty concentrating (P < 0.01), muscular/joint pain (P < 0.01), crying (P < 0.01) and irritability (P < 0.01), and vasomotor symptoms (P < 0.01) than women from the noncancer group. Principal component analysis with quartimax rotation revealed two distinct solutions explaining 60.9% and 57.6% of the variance in the groups, respectively. For both groups, symptom clusters were increased among those with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (and chemotherapy among the after cancer group, P < 0.05 for all), though to a lesser extent in the breast cancer group.Conclusions: In this study, women after treatment for breast cancer reported a broad range of bothersome climacteric symptoms. Similar symptom clusters were also noted for women with and without a history of breast cancer, though correlates differed across groups, and might reflect different underlying etiologies.

AB  - Background: Objective, treatment-independent markers of cancer-related fatigue are needed to advance clinical trials. In the current study, the authors evaluated physical, neurocognitive, and serologic markers for correlation with self-reported fatigue before and after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer.Methods: Women with AJCC TNM Stage I-III breast cancer consented to assessment before and after the completion of 4 cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Assessment included self-reported fatigue (using the Brief Fatigue Inventory), depression (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D]), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 28 objective measures (grip strength in dominant and nondominant hands, 6-minute walk, daily total energy expenditure, 14 neurocognitive tests, and 10 serologic markers). Generalized linear regression models of fatigue were constructed (1 model per marker), and adjusted for depression, timing before/after chemotherapy, menopausal status, obesity, and educational level. P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate.Results: Of 28 subjects, 3 withdrew without completing baseline assessments. Prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy data were available for the evaluation of physical measures (25 subjects aged 50.6 ± 9.5 years), neurocognitive tests (22 subjects), and serologic markers (10 subjects). On covariate-adjusted analysis, interleukin (IL)-12 was found to be associated with fatigue at both assessments (P<.01). Serum eotaxin (P < .01), IL-1RA (P < .01), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (P<.01), and performance on 2 neurocognitive (Trail Making) tests (P<.01 and P = .02, respectively) were found to be inversely associated with fatigue before chemotherapy but not afterward, whereas daily energy expenditure, serum MCP-1, and serum macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) were found to be associated with fatigue after receipt of chemotherapy but not before (P<.01 for each). The association between energy expenditure and fatigue was detectable only if an actively athletic subject with outlier values of energy expenditure was excluded.Conclusions: Serum IL-12 merits confirmatory testing as an objective, treatment-independent measure of fatigue in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

AB  - Tinnitus is a common complaint among patients visiting an ENT clinic. In our tinnitus special clinic, we encountered a special group of subjects: women in their menopausal period or in the immediate postmenopausal period, whose tinnitus responded exceptionally well to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The THI and VAS scores were evaluated at pre-treatment and post-treatment at least 3 month later, during their first follow-up visit. Estrogen [0.625 mg, 1 tablet QD to QOD] plus conjug medroxyprogesterone [5 mg, 1 tablet HS]) to treat their tinnitus and other menopause-associated symptoms. Tire average pretreatment THI score was 57.6 and the post-score was 17.5. The average pre VAS score was 7.2, and the postscore was 3.2. 18 of the 44 (40%) patients had THI scores below 10 after treatment, and 11 patients (25%) even had a THI score of 0. 43 patients showed tinnitus improvement in the post-treatment THI score. Only 1 patient showed no improvement at all. The use of HRT for menopausal syndrome is still controversial. However, emerging evidence shows that low-dose HRT does not increase the incidence to malignancies, and can instead reduce composite deafness and heart failure9. It can also improve the sleep quality and prevent osteoporosislO. We emphasize here that, for this particular group of patients, their consent, close collaboration with gynecologists, and careful monitoring are all very important. Our short-term outcome 44 case series showed that menopausal women with chronic tinnitus could benefit by HRT. The treatment produces rapid, effective, and safe results. However, HRT is not recommended as a standard treatment for chronic tinnitus now.

AB  - The origin of tinnitus was first thought to come from the ear itself, i.e. cochlea or inner ear. However, after accumulation of more than 20 years in clinical experience, we found chronic tinnitus concomitant with a variety of undetected patho-physiological disturbances such as Eustachian tube dysfunction, silent paranasal sinusitis, gastro- esophageal reflux, menopause associated syndromes, obstructive sleep apnea syndromes, drug addiction, insomnia and depression. This notion (the Ist generation) makes tinnitus equivalent to hearing loss, which consequently developed the treatments focused on hair cell reactivation and tinnitus-masking with external sound. But their clinical results were unsatisfactory. In 1990s, through the hypothesis neurophysiological model, tinnitus was postulated (the 2nd generation) to come from the central nervous system, i.e. the brain and a variety of clinical symptoms, or even a vicious cycle, could be ignited while the tinnitus aversive reaction arousing our limbic and autonomic systems. During this period, Tinnitus Retraining Therapy-TRT was introduced to treat tinnitus with direct counseling and sound therapy. In late 90s, more psychologists and psychotherapist were involved in tinnitus treatment with Cognitive behavior therapy-CBT, which clinically merited as good and effective results as TRT. This experience summarized into a new notion (the 3rd generation) of tinnitus treatment in 2000s - through a positive, encouraging and informative explanation to eliminate patients' dread for tinnitus and to inhibit the ever-compensation for tinnitus in the central system. Recently, a new hypothesis about a tinnitus control system - frontostriatal gating- was developed to explain the co-existence of chronic tinnitus and other pathologic disturbances. By rebalancing the tinnitus control system and eliminating the undetected disorders, tinnitus might be well-controlled even it is still perceived or existed (the 4th generation).

AB  - Objective: Alterations in sleep quality and metabolism during menopause are improved by menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). The mechanisms mediating these effects remain unclear. Orexin A (OxA) is a neuro-peptide that regulates sleep/wakefulness, food intake and metabolism. This study examined changes in plasma OxA levels during and after treatment in women from the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS).Methods: KEEPS randomized women within three years of menopause to: oral conjugated equine estrogen (o-CEE, 0.45mg/day), transdermal 17β estradiol (t-E2, 50μg/day), or placebo pills and patches for four years. Plasma OxA levels were measured by enzyme immunoassays in fasting blood samples collected annually from KEEPS participants at Mayo Clinic during and three years after MHT. Changes in menopausal symptoms and plasma OxA levels were assessed for treatment differences.Results: During treatment, OxA levels increased more in women randomized to o-CEE compared with the other groups. Women randomized to either form of MHT demonstrated smaller increases in BMI than those on placebo. Insomnia severity decreased similarly among treatment groups. However, neither changes in sleep nor changes in BMI correlated with changes in plasma OxA levels. Changes in waist circumference correlated positively with changes in plasma OxA levels three years after discontinuation of study treatments.Conclusions: Although OxA levels increased only in women randomized to o-CEE, these changes did not correlate with changes in sleep quality or BMI. The modest correlation of OxA levels with waist circumference once study treatments were discontinued suggests that OxA may be modulated through multiple intermediary pathways affected by metabolites of 17β-estradiol. Clinical Trial Registration for KEEPS: NCT00154180.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this review is to examine three questions: What are the risks and benefits of treating women with schizophrenia with hormone therapy (HT) at menopause? Should the antipsychotic regimen be changed at menopause? Do early- and late-onset women with schizophrenia respond differently to HT at menopause?Methods: MEDLINE databases for the years 1990 to 2016 were searched using the following interactive terms: schizophrenia, gender, menopause, estrogen, and hormones. The selected articles (62 out of 800 abstracts) were chosen on the basis of their applicability to the objectives of this targeted narrative review.Results: HT during the perimenopause in women with schizophrenia ameliorates psychotic and cognitive symptoms, and may also help affective symptoms. Vasomotor, genitourinary, and sleep symptoms are also reduced. Depending on the woman's age and personal risk factors and antipsychotic side effects, the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease may be increased. Antipsychotic types and doses may need to be adjusted at menopause, as may be the mode of administration.Conclusions: Both HT and changes in antipsychotic management should be considered for women with schizophrenia at menopause. The question about differences in response between early- and late-onset women cannot yet be answered.

AB  - Objectives Insomnia is a significant public health concern known to particularly impact women and the veteran population; however, rates of insomnia disorder among women veterans are not known. Method Women veterans who had received health care at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System between 2008 and 2010 and resided within 25 miles of the facility were sent a postal survey assessing sleep, demographics, and other related patient characteristics. Results A total of 660 women (43.1% of potential responders) returned the postal survey and provided sufficient information for insomnia diagnosis. On average, women reported 6.2 hours of sleep per night. The prevalence of insomnia, determined according to diagnostic criteria from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2, was 52.3%. Women with insomnia reported more severely disturbed sleep, and more pain, menopausal symptoms, stress/worries, and nightmares compared with women without insomnia. There was a quadratic relationship between age and insomnia with women in their mid-40s, most likely to have insomnia. Conclusions This survey study found that insomnia symptoms were endorsed by more than one-half of the women veterans in this sample of VA users, highlighting the critical need for enhanced clinical identification and intervention. Further research is needed to establish national rates of insomnia among women veterans and to improve access to evidence-based treatment of insomnia disorder.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to identify the predictors of poor sleep quality and the associations between depression, hope and sleep in a sample of 156 women with breast cancer prior to surgery. Background: The care and treatment of breast cancer is among the most important scientific challenges in public health. Sleep disturbances and depression are the important complaint of cancer patients. However, they are often neglected. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer also experience prejudice, fear of death, suffering, mutilation, fear of lymphedema, as well as feelings of social devaluation leading to hopelessness Several studies point to hope as an effective strategy to help patients cope with difficulties and achieve their goals, especially patients with cancer. Methods: This is a report of baseline data extracted from a longitudinal study. Data collection tools: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Herth Hope Index. Data were analyzed with the Spearman's Rank Correlation test and Multiple Logistic Regression analysis. Results: The majority of women had tumors in initial stages (78.7%), reported poor sleep quality (58.9%), and had moderate to severe or severe depression (27.2%). Significant correlations were found between hope and depression (Spearman r=-0.4341), and between sleep quality and depression (Spearman r=0.3938). Significant associations were found between poor sleep quality and pain, symptoms of menopause and depression. Depression and symptoms of menopause were independent predictors of poor sleep quality. Conclusion: The evaluation of sleep quality, depression and hope should be implemented in clinical practice. Increased hope lessens depression and may positively affect sleep quality, all of which improves quality of life for women with breast cancer.

AB  - Background Soy isoflavone is beneficial for menopausal/postmenopausal symptoms, including sleep complaints. However, little is known about its longitudinal association with sleep in the general population. Objective Our aim was to investigate the association between soy isoflavone intake and sleep duration and daytime falling asleep among Chinese adults. Design A longitudinal analysis was performed. Soy isoflavone intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Sleep duration was self-reported at two time points. Occurrence of daytime falling asleep was determined at follow-up. Short and long sleep were defined as sleep <7 h/day or ≥9 h/day, respectively. Participants/setting Adults aged 20 years and older from the Jiangsu Nutrition Study (2002-2007) with complete isoflavone intake and sleep duration data at both time points (n=1,474) were analyzed (follow-up, n=1,492). Main outcome measures We measured sleep duration in 2002 and 2007 and daytime falling asleep occurrence in 2007. Statistical analyses performed Mixed-effects logistic regression was performed for repeated measures between isoflavone intake and sleep duration. Logistic regression was performed for daytime falling asleep at follow-up. Demographic, anthropometric, and social factors were adjusted in the analyses. Results The prevalence of long sleep duration was 18.9% in 2002 and 12.6% in 2007, and the prevalence of daytime falling asleep was 5.3%. Compared with the lowest quartile of isoflavone intake, the highest quartile was associated with a lower risk of long sleep duration (odds ratio=0.66; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90; P for trend=0.018) over 5 years. Compared with persistent low intake of isoflavone (less than median intake of isoflavone at two time points), persistent high intake was associated with a reduced risk of daytime falling asleep in women (odds ratio=0.20; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68), but not men. No consistent association between soy isoflavone intake and short sleep duration was found. Conclusions Soy isoflavone intake was associated with a low risk of long sleep duration in both sexes and a low risk of daytime falling asleep in women but not men.

AB  - This review describes the evolving role of oral hormone therapy (HT) for treating menopausal symptoms and preventing osteoporosis, focusing on conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene (CE/BZA). Estrogens alleviate hot flushes and prevent bone loss associated with menopause. In nonhysterectomized women, a progestin should be added to estrogens to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Use of HT declined since the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies showed that HT does not prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) and that conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate increased the risk of invasive breast cancer after nearly 5 years of use. However, re-analyses of the WHI data suggest that some risks (eg, CHD, all-cause mortality) may be reduced when HT is initiated in women <60 years of age and <10 years since menopause, compared with later. CE/BZA is the first menopausal HT without a progestogen for nonhysterectomized women. Instead, BZA, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, in combination with CE, protects against estrogenic effects on uterine and breast tissue. Data from 5 large, randomized clinical trials show that CE/BZA reduces hot flush frequency/severity, prevents bone loss, reduces bone turnover, improves the vaginal maturation index and ease of lubrication, and improves some measures of sleep and menopause-specific quality of life. In studies of up to 2 years, there was no increase in endometrial hyperplasia, vaginal bleeding, breast density, or breast pain/tenderness compared with placebo. Venous thromboembolism and stroke are risks of all estrogen-based therapies. The choice of HT should be individualized, with consideration of the risk/benefit profile and tolerability of therapy, as well as patient preferences.

AB  - Context • During the postmenopausal stage, women go through many remarkable changes, including physical, emotional, and hormonal. They also experience some unwanted effects, such as vasomotor symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia. The use of Bach flower remedies has been described as a supporting therapy for those symptoms. Objectives • The investigation aimed to evaluate the effects of the supplement on sleep pattern (ie, sleep perception and objective sleep) and on menopausal symptoms. Design • The research team created a case report. Setting • The study was conducted at the Menopause Transition and Postmenopause Sleep Disorder Clinic at the Department of Gynecology of the Federal University of São Paulo in São Paulo, Brazil. Participant • The participant was a 53-y-old, single woman, at the postmenopausal stage, who had been diagnosed with insomnia according to the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and complained of climacteric symptoms. Intervention • The patient underwent treatment with a blend of the supplement for 4 mo. Outcome Measures • Sleep questionnaires were given and polysomnography was performed before and after treatment. Results • Both sleep perception and objective sleep were improved. The patient's anxiety and menopausal symptoms were reduced after the treatment with the supplement. Conclusion • The use of Bach flower remedies as a therapeutic strategy to relieve menopausal symptoms, such as anxiety, mood changes, and insomnia, seems worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity.Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions.Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome.Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

AB  - Background: Menstrual cycle irregularity is common among adolescents and can induce mental health problems such as stress, depression, and suicidal ideation. We examined the association between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls.Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study was on 808 female adolescents (12-18 years of age) participating in the 2010-2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Psychological stress, depressive mood, suicidal ideations, suicide attempts, and psychological counseling were assessed through questionnaires and surveys, and hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.Results: The risk of menstrual cycle irregularity tended to increase, as the number of mental health problems increased (P for trend=0.016). High stress levels, depressive mood, and psychological counseling were associated with increased risks of menstrual cycle irregularity (odd ratio [95% confidence interval]=1.88 [1.1-3.21], 2.01 [1.01-4.03], and 2.92 [1.16-7.34], respectively) even after adjusting for age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, hemoglobin level, monthly household income, weight loss attempts, age at menarche, and sleep duration. Suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with menstrual cycle irregularity.Limitations: Menstrual irregularity was evaluated based solely on subjects' self-reports, which are subject to their subjective perceptions and appraisal. Cross-sectional design and retrospective data could not draw causal relationship.Conclusions: Positive associations were observed between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls. More attention should be paid towards mental health, to improve menstrual cycle regularity and help prevent related chronic diseases later in life.

AB  - Objective: Insomnia disorder is a risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) pathology. It is unknown whether insomnia that develops in the context of the menopausal transition (MT) impacts the CV system. We assessed nocturnal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) profiles in women with insomnia disorder in the MT.Methods: Twelve women meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia in the MT (age, mean ± SD: 50.5 ± 3.6 y) and 11 controls (age, mean ± SD: 49.0 ± 3.0 y) had polysomnographic recordings on one or two nights during which beat-to-beat BP and HR were assessed and analyzed hourly from lights-out across the first 6 hours of the night and according to sleep stage. Physiological hot flashes were identified from fluctuations in sternal skin conductance.Results: Women with insomnia and controls had similar distributions of sleep stages and awakenings/arousals across hours of the night, although insomnia participants tended to have more wakefulness overall. More women in the insomnia group (7 of 12) than in the control group (2 of 11) had at least one physiological hot flash at night (P < 0.05). Both groups showed a drop in BP in the first part of the night; however, systolic and diastolic BP patterns diverged later, remaining low in controls but increasing in insomnia participants 4 to 6 hours after lights-out (P < 0.05). Both groups showed a similar pattern of decline in HR across the night.Conclusions: Our findings suggest altered regulatory control of BP during sleep in the MT insomnia. The causes and long-term consequences of this altered nocturnal BP profile remain to be determined.

AB  - We previously reported that women with short sleep duration consumed more dietary carbohydrate and showed an increased risk for obesity compared to those who slept adequately, but not for men. Using a cross-sectional study of 17,841 Korean women, we investigated the influence of sleep duration on obesity-related variables and consumption of dietary carbohydrate-rich foods in relation to menopausal status. Premenopausal women with short sleep duration had significantly greater body weight (p = 0.007), body mass index (p = 0.003), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.028 and p = 0.024, respectively), prevalence of obesity (p < 0.016), and consumption of more carbohydrate-rich foods such as staple foods (p = 0.026) and simple sugar-rich foods (p = 0.044) than those with adequate sleep duration after adjustment for covariates. Premenopausal women with short sleep duration were more obese by 1.171 times compared to subjects adequate sleep duration (95% confidence interval = 1.030-1.330). However, obesity-related variables, dietary consumption, and odds of being obese did not differ according to sleep duration for postmenopausal women. The findings suggest that the increased risk for obesity and consumption of dietary carbohydrate-rich foods with short sleep duration appeared to disappear after menopause in Korean women.

AB  - Till now, no evidence illustrates the prevalence and predictors of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) in rural areas of China. The objective of this study was, firstly, to examine the prevalence of MHO in rural areas of China, and identify contributing determinants of MHO, Secondly, to comprehensively investigate to the different characteristics between MHO and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of 2037 participants with obesity in rural Liaoning Province during 2012–2013. Obesity was defined as BMI ?28 kg/m2and metabolically healthy was defined as not having the metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of MHO was 23.1%, and significantly decreased with advancing age in female group. However there was no significant tendency with advancing age in male group. Independent determinant factors for MHO were age <55 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.659;p = .001), non-current smoking (OR 1.397;p = .038), pre-menopause (OR 1.648;p = .030) and non-hyperuricemia (OR 2.317;p < .001), whereas race, gender, diet score, current drinking, marriage, sleep duration, hyperhomocysteinemia, levels of physical activity, annual income and educational status were not significant contributors. In conclusion, we found that age <55 years, non-current smoking, pre-menopause and non-hyperuricemia were identified as independent determinant factors for MHO in this population.

AB  - Background: Limited evidence exists to inform physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior guidelines for older people, especially women. Rigorous evidence on the amounts, intensities, and movement patterns associated with better health in later life is needed.Methods/design: The Objective PA and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) Study is an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Program that examines associations of accelerometer-assessed PA and sedentary behavior with cardiovascular and fall events. Between 2012 and 2014, 7048 women aged 63-99 were provided with an ActiGraph GT3X+ (Pensacola, Florida) triaxial accelerometer, a sleep log, and an OPACH PA Questionnaire; 6489 have accelerometer data. Most women were in their 70s (40%) or 80s (46%), while approximately 10% were in their 60s and 4% were age 90 years or older. Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic/Latina women comprise half of the cohort. Follow-up includes 1-year of falls surveillance with monthly calendars and telephone interviews of fallers, and annual follow-up for outcomes with adjudication of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events through 2020. Over 63,600 months of calendar pages were returned by 5,776 women, who reported 5,980 falls. Telephone interviews were completed for 1,492 women to ascertain the circumstances, injuries and medical care associated with falling. The dataset contains extensive information on phenotypes related to healthy aging, including inflammatory and CVD biomarkers, breast and colon cancer, hip and other fractures, diabetes, and physical disability.Discussion: This paper describes the study design, methods, and baseline data for a diverse cohort of postmenopausal women who wore accelerometers under free-living conditions as part of the OPACH Study. By using accelerometers to collect more precise and complete data on PA and sedentary behavior in a large cohort of older women, this study will contribute crucial new evidence about how much, how vigorous, and what patterns of PA are necessary to maintain optimal cardiovascular health and to avoid falls in later life.Clinical Trials Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00000611 .

AB  - Background: Despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment have significantly improved survival rates, patients post-treatment-related health needs are often not adequately addressed by current health services. The aim of the Women's Wellness after Cancer Program (WWACP), which is a digitised multimodal lifestyle intervention, is to enhance health-related quality of life in women previously treated for blood, breast and gynaecological cancers.Methods: A single-blinded, multi-centre randomized controlled trial recruited a total of 351 women within 24 months of completion of chemotherapy (primary or adjuvant) and/or radiotherapy. Women were randomly assigned to either usual care or intervention using computer-generated permuted-block randomisation. The intervention comprises an evidence-based interactive iBook and journal, web interface, and virtual health consultations by an experienced cancer nurse trained in the delivery of the WWACP. The 12 week intervention focuses on evidence-based health education and health promotion after a cancer diagnosis. Components are drawn from the American Cancer Research Institute and the World Cancer Research Fund Guidelines (2010), incorporating promotion of physical activity, good diet, smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol intake, plus strategies for sleep and stress management. The program is based on Bandura's social cognitive theoretical framework. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). Secondary outcomes are menopausal symptoms as assessed by Greene Climacteric Scale; physical activity elicited with the Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF); sleep measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; habitual dietary intake monitored with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ); alcohol intake and tobacco use measured by the Australian Health Survey and anthropometric measures including height, weight and waist-to-hip ratio. All participants were assessed with these measures at baseline (at the start of the intervention), 12 weeks (at completion of the intervention), and 24 weeks (to determine the level of sustained behaviour change). Further, a simultaneous cost-effectiveness evaluation will consider if the WWACP provides value for money and will be reported separately.Discussion: Women treated for blood, breast and gynaecological cancers demonstrate increasingly good survival rates. However, they experience residual health problems that are potentially modifiable through behavioural lifestyle interventions such as the WWACP.Trial Registration: The protocol for this study was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Trial ID: ACTRN12614000800628 , July 28, 2014.

AB  - Case: Kristen is a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome (DS) who was seen urgently with concerns of cognitive and developmental regression including loss of language, social, and toileting skills. The evaluation in the DS clinic focused on potential medical diagnoses including atlantoaxial joint instability, vitamin deficiency, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and seizures. A comprehensive medical evaluation yielded only a finding of moderate OSA. A reactive depression was considered in association with several psychosocial factors including moving homes, entering puberty/onset of menses, and classroom change from an integrated setting to a self- contained classroom comprising unfamiliar peers with behavior challenges.Urgent referrals for psychological and psychiatric evaluations were initiated. Neuropsychological testing did not suggest true regression in cognitive, language, and academic skills, although decreases in motivation and performance were noted with a reaction to stress and multiple environmental changes as a potential causative factor. Psychiatry consultation supported this finding in that psychosocial stress temporally correlated with Kristen's regression in skills.Working collaboratively, the team determined that Kristen's presentation was consistent with a reactive form of depression (DSM-IV-TR: depressive disorder, not otherwise specified). Kristen's presentation was exacerbated by salient environmental stress and sleep apnea, rather than a cognitive regression associated with a medical cause. Treatment consisted of an antidepressant medication, continuous positive airway pressure for OSA, and increased psychosocial supports. Her school initiated a change in classroom placement. With this multimodal approach to evaluation and intervention, Kristen steadily improved and she returned to her baseline function.

AB  - The development of pain is common in midlife, resulting in increased health care utilization and costs. The aim of this study was to determine the longitudinal trajectory of overall bodily pain among women during the transition between the reproductive years and menopause. We conducted analyses on a community-based, longitudinal cohort of women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. One thousand four hundred ninety-five women met inclusion criteria, including: 1) defined date of the final menstrual period (FMP), and 2) complete data on Short Form-36 bodily pain. The primary exposure was time to/from the FMP. The primary outcome was the rate of change in Short Form-36 bodily pain, measured on a scale of 0 to 100 with 100 being the most severe pain. We performed within-person trajectory analyses using piecewise regression following nonparametric modeling of functional forms. Mean bodily pain score at the time of the FMP was 29. Mean bodily pain increased at a rate of .26 per year during the transmenopause (the interval spanning 4.5 years before the FMP through .5 years after the FMP), and decreased at a rate of .23 per year after that. Depression and sleep problems were associated with greater increases in pain during the late reproductive years, whereas abdominal cramps at baseline predicted greater decreases in pain during the late reproductive years.Perspective: This article shows that bodily pain increases during the transmenopause and then diminishes during postmenopause. These differences may reflect differences in underlying mechanisms of pain in the 2 periods. Although mean changes were small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful, the magnitude of change varied across subgroups of women.

AB  - Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of equol and resveratrol supplementation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in otherwise healthy menopausal women with hot flashes, anxiety and depressive symptoms.Methods: Sixty recently menopausal women aged 50-55 years were randomized in a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial to receive 200mg of fermented soy containing 10mg of equol and 25mg of resveratrol (1 tablet/day). The primary outcome was the change in score on the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), used to evaluate the severity of age-/menopause-related complaints. Additional outcome measures included the subject-reported score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), which was used specifically to assess sleep quality.Results: The symptoms assessed by the MRS improved during treatment in the active group. Comparison between placebo and treatment groups revealed statistically significant improvement in particular for dryness of vagina (-85.7%) (p<0.001), heart discomfort (-78.8%; p<0.001) and sexual problems (-73.3%; p<0.001). On the HAM-D significant improvements at week 12 were seen in work and activities (-94.1%) (p<0.001). Subjects treated with equol and resveratrol also had significant differences in the sleep domain of the NHP (p<0.001).Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with equol and resveratrol may improve menopause-related quality of life in healthy women.

AB  - Objective: Menopause is widely believed to be an established cause of sleep disorders, but evidence for this theory is inconclusive. Attributing any sleep problem to normal processes of menopause may lead to underdiagnosis of treatable sleep disorders in midlife women. This study uses detailed longitudinal data on sleep and menopausal health from participants in the Sleep in Midlife Women Study to investigate whether risk and severity of sleep-disordered breathing increase with progression through menopause, accounting for changes in age and body habitus.Methods: A total of 219 women aged 38 to 62 years were recruited from participants in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. Menopause status was determined from daily diaries in which participants reported menstrual flow, hot flashes, and use of hormonal medications. Each participant underwent in-home polysomnography studies every 6 months, to measure the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (N = 1,667 studies). Linear models with empirical standard errors were fit for logarithm of AHI on menopause status and years in menopause, adjusting for age, body mass index, waist girth, and neck girth.Results: Compared with women in premenopause, AHI was 21% higher among participants in perimenopause (95% CI, -4 to 54), 31% higher among participants in postmenopause (95% CI, 2-68), and 41% higher among participants whose menopausal stage could not be distinguished between peri- and postmenopause (95% CI, 8-82). Among women who had begun perimenopause, each additional year in menopause was associated with 4% greater AHI (95% CI, 2-6).Conclusions: Progression through menopause is associated with greater sleep-disordered breathing severity. This association is independent of aging and changes in body habitus.

AB  - The effectiveness for vasomotor symptoms and sleep disorders plus the long-term safety of a nutraceutical combination of agnus-castus and magnolia extracts combined with soy isoflavones (SI) and lactobacilli were assessed in postmenopausal women. A controlled study was carried out in menopausal women comparing this nutraceutical combination (ESP group) with a formulation containing isoflavones alone (C group) at the dosage recommended. The Kuppermann index, The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) were determined at baseline, three, six and 12 months. Endometrial thickness, mammary density and liver function were evaluated at baseline and after 12 months. One hundred and eighty women were enrolled in the study (100 in the ESP group and 80 in the C group). At the end of the treatment, mammary density, endometrial thickness, and hepatic function did not show substantial differences between groups. The Kuppermann index and particularly the tendency for hot flashes progressively and significantly decreased in frequency and severity during ESP versus C treatment. At the same time, a significant increase in sleep quality and psychophysical wellness parameters was observed in the ESP versus C groups. No adverse events were observed. Agnus-castus and magnolia, combined with SI + lactobacilli, can effectively and safely be used in symptomatic postmenopausal women, mainly when quality of sleep is the most disturbing complaint. The endometrium, mammary glands and liver function were unaffected after 12 months of treatment.

AB  - Background Menstrual migraine is a highly prevalent disorder among adult women, resulting in disability and loss of quality of life. Some studies have reported menstrual cycle synchrony among women living together. No study has reported whether there may also be a higher prevalence of menstrual migraine among these women. Thus, they reported here the prevalence of menstrual migraine in a group of women living together compared with a control group of women living alone, and discussed the possible factors involved. Methods The study was conducted on female university students aged 18-30 years with a diagnosis of migraine according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders III, beta appendix criteria. The subjects were divided into a group of women who lived together with two or more other students and a control group of age-matched students who lived alone, interviewed with a specific questionnaire and assessed for 3 months by means of a paper pain diary. The data evaluated included frequency of headache, presence of menstrual migraine, intensity of headache, medications used including contraceptives, and triggering factors such as diet, sleep deprivation, and stress. The menstrual data and data related to migraine were also investigated in the roommates. Results A higher occurrence of menstrual migraine among women living together (9, 50%) compared with women living alone (3, 16.7%) ( P = .03) was detected. After binary logistic regression analysis, this finding was not related to the main influencing factors detected, that is, use of a contraceptive, test stress, or sleep deprivation ( P = .03, adjusted odds ratio: 7.87; 1.23-50.36). These women also showed menstrual cycle synchrony with their roommates (8, 44.4%) and the presence of headache crises during the menstruation of their colleagues (11, 61.1%). Conclusion The present study detected a higher occurrence of menstrual migraine among women who lived together. Since there was no previous description of this topic in the literature, it was believed that the present study could represent a step toward more elaborate investigations of this complex topic.

AB  - Prior to and following breast cancer treatment women experience multiple co-occurring menopausal-related symptoms. The purposes of this dissertation research were: to evaluate for the differences in multiple dimensions of menopausal-related symptoms between pre- and postmenopausal women prior to and at 12 months following breast cancer surgery; to evaluate for differences in the number and types of menopausal-related symptom clusters at both time points using ratings of occurrence and severity; and to evaluate for changes in these symptom clusters over time. Menopausal-related symptoms were evaluated using the Menopausal Symptoms Scale (MSS). Of the 312 women enrolled prior to surgery, 37.4% were premenopausal and 62.6% were postmenopausal. In the multivariate analysis, premenopausal patients reported higher occurrence rates for urinary frequency (p=.006) and reported lower occurrence rates for joint pain/stiffness (p=.011), difficulty falling asleep (p=.025), and vaginal dryness (p=.002). A significant interaction was found between age and menopausal status for hot flashes (p=.002), wake during the night (p=.025), and headache (.040). Of the 327 women with breast cancer who completed the 12-month assessment, 35.2% were premenopausal and 64.8% were postmenopausal prior to surgery. In the conditional models that evaluated seven symptoms (i.e., hot flashes, night sweats, depression, daytime sweats, joint pain or stiffness, wake during the night, numbness or tingling), for which significant interactions were found between age and menopausal status, the differences in symptom occurrence rates between pre- and postmenopausal patients depended on their age. Of the 398 women evaluated for symptom clusters, the mean number of symptoms was 13.2 +/- 8.5 at enrollment and 10.9 +/- 8.2 at 12 months after surgery. Using exploratory factor analysis, eight distinct symptom clusters were identified prior to and at 12 months following surgery using occurrence and severity. Only two symptom clusters (i.e., pain/discomfort and hormonal) were relatively stable across both dimensions and time points and two symptom clusters were relatively stable across both dimensions either prior to surgery (i.e., sleep/psychological/cognitive) or at 12 months after surgery (i.e., sleep). The other four clusters (i.e., irritability, psychological/cognitive, cognitive, psychological) were identified at one time point using a single dimension.

AB  - Objective: Women's risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases substantially during and after the menopausal transition, when depression risk is also elevated, raising the possibility that estrogen withdrawal contributes to OSA vulnerability, in turn contributing to mood disturbance. We examined the association between estradiol levels and OSA in depressed peri- and postmenopausal women.Methods: Thirty depressed peri-/postmenopausal women (mean body mass index [BMI] 30.82 kg/m) without known OSA completed routine polysomnography concurrent with serum estradiol levels. Estradiol in women with apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) ≥15 indicating moderate-to-severe OSA was compared against those with AHI less than 15 using logistic regression adjusting for age and BMI.Results: Thirteen women (43%) had AHI ≥15 (median AHI 21.6). Estradiol levels were lower (P = 0.02) in those with OSA (median 19, interquartile range 9-25 pg/mL) than without OSA (median 29, interquartile range 19-66 pg/mL). On univariate analysis, higher estradiol was associated with reduced odds of OSA (odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99, P = 0.04). After adjusting for age and BMI, estradiol levels remained associated with lower odds of OSA (odds ratio 0.90), but the association was no longer statistically significant (95% CI 0.76-1.05, P = 0.18). Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores did not differ between those with and without OSA.Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that, in addition to higher BMI and age, lower estradiol may be associated with increased OSA risk in depressed women during the peri- and postmenopause, raising the possibility that estradiol withdrawal associated with menopause influences upper-airway patency in women.

AB  - The transition due to immigration from one country to another country (referred to as immigration transition henceforth) is inherently stressful, placing an additional dimension of stress to midlife women in the menopausal transition. However, few studies have examined the association of immigration to sleep-related symptoms experienced by midlife women in the menopausal transition. The authors’ purpose for this study was to explore the associations of immigration to sleep-related symptoms among four major racial/ethnic groups of 1,054 midlife women in the United States. This was a secondary analysis of data from two national surveys that were collected from 2005 to 2013. The instruments included questions on background characteristics, health and menopausal status, immigration transition, and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women. The data were analyzed usingt-tests, chi-square tests, correlation analyses, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Immigrants reported fewer total numbers of and lower total severity scores of sleep-related symptoms than non-immigrants (p < .01). Yet, when background characteristics and health and menopausal status were controlled, self-reported racial/ethnic identity was the only significant factor associated with sleep-related symptoms (ΔR2 = 0.02,p < .01). Health-care providers need to consider self-reported racial/ethnic identity as a factor significantly related to sleep-related symptoms during the menopausal transition.

AB  - Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a complex clinical syndrome that includes many symptoms beyond chronic pain. The studies that have addressed brain morphometry in FMS have had very heterogeneous results. Thus, the question of which specific FMS symptoms and clinical features-pain, but also psychological distress, sleep-related problems, health status, and medication intake-impact on brain morphometry remains open. Here, we wanted to determine if brain changes in FMS are "symptom-related" more than "diagnostic-related". We performed an observational study of 46 premenopausal women (23 FMS patients and 23 age-matched healthy participants). Magnetic resonance images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and subcortical segmentation. We used multiple regression models to assess the associations between total and local brain volumes and FMS clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we calculated associations between subcortical structures' shapes and volumes and FMS clinical characteristics. Larger psychological distress, anxiety, and sleepiness, and higher analgesic consumption accounted for 38 % of FMS patients' smaller total gray matter volume (GMV). For both groups, local decrements of GMV in the medial orbitofrontal cortex were associated to larger psychological distress. Local increases of GMV were positively related to pain scores (superior frontal gyrus), psychological distress (cerebellum), anxiety (medial orbitofrontal cortex), and sleepiness (frontal superior medial cortex). FMS clinical characteristics were also associated to deformations in subcortical structures and volumes changes. This study reveals that total and local GMV changes in FMS go beyond the traditional "pain matrix" alterations. We demonstrated that brain morphology is altered by pain, but also by clinical characteristics that define the FMS experience.

AB  - Circadian rhythm is an internal biological clock which initiates and monitors various physiological processes with a fixed time-related schedule. The master circadian pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. The circadian clock undergoes significant changes throughout the life span, at both the physiological and molecular levels. This cyclical physiological process, which is very complex and multifactorial, may be associated with metabolic alterations, atherosclerosis, impaired cognition, mood disturbances and even development of cancer. Sex differences do exist, and the well-known sleep disturbances associated with menopause are a good example. Circadian rhythm was detected in the daily pattern of hot flushes, with a peak in the afternoons. Endogenous secretion of melatonin decreases with aging across genders, and, among women, menopause is associated with a significant reduction of melatonin levels, affecting sleep. Although it might seem that hot flushes and melatonin secretion are likely related, there are not enough data to support such a hypothesis.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the course of depression in midlife women. This study aims to identify factors that distinguish risk factors for persistent or recurrent depression from those of a milder course across 13-years of follow-up.Methods: 297 Black and White premenopausal women aged 42-52 were enrolled at the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Pittsburgh site. Psychiatric interviews obtained information on lifetime psychiatric diagnoses at baseline and occurrences of depression annually. We identified four depression patterns: 91(31%) had Persistent/recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), 27(9%) Single Episode MDD, 35(12%) Minor Depression (minD) only, 144(48%) No Depression. We compared baseline risk factors for the Persistent/recurrent MDD group with each of the other three.Results: A lifetime history of major or minor depression (p-values =.001-.08) and 2+ very upsetting life events in the previous year (p-values=.003-.04) were more likely to be reported by women in the Persistent/recurrent group than in the other three. The Persistent/recurrent group was more likely to report a family history of depression (p=.03) than the MinD group, and to report current sleep problems (p=.002) at baseline than the Single Episode MDD group.Limitations: Small numbers of women with minD or a Single Episode MDD. Childhood maltreatment and family depression history were retrospectively reported.Conclusions: A Persistent/recurrent depression course is common during midlife. In addition to personal and family histories of depression, providers of midlife health care should recognize that current sleep problems and recent very upsetting events are strong risk factors for a pernicious depression course.

AB  - Objective: This follow-up study aimed to evaluate risk factors for menopausal sleep disturbances already identifiable before menopause.Methods: At baseline, all 81 women were premenopausal. At year-five follow-up, 27 of the women were premenopausal, 40 postmenopausal, and 14 postmenopausal and using hormone therapy. We used the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire to study sleep; additional questionnaires evaluated risk factors for sleep impairment.Results: Sleep quality differed only marginally between the groups. The following baseline variables were associated with impaired sleep quality at follow-up: depressive symptoms increased the risk of nocturnal awakenings (OR 1.16 (95%CI 1.02-1.32), p=0.025), morning tiredness (OR 1.22 (95%CI 1.06-1.40), p=0.007), daytime tiredness (OR 1.24 (95%CI 1.06-1.44), p=0.007) and propensity to fall asleep during work or leisure time (OR 1.18 (95%CI 1.01-1.37), p=0.036). Personal crises increased the risk of longer sleep latency (OR 5.46 (95%CI 1.13-26.32), p=0.035) and of propensity to fall asleep when not active (OR 5.41 (95%CI 1.42-20.83), p=0.014). Use of medications affecting the CNS increased the risk of worse general sleep quality (OR 11.44 (95% CI 1.07-121.79), p=0.044). Perceived impaired general health (OR 2.87 (95%CI 1.04-7.94), p=0.043) and frequent night sweats (OR 10.50 (95%CI 2.25-49.01), p=0.003) increased the risk of difficulty falling asleep.Conclusions: Various premenopausal health-related factors seem to predict poor sleep in menopausal transition. Menopause itself appears to have only minor effects. Thus, it is essential to identify high-risk women to allow timely interventions that may prevent the development of sleep disturbances at menopause.

AB  - Objective: Many women complain of forgetfulness during the menopausal transition. This study aimed to examine women's subjective perception of memory and their objective memory performance across the menopausal transition.Methods: One hundred thirty women, aged 40 to 60 years were recruited from outpatient Menopause and Gynaecological clinics at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne. Women were divided into menopausal stage groups according to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria based on menstrual patterns. All women completed self-report measures of depressive, anxiety, vasomotor, and sleep symptoms; attitude to menopause; and various aspects of memory, including memory contentment, frequency of forgetting, sense of control over memory, and use of memory strategies. Women also completed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation assessing memory and executive function.Results: Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment showed no difference between premenopausal (n = 36), perimenopausal (n = 54), and postmenopausal (n = 40) groups in performance on memory and executive tasks. Perimenopausal women, however, reported significantly more frequent forgetting (η = 0.09, P < 0.01) and less contentment with their memory (η = 0.08, P < 0.01) than pre- and postmenopausal women.Conclusions: Although no impairment was observed in neuropsychological performance, when compared with pre- and postmenopausal women, perimenopausal women were more likely to be dissatisfied with their memory. During the menopausal transition women with a more negative attitude to menopause and more intense depressive, anxiety, vasomotor, and sleep symptoms are more vulnerable to feeling less content with their memory.

AB  - Reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL), depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality are important health issues among postmenopausal women and may be associated with low vitamin D status. Overweight postmenopausal women, with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] 10-32ng/m, were recruited in Seattle, WA (2010-2012) and randomly assigned to 12months of weight loss +2000IU oral vitamin D3/day or weight loss+daily placebo. The weight-loss program included a reduced-calorie diet and 225min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity. Eight subscales of HRQOL were assessed by the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Mean 12-month changes in HRQOL, depressive symptoms and sleep quality were compared between groups (intent-to-treat) using generalized estimating equations. Compared to placebo, women receiving vitamin D did not experience any significant change in depressive symptoms (p=0.78), HRQOL subscales (all p>0.05), or overall sleep quality (p=0.21). However, a greater magnitude of change in serum 25(OH)D was associated with an increased need to take medications to sleep (ptrend=0.01) and overall worse sleep quality (ptrend<0.01). Women who became vitamin D replete (≥32ng/mL) also showed a deterioration in total PSQI sleep quality score compared to women who remained <32ng/mL despite supplementation, even after adjusting for relevant covariates (Non-Replete: -5.7% vs. Replete: +6.2%, p<0.01). Vitamin D supplementation of 2000IU/d may result in overall worse sleep quality for postmenopausal women with low circulating vitamin D undergoing weight loss.

AB  - Background: Menopausal symptoms are common and may be particularly severe in younger women who undergo treatment-induced menopause. Medications to reduce menopausal symptoms are either contra-indicated or have bothersome side effects. Previous studies have demonstrated that face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer. However, compliance with face-to-face CBT programs can be problematic. A promising approach is to use the Internet to make this form of CBT more accessible and feasible for patients. This study is evaluating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an Internet-based CBT program, with or without therapist guidance, in alleviating or reducing the severity of menopausal symptoms.Methods/design: In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial we are evaluating the efficacy of two Internet-based CBT programs in alleviating or reducing the impact of menopausal symptoms, and particularly hot flushes and night sweats, in breast cancer survivors who have experienced a treatment-induced menopause. Secondary outcomes include sexual functioning, sleep quality, hot flush frequency, psychological distress, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. We will recruit 248 women who will be randomized to either a therapist guided or a self-management version of the 6-week Internet-based CBT program, or to a usual care, waiting list control group. Self-administered questionnaires are completed at baseline (T0), and at 10 weeks (T1) and 24 weeks (T2) post-randomization.Discussion: Internet-based CBT is a potentially useful treatment for reducing menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. This study will provide evidence on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of such an Internet-based CBT program, with or without therapist support. If demonstrated to be efficacious and cost-effective, the availability of such structured supportive intervention programs will be a welcome addition to standard medical treatment offered to cancer patients with treatment-induced menopause.Trial Registration: The study is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on January 26th 2016 ( NCT02672189 ).

AB  - Background. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest cause of female infertility. Visceral obesity and insulin resistance are key pathophysiological mechanisms behind PCOS. Women suffering from this syndrome and infertility often seek bariatric surgery hoping that they would be able to conceive postoperatively. Objective. At present, there is no consensus on the role of bariatric surgery in the management of PCOS-associated infertility within the medical community, making it difficult to give specific advice to these women, so a review of the literature was necessary. Results. A detailed review of the literature was performed. Only 6 manuscripts were relevant and contained quantitative data. They demonstrated that bariatric surgery results in postoperative conception rates varying from 33% to 100%. Surgery is also associated with amelioration of menstrual irregularities, hormonal abnormalities, and hirsutism that are associated with PCOS. These studies were retrospective and only had a small number of participants with infertility. Conclusions. Bariatric surgery has been shown to conclusively improve life expectancy, quality of life, and comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. However, further research is required to identify whether weight loss surgery results in significant improvement in fertility of women with PCOS and to investigate which operation has the best results.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the time course of effect with conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene (CE/BZA) in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women in five phase 3 trials.Methods: This post hoc analysis identified when CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg and CE 0.625 mg/BZA 20 mg first achieved a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) versus placebo in individual trials and the duration the difference persisted for prespecified efficacy endpoints.Results: CE/BZA significantly reduced hot flush frequency beginning at weeks 2 to 4 and severity at weeks 3 to 6; benefits were maintained through month 24. Significant improvements in lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and femoral trochanter bone mineral density were evident at month 6 or 12 and changes in bone turnover markers at month 3 or 6; benefits were maintained throughout the studies (12 or 24 mo). In symptomatic women with less than 5% vaginal superficial cells at baseline, vaginal maturation index was significantly improved by week 4. Reductions in parabasal cells were maintained throughout the studies (through months 3 and 24), but superficial cell count changes persisted only with the higher CE/BZA dose. Menopause-Specific Quality of Life total and vasomotor domain scores were improved at all assessments, from months 3 through 24. Some measures of sleep, especially quality and time to fall asleep, improved during weeks 4 to 8 and were maintained in a majority of weeks thereafter.Conclusions: In the context of studies designed primarily to evaluate efficacy at final study endpoints, both doses of CE/BZA achieved significance versus placebo at early assessments for most outcomes, and benefits were well maintained.

AB  - Objective: Assess effects of once-daily, extended-release oxybutynin chloride on frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms in healthy, postmenopausal symptomatic women.Methods: A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial randomized naturally postmenopausal women experiencing at least seven moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms daily to oxybutynin 15 mg once daily (n = 73) or placebo (n = 75). Co-primary outcomes were the change from baseline to week 12 in the frequency and severity of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms.Results: Significant reductions in both frequency and severity of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms in women who received oxybutynin compared with placebo were observed at all weeks of treatment (P ≤ 0.007, all time points) through week 12. Mean changes in frequency in the oxybutynin and placebo groups were -9.48 and -4.69 episodes/d, respectively, at week 12. Mean changes in severity (scale 0-3) in the oxybutynin and placebo groups were -1.27 and -0.30, respectively, at week 12. At the end of treatment, 73% of women in the oxybutynin group and 26.1% in the placebo group rated symptom improvement "much better" (P ≤ 0.001). Women treated with oxybutynin showed significant improvement in sleep quality, sleep disturbance, and the global sleep index on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P ≤ 0.023). Dry mouth was reported by 52.1% of participants given oxybutynin and 5.3% of participants given placebo, leading to discontinuation of oxybutynin in 6.8% of participants.Conclusions: Oxybutynin is an effective, nonhormonal therapy for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Background and Aim: Cancer is a devastating chronic disease that affects all aspects of life. Lifestyle is an important factor which is related with higher incidence of breast cancer, and it can be modified by education. Investigation of the role of lifestyle on the incidence of cancer in women needs special attention. This study aimed to assess the lifestyle in women with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive study. The sample was 60 patients admitted in oncology ward of Imam Sajad Hospital, Ramsar for chemotherapy in 2015. Lifestyle in patients assessed by lifestyles questionnaire (LSQ). Data analyzed by descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and SPSS software. Results: The lifestyle scores in five cases (8.33%) were undesirable, in 47 cases (78.33%) were relatively desirable, and eight cases (13.34%) had a desirable level of lifestyle. The chip-square test showed there was not significant relationship between the lifestyle and the elapsed time of cancer diagnosis, age, job, estrogen & progesterone receptor and menopause on subjects. (P>0.05) The relationship between lifestyle and education level, marital status, HER-2 oncogenes were significant (P<0.05). The average scores of physical activity and stress were lower than average level but average scores of feeding and opioid consumption were higher than the average level. Conclusion: Although our study results showed better lifestyle scores than previous studies, but they were significantly lower than ideal levels. With proper counseling and interventions (e.g. teaching relaxation techniques, appropriate physical activity, healthy diet, maintaining proper sleep patterns, and stress management) the lifestyle of patients can be promoted.

AB  - Introduction: The authors present the first experience in neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations using an MR compatible incubator (INC) at the Institute of Mother and Child.Material and Methods: Forty-nine examinations of 47 newborns (20 girls, 27 boys) were performed using the GE Signa HDxt 1.5T system and INC Nomag IC 1.5. Demographic data, anesthetic methods and MRI findings in the INC in comparison with previously performed imaging were analyzed.Results: Thirty-two neonates were prematurely born (68.1%) at gestational age 23-37 weeks, mean: 29.9 weeks. They were examined at 26 weeks postmenstrual age to 1 month corrected age, mean: 37.5 weeks. Body weight of newborns on the study day was 600-4300 g, mean: 2724 g. Seventeen (34.7%) children were examined in physiological sleep, 32 (65.3%) anesthetized. In none of them did anesthesiological complications or disease worsening occur. In 43 (91.5%) children brain MRI was performed, in 4 (8.5%) MRI of the spinal cord and canal and of the abdomen/pelvis. In children prenatally examined by MRI, the INC provided new diagnostic information in 5 (83.3%) cases, in neonates studied after birth by ultrasound in 32 (82%). Magnetic resonance imaging in the INC did not entail additional knowledge in 9 (18.7%) cases.Conclusions: The INC enables MRI in preterm newborns and those with low/extremely low body weight. These studies are necessary to assess the extent of changes in the central nervous system and other organs. Incubator coils, designed specifically for neonates, allow more accurate diagnosis than previously used coils for adults. MRI results allow one to determine prognosis, for more accurate planning of diagnostics, helping to make appropriate therapeutic decisions.

AB  - Context: Women are at increased risk for mood disturbance during the menopause transition. Hot flashes (HFs), sleep disruption, and fluctuating estradiol levels correlate with menopause-associated depression but co-occur, making cause and effect relationships difficult to disentangle.Objective: Using a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) experimental model, we investigated whether depressive symptoms are associated with HFs and/or are explained by concomitant sleep fragmentation in the absence of estradiol fluctuation.Design and Intervention: Depressive symptoms, objective polysomnographic sleep parameters, subjective sleep quality, serum estradiol, and HFs were assessed before and 4 weeks after open-label depot GnRHa (leuprolide 3.75-mg) administration.Setting: Academic medical center.Participants: Twenty-nine healthy nondepressed premenopausal volunteers (mean age, 27.3 years).Results: Serum estradiol was rapidly and uniformly suppressed. HFs developed in 69% of the subjects. On univariate analysis, worsening of mood was predicted by increases in time in light sleep (stage N1), number of transitions to wake, non-REM arousals, subjective sleep quality, and reductions in perceived sleep efficiency (all P < .045), as well as the number of nighttime (P = .006), but not daytime (P = .28), HFs reported. In adjusted models, the number of nighttime HFs reported, increases in non-REM arousals, time in stage N1, transitions to wake, and reduced sleep quality remained significant predictors of mood deterioration (P ≤ .05).Conclusions: Depressive symptoms emerged after estradiol withdrawal in association with objectively and subjectively measured sleep disturbance and the number of nighttime, but not daytime, HFs reported. Results suggest that sleep disruption and perceived nighttime HFs both contribute to vulnerability to menopause-associated depressive symptoms in hypoestrogenic women.

AB  - Objective: This study characterizes and quantifies the relationship of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause with menopause-specific quality of life (MSQOL) and sleep parameters to help predict treatment outcomes and inform treatment decision-making.Methods: Data were derived from a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial that evaluated effects of two doses of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene on VMS in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women (N = 318, mean age = 53.39) experiencing at least seven moderate to severe hot flushes (HFs) per day or at least 50 per week. Repeated measures models were used to determine relationships between HF frequency and severity and outcomes on the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Study sleep scale. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check assumptions of linearity between VMS and outcomes.Results: Frequency and severity of HFs showed approximately linear relationships with MSQOL and sleep parameters. Sensitivity analyses supported assumptions of linearity. The largest changes associated with a reduction of five HFs and a 0.5-point decrease in severity occurred in the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life vasomotor functioning domain (0.78 for number of HFs and 0.98 for severity) and the Medical Outcomes Study sleep disturbance (7.38 and 4.86) and sleep adequacy (-5.60 and -4.66) domains and the two overall sleep problems indices (SPI: 5.17 and 3.63; SPII: 5.82 and 3.83).Conclusions: Frequency and severity of HFs have an approximately linear relationship with MSQOL and sleep parameters-that is, improvements in HFs are associated with improvements in MSQOL and sleep. Such relationships may enable clinicians to predict changes in sleep and MSQOL expected from various VMS treatments.

AB  - It is estimated that up to 80% of women experience symptoms related to declining estrogen levels that occur with menopause. The most common bothersome symptoms reported by women during and after this transition are vasomotor symptoms, which can include hot flashes, flushing, night sweats, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms are the most common reason women seek care during menopause. Until recently, the mainstay of treatment and symptom relief has been estrogen supplementation. In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved paroxetine, a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as the first nonhormonal treatment for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms of menopause. This article provides an overview of the use of paroxetine to treat vasomotor symptoms of menopause, including potential adverse reactions, special considerations for use, and implications for nursing practice.

AB  - Background: The Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V) was conducted in 2012, and the results showed that the overall prevalence o adult obesity (BMI ≥ 25kg/m2) was 32.6 % (36.3 % in men and 28.0 % in women). A more recent study revealed that positional sleep apnea was more common in the patients with mild Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the positional tendency of OSA patients was affected by central obesity. Such the factors as the severity of OSA, the weight, the waist size and the waist to hip ratio (WHR) are also relared ro the positional tendency Method: We analyzed the polymorphism of the genes LEPR, ADIPOQ and PPARy in 907 postmenopausal women to demonstrate the relationship between genetic variants of obesity-related genes and the components of Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in postmenopausal women. Results: The results showed that the weight levels (Overweight and obesity) were higher in the GT+TT genotype of rs 1501299 of ADIPOQ gene and the GC+CC genotypes of rs8179183 of LEPR gene. Waist sizes and waist to hip ratios (WHR) were higher in the GG genotype of rs8179183 of LEPR gene. The prevalence of Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was higher in the AG+GG genotype o rs2938392 of PPARy gene and the GC+CC genotype of rs8179183 of LEPR gene. Conclusions: The study found that several SNPs of adiposity-related genes were associated with Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as obesity. This association would provide a possible genomic linkage of the OSA in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Question In perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with insomnia and hot flashes, what is the relative efficacy of telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and telephone-based menopause education control (MEC) for reducing insomnia? Methods Design Randomized controlled trial (RCT). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01936441. Allocation {Concealed}*.† Blinding Blinded† (data collectors). Follow-up period 24 weeks. Setting MsFlash research network in western Washington State, USA. Patients 106 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women 40 to 65 years of age (mean age 55 y) who had significant insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] score ≥ 12) and ≥ 2 hot flashes/d for the past 2 weeks. Exclusion criteria included primary sleep disorder or major illness interfering with sleep, routine use of prescription sleep medication, consumption of > 3 alcoholic drinks/d, or shift work. Intervention CBT-I (n = 53) or MEC (n = 53), each of which comprised six 20- to 30-minute telephone sessions led by 2 female coaches over 8 weeks. CBT-I included information about age-related sleep changes, sleep hygiene, and stimulus control procedures; and teaching about cognitive techniques to reduce physiologic arousal and reduce unrealistic beliefs about sleep loss. Sleep windows were restricted to the average sleep time reported at baseline and extended by 15 minutes weekly when ≥ 85% sleep efficiency was achieved. MEC comprised general education and written information about women's health and quality of life, excluding information about CBT strategies for sleep. Outcomes Insomnia severity (ISI). Secondary outcome was Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score. Exploratory outcomes included no clinically significant insomnia {ISI}* and daily interference of hot flashes (Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale). Patient follow-up 83% at 8 weeks and 76% at 24 weeks (intention-to-treat analysis). Main results CBT-I reduced insomnia (on the ISI and PSQI) and increased the likelihood of no insomnia at 8 and 24 weeks compared with MEC (Table). CBT-I also reduced scores on the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale at 8 (P = 0.03) and 24 (P = 0.003) weeks compared with MEC. Conclusion In perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with insomnia and hot flashes, telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia reduced insomnia severity compared with telephone-based menopause education control.

AB  - Objectives. To review the contributions of the Nurses' Health Studies (NHSs) to the understanding of cardiovascular disease etiology in women. Methods. We performed a narrative review of the publications of the NHS and NHS II between 1976 and 2016. Results. Diets low intrans fat, saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, and sugar-sweetened beverages and rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and sources of unsaturated fats are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Healthy lifestyle choices include smoking avoidance, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body mass index, and moderate alcohol consumption. Adherence to a combination of these healthy diet and lifestyle behaviors may prevent most vascular events. Studies also covered oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormone therapy, shift work, sleep duration, psychosocial factors, and various biomarkers and genetic factors. Findings, such as the association of trans fat with cardiovascular disease, have helped shaped medical guidelines and government policies. Conclusions. The NHS has provided compelling evidence that the majority of vascular events may be prevented by avoiding smoking, participating in regular physical activity, maintaining normal body mass index, and eating a healthy diet.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a selective estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonist, Dr. Tagliaferri's Menopause Formula (MF102), to treat the symptoms of menopause. Methods: An open-label trial of MF102 taken for 12 weeks by 30 postmenopausal women aged 40-65 years, who experienced a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per day. The primary efficacy outcome was a change in the frequency of moderate to severe hot flushes from baseline to week 12. A change in the frequency of hot flushes that woke participants from their sleep from baseline to 12 weeks was a secondary endpoint. Lipid profile and endometrial thickness were also evaluated. Results: Thirty postmenopausal women with an average of nine moderate to severe hot flushes per day were treated with MF102 4 g/day; 27 participants completed the study. The median percent reduction in moderate to severe hot flushes was 71% ( p < 0.001). The median percent reduction in hot flushes that woke participants from their sleep was 54% ( p < 0.001). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and total cholesterol both declined significantly from baseline. There were no serious adverse events, reports of abnormal uterine bleeding, or significant changes in double-wall endometrial thickness. Conclusions: Treatment with MF102 resulted in a marked decrease in the frequency of moderate to severe hot flushes, was well-tolerated, and demonstrated no safety concerns.

AB  - Objective: Menopause can affect the physiological timing system, which could result in circadian rhythm changes and development of napping habits. Whether longtime napping in postmenopausal women is associated with cardiovascular disease is, however, still debated. The present study aims to investigate this association.Methods: We conducted a population-based study in 4,616 postmenopausal Chinese women. Information on sleep duration was self-reported. The Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score was calculated and used to identify participants at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).Results: Increased daytime napping hours were positively associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women, such as age, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting glucose, postload glucose, and hemoglobin A1C (all P for trend <0.05). The prevalence of high risk of CHD increased with daytime napping hours, and was 3.7%, 4.3%, and 6.9% in the no daytime napping group, the 0.1 to 1 hour group, and the more than 1 hour group, respectively (P for trend = 0.005). Compared with the no daytime napping group, postmenopausal women with daytime napping more than 1 hour had higher risk of CHD in both univariate (odds ratio 1.94, 95% CI, 1.29-2.95) and multivariate (odds ratio 1.61, 95% CI, 1.03-2.52) logistic regression analyses. No statistically significant association was detected between night sleeping hours and high risk of CHD in postmenopausal participants.Conclusions: Daytime napping is positively associated with estimated 10-year CHD risk in postmenopausal Chinese women.

AB  - No risk assessment tool is available for identifying high risk population of breast cancer (BCa) in Hong Kong. A case-control study including 918 BCa cases and 923 controls was used to develop the risk assessment model among Hong Kong Chinese women.Each participant received an in-depth interview to obtain their lifestyle and environmental risk factors. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) selection model was used to select the optimal risk factors (LASSO-model). A risk score system was constructed to evaluate the cumulative effects of selected factors. Bootstrap simulation was used to test the internal validation of the model. Model performance was evaluated by receiver-operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC).Age, number of parity, number of BCa cases in 1st-degree relatives, exposure to light at night, and sleep quality were the common risk factors for all women. Alcohol drinking was included for premenopausal women; body mass index, age at menarche, age at 1st give birth, breast feeding, using of oral contraceptive, hormone replacement treatment, and history of benign breast diseases were included for postmenopausal women. The AUCs were 0.640 (95% CI, 0.598-0.681) and 0.655 (95% CI, 0.621-0.653) for pre- and postmenopausal women, respectively. Further subgroup evaluation revealed that the model performance was better for women aged 50 to 70 years or ER-positive.This BCa risk assessment tool in Hong Kong Chinese women based on LASSO selection is promising, which shows a slightly higher discriminative accuracy than those developed in other populations.

AB  - BackgroundMedical marijuana alleviates a variety of symptoms, including those associated with menopause, such as insomnia, irritability, depression and joint pain. However, little work has addressed the use of marijuana in a population of menopausal women, or the role of menopausal women’s marijuana treatment expectancies in regard to consumption. We hypothesized that menopausal women who used marijuana would expect it to alleviate symptoms that have responded well to the plant in previous research. Based on the marijuana expectancy literature, we also hypothesized that links from menopause symptoms to marijuana use would arise via indirect paths through expectancies.MethodsMenopausal and post-menopausal women (N= 115) who endorsed lifetime marijuana use completed an online survey assessing their frequency of use, average intoxication – a proxy for quantity, menopause symptoms, and expectancies of relief from menopause symptoms.ResultsWomen expected marijuana to improve joint/muscle discomfort, irritability, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and hot flashes, but not sex problems, heart discomfort, exhaustion, vaginal dryness and bladder problems. Expectancies mediated the links between menopause symptoms and frequency of use. Average intoxication did not correlate with symptoms or expectations of relief. Symptoms, expectancies, and frequency of marijuana use were all independent of marijuana-related problems.ConclusionsParticularly as the population ages, increased research on how medical marijuana might help menopause symptoms without increasing marijuana-related problems could prove heuristic.

AB  - The effect of menstrual cycle phase on sleep has been studied for decades; however, individual differences in the associations between sleep and menstrual phase have not been well studied. In addition, the associations between changes in sleep and other physiological and psychological factors that vary as a function of menstrual phase have not been thoroughly assessed. This study explored individual differences in daily self-reports of difficulty sleeping across the menstrual cycle, as well as associations between daily changes in difficulty sleeping and psychological/vegetative and somatic symptoms. Participants ( n = 213 females, mean age = 21.29 ± 4.01 years) completed daily online questionnaires assessing` sleep, psychological and physical symptoms for two menstrual cycles. Two patterns of menstrual cycle-related self-reported difficulty sleeping emerged in addition to women who showed no cyclical change in self-reported difficulty sleeping: a perimenstrual increase and a mid-cycle increase. All psychological/vegetative symptoms and some of the somatic symptoms showed significant associations with self-reported difficulty sleeping. These findings highlight the importance of examining individual differences in sleep across the menstrual cycle and the significant contribution of a wide range of menstrual cycle-related psychological/vegetative and somatic symptoms.

AB  - ObjectiveSleep disturbances are one of the most common psycho-physiological issues among postmenopausal women. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of walking with a pedometer on the sleep quality of postmenopausal Iranian women. MethodsThis randomized, controlled trial was conducted on 112 women who were randomly assigned to two groups. The women in the intervention group (n = 56) were asked to walk with a pedometer each day for 12 weeks and to increase their walking distance by 500 steps per week. A sociodemographic instrument and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to collect data. Sleep quality was measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after intervention. The control group (n = 56) did not receive any intervention. ResultsAfter 12 weeks, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction improved to a significantly greater extent in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The total sleep quality score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (0.64 vs. 0.98,p = 0.001). ConclusionThis study showed that walking with a pedometer is an easy and cost-effective way to improve the quality of sleep among postmenopausal women. Use of this method in public health centers is recommended.

AB  - Objectives: Many middle-aged women are affected by sleep disturbance. We investigated how subjective insomnia is associated with objective sleep parameters and other background characteristics.Methods: This cross-sectional study used baseline data obtained from 95 women aged 40-59 years who participated in another study assessing the effects of a dietary supplement. Participants wore an actigraph unit for 3 days to collect information concerning physical activities and objective sleep parameters and were then evaluated for body composition, cardiovascular parameters, and menopausal symptoms including insomnia and fatigue, and lifestyle factors. Stratifying Athens Insomnia Scale scores as low (0-5 points, control group) and high (≥ 6 points, subjective insomnia group), we sought to identify the parameters that are independently associated with subjective insomnia.Results: Women with subjective insomnia (n = 30) had lower sleep efficiency than did the controls. They were also older; had more live births, lower height, higher body mass index, lower ankle brachial index, and more severe menopausal symptoms including fatigue; took more naps; smoked more cigarettes; and more of them were full-time workers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that low sleep efficiency (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44 per 1% decrease in sleep efficiency; 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.05) and fatigue assessed with Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57 per 1-point increase in BFI score; 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.13) were independent contributors to subjective insomnia.Conclusions: Low sleep efficiency and feeling of fatigue were found to be independently associated with subjective insomnia in middle-aged women.

AB  - Acupuncture treatments can reduce the number of hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause by as much as 36%, according to recently published data. Additional research is needed to identify individual differences in response to acupuncture, researchers note. According to the North American Menopause Society, hot flashes occur in up to 75% of women. Although most women experience them for six months to two years, some women may experience bothersome hot flashes for 10 years or longer. Treatment for hot flashes should be considered if symptoms are bothersome, disrupt sleep, or adversely affect quality of life. Such therapy should be tailored to each patient's medical history, treatment goals, and personal attitudes toward menopause and medication use.

AB  - This study examines the current utilization of primary and preventive health care services among dancers in order to assess their self-reported primary care needs. Participants were 37 dancers from a variety of dance backgrounds who presented for a free dancer health screening in a large US metropolitan area (30 females, 7 males; mean age: 27.5 ± 7.4 years; age range: 19 to 49 years; mean years of professional dancing: 6.4 ± 5.4 years). Dancers were screened for use of primary care, mental health, and women's health resources using the Health Screen for Professional Dancers developed by the Task Force on Dancer Health. Most dancers had health insurance (62.2%), but within the last 2 years, only approximately half of them (54.1%) reported having a physical examination by a physician. Within the last year, 54.1% of dancers had had a dental check-up, and 56.7% of female dancers received gynecologic care. Thirty percent of female participants indicated irregular menstrual cycles, 16.7% had never been to a gynecologist, and 16.7% were taking birth control. Utilization of calcium and vitamin D supplementation was 27.0% and 29.7%, respectively, and 73.0% were interested in nutritional counseling. A high rate of psychological fatigue and sleep deprivation was found (35.1%), along with a concomitant high rate of self-reported need for mental health counseling (29.7%). Cigarette and recreational drug use was low (5.4% and 5.4%); however, 32.4% engaged in binge drinking within the last year (based on the CDC definition). These findings indicate that dancers infrequently access primary care services, despite high self-reported need for nutritional, mental, and menstrual health counseling and treatment. More studies are warranted to understand dancers' primary health care seeking behavior.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to compare the endothelial function of symptomatic (self-reported hot flashes >3 on a scale of 0-10) versus asymptomatic (≤3) women in different postmenopause stages, and to examine if the association between hot flashes and endothelial function was independent of classical cardiovascular risk factors observed during the analysis.Methods: Noninvasive venous occlusion plethysmography within two groups: recent (recent postmenopause [RPM], <10 y, n = 63) and late (late postmenopause [LPM], ≥10 y, n = 67) postmenopause.Results: Symptomatic women showed lower forearm blood flow and lower percentage increment of it during the reactive hyperemia response; higher systolic (P < 0.0001 in RPM and P = 0.0008 in LPM) and diastolic (P = 0.0005 in RPM and P = 0.0219 in LPM) blood pressure; highest score for perimenopausal hot flashes (P = 0.0007 in RPM and P < 0.0001 in LPM), longer duration of prior oral contraceptive use (P = 0.009 in RPM and P = 0.0253 in LPM), and higher current sleep disorders (P < 0.0001 in RPM and P = 0.0281 in LPM) compared with asymptomatic ones. In the LPM group, symptomatic women also had higher prevalence of previous hypertension diagnosis (P = 0.0092). During multivariate analysis, blood flow during the reactive hyperemia response was associated with hot flashes after adjusting for age, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 0.55 [0.36-0.84] in RPM and odds ratio 0.7 [0.5-0.97] in LPM).Conclusions: In both phases, recent and late post menopause, hot flashes were associated with endothelial dysfunction and higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but the relationship between hot flashes and endothelial dysfunction was independent of blood pressure.

AB  - Context and Objectives: Associations between sex hormones and sleep habits originate mainly from small and selected patient-based samples. We examined data from a population-based sample with various sleep characteristics and the major part of sex hormones measured by mass spectrometry.Design, Setting, and Participants: We used data from 204 men and 213 women of the cross-sectional Study of Health in Pomerania-TREND.Main Outcome and Measures: Associations of total T (TT) and free T, androstenedione (ASD), estrone, estradiol (E2), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate, SHBG, and E2 to TT ratio with sleep measures (including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed by sex-specific multivariable regression models.Results: In men, age-adjusted associations of TT (odds ratio 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83), free T, and SHBG with AHI were rendered nonsignificant after multivariable adjustment. In multivariable analyses, ASD was associated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (β-coefficient per SD increase in ASD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.25). In women, multivariable analyses showed positive associations of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate with wake after sleep onset (β-coefficient: .16; 95% CI 0.03-0.28) and of E2 and E2 to TT ratio with Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Additionally, free T and SHBG were associated with AHI in multivariable models among premenopausal women.Conclusions: The present cross-sectional, population-based study observed sex-specific associations of androgens, E2, and SHBG with sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness. However, multivariable-adjusted analyses confirmed the impact of body composition and health-related lifestyle on the association between sex hormones and sleep.

AB  - Key Clinical Points Polycystic Ovary Syndrome The polycystic ovary syndrome is diagnosed in women with at least two of the following otherwise unexplained abnormalities: hyperandrogenism (clinical, biochemical, or both), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphologic features. Women with the polycystic ovary syndrome are at increased risk for infertility, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety. Nonpharmacologic therapies play key roles in the treatment of the polycystic ovary syndrome. Lifestyle modification is important for patients who are (or are at risk for being) overweight or obese and in those with other coexisting metabolic conditions. Mechanical hair removal (e.g., shaving) is an important treatment strategy in patients with hirsutism. Combined (estrogen-progestin) oral contraceptives are considered to be the first-line pharmacologic therapy for the classic symptoms of the polycystic ovary syndrome. They ameliorate hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism), result in predictable withdrawal bleeding, and provide reliable endometrial protection and contraception. Additional pharmacologic therapies may include spironolactone (with appropriate contraception) for hirsutism, episodic or continuous progestin therapy for endometrial protection, metformin for abnormal glucose tolerance, and clomiphene for ovulation induction.

AB  - Importance: Effective, practical, nonpharmacologic therapies are needed to treat menopause-related insomnia symptoms in primary and women's specialty care settings.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) vs menopause education control (MEC).Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-site, randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 1, 2013, to August 31, 2015, in western Washington State among 106 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years with moderate insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] score, ≥12) and 2 or more daily hot flashes. Blinded assessments were conducted at baseline, 8, and 24 weeks postrandomization. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted.Interventions: Six CBT-I or MEC telephone sessions in 8 weeks. Participants submitted weekly electronic sleep diaries and received group-specific written educational materials. The CBT-I sessions included sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene education, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral homework; MEC sessions provided information about menopause and women's health.Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was scores on the ISI (score range, 0-28; scores ≥15 indicate moderate to severe insomnia). Secondary outcome was scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (score range, 0-21; higher scores indicate worse sleep quality). Additional outcomes included sleep and hot flash diary variables and hot flash interference.Results: At 8 weeks, ISI scores had decreased 9.9 points among 53 women receiving CBT-I (mean [SD] age, 55.0 [3.5] years) and 4.7 points among 53 women receiving MEC (age, 54.7 [4.7] years), a mean between-group difference of 5.2 points (95% CI, -6.1 to -3.3; P < .001). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores decreased 4.0 points in women receiving CBT-I and 1.4 points in women receiving MEC, a mean between-group difference of 2.7 points (95% CI, -3.9 to -1.5; P < .001). Significant group differences were sustained at 24 weeks. At 8 and 24 weeks, 33 of 47 women (70%) and 37 of 44 (84%) in the CBT-I group, respectively, had ISI scores in the no-insomnia range compared with 10 of 41 (24%) and 16 of 37 (43%) in the MEC group, respectively. The CBT-I group also had greater improvements in diary-reported sleep latency, wake time, and sleep efficiency. There were no between-group differences in frequency of daily hot flashes, but hot flash interference was significantly decreased at 8 weeks for the CBT-I group (-15.7; 95% CI, -20.4 to -11.0) compared with the MEC group (-7.1; 95% CI, -14.6 to 0.4) (P = .03), differences that were maintained at 24 weeks for the CBT-I group (-22.8; 95% CI, -28.6 to -16.9) and MEC group (-11.6; 95% CI, -19.4 to -3.8) (P = .003).Conclusions and Relevance: Telephone-based CBT-I improved sleep in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with insomnia and hot flashes. Results support further development and testing of centralized CBT-I programs for treating menopausal insomnia.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01936441.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular risk factors during adolescence-including obesity, elevated lipids, altered glucose metabolism, hypertension, and elevated low-grade inflammation-is cause for serious concern and potentially impacts subsequent morbidity and mortality. Despite the importance of these cardiovascular risk factors, very little is known about their developmental origins in childhood. In addition, since adolescence is a time when individuals are navigating major life changes and gaining increasing autonomy from their parents or parental figures, it is a period when control over their own health behaviors (e.g. drug use, sleep, nutrition) also increases. The primary aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods for the RIGHT Track Health Study. This study examines self-regulation as a key factor in the development of cardiovascular risk, and further explores health behaviors as an explanatory mechanism of this association. We also examine potential moderators (e.g. psychosocial adversities such as harsh parenting) of this association.Method/design: RIGHT Track is a longitudinal study that investigates social and emotional development. The RIGHT Track Health Study prospectively follows participants from age 2 through young adulthood in an effort to understand how self-regulatory behavior throughout childhood alters the trajectories of various cardiovascular risk factors during late adolescence via health behaviors. Individuals from RIGHT Track were re-contacted and invited to participate in adolescent data collection (~16.5, 17.5 and 18(+) years old). Individuals completed assessments of body composition, anthropometric indicators, fitness testing (via peak oxygen consumption), heart rate variability during orthostatic challenge, 7-day accelerometry for physical activity and sleep, 24-h dietary recalls, and blood analysis for biomarkers related to metabolic syndrome, inflammatory status and various hormones and cytokines. Individuals also completed extensive self-report measures on diet and eating regulation, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, sleep, substance use, medical history, medication use and a laboratory-day checklist, which chronicled previous day activities and menstrual information for female participants.Discussion: Insights emerging from this analysis can help researchers and public health policy administrators target intervention efforts in early childhood, when preventing chronic disease is most cost-effective and behavior is more malleable.

AB  - We investigated the percentage of women with poor sleep quality and its related factors among mainland Chinese women. Sleep quality and menopausal status were self-reported. We explored the contribution of possible risk factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, lifestyle, psychological status, stressful life events, and vasomotor symptoms. We found that 38.6% of midlife Chinese women were poor sleepers. This percentage was higher in comparison with women from other Asian countries. Our multiple logistic regression showed that anxiety, comorbidities, perceived stress, and vasomotor symptoms were risk factors for poor sleep quality.

AB  - Background: Sleep disorders among middle-aged women are regarded as a common symptom of menopause or menopausal transition. This study was aimed to investigate factors associated with sleep quality among reproductive age (RA), peri- and post-menopausal women with poor self-reported sleep quality in Taiwan. Methods: 129 women aged 45-60 who self-reported with poor sleep quality and were screened using Chinese version Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( C-PSQI ) > 5 points, were recruited from a women health outpatient in one regional teaching hospital in Taipei City. Participants were administered the C-PSQI, Greene Climacteric scale (GCS) and demographic questionnaire. Results: The results of general linear model (GLM) showed that the perimenopausal and postmenopausal women did not show significant difference from RA women for subjective sleep quality measured by C-PSQI, after adjusting for age, educational levels and employment status. However, heavier psychological symptom significantly resulted in worse sleep quality (p < 0.001) under multivariate model analysis. Besides, perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women had significantly longer sleep latency than RA women (26.61 and 27.526 mins, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The health policy authority may need to provide more medical resources for the health promotion of mid-aged women, especially for psychological care, rather than relying solely on reimbursement for episodic care.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Sleep hygiene is one factor that contributes to poor sleep in breast cancer survivors but is poorly measured. The purposes of this study were to (a) evaluate the psychometric properties of the Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale (SHAPS) and (b) compare SHAPS scores between midlife women with and without breast cancer. Methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive data from a single-blinded, controlled hot flash intervention trial. Results: 194 women (88 breast cancer survivors; 106 menopausal women). Reliability of the three sections of the SHAPS was inadequate with Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.23 to 0.67. Sleep hygiene practices were modestly correlated with global sleep quality in both groups. Conclusions: Findings suggest the SHAPS would need to be revised to be a psychometrically sound measure of sleep hygiene awareness and practice.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this follow-up study was to explore the long-term effects of a 6-month trial of exercise training on hot flushes. The follow-up was 4 years after the exercise intervention ended.Study Design: A cohort study after a randomised controlled trial. Ninety-five of the 159 randomised women (60%) participated in anthropometric measurements and performed a 2-km walk test. Participants completed a questionnaire and kept a one-week diary on physical activity, menopause symptoms and sleep quality. The frequency of 24-h hot flushes was multiplied by severity and the total sum for one week was defined as the Hot Flush Score (HFScore). Multilevel mixed regression models were analysed to compare the exercise and control groups.Main Outcome Measure: Hot Flush Score (HFScore) as assessed with the one-week symptom diary.Results: The women in the exercise group had a higher probability of improved HFScore, i.e. a decrease in HFScore points, adjusted for hormone therapy (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90-1.00) than women in the control group at the 4-year follow-up. After additional adjustment for sleep quality, the result approached statistical significance at HFScore≥13 with women in the exercise group. Women who had the least amount of hot flushes, HFScore<13, benefited most from exercise during the 4-year follow-up when compared with women in the control group.Conclusions: Women in the exercise group had positive effects on their HFScore 4 years after a 6-month exercise intervention.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the short and long-term effects of acupuncture on vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and quality of life-related measures.Methods: A total of 209 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 45 to 60 years, experiencing four or more VMS per day, were recruited from the community and randomized to receive up to 20 acupuncture treatments within the first 6 months (acupuncture group) or the second 6 months (waitlist control group) of the 12-month study period. The primary outcome was mean daily frequency of VMS. Secondary outcomes were VMS interference with daily life, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, somatic and other symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life.Results: The VMS frequency declined by 36.7% at 6 months in the acupuncture group and increased by 6.0% in the control group (P < 0.001 for between-group comparison). At 12 months, the reduction from baseline in the acupuncture group was 29.4% (P < 0.001 for within-group comparison from baseline to 12 months), suggesting that the reduction was largely maintained after treatment. Statistically significant clinical improvement was observed after three acupuncture treatments, and maximal clinical effects occurred after a median of eight treatments. Persistent improvements were seen in many quality of life-related outcomes in the acupuncture group relative to the control group.Conclusions: We found that a course of acupuncture treatments was associated with significant reduction in VMS, and several quality-of-life measures, compared with no acupuncture, and that clinical benefit persisted for at least 6 months beyond the end of treatment.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate whether postmenopausal women show differences in circadian-related variables and sleep characteristics compared with premenopausal women, and to analyze potential associations between these circadian-related variables and abdominal fat distribution or metabolic syndrome (MetS) components.Methods: A total of 177 women were studied (127 premenopausal, 50 postmenopausal). Sixty percent of the total population was overweight/obese, with no significant differences between premenopausal (60%) and postmenopausal women (62%) (P = 0.865). Wrist temperature (WT) and rest-activity cycles were measured during 8 consecutive days, and sleep and food diaries collected. MetS characteristics and daily patterns of saliva cortisol were analyzed. Sleep characteristics were assessed with domiciliary polysomnography.Results: Postmenopausal women showed a less robust rhythm in WT with lower amplitude (°C) (0.8 ± 0.4 vs 0.9 ± 0.5) (P < 0.05) and lower mean temperature values at the midpoint of sleep than premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women were also more morning-type than premenopausal women, showing a phase advance of approximately 1 hour in WT and rest-activity rhythms, and more morning-type habits (earlier sleep onset/offset and breakfast intake) (P < 0.05). Postmenopausal women showed higher levels of activity in the morning and lower in the evening compared with premenopausal women (P < 0.05). Daily variability in cortisol was significantly reduced in postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women (P < 0.05). Postmenopausal women had increased frequency of sleep-related breathing abnormalities (P < 0.0001). In the women studied, abdominal fat and MetS were associated with an increase in circadian alterations (high fragmentation and low amplitude of the rhythm) (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Postmenopausal women exhibit loss of circadian robustness and an increase in sleep abnormalities compared with premenopausal women.

AB  - Rationale: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice in patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CPAP treatment improves quality of life (QoL) in men with OSA, but its role in women has not yet been assessed.Objectives: To investigate the effect of CPAP on QoL in women with moderate to severe OSA.Methods: We conducted a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial in 307 consecutive women diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index, ≥15) in 19 Spanish sleep units. Women were randomized to receive effective CPAP therapy (n = 151) or conservative treatment (n = 156) for 3 months. The primary endpoint was the change in QoL based on the Quebec Sleep Questionnaire. Secondary endpoints included changes in daytime sleepiness, mood state, anxiety, and depression. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis with adjustment for baseline values and other relevant clinical variables.Measurements and Main Results: The women in the study had a mean (SD) age of 57.1 (10.1) years and a mean (SD) Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 9.8 (4.4), and 77.5% were postmenopausal. Compared with the control group, the CPAP group achieved a significantly greater improvement in all QoL domains of the Quebec Sleep Questionnaire (adjusted treatment effect between 0.53 and 1.33; P < 0.001 for all domains), daytime sleepiness (-2.92; P < 0.001), mood state (-4.24; P  = 0.012), anxiety (-0.89; P = 0.014), depression (-0.85; P = 0.016), and the physical component summary of the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (2.78; P = 0.003).Conclusions: In women with moderate or severe OSA, 3 months of CPAP therapy improved QoL, mood state, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and daytime sleepiness compared with conservative treatment. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02047071).

AB  - Purpose: The Suppression of Ovarian Function trial showed improved disease control for tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) compared with tamoxifen alone for the cohort of premenopausal patients who received prior chemotherapy. We present the patient-reported outcomes.Patients and Methods: The quality-of-life (QoL) analysis includes 1,722 of 2,045 premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer randomly assigned to receive adjuvant treatment with 5 years of tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone. Chemotherapy use before enrollment was optional. Patients completed a QoL form consisting of global and symptom indicators at baseline, every 6 months for 24 months, and annually during years 3 to 6. Differences in the change of QoL from baseline between the two treatments were tested at 6, 24, and 60 months with mixed models for repeated measures with and without chemotherapy and overall.Results: Patients on tamoxifen plus OFS were more affected than patients on tamoxifen alone by hot flushes at 6 and 24 months, by loss of sexual interest and sleep disturbance at 6 months, and by vaginal dryness up to 60 months. Without prior chemotherapy, patients on tamoxifen alone reported more vaginal discharge over the 5 years than patients on tamoxifen plus OFS. Symptom-specific treatment differences at 6 months were less pronounced in patients with prior chemotherapy. Changes in global QoL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the whole treatment period.Conclusion: Overall, OFS added to tamoxifen resulted in worse endocrine symptoms and sexual functioning during the first 2 years of treatment, with variable magnitudes of treatment differences. Short-term differences in symptom-specific QoL, treatment burden, and coping effort between treatment groups were less pronounced for patients with prior chemotherapy, the cohort that benefited most from OFS in terms of disease control.

AB  - Background: Shift work disrupts the circadian rhythm and may cause menstruation disorders. This study assessed the impact of shift work on menstrual cycle in a population of Chinese nurses.Methods: Questionnaires on menstrual characteristics and shift schedules were sent to female nurses of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAHSYSU) and Guanghua Hospital of Stomatology (GHHS), affiliated to Sun Yat-sen University. Part I was a cross-sectional study and included 139 nurses in GHHS who had regular 8:00-17:30 working (non-shift group), and 334 nurses from FAHSYSU who worked shifts, a response rate of 67.5 % and 59.6 %, respectively (age ≤ 50 years). Menstrual patterns were compared and age-adjusted relative risks of shift work were analyzed. Part II was a nested case-control study. Cases were nurses in Part I who had regular cycle with mean cycle length (MCL) of 25-31 days and but at least 3 days variation in MCL after starting shift work (n = 45). Controls consisted of 67 nurses with matching shift patterns and age, but no MCL changes. A control non-shift age-matched group consisted of 30 GHHS nurses with no MCL changes. A follow-up second questionnaire was sent 2 years later.Results: In Part I, the shift group had a significantly higher proportion of nurses with menstrual cycle irregularity. The proportion of nurses with a cycle of 25-31 days decreased from 81.7 to 67.8 % after changing to shift work. Logistic regression analysis showed that night shift frequency was the only risk factor associated with cycle shortening. After adjusting for age, MCL was shorter when night work was performed > 7 times per month. In Part II, the mean change in MCL in the case group, including prolongation or shortening, was 4.115 ± 2.084 days after shift working. In the 2 years' follow-up, the MCL of the study group did not recover to the original length.Conclusions: Rotating shift work can increase the prevalence of menstrual cycle irregularity. Night shift frequency was the only risk factor associated with cycle reduced. Changes in MCL did not show recovery over a follow-up period of 2 years.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in postmenopausal women. Few studies compared symptom improvement taking antidepressants versus placebo. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of venlafaxine and Citalopram compared to placebo in treatment of sleep disturbance in healthy postmenopausal women.Method: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in three groups of 20 postmenopausal women. The patients took venlafaxine 75 mg/daily (group I) or citalopram 20 mg/d (group II) or placebo (group III). Each patient filled Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Pittsburgh and Beck depression questionnaires. The frequency of hot flashes in a day and its severity were measured through diaries. Somatic symptoms and adverse side effects were evaluated. Follow-up visit was conducted after 3 months. The prior and the later results were compared.Results: The PSQI scores in three placebo, venlafaxine, and citalopram groups before treatment were 14.25 ± 3.85, 11.55 ± 3.96, and 13.50 ± 3.56, respectively (p = 0.076). These values after treatment reached 9.95 ± 5.07, 8 ± 3.06, and 6.95 ± 1.84, respectively. PSQI score in citalopram and venlafaxine group was not significantly different (p = 0.19) but the score in both groups was significantly lower compared with placebo group after treatment (p = 0.01). The frequency of hot flashes in a day was reduced significantly by both citalopram and venlafaxine (p < 0.05), although it was more reduced by citalopram than venlafaxine (p = 0.03). Severity of hot flashes in both venlafaxine and citalopram was significantly lower in comparison with placebo group (p = 0.02), and there was no significant difference between two drugs, though (p = 0.84). Beck score decreased more in venlafaxine group in comparison with other groups but it did not reach significant (p = 0.06).Conclusion: Citalopram and venlafaxine are equally more effective than placebo in reducing sleep disturbance and severity of hot flashes, while citalopram is more effective in reducing frequency of hot flashes than venlafaxine. Meanwhile, venlafaxine is more effective than citalopram in treatment of depression in postmenopausal women.Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials 201210152576N6.

AB  - Objective To describe acute and prodromal cardiac symptoms in older and younger women. Data Sources PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles published between January 2000 and January 2015. Study Selection A combination of the MESH terms acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, symptoms, prodromal symptoms, sex, gender, and age was used. The search was limited to studies on humans published in English and original articles related to symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in women with symptoms stratified by age or analyses adjusted for age and/or sex. Data Extraction A total of 432 articles were identified, and 20 met the inclusion criteria. Data Synthesis Key findings for differences in acute ACS symptoms for women based on age included the following: (a) typical chest pain and pain of any kind were less likely in older women (≥65 years); (b) women were more likely to have nonpain symptoms of nausea, dyspnea, and fatigue after adjustment for age; (c) most researchers did not adjust for menopausal status or hormone replacement therapy; and (d) findings were consistent across international cohorts. The most common prodromal symptoms in women after adjustment for age included unusual fatigue, discomfort in arms, sleep disturbance, anxiety, general chest discomfort, discomfort in jaws/teeth, and shortness of breath. Although chest symptoms were reported by some women, they were not reported by most women. Conclusion Women older than 65 years with ACS experienced fewer symptoms, more ambiguous symptoms, less chest pain, and more dyspnea. Women older than 50 years were more likely to report prodromal symptoms that include sleep disturbance. Many symptom differences that were statistically significant by age, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, may not be clinically relevant.

AB  - The human menopause transition and aging are each associated with an increase in a variety of health risk factors including, but not limited to, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, stroke, sexual dysfunction, affective disorders, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline. It is challenging to systematically evaluate the biological underpinnings associated with the menopause transition in the human population. For this reason, rodent models have been invaluable tools for studying the impact of gonadal hormone fluctuations and eventual decline on a variety of body systems. While it is essential to keep in mind that some of the mechanisms associated with aging and the transition into a reproductively senescent state can differ when translating from one species to another, animal models provide researchers with opportunities to gain a fundamental understanding of the key elements underlying reproduction and aging processes, paving the way to explore novel pathways for intervention associated with known health risks. Here, we discuss the utility of several rodent models used in the laboratory for translational menopause research, examining the benefits and drawbacks in helping us to better understand aging and the menopause transition in women. The rodent models discussed are ovary-intact, ovariectomy, and 4-vinylcylohexene diepoxide for the menopause transition. We then describe how these models may be implemented in the laboratory, particularly in the context of cognition. Ultimately, we aim to use these animal models to elucidate novel perspectives and interventions for maintaining a high quality of life in women, and to potentially prevent or postpone the onset of negative health consequences associated with these significant life changes during aging.

AB  - The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, is associated with profound reproductive and hormonal changes. These changes have been well chronicled and matched with concomitant symptoms. The pattern of appearance of menopausal symptoms and their natural history have become increasingly clear thanks to the conduct of several long-term, longitudinal cohort studies that have examined many aspects of women's biology and psychology through this time of life. Menopausal symptoms are highly prevalent; they are sufficiently bothersome to drive almost 90% of women to seek out their healthcare provider for advice on how to cope. The classic symptom of menopause is the hot flash, which is experienced by most women, and is moderately to severely problematic for about 1/3 of women. While most women will have an experience of hot flashes limited to just a year or two, others will experience them for a decade or more, and a small proportion of women will never be free of them. Poor sleep becomes more common in perimenopausal women not only in association with the menopausal transition but also in relation to aging. Depressed mood and increased anxiety also increase during the transition, with an abrupt rise in prevalence as women approach the later stages of the menopausal transition and have longer bouts of amenorrhea. These common symptoms often interact with one another such that depressed women tend to experience worse hot flashes along with worse sleep. As women enter the latter stages of the transition, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia also become more likely, affecting about 1/3 of the population. Unlike hot flashes, mood issues, and sleep, vaginal symptoms will not go away without treatment. Clinical approaches to these problems often involve hormone therapy, which can be safely given to most perimenopausal women on a short-term basis. Therapeutic strategies that are nonhormonal and behavioral can also be deployed.

AB  - Objectives: Chronic diseases may aggravate or simulate climacteric symptoms. Although acknowledged in clinical practice, there is a lack of research systematically analysing the association between chronic diseases and climacteric symptoms.Study Design and Main Outcome Measures: Our study was a cross-sectional population-based study, which included 3421 women, aged 41-54 years. Climacteric symptoms were evaluated using the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), of which we included seven symptom domains (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety/fears, cognitive, sexual, and menstrual) and a question concerning whether the women were worried about growing old. The occurrence of various diseases (cardiovascular, neurological, sensory organ, bronchopulmonary, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, urological, dermatological, and thyroid disease, diabetes, and cancer) was recorded. The associations between the diseases and symptoms were defined with multivariable analyses, adjusting for various confounding factors.Results: The women with the diseases had more symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms and sleep problems were associated only with gastrointestinal diseases, and lower sexual functioning only with diabetes. The remaining symptoms were associated with several diseases, except being worried about growing old, which was not associated with any.Conclusions: Many symptoms connected to the climacteric may manifest also due to chronic diseases. Thus, health-care professionals should consider the origin of the symptoms when treating middle-aged women with chronic diseases.

AB  - Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), genito-urinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), sleep disturbance, sexual dysfunction and mood disturbance are common during the menopause transition. The degree of "bother" from symptoms should guide discussions about treatment. Moderate dose estrogen-containing hormone therapy (HT) is currently the most effective treatment for VMS and also improves vaginal dryness. The indication for HT is moderate to severe VMS in women without contraindications. It should not be prescribed or continued for the treatment of chronic disease. GSM can effectively be treated with vaginal (topical) estrogens. The dose, delivery system and duration of treatment for HT should be individualised to relieve symptoms. For most healthy women aged 50-59 years, the risks of HT are low. Several widely available non-hormonal agents can treat VMS for those who should avoid or do not wish to take estrogen. These include selected antidepressants and gaba-agonists.

AB  - Purpose: Quality of life in women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer (BC) may be impaired by hot flushes and night sweats. The cool pad pillow topper (CPPT) is a commercial product, promoted to improve quality of sleep disrupted by hot flushes. This study aimed to identify if the CPPT reduces severity of sleep disturbance by minimising effects of hot flushes.Methods: This randomised phase II trial, recruited women with BC, on adjuvant endocrine therapy, experiencing hot flushes and insomnia. Participants were randomised (stratified by baseline sleep efficiency score (SES) and menopausal status) to the intervention arm (CPPT + standard care) or control arm (standard care). Participants completed Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaires and fortnightly sleep/hot flush diaries (where responses were averaged over 2-week periods). The primary endpoint was change in average SES from -2 to 0 weeks to 2 to 4 weeks.Results: Seventy-four pre- (68.9 %) and post-menopausal (31.1 %) women were recruited. Median age was 49.5 years. Endocrine therapies included tamoxifen (93.2 %). Median SES at weeks 2 to 4 improved in both arms but the increase on the intervention arm was almost twice that on the control arm (p = 0.024). There were significantly greater reductions in hot flushes and HADS depression in the intervention arm (p = 0.09 and p = 0.036, respectively). There were no significant differences in FACT-B or HADS anxiety.Conclusion: This study supports the use of the CPPT as an aid to reduce sleep disturbance and the frequency/severity of hot flushes.

AB  - Menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flushes and vaginal symptoms) are common, often bothersome, and can adversely impact women's sexual functioning, relationships, and quality of life. Estrogen-progestin therapy was previously considered the standard care for hormone therapy (HT) for managing these symptoms in nonhysterectomized women, but has a number of safety and tolerability concerns (eg, breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, breast pain/tenderness, and vaginal bleeding) and its use has declined dramatically in the past decade since the release of the Women's Health Initiative trial results. Conjugated estrogens paired with bazedoxifene (CE/BZA) represent a newer progestin-free alternative to traditional HT for nonhysterectomized women. CE/BZA has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms and preventing loss of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. CE/BZA provides an acceptable level of protection against endometrial hyperplasia and does not increase mammographic breast density. Compared with traditional estrogen-progestin therapy, it is associated with lower rates of breast pain/tenderness and vaginal bleeding. Patient-reported outcomes indicate that CE/BZA improves menopause-specific quality of life, sleep, some measures of sexual function (especially ease of lubrication), and treatment satisfaction. This review looks at the rationale for selection and combination of CE with BZA at the dose ratio in the approved product and provides a detailed look at the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes from the five Phase III trials. Patient considerations in the choice between CE/BZA and traditional HT (eg, tolerability, individual symptoms, and preferences for route of administration) are also considered.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis among women in the United States, of which approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in women under the age of 50. As compared to older women, younger breast cancer survivors experience worse long term symptoms related to estrogen deprivation (e.g.: hot flashes, sleep disturbances, depression, and sexual health). These co-occurring symptoms have multiple etiologies and interlink within physical and psychosocial domains; subsequently, they are often poorly managed and difficult to understand from a research perspective. A combined nursing framework of Theory of Symptom Management and Transitions Theory is proposed to elucidate symptom experience, management, and outcomes within the context of survivorship among young female cancer survivors. Theoretical Framework: The Theory of Symptom Management and Theory of Transitions. Methods: A theory analysis using the process described by Walker and Avant evaluated the Theory of Symptom Management and Theory of Transitions with attention to symptoms associated with estrogen deprivation among young women's transitional period from breast cancer patient to survivor. Results: The Theory of Symptom Management and Theory of Transitions conceptualize different, yet complementary processes (i.e.: transitions and symptoms), where concepts embedded within the two theories both overlap (e.g.; outcome indicators) and complement (e.g.; nature of transitions, symptom experience) the other. The Theory of Symptom Management is a useful framework for explicating personal, environmental and illness related factors contributing to diverse symptom experiences, treatments and outcomes of young female breast cancer survivors. Theory of Transitions also addresses the contextual aspect of person and environment, yet is unique as it provides a framework or lens with which to understand the multiplicity of transitions experienced by this population (e.g.: premature menopause, motherhood, health, work, etc.) in the short and long-term survivorship period post-cancer treatment. Theory of Transitions provides a framework to examine symptom experience within the context of time and place. Conclusions/Implications: The two theories complement and overlap as theoretical frameworks. The conjoined model illustrates how the two theories provide a useful theoretical framework to illuminate the risk factors, symptoms, and related concepts among young female breast cancer survivors with multiple co-occurring biopsychosocial symptoms. The framework will guide nursing care and research in the areas of symptom management and healthy reintegration into life among transitioning from young cancer patient to long term survivor.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Insomnia in adults contributes to poor health outcomes such as myocardial infarction and obesity. Empiric evidence consistently suggests a predisposition to insomnia in women; yet, there is a paucity of research that addresses insomnia in perimenopausal women transitioning to menopause. The purpose of this longitudinal study was [RB1] to examine the prevalence and incidence of insomnia in perimenopausal women transitioning to menopause. [RB1] Study completed Methods: A secondary analysis of 10 years of data from the Study of Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN), was conducted to examine insomnia prevalence in perimenopausal women, using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine insomnia criteria (any 1 insomnia symptom reported ≥ 3 per week). Descriptive analysis and repeated measures logistic regression were used to identify change over time by perimenopausal stage in insomnia symptoms (Sleep Latency, Wake after Sleep Onset, Awakenings, Sleep Quality) annually. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of influence on chronic insomnia. Results: Participants were middle aged (45.9 + 2.69 years) diverse (African American 28%; Caucasian 50%; Asian 10%; Hispanic 12%) women from 5 regions of the U.S. Diagnosable insomnia was present in a third or more of perimenopausal women at any point in the transition period (31%-42%). Insomnia symptoms were worse and more prevalent in the late stage of perimenopause. The odds of having any one symptom of insomnia were 1.3 times greater for those in late stage versus early stage of perimenopause (95% CI (1.2, 1.5); p<0.001). The odds of developing chronic insomnia were 1.5 times greater for those in perimenopause than pre-perimenopausal status at baseline (95% CI (1.3,1.8); p<0.001). Conclusions/Implications: Late stage perimenopausal women are at greater risk for insomnia than early perimenopausal women. Perimenopausal women are at risk for developing chronic insomnia when compared to pre-perimenopausal women. The results of this study afford research and clinical implications that provide insight to design interventions to improve the sleep and long-term health of perimenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To examine the association of acupuncture with sleep disturbances and serum sex hormone levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and whether there are associated changes in sex hormone levels.Data Sources: We systematically searched electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Wanfang Data Chinese Database, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database) and the reference lists of the identified studies.Methods Of Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of acupuncture on sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement was followed.Tabulation, Integration, and Results: We identified 31 randomized controlled trials with 34 effect sizes involving a total of 2,433 participants. Acupuncture is associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of sleep disturbances (odds ratio [OR] 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.31), a significant increase in the secretion of serum estradiol (pooled difference in means 7.56 pg/mL, 95% CI 4.03-11.08), and reduction in the secretion of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (-6.75 milli-international units/mL, 95% CI -12.16 to -1.34) and luteinizing hormone (-2.71 milli-international units/mL, 95% CI -4.22 to -1.20). Studies with a large effect size of acupuncture-associated changes in serum estradiol had a significantly lower odds of sleep disturbances than did those with a small-to-moderate effect sizes (ORs 0.07 and 0.36, P=.02).Conclusion: Acupuncture is associated with a significant reduction in sleep disturbances in women experiencing menopause-related sleep disturbances. Our findings suggest that acupuncture should be adopted as part of a multimodal approach for improving sleep disturbances in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

AB  - Menstrual-related hypersomnia (MRH) is a rare disorder consisting of recurrent hypersomnia that is temporally linked with menses. An unusual case of an 18-yearold female with repeated episodes of hypersomnia was referred to a psychiatrist and a neurologist. A review of the literature was done so that an accurate diagnosis could be made, thereby enabling the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Making an effective diagnosis was a challenge because of the similarity of the symptoms of MRH with other psychiatric disorders. As additional clinical features were identified and treatments were ruled ineffective, further diagnoses were proposed. The patient's symptoms ceased with oral contraceptive treatment. Hormones play a role in the menstrual cycle and frequently affect behavior (such as sleep patterns). This case underlines the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment in unusual cases. The potential role of hormone fluctuation in patients with psychiatric conditions should be considered when diagnosing and treating those who are unresponsive to traditional pharmacological treatments.

AB  - Menopausal transition is highly symptomatic in at least 20% of women. A higher prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, has been shown in women with symptomatic menopausal transition. However, a clear correlation between symptomatic menopausal transition and psychiatric disorders has not been established.We explored the association between symptomatic menopausal transition and subsequent newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia as well as bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders.We investigated women who were diagnosed with symptomatic menopausal transition by an obstetrician-gynecologist according to the data in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A comparison cohort comprised age-matched women without symptomatic menopausal transition. The incidence rate and the hazard ratios of subsequent newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders were evaluated in both cohorts, based on the diagnoses of psychiatrists.The symptomatic menopausal transition and control cohorts each consisted of 19,028 women. The incidences of bipolar disorders (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-2.80), depressive disorders (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.93-2.45), anxiety disorders (HR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.84-2.41), and sleep disorders (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.73-2.34) were higher among the symptomatic menopausal transition women than in the comparison cohort. After stratifying for follow-up duration, the incidence of newly diagnosed bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and sleep disorders following a diagnosis of symptomatic menopausal transition remained significantly increased in the longer follow-up groups (1-5 and ≥ 5 years).Symptomatic menopausal transition might increase the risk of subsequent newly onset bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and sleep disorders. A prospective study is necessary to confirm these findings.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: To compare the prevalence and cardiometabolic health impact of sleep disturbance among postmenopausal Veteran and non-Veteran participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Design and Methods: The prevalence of five categories of sleep disturbance--medication/alcohol use for sleep; risk for insomnia; risk for sleep disordered breathing [SDB]; risk for comorbid insomnia and SDB (insomnia + SDB); and aberrant sleep duration [SLD]--was compared in 3,707 Veterans and 141,354 non-Veterans using logistic or multinomial regression. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association of sleep disturbance and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes in Veterans and non-Veterans. Results: Women Veterans were more likely to have high risk for insomnia + SDB relative to non-Veteran participants. However, prevalence of other forms of sleep disturbance was similar across groups. Baseline sleep disturbance was not differentially associated with cardiometabolic health outcomes in Veteran versus non-Veteran women. Risks for SDB and insomnia + SDB were both linked to heightened risk of CVD and diabetes; SLD was consistently linked with greater risk of CVD and diabetes in non-Veterans but less strongly and consistently in Veterans. Implications: Efforts to identify and treat sleep disturbances in postmenopausal women are needed and may positively contribute to the attenuation of cardiometabolic morbidity risk. Increased awareness of women Veterans' vulnerability to postmenopausal insomnia + SDB may be particularly important for health care providers who treat this population.

AB  - Purpose of Study: To characterize the prevalence and longitudinal effects of pain in older Veteran and non-Veteran women. Design and Methods: Data on 144,956 participants in the Women's Health Initiative were analyzed. At baseline, Veteran status, pain severity, and pain interference with activity were assessed. Outcomes of physical function, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sleep quality were reported at baseline by all study participants and longitudinally on two follow-up occasions (3 years and 13-18 years after baseline) in the observational study participants (n = 87,336). Results: At baseline, a total of 3,687 (2.5%) had a history of military service and 22,813 (15.8%) reported that pain limited their activity level moderately to extremely during the past 4 weeks. Prevalence of pain interference did not differ in Veterans and non-Veterans (16.8% and 15.7%, respectively; p= .09). At baseline, women with moderate-to-extreme pain interference had substantially worse physical function and greater symptoms of depression, fatigue, and insomnia than those with less pain (p < .001 for all comparisons), adjusting for several social, behavioral, and health related factors. There were no significant military service by pain interference interactions for any of the outcomes (p > .2), indicating that the effect of pain interference on outcomes at baseline did not vary between Veterans and non-Veterans. Moderate-to-extreme pain interference was associated with a greater rate of decline in physical function over time (p < .001) and higher incidence of limited physical functioning (p < .001), but these effects did not vary by Veteran status. Similar results were observed with pain severity as the exposure variable. Implications: As the Veteran population ages and the number of women exposed to combat operations grows, there will be an increased need for health care services that address not only pain severity and interference but also other disabling comorbid symptoms.

AB  - Background Assessment of the likelihood ratio (LR) of symptoms has been proposed as a rational means for detecting indicators to homeopathic medicines. Aims To investigate the prevalence and LR of symptoms commonly attributed to the homeopathic medicine Lycopodium clavatum (Lyc). Secondarily, to answer the question if experienced homeopaths could intuitively infer which the main symptoms of this medicine are. Methods The presence of 35 selected symptoms, prescribed medicines and therapeutic response were assessed retrospectively. The symptoms' prevalence in the Lyc responding population and the LR of the symptoms compared to their prevalence in the remainder of the population were calculated. Results Two hundred and two Lyc and 550 non Lyc cases (total 752) were included for analysis. Twenty-two symptoms were confirmed as pertaining to Lyc's semiology (prevalence %; LR): contemptuous (3.3; 6.7), urinary stones history (2.7; 5.4), egotism (5.6; 3.6), dictatorial (33.3; 3.4), haughty (8.7; 3.3), sleeps on abdomen (3.3; 3.3), intolerance to clothing in abdomen (12.0; 3.1), reproaches (4.0; 3.0), helplessness (24.0; 2.7), fear of failure (10.7; 2.6), irritability on waking in the morning (16.7; 2.5), constipation alternating with diarrhea (8.7; 2.5), intolerant to contradiction (59.3; 2.3), want of self confidence (30.0; 2.4), abdominal distension after eating (23.3; 2.1); ailments from anticipation (32.0; 1.9), irritability before menses (23.3; 1.8), conscientious (26.0; 1.6), desire of sweets (52.0; 1.6), desire of chocolate (16.7; 1.6), lack of vital heat (41.3; 1.3), and flatterer (1.3; ∞). Surveyed homeopaths' intuitive inferences correlated well with symptoms' prevalence but not with their LR. Conclusions Lycopodium's main symptoms are well known by homeopaths, but their knowledge correlates well with the symptoms' prevalence and not with their LR. Retrospective assessment of prevalence and LR of symptoms in good responders might be a means for better selection of symptoms for prospective studies.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to identify symptom clusters using standardized measures completed by participants in the Menopausal Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers to Symptoms and Health clinical trial at baseline, including hot flash interference, and sleep, depressive, anxiety, and pain symptoms.Methods: Data from all women randomized to interventions and controls from Menopausal Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers to Symptoms and Health studies 1, 2, and 3 (N = 899) were included; 797 with complete data were used in the analyses. Scores from standardized measures obtained at baseline included the following: Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 measure of depressed mood, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Brief Pain Inventory PEG scores (pain intensity [P], interference with enjoyment of life [E], and interference with daily activity [G]). Latent class analysis was used to identify symptom clusters using standardized scale scores and their established cut points.Results: We identified five classes using the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion. Women in classes 1 and 2 had high hot flash interference levels relative to the others, and class 1 (10.5% of total) included severe hot flash interference, severe sleep symptoms, and moderately severe pain symptoms (hot flash, sleep, pain). In class 2 (14.1%), severe hot flash interference was paired with the severe sleep symptoms, and moderate to severe depressed and anxious mood symptoms and pain (hot flash, sleep, mood, pain). In class 3 (39.6%), women reported moderately severe sleep symptoms with moderate hot flash interference, and low severity mood and pain symptoms (hot flash, sleep). Those in class 4 (7.0%) reported moderate hot flash interference with severe levels of anxiety and depressed mood symptoms, but low levels of other symptoms (hot flash, mood). Women in class 5 (28.7%) reported the lowest levels of all the five symptoms (low severity symptoms).Conclusions: Women meeting hot flash frequency criteria for inclusion in clinical trials exhibited multiple co-occurring symptoms that clustered into identifiable groups according to symptom interference and severity. Variability of symptom profiles between the classes was evident, indicating that the classes were composed of differing symptom types and not simply differing severity levels. These symptom clusters may be useful phenotypes for differentiating treatment effects or evaluating associations with biomarkers or genes.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in women increases significantly after menopause. However, identifying at-risk women is difficult because they tend to underreport symptoms and their complaints may differ from those traditionally associated with OSA. We investigated whether OSA risk factors are associated with the presence of a "nontraditional" complaint, such as nocturnal enuresis, in postmenopausal women.Methods: A cross-sectional study of postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study and clinical trials (1993-2005) at 40 clinical centers in the United States was performed. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of OSA risk factors with nocturnal enuresis.Results: A cohort of 2,789 women (1.7%) reported having nocturnal enuresis. Obesity (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% CI, 2.00-2.62), snoring (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.74-2.32), poor sleep quality (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.52-1.91), sleep fragmentation (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 2.14-2.79), daytime sleepiness (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.33-1.68), and hypertension (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26) were associated with nocturnal enuresis. Each additional OSA risk factor in a predefined OSA score significantly increased the odds of having nocturnal enuresis in a dose-response fashion (OR of 1.38, 2.00, 2.80, 3.87, 5.10, and 7.02 for scores of 1-6, respectively) compared with no risk factors.Conclusions: OSA risk factors are associated with nocturnal enuresis in postmenopausal women. Mechanisms relating nocturnal enuresis to OSA may include apnea-associated changes in intrathoracic pressure, leading to increased urine output. Questioning at-risk postmenopausal women presenting with nocturnal enuresis about other OSA risk factors should be considered.

AB  - Introduction: Shift Work Disorder (SWD) is a sleep disorder characterized by sleepiness and insomnia, which can be attributed to the person's work schedule. Awareness of the mechanisms behind shift work related health problems could be essential to schedule the shift work, employment routines, clinical treatment, and selection of employees. Objective: To assess the prevalence of SWD and to identify related health problems among nurses in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore. Materials and Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore between May and September 2014. Based on simple random sampling, 130 nurses were selected for the study. After obtaining written informed consent from the participants, structured interview schedule using Standard Shift Work Index and Bergen Shift Work Sleep Questionnaire (BSWSQ) was administered. The Results: mean age of the 130 nurses was 27.4 ± 2.64 years. The prevalence of SWD was found to be 43.07%. Headache, back pain, gastritis, and menstrual disorders were the most common complaints, which are found in 78 (60.0%), 75 (57.6%), 42 (32.3%), and 39 (30.0%) cases, respectively. Anxiety and depression was found in 23 (17.6%) and 31 (23.8%) individuals, respectively. We also found a significant association of SWD with increasing age, more number of nights worked in a year, and longer duration of working hours. According to the BSWSQ, 70 (53.8%) nurses were found to have sleep problems. Conclusion: A high prevalence of SWD symptoms calls for a focus on the antecedents of work related sleep problems and appropriate intervention, such as behavioral changes, clockwise rotating shifts, and treatment.

AB  - Aims: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may negatively affect a couple's sexual relationship. This systematic review evaluated what characteristics are determinants of sexual function and dysfunction in women and men with OSA, and what interventions are shown to be effective.Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane and TRIP, and articles published between January 2004 and December 2014 in English; original research; adults ≥ 18 years; and both experimental and non-experimental designs. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to assess study quality. Of 21 studies, six studies (no randomised control trials, RCTs) included women and 15 (with six RCTs) studies included men. Extracted data were scrutinised and adjusted until consensus was reached; suitable quantitative data were pooled in statistical meta-analysis.Results: Sexual function was affected similarly in both genders, but effective interventions were reported only for men. In some studies, OSA severity and medications contributed to greater sexual dysfunction. In women, menopausal status, hormone levels and SaO2 < 90% were determinants of sexual dysfunction, while for men factors included BMI, hormonal status and inflammatory markers. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) not only improved clinical measures such as excessive daytime sleepiness but also the erectile and orgasmic function. Nevertheless, sildenafil was superior CPAP with regard to erectile dysfunction.Conclusions: The findings illustrate important contributors to sexual dysfunction; however, firm generalisations cannot be made. There were limited RCTs and none for women, indicating further RCTs are needed to determine how OSA affects sexual function.

AB  - Background: Evidence is growing that the equilibrium between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants plays a vital role in women's reproductive health.Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate variations in serum antioxidant concentrations across the menstrual cycle and associations between antioxidants and reproductive hormones and anovulation among healthy women.Methods: The BioCycle Study, a prospective cohort, followed 259 women aged 18-44 y for up to 2 menstrual cycles. Serum fat-soluble vitamin and micronutrient (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, retinol, lutein, lycopene, and β-carotene), ascorbic acid, and reproductive hormone concentrations were measured 5-8 times/cycle. We used weighted linear mixed models to assess associations between antioxidants and hormone concentrations, after adjustment for age, race, body mass index, parity, sleep, pain medication use, total energy intake, concurrent hormones, serum cholesterol, F2-isoprostanes, and other antioxidants. Generalized linear models were used to identify associations with anovulation.Results: Serum antioxidant concentrations varied across the menstrual cycle. Retinol and α-tocopherol were associated with higher estradiol [RR: 1.00 pg/mL (95% CI: 0.67, 1.34 pg/mL); RR: 0.02 pg/mL (95% CI: 0.003, 0.03 pg/mL), respectively] and testosterone [RR: 0.61 ng/dL (95% CI: 0.44, 0.78 ng/dL); RR: 0.01 ng/dL (95% CI: 0.001, 0.01 ng/dL), respectively]. Ascorbic acid was associated with higher progesterone (RR: 0.15 ng/mL; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.25 ng/mL) and with lower follicle-stimulating hormone (RR: -0.06 mIU/mL; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03 mIU/mL). The ratio of α- to γ-tocopherol was associated with an increased risk of anovulation (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06).Conclusions: These findings shed new light on the intricate associations between serum antioxidants and endogenous hormones in healthy premenopausal women and support the hypothesis that concentrations of serum vitamins affect steroidogenesis even after adjustment for oxidative stress.

AB  - Objective: Hot flashes are classic symptoms of menopause. Emerging data link hot flashes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet whether hot flashes are related to brain health is poorly understood. We examined the relationship between hot flashes (measured via physiologic monitor and self-report) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) among midlife women.Methods: Twenty midlife women (aged 40-60 y) without clinical CVD, with an intact uterus and ovaries, and not taking hormone therapy were recruited. Women underwent 24 hours of ambulatory physiologic and diary hot flash monitoring to quantify hot flashes; magnetic resonance imaging to assess WMH burden; 72 hours of actigraphy to quantify sleep; and a blood draw, questionnaires, and physical measures to quantify demographics and CVD risk factors. Tests of a priori hypotheses regarding relationships between physiologically monitored and self-reported wake and sleep hot flashes and WMH were conducted in linear regression models.Results: More physiologically monitored hot flashes during sleep were associated with greater WMH, controlling for age, race, and body mass index (β [SE] = 0.0002 [0.0001], P = 0.03]. Findings persisted after controlling for sleep characteristics and additional CVD risk factors. No relationships were observed for self-reported hot flashes.Conclusions: More physiologically monitored hot flashes during sleep are associated with greater WMH burden among midlife women without clinical CVD. Results suggest that the relationship between hot flashes and CVD risk observed in the periphery may extend to the brain. Future work should consider the unique role of sleep hot flashes in brain health.

AB  - Background: An association between obstructive sleep apnea and the incidence of heart failure has been reported in men but not in women. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a combination of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness, the two main symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, was able to predict incident heart failure in a population-based sample of women.Methods: The population-based cohort study Sleep and Health in Women (SHE; n = 5990 women born between 1901 and 1980) was used, with baseline questionnaire data from April 2000 relating to snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and covariates. Using data retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register and Cause of Death Register, the follow-up of incident heart failure continued until 31 December 2011.Results: Among women with both snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness at baseline, 5.3% developed heart failure during follow-up compared with 0.9% in the reference group with neither snoring nor excessive daytime sleepiness. After adjustment for age, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, physical inactivity, depressive symptoms, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, women with the combination of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness had a twofold increase in the risk of incident heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.4).Conclusion: Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, that is, the combination of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness, are associated with an increased risk of developing heart failure in women.

AB  - Insomnia affects 10% to 30% of the population with a total cost of $92.5 to $107.5 billion annually. Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability, poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women, especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia. Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for refractory cases.

AB  - Background: The high prevalence of women that do not reach the recommended level of physical activity is worrisome. A sedentary lifestyle has negative consequences on health status and increases health care costs. The main objective of this project is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a primary care-based exercise intervention in perimenopausal women.Methods/design: The present study is a Randomized Controlled Trial. A total of 150 eligible women will be recruited and randomly assigned to either a 16-week exercise intervention (3 sessions/week), or to usual care (control) group. The primary outcome measure is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The secondary outcome measures are: i) socio-demographic and clinical information; ii) body composition; iii) dietary patterns; iv) glycaemic and lipid profile; v) physical fitness; vi) physical activity and sedentary behaviour; vii) sleep quality; viii) quality of life, mental health and positive health; ix) menopause symptoms. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post intervention. The data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. In addition, we will conduct a cost effectiveness analysis from a health system perspective.Discussion: The intervention designed is feasible and if it proves to be clinically and cost effective, it can be easily transferred to other similar contexts. Consequently, the findings of this project might help the Health Systems to identify strategies for primary prevention and health promotion as well as to reduce health care requirements and costs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02358109.

AB  - Melatonin is a neurohormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland that controls circadian rhythm, which is primarily regulated by light. Although melatonin levels are known to be altered in individuals with sleep disorders, melatonin also has modulatory effects on other body systems, including the skeletal and immune systems. In addition, melatonin has been shown to interfere with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and to have significant antioxidant effects, both directly and via its metabolites. Melatonin levels vary throughout human life and are known to decrease with age but the effects of declining melatonin levels are poorly understood. In women, this age-related decrease in melatonin levels coincides with the menopause. This review aims to summarize the impact of altered melatonin levels in aging women and the outcomes of exogenous replacement therapies.

AB  - Objective: To describe self-reported menopausal symptom priorities and their association with demographics and other symptoms among participants in an intervention trial for vasomotor symptoms (VMS).Methods: Cross-sectional study embedded in the MsFLASH 02 trial, a three-by-two factorial design of yoga vs. exercise vs. usual activity and omega-3-fatty acid vs. placebo. At baseline, women (n = 354) completed hot flush diaries, a card sort task to prioritize symptoms they would most like to alleviate, and standardized questionnaires.Results: The most common symptom priorities were: VMS (n = 322), sleep (n = 191), concentration (n = 140), and fatigue (n = 116). In multivariate models, women who chose VMS as their top priority symptom (n = 210) reported significantly greater VMS severity (p = 0.004) and never smoking (p = 0.012), and women who chose sleep as their top priority symptom (n = 100) were more educated (p ≤ 0.001) and had worse sleep quality (p < 0.001). ROC curves identified sleep scale scores that were highly predictive of ranking sleep as a top priority symptom.Conclusions: Among women entering an intervention trial for VMS and with relatively low prevalence of depression and anxiety, VMS was the priority symptom for treatment. A card sort may be a valid tool for quickly assessing symptom priorities in clinical practice and research.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Provide evidence-based recent data on oral micronized progesterone (OMP) and progestins in menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT).Recent Findings: Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) increases breast cancer acting through the glucocorticoid receptor; progestins in MHT increase thrombosis more than oral estrogens; MPA, but not OMP or other progestins, increase monocyte cell endothelium adhesion; MPA and estradiol (E2)/MPA have negative brain effects, whereas E2/progesterone (P4) has neuroregenerative brain effects. The 'window of opportunity' cardiovascular disease hypothesis is not supported by a randomized controlled trial showing that transdermal estradiol with sequential OMP in early menopause does not prevent increased carotid intimal media thickness; P4 in the cardiac electrical system opposes E2 effects and prevents sudden death/long QT syndrome; transdermal estradiol/OMP does not increase venous thromboembolism in observational data. P4 decreases breast cell proliferation and improves prognosis through P4 receptor alteration of estrogen receptor α genetic effects; OMP with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)/estrogen (E)/E2 does not increase breast cancer in two prospective cohorts, one population-based. Endometrial cancer is increased in MHT of CEE/E/E2+cyclic OMP at 200 mg/day.Summary: New data show CEE/E/E2+MPA/P mechanisms for negative breast cancer, venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular system, and brain effects. OMP/P4 counterbalances CEE/E/E2-related negative effects on breast cancer and long QT syndrome. OMP effectively treats vasomotor symptoms and sleep disturbances, and could safely be used alone for symptomatic menopause.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To examine the psychometric properties of the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale. Background. Sleep disturbances are an extensive and common problem among menopausal women. However, no unique and specific scale has yet been developed to detect the inductive symptoms distresses that cause poor sleep quality for menopausal women. Design. A cross-sectional design. Methods. The Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale was based on in-depth interviews with menopausal women and literature review. Convenience sampling was employed. One hundred and fifty three women participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis, concurrent validity and contrasting group validity were used to examine the validity of the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale. Cronbach's a was conducted to test the reliability. The accuracy of the scale was analysed with the receiver operating characteristic from MED CALC version 10.4.8.0 software. The scale's sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were analysed to locate the best cut-off point. Results. One factor was generated by Exploratory factor analysis, and this factor explained 49-07% of total variance. In addition, the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale had significant positive correlations with the Greene Climacteric Scale and the self-evaluation of menopausal symptoms scale. Cronbach's a of the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale was 0-89. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy probability of the scale's receiver operating characteristic curve was 0-85. The best cut-off point was three with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 87%. Conclusions. The Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale had good reliability and validity, as well as refined indicators for assessing the tool's accuracy. Relevance to clinical Practice. The Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale is easy to use, can quickly detect the sleep conditions of menopausal women who suffer from menopausal symptom distress, and provide efficient nursing interventions to relieve menopausal symptom distresses, and then improve sleep quality.

AB  - The menstrual cycle is an example of a human infradian rhythm, but an altered sleep–wake cycle or a disrupted circadian rhythm can change the regularity of the menstrual cycle. In this study, we investigated whether an irregular menstrual cycle is associated with polymorphisms in theCLOCK(3111T > C) and/orPER3(variable number tandem repeat, VNTR) genes, which are known to have an impact on the circadian rhythm. One hundred ninety-seven postmenarchal, adolescent girls from two girls’ high schools in Seoul, Korea, were studied. All participants were requested to complete the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess the emotional distress that might cause menstrual irregularity. Every participant donated a blood sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped for theCLOCK3111T > C andPER3VNTR polymorphisms. A significant association was found between theCLOCK3111T > C genotype and irregular menstrual cycles. Subjects with the 3111T > C genotype had a high risk of an irregular menstrual cycle compared with 3111T/T homozygous subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26–6.55). When multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for age, PSS, STAI, BDI and BMI, subjects with the 3111T > C polymorphism showed a significantly increased OR for irregular menstrual cycles (OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.32–7.21). There was no significant association between thePER3VNTR polymorphism and the irregularity of the menstrual cycle (p > 0.05). The results of this study suggest that theCLOCK3111T > C polymorphism could be an independent risk factor for irregular menstrual cycles, irrespective of psychological distress and endocrine or metabolic conditions, and could be used as a molecular marker for gynecological studies on this aspect.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare perimenopausal symptomatology using a levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) + low-dose transdermal estradiol (TDE) with LNG-IUS alone.Methods: The trial was a double-blind, randomized, controlled pilot trial. Regularly cycling women aged 38 to 52 years, with at least one self-reported symptom (hot flashes, bloating, headache, adverse mood, or poor sleep), were randomized to either LNG-IUS + low-dose TDE gel (intervention) or LNG-IUS alone (control). TDE was administered once daily as a 0.06% gel containing 0.75 mg of TDE for 50 days. LNG-IUS was placed at least 90 days before TDE or placebo gel treatment to assure stable circulating LNG. Participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD), Hot Flash Related Daily Interference scale (HFRDIS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) at the time of LNG-IUS placement, at 90 days (the time of randomization to TDE/placebo), and 140 days (end of study). TDE and placebo groups were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance.Results: Thirty-eight women aged 42.9 ± 2.7 years, with a mean BMI of 24.7 ± 3.3 kg/m², were enrolled; 20 were randomized to TDE. Women receiving TDE had significantly improved FSS scores between days 90 and 140 (mean difference TDE: -0.8 ± 1.2 vs placebo: 0.1 ± 0.7; P = 0.026) and borderline significant improvement in HFRDIS scores (mean difference TDE: -5.5 ± 15.3 vs placebo: 4.2 ± 13.1; P = 0.076). Women who reported hot flashes at baseline and who received TDE had a significant decrease in HFRDIS scores between days 90 and 140 (n = 9, P = 0.035). CESD and PSQI scores were not associated with TDE use.Conclusions: A brief, low-dose estrogen intervention, combined with a LNG-IUS, led to significant improvement of some common perimenopausal symptoms. Such a "minimalist" approach to management of the perimenopause holds promise for reducing common, bothersome perimenopausal symptoms while maintaining effective contraception.

AB  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named "mixed)", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

AB  - Objective: Our first aim was to investigate the effects of caffeine on preterm infants' respiratory functions and brain cortical activity (conventional and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (cEEG and aEEG)). Secondary aim was to study its long-term effects on respiratory system and electroencephalographic maturation by 36 weeks post-menstrual age.Methods: Prospective observational study on 33 consecutively admitted preterm infants less than 34-weeks-gestation. cEEG and aEEG, cardiopulmonary and sleep state were recorded in 20 preterm infants, before, during and 2-hours after intravenous (IV) caffeine (caffeine Group), and for 13 preterms (control group). Both groups were subjected to assessment of cerebral cortical maturation by cEEG and aEEG at 36-weeks post-menstrual age as an outcome measure.Results: IV caffeine administration significantly increased heart rate (p = 0.000), mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.000), capillary oxygen saturation (p = 0.003), arousability (p = 0.000) and aEEG continuity (p = 0.002) after half an hour. No clinical seizures were recorded and non-significant difference was found in electrographic seizures activity in cEEG. At 36-weeks post-conceptional age, NICU stay was significantly longer in controls (p = 0.022). aEEG score was significantly higher in caffeine group than the control group, (p = 0.000).Conclusions: Caffeine increases preterm infants' cerebral cortical activity during infusion and results in cerebral cortical maturation at 36weeks, without increase in seizure activity.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of improving sleep quality interventions in menopausal women with sleep disturbance. Background: Sleep disturbances are an extensive and common problem among menopausal women. There is an increased trend in the use of non-pharmacological methods to alleviate sleep disturbances. Studies that have implemented two or more non-pharmacological strategies for menopausal women are scant. Methods: A repeat measurement with a randomized assignment was conducted. A total of 59 menopausal women with sleep disturbance were recruited and randomly assigned to experimental (n = 29) and control (n = 30) groups. Participants in the experimental group received four 2-hour improving sleep quality activities, whereas the control group received regular greeting calls. Sleep quality was measured prior to intervention, and on the 5th and 8th weeks by using the Pittsburg's Sleep Quality Index, and Actiwatch was worn before and during the 8 weeks of intervention. Generalized estimating equation was used to analyze data. Results: The results revealed that subjective sleep quality had significant main effect in group and time. The findings of the objective measurement showed that participants in the experimental group had significantly shorter frequency of awakening time and increased sleep efficiency. Conclusion: The improving sleep quality intervention is a healthy and cost-effective method to improve sleep quality in community-dwelling menopausal women with sleep disturbance.

AB  - Background: Primary dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology, is a common, and often debilitating, gynecological condition that affects between 45 and 95% of menstruating women. Despite the high prevalence, dysmenorrhea is often poorly treated, and even disregarded, by health professionals, pain researchers, and the women themselves, who may accept it as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. This review reports on current knowledge, particularly with regards to the impact and consequences of recurrent menstrual pain on pain sensitivity, mood, quality of life and sleep in women with primary dysmenorrhea.Methods: Comprehensive literature searches on primary dysmenorrhea were performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. Full-text manuscripts published between the years 1944 and 2015 were reviewed for relevancy and reference lists were cross-checked for additional relevant studies. In combination with the word 'dysmenorrhea' one or more of the following search terms were used to obtain articles published in peer-reviewed journals only: pain, risk factors, etiology, experimental pain, clinical pain, adenomyosis, chronic pain, women, menstrual cycle, hyperalgesia, pain threshold, pain tolerance, pain sensitivity, pain reactivity, pain perception, central sensitization, quality of life, sleep, treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Results: Women with dysmenorrhea, compared with women without dysmenorrhea, have greater sensitivity to experimental pain both within and outside areas of referred menstrual pain. Importantly, the enhanced pain sensitivity is evident even in phases of the menstrual cycle when women are not experiencing menstrual pain, illustrating that long-term differences in pain perception extend outside of the painful menstruation phase. This enhanced pain sensitivity may increase susceptibility to other chronic pain conditions in later life; dysmenorrhea is a risk factor for fibromyalgia. Further, dysmenorrheic pain has an immediate negative impact on quality of life, for up to a few days every month. Women with primary dysmenorrhea have a significantly reduced quality of life, poorer mood and poorer sleep quality during menstruation compared with their pain-free follicular phase, and compared with the menstruation phase of pain-free control women. The prescribed first-line therapy for menstrual pain remains non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are effective in relieving daytime and night-time pain.Conclusion: Further study is needed to determine whether effectively blocking dysmenorrheic pain ameliorates risk for the development of chronic pain disorders and to explore whether it is possible to prevent the development-and not just treat-severe dysmenorrheic pain in adolescent girls. In conclusion, we demonstrate the extensive multi-factorial impact of dysmenorrhea and we encourage and direct researchers to necessary future studies.

AB  - The article discusses a study by BA Prairie et al on the co-occurrence of a triad of the symptoms namely sleep disorders, depressed mood and sexual dysfunction. It points out that the symptoms depict a strong association between sleep quality and its duration and sexual function in women. It cites a study by DA Kalmbach et al on changes in sleep duration, sleep quality and sleep onset latency and its correspondences to variations in sexual response and sexual activity in young healthy women.

AB  - The article presents the authors' reply to a letter from Dr. Coelho et al about their article reporting on the symptom triad of depressed mood, sleep disturbances and sexual problems. They agree that continued investigation on the symptom clusters will elucidate menopausal experience and concur that the rates of sleep disturbance and sexual problems in their sample are consistent with previously reported literature. They note that mood symptoms affect both sleep and sexual function.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify clusters of midlife women by sleep-related symptoms in multiethnic groups and to examine racial/ethnic differences in the clusters.Methods: This secondary analysis was conducted on data from 1,054 midlife women who participated in two cross-sectional descriptive national Internet surveys. The instruments included questions on background characteristics, health, and menopause status, and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women. The data were analyzed using hierarchical clustering methods, χ2 test, analysis of variance, and multinomial logistic regression analyses.Results: A four-cluster solution was adopted: cluster 1 (low total symptoms group), cluster 2 (moderate physical and psychosomatic symptoms group), cluster 3 (moderate psychological symptoms group), and cluster 4 (high total symptoms group). There were significant differences in education, employment status, family income, social support, country of birth, race/ethnicity, body mass index, perceived general health, diagnosed disease, access to health care, and menopause status among clusters (P < 0.05). In cluster 1 only, there were significant racial/ethnic differences in the total number of total severity scores for physical symptoms (P < 0.01). When racial/ethnic differences in individual symptoms in each cluster were determined, there were no consistent racial/ethnic differences.Conclusions: Researchers need to consider that racial/ethnic differences could be prominent in midlife women with low sleep-related symptoms.

AB  - Objective: Women, especially those with hot flashes, report poor sleep quality during various stages of the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Sleep measurements vary widely because of the copious instruments available. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a frequently used questionnaire that produces a single score for sleep quality. This one-factor structure has not received consistent support in the literature. The goal of this analysis was to determine the best factor structure of the PSQI in women with hot flashes.Methods: A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on PSQI baseline data from three randomized controlled clinical trials enrolling perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes (N = 849) from the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health network. Several a priori factor models were compared.Results: One-factor and two-factor models did not fit the data. A three-factor model comprising sleep efficiency, perceived sleep quality, and daily disturbance showed good fit; however, the sleep medication item was dropped because of poor fit and low rates of sleep medication use. The three-factor model was examined in African-American and white subsamples and was found to be similar in both groups; however, two items showed small group differences in strength as indicators.Conclusions: Sleep quality in midlife women with hot flashes, as measured by the PSQI, seems to comprise three correlated factors. Minor measurement differences detected between groups are of research interest but do not necessitate different scoring practices. Additional research is needed to further define sleep quality and its associations with health-related outcomes.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate differences and similarities in the prevalence of postmenopausal symptoms and their impact on postmenopausal women and male partners of postmenopausal women in North America and Europe.Methods: The Internet-based survey Clarifying Vaginal Atrophy's Impact on Sex and Relationships (CLOSER) was conducted in North America and Europe. The questionnaire included questions on symptoms experienced by women after menopause and the impact of these symptoms overall and specifically on emotional and physical relationships. This study included 8,200 respondents: 4,100 were postmenopausal women who had experienced vaginal discomfort and 4,100 were male partners of postmenopausal women with this symptom. Differences were significant at the 95% level of confidence.Results: The survey identified vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and weight gain as the top five symptoms experienced by postmenopausal women in North America and Europe. Overall, symptoms were found to be more prevalent in women from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada (P < 0.05), and less prevalent in women from Sweden and Italy compared with other countries. In regards to the impact of symptoms overall and on emotional and physical relationships, the greatest number of women from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada found the impact to be "worse than expected."Conclusions: The impact of postmenopausal symptoms on relationships is greater in women from countries where symptoms are more prevalent. Postmenopausal women and male partners of postmenopausal women may benefit from greater education about menopause and open discussions with their healthcare provider.

AB  - Background: Although habitual low-to-moderate alcohol intake has been linked with reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity, the effect of recent alcohol intake on female reproductive function has not been clearly established. Objective: We assessed the relation between acute alcohol consumption, reproductive hormones, and markers of menstrual cycle dysfunction including sporadic anovulation, irregular cycle length, luteal phase deficiency, long menses, and heavy blood loss. Design: A total of 259 healthy, premenopausal women from Western New York were followed for #2 menstrual cycles (2005-2007) and provided fasting blood specimens during #8 visits/cycle and four 24-h dietary recalls/cycle. Linear mixed models were used to estimate associations between previous day's alcohol intake and hormone concentrations, whereas Poisson regression was used to assess RR of cycle-average alcohol intake and menstrual cycle function. Results: For every alcoholic drink consumed, the geometric mean total and free estradiol, total and free testosterone, and luteinizing hormone were higher by 5.26% (95% CI: 1.27%, 9.41%), 5.82% (95% CI: 1.81%, 9.99%), 1.56% (95% CI: 0.23%, 2.90%), 1.42% (95% CI: 0.02%, 2.84%), and 6.18% (95% CI: 2.02%, 10.52%), respectively, after adjustment for age, race, percentage of body fat, perceived stress, painmedication use, sexual activity, caffeine, and sleep. Binge compared with nonbinge drinking (defined as reporting $4 compared with ,4 drinks/d, respectively) was associated with 64.35% (95% CI: 18.09%, 128.71%) and 63.53% (95% CI: 17.41%, 127.73%) higher total and free estradiol. No statistically significant associations were shown between cycle-average alcohol intake and menstrual cycle function. Conclusion: Although recent moderate alcohol intake does not appear to have adverse short-term effects on menstrual cycle function, including sporadic anovulation, potential protective and deleterious long-term effects of alterations in reproductive hormones on other chronic diseases warrant additional investigation.

AB  - Purpose: Observational studies suggest that menopausal hormone therapy protects against sleep-disordered breathing, but such findings may be biased by a "healthy user effect." When the Women's Health Initiative Study reported in 2002 that estrogen-progestin therapy increases heart disease risk, many women discontinued hormone therapy. We investigate healthy user bias in the association of hormone therapy with sleep-disordered breathing in the Sleep in Midlife Women Study.Methods: A total of 228 women aged 38 to 62 years were recruited from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. They underwent polysomnography to measure apnea-hypopnea index, at home semiannually from 1997 to 2006, and in the sleep laboratory every four years (n = 1828 studies). Hormone therapy was recorded monthly. Linear models with empirical standard errors regressed logarithm of apnea-hypopnea index on hormone use with a pre- or post-July 2002 interaction, adjusting for menopause and age.Results: The association of hormone therapy and sleep-disordered breathing was heterogeneous (P < .01); apnea-hypopnea index among users was 15% lower in the early period (95% confidence interval, -27% to -1%), but similar to nonusers in the late.Conclusions: Hormone therapy was negatively associated with sleep-disordered breathing only until the Women's Health Initiative results were publicized. Hormone therapy may have been a marker for healthfulness in the early period, creating a spurious association with sleep-disordered breathing.

AB  - Purpose: Melatonin has anti-carcinogenic properties, including modulation of estradiol production, cell cycle regulation, and promotion of apoptosis. Urinary melatonin has been inversely associated with breast cancer in some studies, but the association with ovarian cancer has not been investigated.Methods: We measured urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) in nested ovarian cancer case-control studies in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; n = 100 cases; 199 controls) and NHSII (n = 52 cases; 105 controls); samples were mainly from first morning voids. Controls were matched to cases on year of birth, menopause status, use of menopausal hormone therapy, and urine collection characteristics. We evaluated the association of tertiles of aMT6s, corrected for creatinine concentrations, with risk of ovarian cancer using conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for key ovarian cancer risk factors, and we additionally evaluated adjustment for usual sleep duration, snoring, and history of rotating night shift work.Results: aMT6s was not significantly associated with risk of ovarian cancer. In multivariable models, the odds ratio comparing the highest tertile of aMT6s to the lowest was 0.79, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.40-1.56 in the NHS and 2.88, and 95 % CI in the NHSII 0.97-8.52. Additional adjustment for sleep habits and night shift work had little impact on the observed results. We observed no clear association between urinary melatonin and ovarian cancer risk.Conclusions: These results are consistent with our previous study in which we reported no association between night shift work and ovarian cancer; however, given the small sample size in our study, additional evaluation in larger studies is warranted.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to explore the association of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and depression symptoms with different symptoms of subjective sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women.Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 163 postmenopausal women (not taking hormone therapy) attending a university menopause clinic. Measures included the Athens Insomnia Scale, Greene Climacteric Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised depression subscale. Covariate-adjusted ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate the association of VMS and depression with each item of the Athens Insomnia Scale.Results: Controlling for confounding factors, we found VMS to be significantly associated with awakenings during the night (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; P < 0.001), overall quality of sleep (OR, 2.00; P < 0.001), well-being during the day (OR, 1.63; P = 0.008), functioning capacity during the day (OR, 1.72; P = 0.01), and sleepiness during the day (OR, 1.66; P = 0.03); whereas we found Symptom Checklist-90-Revised depression subscale scores to be associated with sleep induction (OR, 2.09; P < 0.001), final awakening earlier than desired (OR, 2.21; P < 0.001), total sleep duration (OR, 1.62; P = 0.01), overall quality of sleep (OR, 1.64; P = 0.009), well-being during the day (OR, 1.67; P = 0.006), functioning capacity during the day (OR, 1.68; P = 0.01), and sleepiness during the day (OR, 1.57; P = 0.04).Conclusions: VMS and depression symptoms are associated with different patterns of sleep disturbance. Although both symptoms are related to sleep quality, daytime functioning, and daytime well-being, depression is uniquely associated with difficulty falling asleep and waking up earlier than desired, whereas VMS are related to frequent awakenings during sleep. The findings are limited by the cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size of the study. Recommendations for future research are discussed to guide this line of inquiry and to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between climacteric and mood symptoms and their contribution to the development of sleep disturbances during menopause.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to elicit midlife women's heuristics about symptom clusters they were experiencing, as identified by the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool for Menopause (C-SCAT M).Methods: Women aged 40 to 60 years who were experiencing symptoms that they associated with menopause were recruited through flyers posted on campus and in clinics. Women completed the C-SCAT M application (app), using an iPad, by identifying and drawing symptom clusters they experienced during the last 24 hours, indicating relationships among symptoms, prioritizing the clusters and symptoms within them, making causal attributions, and identifying exacerbating and ameliorating factors. They were asked to prioritize the clusters and a symptom within each cluster. While women were completing the app, they were asked to "think aloud" about their experience using the app. Data generated from the C-SCAT M app were transmitted securely to an Amazon Web Services account and saved as screen images and Excel files to preserve both graphical images and text elicited from the app. Qualitative data were saved in verbatim phrases. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data.Results: Thirty women completed the app. Most women (77%) stated that the final diagrams were very/extremely accurate in depicting their symptoms and their connections. Women reported between 1 and 22 symptoms (median, 11). Hot flashes, waking up during the night, night sweats, and early morning awakening were the most commonly reported symptoms. Women rated hot flashes as their most bothersome symptom, followed by waking up during the night and fatigue. They reported more than 300 different bivariate relationships between their symptoms and more than 150 unique causal paths. They believed that hot flashes caused several symptoms, especially sleep disruption, and most could describe the time order of their symptoms. Women reported clusters consisting of 2 to 18 symptoms. Women also named each cluster based on their response to their symptoms ("really annoying"), time of occurrence ("night problem"), and symptoms included in the cluster ("hot flash"). They attributed their clusters to menopause, life demands, and other symptoms, among other causes. Management strategies that women used included over-the-counter preparations, sleep, rest, and other lifestyle changes. Some women requested for a copy of their final symptom cluster diagram to discuss with their healthcare providers.Conclusions: Use of the C-SCAT M affords women an opportunity to depict their symptoms and clusters and the relationships between them and to provide narrative data about their heuristics. Women's unsolicited comments about using the cluster diagram to facilitate conversations (about their symptoms) with their healthcare providers suggest the potential value of modifying the C-SCAT M and evaluating its use in a healthcare setting.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women attending a menopause clinic.Methods: The records of 351 women aged 40 to 76 years who enrolled in a health and nutrition education program at a menopause clinic were analyzed cross-sectionally. The prevalence of frequency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and stress incontinence was estimated based on women's responses to the Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire. Effects of background characteristics, including age, menopause status, vaginal dryness, body composition, cardiovascular parameters, physical fitness, and psychological symptoms, on storage LUTS were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results: Frequency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and stress incontinence were reported by 45.9%, 10.8%, 11.4%, and 32.8% of women, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed independent associations between storage LUTS and the following predictors after adjustment: frequency was associated with nonrestorative sleep score (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.35-1.95); nocturia was associated with nonrestorative sleep score (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.57-3.25) and waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18); urge incontinence was associated with reaction time (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19); and stress incontinence was associated with body fat (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09).Conclusions: Storage LUTS are highly prevalent in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women attending a menopause clinic. Nonrestorative sleep score is associated with frequency and nocturia; body fat and visceral fat accumulation are associated with nocturia and stress incontinence; and delayed reaction time is associated with urge incontinence. Careful evaluation of nonrestorative sleep, body fat and visceral fat accumulation, or delayed reaction time might reveal undisclosed storage LUTS in this population.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to describe time trends in and patterns of use of hormonal contraception and postmenopausal hormone therapy and to identify factors associated with their use among Spanish women.Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from 1,954 population controls (aged 24-85 y) in 12 provinces of Spain who were enrolled in the Multi Case-Control Spain study (2007-2013). Data were collected from a questionnaire conducted face-to-face by trained personnel. We collected information on sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, sleep patterns, reproductive history, and occupational history.Results: Overall, 48.5% of Spanish women reported ever use of hormonal contraception, and 9.8% of women in the postmenopausal group reported use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Younger cohorts used hormonal contraception for a longer period, whereas postmenopausal hormone therapy use dramatically dropped in the 2000s. Women with higher education levels (including education of partners) and smoking history were the most probable users of hormonal contraception, whereas inverse associations were observed among housewives, obese women, and nulliparous women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy use was associated with a surgical or therapeutic cause of menopause and with occupational history of rotating shifts.Conclusions: In this Spanish population, several demographic, lifestyle, occupational, and reproductive factors are associated with use of hormonal compounds. Characterizing hormonal users and monitoring trends in the use of these hormonal compounds are essential from a public health perspective.

AB  - Background: Melatonin is often used as a sleeping aid in elderly adults. As previous studies suggest a protective role of melatonin against osteoporosis, it is important to document its safety. Treatment should not cause any hangover effect that could potentially lead to falls and fractures. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin on balance- and muscle function.Methods and Patients: In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we randomized 81 postmenopausal women with osteopenia to receive 1 or 3 mg melatonin, or placebo nightly for 12 months. Postural balance as well as muscle function was measured. In addition, we assessed quality of life and sleep at baseline and after 12 months treatment.Results: Compared to placebo, one-year treatment with melatonin did not affect postural balance or risk of falls. Furthermore, no significant changes between groups were observed in muscle strength in neither upper- nor lower extremities. Treatment did not affect quality of life or sleep. However, in the subgroup of women with sleep disturbances at baseline, a trend towards an improved sleep quality was seen (p = 0.08).Conclusion: Treatment with melatonin is safe in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. There is no hangover effect affecting balance- and muscle function following the intake of melatonin. In women with a good quality of sleep, melatonin has no effect, however in poor quality of sleep, small doses of melatonin trended towards improving the quality.Trial Registration: (# NCT01690000).

AB  - Background: Sleep and mood disturbances in women have often been linked to the menstrual cycle, implying an ovarian hormonal causation. However, most studies in this area have used self-reported menstrual cycle phase rather than direct measurement of ovarian hormone concentrations. Further, many studies have focused primarily on peri- and postmenopausal populations reporting clinical sleep difficulty. In this study, we examined the associations among sleep quality, mood, and ovarian hormone concentration in a random sample of community-dwelling, nonclinical women of reproductive age.Methods: Our sample consisted of 19 non-help-seeking women aged 18-43 years, each contributing an average of 39.5 nights of data. Over the 42 days of the study, we collected self-reported and actigraphic sleep-quality data, concentrations of urinary estrogen and progesterone metabolites (estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G) and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide [PdG], respectively), and daily mood ratings. Linear-mixed models were used to estimate associations, clustering longitudinal observations by the participant.Results: We found a significant positive association between Sleep Efficiency and E1G, and a significant negative association between Sleep Efficiency and PdG. Otherwise, the self-reported and actigraphic sleep measures were not associated with ovarian hormone concentrations. Self-reported sleep was strongly associated with mood, whereas actigraphic sleep was associated with only two of the 11 individual mood items, "Feeling on Top of Things" and "Difficulty Coping."Conclusions: In this community sample of women of reproductive age, ovarian hormones play little, if any, role in day-to-day sleep quality. Our findings additionally highlight the different associations that self-reported and actigraphic sleep show with hormones and mood.

AB  - The menopause transition is associated with various symptoms, which can interact to produce morbidity. Vasomotor symptoms are the most commonly reported, but vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, sleep difficulties and adverse mood changes have all been shown to worsen as women approach menopause. For postmenopausal women changes in cognition are more likely to be related to aging and not to hormones. This article reviews the symptoms of hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms), vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, adverse mood, poor sleep/insomnia, and cognitive complaints, describing their epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article thus reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these common menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Objectives: Mania in bipolar disorder (BD) and partial (focal) seizures (PS) arising from the temporal lobes, have a number of similarities. Typically, a chronic course of the disorders is punctuated by acute illness episodes. Common features of episodes may include sensory, perceptual, cognitive and affective changes. Both respond to anticonvulsant treatment. Common mechanisms imputed include neurotransmitters and kindling processes. Further investigation may improve understanding of the occurrence of both mania and PS, casting light on the relevance of temporal lobe mediated processes and pathology. One avenue of investigation is to compare aetiological factors and determine the extent of overlap which may indicate shared brain localization or pathophysiology. Aetiology includes predisposing, precipitating or perpetuating factors. This paper examines the literature on precipitating factors of mania, first or subsequent episode, and of PS in diagnosed epilepsy, which is the second or subsequent seizure, to identify the extent and nature of their overlap.Method: Narrative review based on a literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar.Results: Precipitating factors for both mania and PS were stress, sleep deprivation, antidepressant medication and, tentatively, emotion. For mania alone, goal-attainment events, spring and summer season, postpartum, and drugs include steroids and stimulants. For PS alone, winter season, menstruation and specific triggers in complex reflex epilepsies. Those not substantiated include lunar phase and menopause. A wide range of chemicals may provoke isolated seizures but by definition epilepsy requires at least two seizures.Conclusions: The overlap of precipitating factors in mania and PS imply that common brain processes may contribute to both, consistent with findings from neuroscience research.

AB  - Objective: To investigate subjective sleep quality among women in the menopausal period and to confirm and diagnose the possible sleep disturbances with polysomnographic (PSG) evaluation objectively. Material and Methods: Sixty-seven women with menopause were enrolled in the study. Sociodemographic characteristics and the features of menopause were recorded. We assessed subjective sleep quality with Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). To confirm sleep disturbances and further diagnose the underlying cause, PSG evaluation was performed to women with PSQI scores of >5 who gave their approval. Results: Mean PSQI score of women with normal PSG evaluation was 12.00±3.16, while it was 11.00±2.32 in women with abnormal PSG evaluation (p=0.466); 59.7% (n=40) of women had poor sleep quality. Among these, 11 (64.7%) had abnormal results in the PSG evaluation and were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS); 54.5% had mild OSAS, 27.3% had moderate, and 18.2% had severe OSAS. Conclusion: PSQI and PSG evaluations would give a chance to demonstrate sleep problems and shed a light on treatment options according to the underlying causes of sleep disturbances in menopause.

AB  - Objective: Women diagnosed as having breast cancer may experience difficulties with posttreatment effects such as menopausal symptoms. The aims of this pilot study were to (1) evaluate the impact of a multimodal lifestyle program on reducing menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer and (2) examine the impact of the program on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adherence to lifestyle recommendations.Methods: Overall, 55 women aged 45 to 60 years with one moderate to severe menopausal symptom and a history of breast cancer were randomized into an intervention group (n = 26) or a control group (n = 29). Women in the intervention group received a lifestyle intervention (The Pink Women's Wellness Program) that included clinical consultations and a tailored health education program. Measurements of menopausal symptoms (Greene Climacteric Scale), HRQoL (SF-12 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), and modifiable lifestyle factors (food intake, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use, and sleep disturbance) were taken at baseline and 12 weeks.Results: Women in the intervention group reported clinically significant reductions in many menopausal symptoms, specifically somatic symptoms (d = 0.52), vasomotor symptoms (d = 0.55), sexual dysfunction (d = .65), and overall menopausal symptoms (d = 0.54), at 12 weeks compared with the control group (d = 0.03, d = 0.24, d = 0.18, and d = 0.05, respectively). Women in the intervention group reported improvements in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast subscale scores, physical well-being and functional well-being, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General total scores (intervention group: d = 0.54, d = 0.50, and d = 0.48, respectively; control group: d = 0.22, d = 0.11, and d = 0.05, respectively).Conclusions: The Pink Women's Wellness Program is effective in decreasing menopausal symptoms, thus improving HRQoL. This being a pilot study, further research is recommended to investigate the benefits of combining nonpharmacological interventions for women with breast cancer to reduce their treatment-related menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Sleep disorders are commonly observed among postmenopausal women, with negative effects on their quality of life. The search for complementary therapies for sleep disorders during postmenopausal period is of high importance, and acupuncture stands out as an appropriate possibility. The present review intended to systematically evaluate the available literature, compiling studies that have employed acupuncture as treatment to sleep disorders in postmenopausal women. A bibliographic search was performed in PubMed/Medline and Scopus. Articles which had acupuncture as intervention, sleep related measurements as outcomes, and postmenopausal women as target population were included and evaluated according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool and to the STRICTA guidelines. Out of 89 search results, 12 articles composed our final sample. A high heterogeneity was observed among these articles, which prevented us from performing a meta-analysis. Selected articles did not present high risk of bias and had a satisfactory compliance rate with STRICTA guidelines. In general, these studies presented improvements in sleep-related variables. Despite the overall positive effects, acupuncture still cannot be stated as a reliable treatment for sleep-related complaints, not due to inefficacy, but rather limited evidence. Nevertheless, results are promising and new comprehensive and controlled studies in the field are encouraged.

AB  - Objective: To document the prevalence of, and factors associated with, the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and other symptoms of menopause in Australian women aged 40-65 years.Design, Setting and Participants: Cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of Australian women aged 40-65 years living independently in the community. Women able to complete a questionnaire in English were recruited by telephone between October 2013 and March 2014 from a large, representative, national, continually refreshed database derived from the electoral roll.Main Outcome Measures: Use of CAMs for VMS and other menopausal symptoms (eg, arthralgia, depression and sleep disturbance), assessed using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire.Results: Of 5850 women contacted, 2911 agreed to participate, and 2020 eligible women returned completed questionnaires (response rate, 34.53%). Most of the women were postmenopausal (54.90%), resided in metropolitan areas (62.70%) and were born in Australia (80.43%). The prevalence of use of CAMs for VMS was 13.22%. Phytoestrogens were most commonly used for VMS (6.29%), followed by evening primrose oil (3.91%) and ginseng (1.73%). Compared with premenopausal women, perimenopausal women (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.42-3.06) and early postmenopausal women (OR, 1.83, 95% CI, 1.21-2.76) were more likely to use any CAM for VMS. The prevalence of use of CAMs for other symptoms was 32.23%; being postmenopausal and older were the factors associated with this use.Conclusions: Australian women at midlife are using CAMs that are known to be ineffective for managing VMS. Health care providers need to be more involved in guiding women in the treatment of VMS and other menopausal symptoms. More judicious use of supplements such as fish oil and glucosamine, particularly by older women, is needed until their efficacy and safety profiles are better understood.

AB  - Malignancies that affect females who survive cancer commonly originate in, invade, and/or metastasize to the sexual organs, including the ovaries, uterine corpus, uterine cervix, vagina, vulva, fallopian tubes, anus, rectum, breast(s), and brain. Females comprise most of the population (in number and proportion) with cancers that directly affect the sexual organs. Most females in the age groups most commonly affected by cancer are sexually active in the year before diagnosis, which includes most menopausal women who have a partner. Among female cancer survivors, the vast majority have cancers that are treated with local or systemic therapies that result in removal, compromise, or destruction of the sexual organs. Additionally, female cancer survivors often experience abrupt or premature onset of menopause, either directly with surgery, radiation, or other treatments or indirectly through disruption of female sex hormone or other neuroendocrine physiology. For many female patients, cancer treatment has short-term and long-lasting effects on other aspects of physical, psychological, and social functioning that can interfere with normal sexual function; these effects include pain, depression, and anxiety; fatigue and sleep disruption; changes in weight and body image; scars, loss of normal skin sensation, and other skin changes; changes in bodily odors; ostomies and loss of normal bowel and bladder function; lymphedema, and strained intimate partnerships and other changes in social roles. In spite of these facts, female patients who are treated for cancer receive insufficient counseling, support, or treatment to preserve or regain sexual function after cancer treatment.

AB  - Objective: Sleep problems are prominent after menopause. The aim of our study was to look into the effect of black cohosh on both objective and subjective sleep in early postmenopausal women with sleep complaints.Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled research during a 6-month period. Forty-eight postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years with sleep disturbance were enrolled and received daily administration of either black cohosh or placebo. Polysomnography and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were performed at the initiation and termination of the study, as well as the Menopause-specific Quality of Life questionnaire and estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone tests. Liver and renal functions and breast and pelvic ultrasound were set as safety measures, carried out every 3 months.Results: Seventy-six women were interviewed, of whom 42 women completed the whole trial. Compared with placebo, black cohosh treatment led to significant polysomnographic changes, including increased sleep efficiency and decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration, and tended to improve PSQI with a medium effect size. On average, 15.8% of WASO duration was reduced in the black cohosh group. Vasomotor and physical domains of life quality were improved compared with placebo. Safety measures did not yield any adverse event assigned to black cohosh.Conclusions: In early postmenopausal women with a major sleep complaint, black cohosh effectively improved sleep and might be a safe measure in managing menopausal sleep disturbance.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to translate the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) into the Serbian language and assess its validity and reliability in a population of Serbian menopausal women.Methods: The study included peri- and postmenopausal women from two Community Health Centers in Belgrade. Women filled out the WHQ, the Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The WHQ was translated according to recommended methodology for cultural adaptation of questionnaires and its psychometric characteristics (internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, factor analysis, sensitivity, discriminant, construct and criterion validity) were tested.Results: In the Serbian population, the mean values of the WHQ domains were mostly comparable with reference Mediterranean countries. Whole-scale Cronbach's α was 0.838. Moreover, five WHQ domains had a value of Cronbach's α above the acceptable limit. There were no significant differences in WHQ scores between our two investigators. On exploratory factor analysis, we obtained ten factors (two items formed a new factor - 'Menstrual pathology'). Almost all SF-36 domains were significantly associated with WHQ domains, while the BDI was associated with domains: depressive mood, anxiety and sleep problems. Based on ROC analysis, WHQ is slightly more reliable for perimenopausal than postmenopausal Serbian women.Conclusion: The Serbian version of the WHQ showed very good reliability and validity in assessment of quality of life among menopausal women. The WHQ is applicable for both peri- and postmenopausal women.

AB  - Study Question: Are prospectively assessed dietary factors, including overall diet quality, macronutrients and micronutrients, associated with luteal phase deficiency (LPD) in healthy reproductive aged women with regular menstrual cycles? Summary Answer: Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), fiber and isoflavone intake were positively associated with LPD while selenium was negatively associated with LPD after adjusting for age, percentage body fat and total energy intake. What Is Known Already: LPD may increase the risk of infertility and early miscarriage. Prior research has shown positive associations between LPD and low energy availability, either through high dietary restraint alone or in conjunction with high energy expenditure via exercise, but few studies with adequate sample sizes have been conducted investigating dietary factors and LPD among healthy, eumenorrheic women. Study Design, Size, Duration: The BioCycle Study (2005-2007) prospectively enrolled 259 women from Western New York state, USA, and followed them for one (n = 9) or two (n = 250) menstrual cycles. Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: Women aged 18-44 years, with self-reported BMI between 18 and 35 kg/m(2) and cycle lengths between 21 and 35 days, were included in the study. Participants completed baseline questionnaires, four 24-h dietary recalls per cycle and daily diaries capturing vigorous exercise, perceived stress and sleep; they also provided up to eight fasting serum samples during clinic visits timed to specific phases of the menstrual cycle using a fertility monitor. Cycles were included for this analysis if the peak serum luteal progesterone was >1 ng/ml and a urine or serum LH surge was detected. Associations between prospectively assessed diet quality, macronutrients and micronutrients and LPD (defined as luteal duration <10 days) were evaluated using generalized linear models adjusting for age, percentage body fat and total energy intake. Main Results and the Role Of Chance: LPD occurred in 41 (8.9%) of the 463 cycles from 246 women in the final analysis. After adjusting for age, percentage body fat and total energy intake, LPD was positively associated with MDS, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17, 2.48), P = 0.01. In separate macro- and micronutrient adjusted models, increased fiber and isoflavone intake showed modest positive associations with LPD: fiber (per g), aOR: 1.10 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.23), P = 0.07; and isoflavones (per 10 mg), aOR: 1.38 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.92), P = 0.06. In contrast, selenium (per 10 mcg) was inversely associated with LPD, aOR: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.97), P = 0.03. Additional adjustments for relevant lifestyle factors including vigorous exercise, perceived stress and sleep did not appreciably alter estimates. Limitations, Reasons For Caution: The number of LPD cycles was limited, and thus these findings are exploratory. We relied on participant self-report of their medical history to apply exclusion criteria; it is possible that we admitted to the study women with a gynecologic or medical disease who were unaware of their diagnosis. Wider Implications Of the Findings: Our study suggests that diet quality may be associated with LPD among healthy eumenorrheic women. As LPD may contribute to infertility and early miscarriage, further research is warranted to elucidate how dietary factors, such as MDS, may influence LPD. The inverse association we found with selenium is supported by previous research and deserves further investigation to determine whether this finding has pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications.

AB  - Context: Most studies show sleep homeostasis and continuity remain stable across the menstrual cycle in young women. The influence of the menstrual cycle on physiological sleep in midlife women is unknown.Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the impact of menstrual cycle phase on the polysomnogram and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of sleep in midlife women, accounting for the presence of an insomnia disorder.Design and Participants: This was a laboratory study of 20 women in the early menopausal transition (48.8 ± 2.9 y), 11 with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, diagnosis of insomnia, studied on one night each in the follicular and luteal menstrual cycle phases.Main Outcome Measures: Polysomnographic and sleep EEG indices were measured.Results: Both groups of women had more awakenings (P = .003) and arousals (P = .025) per hour of sleep and less percentage slow wave sleep (P = .024) when progesterone was raised (≥3 ng/mL(-1)) during the luteal compared with the follicular phase. Both groups had greater spindle density (P = .007), longer spindles (P = .037), and increased 14-17 Hz EEG activity in the luteal phase (P < .05), although for the 15- to 16-Hz bin, this effect was significant only in women without insomnia (P < .001). Women with insomnia had a shorter sleep duration (P = .012), more wakefulness after sleep onset (P = .031), and a lower sleep efficiency (P = .034) than women without insomnia, regardless of menstrual cycle phase.Conclusion: Sleep is more disrupted in the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase in midlife women, whether or not they have an insomnia disorder. There is a prominent increase in sleep spindles and spindle frequency activity in the luteal phase, likely an effect of progesterone and/or its neuroactive metabolites acting on sleep regulatory systems.

AB  - Purpose: To explain the controversy about whether midlife women who self-report hot flashes have relatively increased affective symptoms, poor cognitive performance or worse sleep.Methods: Retrospective data from 88 women seeking relief from bothersome day and night hot flashes were submitted to mixed linear regression modeling to find if estimated hot flashes, as measured by Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) items, or diary-documented hot flashes recorded daily, were associated with each other, or with affective, cognitive or sleep measures.Results: Subjects averaged 6.3 daytime diary-documented hot flashes and 2.4 nighttime diary-documented hot flashes per 24h. Confounder-controlled diary-documented hot flashes but not estimated hot flashes were associated with increased Leeds anxiety scores (F=4.9; t=2.8; p=0.01) and Leeds depression scores (3.4; 2.5; 0.02), decreased Stroop Color-Word test performance (9.4; 3.5; 0.001), increased subjective sleep disturbance (effect size=0.83) and increased objective sleep disturbance (effect size=0.35). Hot flash effects were small to moderate in size. Univariate but not multivariate analyses revealed that all hot flash measures were associated with all affect measures. Different measures of hot flashes associated differently with affect, cognition and sleep. Only nighttime diary-document hot flash consistently correlated with any affect measures in multivariate analyses.Conclusions: The use of differing measures for hot flashes, affect, cognition and sleep may account for the continually reported inconsistencies in menopause study outcomes. This problem impedes forging a consensus on whether hot flashes correlate with neuropsychological symptoms.

AB  - Objective: The current study aimed to investigate stages of reproductive aging as an associated factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) among women in a representative sample of Sao Paulo, Brazil.Methods: Four hundred seven women underwent clinical evaluation, polysomnography, and biochemical analysis. Stages of reproductive aging were defined as premenopause, early postmenopause, and late postmenopause.Results: OSAS was more frequent in the postmenopausal groups, with 68.4% of women affected by severe OSAS belonging to the late postmenopause group. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, associated factors for OSAS, regardless of its severity, were waist circumference, modified Mallampati score IV, and both postmenopause stages. For moderate to severe OSAS and severe OSAS, we found waist circumference and both postmenopause stages to be the main factors. We carried out a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, which demonstrated that the cutoff value for waist circumference was 87.5 cm, with a maximum of 75.7% accuracy for the classification of women as OSAS or non-OSAS.Conclusions: OSAS is prevalent in postmenopausal women, especially in late postmenopause. This study highlights the association between waist circumference, early postmenopause and late postmenopause, and severity of OSAS. Our findings suggest that postmenopause stages may potentially exacerbate the presence of sleep disturbance and that reducing waist circumference may be an important strategy for managing OSAS in women.

AB  - Objective: Our overall aim-through a narrative review-is to critically profile key extant evidence of menopause-related sleep, mostly from studies published in the last decade.Methods: We searched the database PubMed using selected Medical Subject Headings for sleep and menopause (n = 588 articles). Using similar headings, we also searched the Cochrane Library (n = 1), Embase (n = 449), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (n = 163), Web of Science (n = 506), and PsycINFO (n = 58). Articles deemed most related to the purpose were reviewed.Results: Results were articulated with interpretive comments according to evidence of sleep quality (self-reported) and sleep patterns (polysomnography and actigraphy) impact as related to reproductive aging and in the context of vasomotor symptoms (VMS; self-reported), vasomotor activity (VMA) events (recorded skin conductance), depressed mood, and ovarian hormones.Conclusions: Predominantly, the menopausal transition conveys poor sleep beyond anticipated age effects. Perceptions of sleep are not necessarily translatable from detectable physical sleep changes and are probably affected by an emotional overlay on symptoms reporting. Sleep quality and pattern changes are mostly manifest in wakefulness indicators, but sleep pattern changes are not striking. Likely contributing are VMS of sufficient frequency/severity and bothersomeness, probably with a sweating component. VMA events influence physical sleep fragmentation but not necessarily extensive sleep loss or sleep architecture changes. Lack of robust connections between perceived and recorded sleep (and VMA) could be influenced by inadequate detection. There is a need for studies of women in well-defined menopausal transition stages who have no sleep problems, accounting for sleep-related disorders, mood, and other symptoms, with attention to VMS dimensions, distribution of VMS during night and day, and advanced measurement of symptoms and physiologic manifestations.

AB  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible.

AB  - Aim: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on cortical function in preterm infants at term age.Methods: Family Nurture Intervention is a NICU-based intervention designed to establish emotional connection between mothers and preterm infants. Infants born at 26-34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) were divided into two groups, standard care (SC, N = 49) and FNI (FNI, N = 56). Infants had EEG recordings of ~one hour duration with 124 lead nets between 37 and 44 weeks PMA. Coherence was measured between all pairs of electrodes in ten frequency bands. Data were summarised both within and between 12 regions during two sleep states (active, quiet).Results: Coherence levels were negatively correlated with PMA age in both groups. As compared to SC infants, FNI infants showed significantly lower levels of EEG coherence (1-18 Hz) largely within and between frontal regions.Conclusion: Coherence in FNI infants was decreased in regions where we previously found robust increases in EEG power. As coherence decreases with age, results suggest that FNI may accelerate brain maturation particularly in frontal brain regions, which have been shown in research by others to be involved in regulation of attention, cognition and emotion regulation; domains deficient in preterm infants.

AB  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy-four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger-hostility, depression, tension-anxiety, fatigue-inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tensionanxiety, and increased levels of anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep is a universal behavior that has been demonstrated in every animal species studied, from insects to mammals. It is one of the most significant human behaviors occupying roughly one third of human life. Sleep occupies a greater portion of our life and is considered as one among the three upasthambhas of existence. Sleep disturbance have been a major concern of physicians, psychologists and social scientists especially since last few decades because of the rising trend of different sleep disorders. Although the exact functions of sleep are still unknown, it is clearly necessary for survival, because prolonged sleep deprivation leads to physical and cognitive impairment. Objectives 1. To assess the pre test and post test level of insomnia among post menopausal women. 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of yoga among post menopausal women. 3. To associate the post test level of insomnia with selected demographic variables. Material and method: The research approach used for the study was the Quantitative research approach. The study was conducted using pre experimental design with one group pre-test and post-test. The independent variable is yoga and dependent variable was insomnia among post menopausal women. The study was conducted on 30 post menopausal women in rural area of Vadodara using non probability convenient technique. The data was collected by using rating scale. The data was tabulated and analyzed in terms of objectives of the study, using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: In the pre test post menopausal women having 55. 83% level of insomnia and mean score was 40.20 ±8.24. In the post test post menopausal women having average 35.28% of insomnia and mean score was 25.40±5.73. The post test mean insomnia score is significantly lesser than the pre test mean insomnia score. The 't' calculated value 13.690 is more than tabulated value 2.045 at 0.05 level of significance. So we accept H1 and conclude that there is significant difference between level of pre test and post test insomnia among post menopausal women exposed to YOGA. In the pre test majority (63.3%) of the post menopausal women had moderate insomnia but in the post test there was marked reduction in the level of insomnia with majority (83.3%). The ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to determine the association between level of post test insomnia and selected demographic variables. From the entire demographic variables no significant association found with post test score. Conclusion: It can be concluded that post menopausal women can utilize the knowledge regarding yoga and they can use this in to their practice. The study findings reveal that yoga was highly effective in improving sleep quality of post menopausal women. The study also reveals that there is no any association between demographic variables and post test level of insomnia.

AB  - Background: One of the common problems in menopausal women is sleep disorder. Traditional Chinese acupressure is a noninvasive and safe technique. Menopausal women can easily learn the technique and a self-care method to manage their sleep disorder. This study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality of postmenopausal women in Mashhad during 2009. Methods: This double blind, randomized clinical trial was performed on 120 qualified menopausal women at the age of 41-65 years. Their sleep quality was measured according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants were randomly assigned to an acupressure group (n=37), a sham acupressure group (n=36) and a control group (n=32) by two time randomized method (systematic and simple randomized). These interventions were carried out for four consecutive weeks. The participants in the acupressure and sham acupressure groups learned to carry out the acupressure technique as a self-care at home with simultaneous massage techniques that were to be performed 2 hours before sleep, whereas only conversation was used in the control group. The data were analyzed by the SPSS software version 17. Results: The results indicated significant differences in total PSQI scores among the three groups (P<0.001). Tukey's test revealed that there were significant differences between the acupressure group and the control group (P<0.001), the acupressure group and sham acupressure group (P<0.001), and the sham acupressure and the control group (P<0.001). Conclusion: Acupressure can be used as a complementary treatment to relieve sleep disorders in menopausal women; and is offered as an efficient method to manage sleep quality.

AB  - Background: It is unknown whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D has an impact on menopause-related symptoms.Methods: As part of the Women's Health Initiative Calcium/Vitamin D Supplementation Trial (CaD), women were randomized at 40 clinical sites to elemental calcium carbonate 1000 mg with vitamin D 400 IU daily or placebo. At the CaD baseline visit (year 1 or year 2) and during a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, participants provided data on menopause-related symptoms via questionnaires. Generalized linear mixed effects techniques were used to address research questions.Results: After excluding participants with missing data (N=2125), we compared menopause-related symptoms at follow-up visits of 17,101 women randomized to CaD with those of 17,056 women given the placebo. Women in the CaD arm did not have a different number of symptoms at follow-up compared to women taking the placebo (p=0.702). Similarly, there was no difference between sleep disturbance, emotional well-being, or energy/fatigue at follow-up in those who were randomized to CaD supplementation compared to those taking the placebo.Conclusions: Our data suggest that supplementation with 1000 mg of calcium plus 400 IU of vitamin D does not influence menopause-related symptoms over an average of 5.7 years of follow-up among postmenopausal women with an average age of 64 at the WHI baseline visit.

AB  - Sleep deteriorates with age. The menopause is often a turning point for women's sleep, as complaints of insomnia increase significantly thereafter. Insomnia can occur as a secondary disorder to hot flashes, mood disorders, medical conditions, psychosocial factors, underlying intrinsic sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or restless legs syndrome (RLS), or it can be a primary disorder. Since unrecognized OSA can have dramatic health-related consequences, menopausal women complaining of persisting sleep disturbances suggesting primary insomnia or intrinsic sleep disorders should be referred to a sleep specialist for a comprehensive sleep assessment. Patients suffering from primary insomnia will be preferentially treated with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin, or with cognitive behavioural therapy. Insomnia related to vasomotor symptoms can be improved with hormone replacement therapy. Gabapentin and isoflavones have also shown efficacy in small series but their precise role has yet to be established. In patients suffering from OSA, non-pharmacological therapy will be applied: continuous positive airway pressure or an oral appliance, according to the severity of the disorder. In the case of RLS, triggering factors must be avoided; dopaminergic agonists are the first-line treatment for moderate to severe disease. In conclusion, persisting sleep complaints should be addressed in menopausal women, in order to correctly diagnose the specific causal disorder and to prescribe treatments that have been shown to improve sleep quality, quality of life and long-term health status.

AB  - Objective: We examined whether women reporting nighttime pain would have more actigraphy-measured evidence for disturbed sleep and would report feeling less rested compared with women without nighttime pain.Methods: Up to 27 consecutive nights of actigraphy and sleep diary data from each participant were analyzed in this community-based study of 314 African-American (n = 118), white (n = 141), and Chinese (n = 55) women, aged 48 to 58 years, who were premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal and were participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. Dependent variables were actigraphy-measured movement and fragmentation index, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and diary self-report of "feeling rested" after waking up. All outcomes were fitted using linear mixed-effects models to examine covariate-adjusted associations between the independent variable (nighttime pain severity) and sleep outcomes.Results: Higher pain severity scores were associated with longer sleep duration but reduced sleep efficiency and less restful sleep. Women reporting nocturnal vasomotor symptoms had more sleep-related movement and sleep fragmentation, had reduced sleep efficiency, and were less likely to feel rested after wakening whether or not they reported pain.Conclusions: Midlife women who report higher nighttime pain levels have more objective evidence for less efficient sleep, consistent with self-reported less restful sleep. Nocturnal vasomotor symptoms also can contribute to restlessness and wakefulness in midlife women.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to estimate the prevalence and predictors of moderate/severe poor sleep in relation to the final menstrual period (FMP) in midlife women.Methods: Annual assessments were conducted in a population-based cohort of 255 women. All were premenopausal at cohort enrollment and reached natural menopause during the 16-year follow-up. The outcome measure was severity of poor sleep, as reported by participants in annual interviews for 16 years and as evaluated in relation to the FMP.Results: The annual prevalence of moderate/severe poor sleep largely ranged from about 28% to 35%, with no significant differences in any year relative to the FMP for the sample overall. When sleep status was stratified at premenopausal baseline, premenopausal sleep status strongly predicted poor sleep around the FMP. Women with moderate/severe poor sleep in premenopause were approximately 3.5 times more likely to have moderate/severe poor sleep around menopause than those with no poor sleep at baseline in adjusted analysis (odds ratio, 3.58; 95% CI, 2.50-5.11; P < 0.0001), whereas mild poor sleepers in premenopause were approximately 1.5 times more likely to have moderate/severe poor sleep around menopause (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.99-2.47; P = 0.053). There was no significant association between poor sleep and time relative to the FMP among women who had no poor sleep at premenopausal baseline. Hot flashes were significantly associated with poor sleep (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.44-2.21; P < 0.0001 in adjusted analysis) but had no interaction with baseline sleep severity (interaction P = 0.25), indicating that hot flashes contributed to poor sleep regardless of baseline sleep status.Conclusions: Findings show a high prevalence of moderate/severe poor sleep in midlife women, with only a small "at-risk" subgroup having a significant increase in poor sleep in relation to the FMP. Sleep status at premenopausal baseline and concurrent hot flashes strongly and consistently predict poor sleep in the menopausal transition. Overall, poor sleep does not increase around the FMP and frequently occurs in the absence of hot flashes, indicating that sleep difficulties in the menopausal transition in generally healthy women are not simply associated with ovarian decline.

AB  - Perimenopause is a midlife transition state experienced by women that occurs in the context of a fully functioning neurological system and results in reproductive senescence. Although primarily viewed as a reproductive transition, the symptoms of perimenopause are largely neurological in nature. Neurological symptoms that emerge during perimenopause are indicative of disruption in multiple estrogen-regulated systems (including thermoregulation, sleep, circadian rhythms and sensory processing) and affect multiple domains of cognitive function. Estrogen is a master regulator that functions through a network of estrogen receptors to ensure that the brain effectively responds at rapid, intermediate and long timescales to regulate energy metabolism in the brain via coordinated signalling and transcriptional pathways. The estrogen receptor network becomes uncoupled from the bioenergetic system during the perimenopausal transition and, as a corollary, a hypometabolic state associated with neurological dysfunction can develop. For some women, this hypometabolic state might increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. The perimenopausal transition might also represent a window of opportunity to prevent age-related neurological diseases. This Review considers the importance of neurological symptoms in perimenopause in the context of their relationship to the network of estrogen receptors that control metabolism in the brain.

AB  - Background: Concussion literature and treatment guidelines are inconclusive regarding the role of sex in symptom reporting at baseline and post-concussion. Although empirical evidence is lacking, it is generally regarded that females have a more severe symptomatic presentation than males at all time-points on the concussion spectrum. Objectives: Our objective was to determine whether differences exist between males and females at baseline (pre-season/before concussion) or post-concussion for self-reported (1) prevalence of individual symptoms and (2) total symptom scores in high school and college athletes. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies; level of evidence, 1. Methods: A computerized search of the PubMed, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Scopus databases was performed. Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed. Criteria for inclusion were (1) self-report of symptoms at any time within the concussion spectrum, including baseline and after concussion, (2) study sample included high school and/or collegiate athletes aged 12-26 years, (3) concussions occurred during participation in sport, and (4) symptom reporting was separated by sex. The Quality Assessment Tool for Cohort Studies, Q-Coh, was utilized for quality assessment. Results: Twenty-one studies met the criteria for inclusion: seventeen had good quality and four, acceptable quality. At baseline, females had significantly higher odds than males of reporting the individual symptoms of vision/hearing problems, headache/migraine, difficulty concentrating, energy/sleep disturbances, and emotional disturbances. Post-concussion, only one symptom demonstrated significant differences between males and females, with females demonstrating lower odds of reporting confusion than males. Statistically, at baseline and post-concussion, females had significantly higher total symptom scores on the Post-Concussion Scale (PCS) and the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2), but when the standard mean difference was interpreted after back-transformation, these results were clinically insignificant. Conclusions: The symptomatic presentation of males and females, most notably the prevalence of specific symptoms, is very divergent. Females had higher total symptom scores at baseline and post-concussion, however, clinically this cannot be interpreted as a meaningful difference. It is possible that these differences can be explained by normal hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle. The implications of these findings are that symptomatic presentation during an individual female's menstrual cycle needs to be taken into consideration post-concussion when making return-to-play decisions, as returning to a completely asymptomatic level may not be a reasonable expectation.

AB  - Depression, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms are common in breast cancer survivors (BCS), especially in younger women diagnosed before menopause. Risk factors and mechanisms for depression in this population are relatively unexplored. In 163 young BCS, vasomotor symptoms were significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms ( β = 0.26, p = 0.001) and 64 % of the total effect was mediated through sleep disturbance (beta for specific indirect effect = 1.296, 95 % CI 0.591-2.212). Treatments reducing vasomotor symptoms might alleviate sleep disturbance and depression in this population.

AB  - Objective: To test whether more physiologically assessed hot flashes were associated with more connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), the network of brain regions active during rest. We particularly focus on DMN networks supporting the hippocampus as this region is rich in estrogen (E) receptors (ER) and has previously been linked to hot flashes.Design: Women underwent 24 hours of physiologic and diary hot flash monitoring, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 72 hours of sleep actigraphy monitoring, a blood draw, questionnaires, and physical measures.Setting: University medical center.Patient(s): Twenty midlife women aged 40-60 years who had their uterus and both ovaries and were not taking hormone therapy (HT).Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): The DMN functional connectivity.Result(s): Controlling for age, race, and education, more physiologically-monitored hot flashes were associated with greater DMN connectivity (beta, B [SE] = 0.004 [0.002]), particularly hippocampal DMN connectivity (B [SE] = 0.005 [0.002]). Findings were most pronounced for sleep physiologic hot flashes (with hippocampal DMN, B [SE] = 0.02 [0.007]). Associations also persisted controlling for sleep, depressive symptoms, and serum E2 concentrations.Conclusion(s): More physiologically-monitored hot flashes were associated with more DMN connectivity, particularly networks supporting the hippocampus. Findings were most pronounced for sleep hot flashes. Findings underscore the importance of continued investigation of the central nervous system in efforts to understand this classic menopausal phenomenon.

AB  - Objective: Increased amplitudes in high-frequency brain electrical activity are reported with menopausal hot flashes. We report outcomes associated with the use of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring--a noninvasive neurotechnology for autocalibration of neural oscillations--by women with perimenopausal and postmenopausal hot flashes.Methods: Twelve women with hot flashes (median age, 56 y; range, 46-69 y) underwent a median of 13 (range, 8-23) intervention sessions for a median of 9.5 days (range, 4-32). This intervention uses algorithmic analysis of brain electrical activity and near real-time translation of brain frequencies into variable tones for acoustic stimulation. Hot flash frequency and severity were recorded by daily diary. Primary outcomes included hot flash severity score, sleep, and depressive symptoms. High-frequency amplitudes (23-36 Hz) from bilateral temporal scalp recordings were measured at baseline and during serial sessions. Self-reported symptom inventories for sleep and depressive symptoms were collected.Results: The median change in hot flash severity score was -0.97 (range, -3.00 to 1.00; P = 0.015). Sleep and depression scores decreased by -8.5 points (range, -20 to -1; P = 0.022) and -5.5 points (range, -32 to 8; P = 0.015), respectively. The median sum of amplitudes for the right and left temporal high-frequency brain electrical activity was 8.44 μV (range, 6.27-16.66) at baseline and decreased by a median of -2.96 μV (range, -11.05 to -0.65; P = 0.0005) by the final session.Conclusions: Hot flash frequency and severity, symptoms of insomnia and depression, and temporal high-frequency brain electrical activity decrease after High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring. Larger controlled trials with longer follow-up are warranted.

AB  - Objective: Insomnia both as a symptom and as part of chronic insomnia disorder is quite common in menopause. Comorbid conditions, such as restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea, occur with high prevalence among perimenopausal women with insomnia. Insomnia in this population group is associated with adverse health outcomes, and there are no clear standards on how to treat it.Methods: Based on extensive literature search, 76 articles were identified. Two authors independently graded evidence according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence.Results: Evaluation and treatment of other comorbid sleep disorders are recommended, as is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. Hormone therapy, eszopiclone, escitalopram, gabapentin, isoflavones, valerian, exercise, and hypnosis are suggested. Zolpidem, quiteiapine XL, citalopram, mirtazapine followed by long-acting melatonin, ramelteon, Pycnogenol, Phyto-Female Complex, yoga, and massage may be considered. Kampo formulas are not recommended. Acupuncture may not be suggested, and cognitive-behavioral therapy that is not tailored for insomnia probably should not be considered.Conclusions: Although a variety of interventions are shown to be helpful in improving sleep in menopause, there is a need for well-designed head-to-head trials with uniform outcome measures.

AB  - Objective: Weight, physical activity, and sleep are modifiable lifestyle factors that impact cognitive functioning in noncancer populations but have yet to be examined in cancer survivors. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship of obesity, physical activity, and sleep, with cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors.Methods: Participants were 136 early-stage postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who completed an assessment of neuropsychological testing, height, weight, physical activity, and sleep. Linear regression models examined the associations of the seven neuropsychological domains with obesity, physical activity, and sleep. Logistic regression models examined odd of impairment in each domain. All models controlled for breast cancer treatment variables and relevant demographic and clinical variables.Results: Obese participants had significantly worse performance (β = -5.04, standard error (SE) = 2.53) and were almost three times more likely to be impaired (odds ratio (OR) = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.02-8.10) on the Information processing domain. The highest tertile of physical activity was significantly related to better performance on the executive functioning domain (β = 5.13, SE = 2.42) and attention domain (β = 4.26, SE = 2.07). The middle tertile of physical activity was significantly related to better performance (β = 9.00, SE = 3.09) and decreased odds of impairment (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.07-0.91) on the visual-spatial domain. More hours of sleep per night was significantly associated with better performance (β = 2.69, SE = 0.98) and decreased odds of impairment (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33-0.82) on the verbal functioning domain.Conclusions: These findings suggest that obesity, physical activity, and sleep are related to cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors and have potential to be intervention targets to improve cognitive functioning.

AB  - Background: The Region of Tuscany Health Department was included as an associated member in WP7 "Healthcare" of the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC), initiated by the EU Commission in 2009.Aims: The principal aim was to map centres across Europe prioritizing those that provide public health services and operating within the national health system in integrative oncology (IO).Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to collect data. A questionnaire was elaborated concerning integrative oncology therapies to be administered to all the national health system oncology centres or hospitals in each European country. These institutes were identified by convenience sampling, searching on oncology websites and forums. The official websites of these structures were analysed to obtain more information about their activities and contacts.Results: Information was received from 123 (52.1 %) out of the 236 centres contacted until 31 December 2013. Forty-seven out of 99 responding centres meeting inclusion criteria (47.5 %) provided integrative oncology treatments, 24 from Italy and 23 from other European countries. The number of patients seen per year was on average 301.2 ± 337. Among the centres providing these kinds of therapies, 33 (70.2 %) use fixed protocols and 35 (74.5 %) use systems for the evaluation of results. Thirty-two centres (68.1 %) had research in progress or carried out until the deadline of the survey. The complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) more frequently provided to cancer patients were acupuncture 26 (55.3 %), homeopathy 19 (40.4 %), herbal medicine 18 (38.3 %) and traditional Chinese medicine 17 (36.2 %); anthroposophic medicine 10 (21.3 %); homotoxicology 6 (12.8 %); and other therapies 30 (63.8 %). Treatments are mainly directed to reduce adverse reactions to chemo-radiotherapy (23.9 %), in particular nausea and vomiting (13.4 %) and leucopenia (5 %). The CAMs were also used to reduce pain and fatigue (10.9 %), to reduce side effects of iatrogenic menopause (8.8 %) and to improve anxiety and depression (5.9 %), gastrointestinal disorders (5 %), sleep disturbances and neuropathy (3.8 %).Conclusions: Mapping of the centres across Europe is an essential step in the process of creating a European network of centres, experts and professionals constantly engaged in the field of integrative oncology, in order to increase, share and disseminate the knowledge in this field and provide evidence-based practice.

AB  - Objective: To identify physical and behavioral characteristics related to the incidence of tibial stress injuries (TSIs). Design: Case-control study. No clinical care was conducted. Setting: Research laboratories in the San Francisco (the United States) and Gold Coast (Australia) areas. Participants: Forty-eight patients (21 men and 27 women) with acute TSI, and 36 (16 men and 20 women) age-matched, sex-matched, height-matched, weight-matched, and activity-matched controls with no history of TSI. Independent Variables: Height, weight, body mass index, bone, lean and fat mass, lower limb alignment anomalies, foot type, orthotics, calcium, recent weight change, menstrual history, oral contraceptive use, medications, smoking, alcohol, sleep, training type, and intensity. Differences in continuous variables were tested using 1-way analysis of variance. Categorical variable comparisons were performed with Fisher exact test. Main Outcome Measure: Tibial stress injury. Results: Tibial stress injury cases had 2.7% more fat (P < 0.001) and 2.6% less muscle (P < 0.001) as well as lower trochanteric bone mineral content (BMC) (P < 0.001), lumbar spine (LS) area (P < 0.001), femoral neck BMC (P < 0.001), length (P < 0.05), area (P < 0.001), cortical width (P < 0.01), cross-sectional moment of inertia (P < 0.001), and index of bending strength (P < 0.001) than controls. Controls had lower LS BMC (P < 0.01), length (P < 0.001), and broadband ultrasound attenuation (P < 0.001). The use of orthotic insoles was more prevalent in TSI cases than controls (25% vs 5.6%, respectively; P < 0.02), as were foot anomalies (56.3% vs 27.8%, respectively; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Tibial stress injury cases had lower lean and higher fat mass, a tendency for smaller bones, and for foot anomalies compared with uninjured matched controls. bone mineral density was normal for both groups. Clinical Relevance: Enhancing lean mass and limiting gains in fat may provide some protection against TSI. Individuals with small skeletal frames are advised to increase training loads particularly gradually and to reduce training intensity at the first sign of pain in the shins.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this descriptive study was to assess the severity of symptoms and their impact on quality of life in women with a diagnosis of urogenital prolapse. Backgroung: Urogenital prolapse symptoms are not life-threatening, but they lead to limitations in work, family and sexual life and deterioration in quality of life. Therefore, when many women experience these symptoms more than once in a week, they realize that their quality of life has been negatively affected. Methods: The study included a total of 179 women with a diagnosis of urogenital prolapse who applied to the gynecology outpatient clinic of Women's Health Teaching and Research Hospital, Turkey, July-October 2010. The "Descriptive Information Questionnaire" and "The Prolapsus-Related Quality of Life (P-QOL) Questionnaire" were used to collect data. Results: In this study, 68.1% of women recruited from the gynecology outpatient clinic were aged 52 and over, and 46.9% had graduated from primary school. 44.1% of women's parity was 3-4, 97% of women had a history of giving birth vaginally. 72.6% of women were in the postmenopausal period and 29.1% of women had a history of urogenital prolapse in their family. 77.7% of women had not previously applied to a hospital, even though they had experienced symptoms related to urogenital prolapse, 43.6% of women had applied to a hospital concerning urinary incontinence. It was found that 52% of women were diagnosed with cystocele, 57% had a third degree or higher urogenital prolapse. Urogenital prolapse affects women's general health perceptions, physical-social activities, personal relationships, quality of sleep. Conclusion: All women should be educated - consulted about urogenital prolapse for prevention of the disease, early diagnosis treatment.

AB  - Background: Premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk for psychological and behavioral disturbances after cancer treatment. Targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group.Methods: This randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief, mindfulness-based intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress, depression, and inflammatory activity. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6-week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPS) intervention group (n = 39) or to a wait-list control group (n = 32). Participants completed questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes) as well as physical symptoms, cancer-related distress, and positive outcomes. Blood samples were collected to examine genomic and circulating markers of inflammation. Participants also completed questionnaires at a 3-month follow-up assessment.Results: In linear mixed models, the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress (P = .004) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms (P = .094), as well as significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression (P = .009) and inflammatory signaling (P = .001) at postintervention. Improvements in secondary outcomes included reduced fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and increased peace and meaning and positive affect (P < .05 for all). Intervention effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up assessment, although reductions in cancer-related distress were observed at that assessment.Conclusions: A brief, mindfulness-based intervention demonstrated preliminary short-term efficacy in reducing stress, behavioral symptoms, and proinflammatory signaling in younger breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Background: Many breast cancer survivors experience fatigue, mood, and sleep disturbances.Purpose: This study aims to compare a meditative movement practice, Qigong/Tai Chi Easy (QG/TCE) with sham Qigong (SQG), testing effects of meditation/breath aspects of QG/TCE on breast cancer survivors' persistent fatigue and other symptoms.Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial tested 12 weeks of QG/TCE versus SQG on fatigue, depression, and sleep among 87 postmenopausal, fatigued breast cancer survivors, stages 0-III, age 40-75.Results: Fatigue decreased significantly in the QG/TCE group compared to control at post-intervention (p = 0.005) and 3 months follow-up (p = 0.024), but not depression and sleep quality. Improvement occurred over time for both interventions in depression and sleep quality (all p < 0.05).Conclusions: QG/TCE showed significant improvement over time compared to SQG for fatigue, but not depression or sleep. Both QG/TCE and SQG showed improvement for two prevalent symptoms among breast cancer survivors, depression and sleep dysfunction.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the occurrence of menstrually-entrained mood cycling in women with treated bipolar disorder as compared to healthy controls, and to explore whether there is a specific effect of lamotrigine in dampening menstrually-entrained cyclicity of mood.Methods: Observational comparison study of daily self-ratings of mood, sleep, and insomnia obtained over a mean of four menstrual cycles in 42 women with bipolar disorder taking lamotrigine as part of their treatment, 30 women with bipolar disorder receiving mood stabilizing regimens without lamotrigine, and 13 healthy controls, all with physiological menstrual cycles. Additional exploratory analysis of interactions between psychopharmacological regimen and hormonal contraceptive use in the group of women with bipolar disorder, with the addition of 19 women with bipolar disorder who were using hormonal contraceptives.Results: Women treated for bipolar disorder manifested lower average mood, longer average nightly sleep duration, and greater fluctuations in mood and sleep across menstrual cycle phases than healthy controls. Women with bipolar disorder who were taking lamotrigine had less fluctuation in mood both within and across menstrual cycle phases, and were more similar to the control group than to women with bipolar disorder who were not taking lamotrigine in this respect. In addition, medications with GABA-A receptor modulating effects were found to result in improved mood ratings when combined with hormonal contraceptives.Conclusions: Menstrually-entrained mood fluctuation is present in women treated for bipolar disorder to a greater degree than in healthy controls. Lamotrigine may be of use in mitigating this fluctuation. GABA-A receptor modulators in general may act synergistically with hormonal contraceptives to enhance mood in women with bipolar disorder; this hypothesis merits further study.

AB  - Context: The changing hormonal milieu around menopause is implicated in the development of sleep disturbances. No studies have assessed the association between concurrent physiological measures of sleep and serum hormone concentrations in perimenopausal women.Objective: This study aimed to assess the interaction between physiological sleep and reproductive hormone measures in perimenopausal women.Design and Participants: This was a cross-sectional laboratory study of 33 perimenopausal women age 43-52 years (17 with no sleep complaints and 16 with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia). Eleven premenopausal women without sleep complaints (18-27 y), were included to determine whether hormone-sleep relationships differed depending on reproductive stage.Main Outcome Measures: Concurrent polysomnographic sleep indices and serum hormone levels (estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]) were measured.Results: FSH was positively associated with polysomnographic-defined wakefulness after sleep onset, and number of awakenings and arousals in perimenopausal women (P < .05) without sleep complaints independent of age, body mass index, and hot flashes. Similarly, FSH correlated with wakefulness after sleep onset and light N1 sleep in premenopausal women (P < .05). In contrast, in perimenopausal insomniacs amount of sleep correlated with anxiety and depression (P < .05) but not with FSH. Estradiol did not correlate with sleep in perimenopausal groups but correlated negatively with arousals in premenopausal women (P < .01).Conclusion: Our results suggest an interaction between the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis and sleep-wake regulatory systems in pre- and peri-menopausal women without sleep complaints. There was no relationship between hormones and sleep in perimenopausal insomniacs, whose sleep may be influenced by other factors intrinsic to insomnia, such as hyperactivity, poor mood, and night-to-night variability.

AB  - Context: Depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances have been identified as a symptom cluster among breast cancer patients. However, few longitudinal studies have examined the temporal relations between these symptoms surrounding diagnosis and treatment.Objectives: The present study investigated the co-occurrence of and interrelations between nonsomatic depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sleep disturbances in breast cancer patients at three time points: before, after, and six to eight months following adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.Methods: Separate samples of premenopausal (n = 67) and postmenopausal (n = 67) breast cancer patients completed self-report measures of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances at all three time points. Path analysis was used to explore within- and cross-symptom paths across time.Results: Depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances were correlated within each time point. Continuity paths, whereby prior levels of symptom severity tended to predict subsequent severity of the same symptom at the subsequent time point, were significant in both samples, except for depression in the premenopausal sample. Instead, significant cross-symptom paths emerged whereby baseline fatigue predicted postchemotherapy depression, and postchemotherapy fatigue predicted depression at follow-up in the premenopausal patients. No significant cross-symptom paths emerged for the postmenopausal sample.Conclusion: Findings supported the notion that depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances manifest as a symptom cluster. Fatigue may precede nonsomatic symptoms of depression among premenopausal breast cancer patients and represents a potential intervention target.

AB  - Objective: Factors that cause a decrease in quality of life (QoL) among middle-aged women are contradictory. Given that previous studies have been presumably performed in ethnically heterogeneous populations, we evaluated the impact of socioeconomic and lifestyle factors on QoL in Finnish women because the Finnish population is ethnically homogenous. Methods: A total of 6,408 women (aged 41-54 y) who were called for municipal screening mammography received a postal survey concerning their health-related issues. A total of 3,421 women returned the questionnaire. QoL was evaluated with the Women's Health Questionnaire, from which we included eight symptom clusters (somatic symptoms, depressive symptoms, cognitive difficulties, anxiety/fears, sexual functioning, vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, and menstrual symptoms). The effects of variables on QoL were defined with multivariate analysis. Results: Older women had more symptoms. Lower educational level was associated with lower QoL. Retired women had more symptoms than working or unemployed women, and unemployed women had more symptoms than employed women. Increasing body mass index was associated with lower QoL. Women who consumed alcohol occasionally had fewer symptoms, and women who consumed alcohol weekly had more symptoms than abstainers. Women who smoked had more symptoms than nonsmokers. Current hormone therapy users had more symptoms than nonusers, and former hormone therapy users had more symptoms than nonusers or current hormone therapy users. Conclusions: Higher socioeconomic status and healthier lifestyle are beneficial for good QoL in middle-aged women. Thus, women should be encouraged to continue employment and to avoid behavioral health risks.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the temporal relationship of subjective sleep quality to menstrual cycle phase in a community (non help-seeking) sample of adult women over six months. Previous work has produced contradictory results and often used student samples.Participants/methods: Patients/methods: This was a cohort study, using daily electronic data collection in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada; 76 women aged 18-42 years recruited by random digit telephone dialing, recorded mood, sleep quality, and other health variables on a daily basis for 24 weeks.Results: Using linear mixed models, we assessed the relationship between subjective sleep quality and three menstrual cycle phases (menses, premenstrual and midcycle) over 395 cycles. Premenstrual sleep quality was poorer than during the rest of the cycle, with a mean difference of 1.32 between premenstrual and midcycle reference phase, on a 1-100 quality scale (higher score denotes poorer quality). This difference held when the independent variables of daily exercise and physical health were added to the model; it became non-significant when perceived stress and later, social support were also added to the model.Conclusions: Sleep quality in adult non-help seeking women is statistically poorer in the premenstruum but the size of the difference is of little clinical significance and was no longer statistically significant with inclusion of the potentially confounding variables, perceived stress and social support.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the expression patterns of periphery clock genes were influenced by menstrual cycle in a monkey model.Study Design: In this preliminary study, the expression patterns of four clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1 and Per2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 6 female Macaca fascicularis in menstrual, late follicular and mid luteal phases of menstrual cycle were determined by qrt-PCR.Results: Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA levels were found to exhibit significant diurnal rhythms in all phases of the menstrual cycle. The expression of Cry1 mRNA was statistically rhythmic in late follicular and mid luteal phases. A main effect of menstrual cycle existed on the rhythms of Bmal1, Cry1 and Per2 expression, but not Clock expression. No significant differences were detected between menstrual phase and late follicular phase in all clock genes. Significant differences were found on the expression of Bmal1, Cry1 or Per2 mRNA between late follicular phase and mid luteal phase, when no difference existed in estrogen level, indicating the role of progesterone on biological clock gene expression. Furthermore, the peak of Bmal1 mRNA level slightly advanced in mid luteal phase compared with that in menstrual and late follicular phases.Conclusion: The expression patterns of clock genes in PBMCs were influenced by menstrual cycle, potentially by the change of progesterone levels, and this effect maybe correlated with early pregnancy.

AB  - To explore cross-cultural experiences of women taking estrogen plus progestin therapies (EPT) and develop a symptom-based electronic diary and impact questionnaire for EPT-related breast symptoms. (1) Concept elicitation interviews were conducted with women in the US (n=14), Italy (n=15), Mexico (n=15) and China (n=15) to explore breast symptoms associated with EPT. Patients completed the Breast Sensitivity Questionnaire (BSQ) to evaluate understanding and comprehensiveness. (2) Based on concept elicitation, a 6-item eDiary (Breast Pain/Tenderness Daily Diary - BPT-DD) was generated and the BSQ modified forming the 18-item Breast Sensations Impact Questionnaire (BSIQ). (3) The measures were pilot-tested and then cognitively debriefed with US women receiving EPT. All qualitative data was subject to thematic analysis. Concept elicitation identified breast pain/tenderness, swollen breasts and sensitivity to contact as important symptoms, impacting women's emotional well-being, relationships with family/friends, social life, sleep, ability to move freely, contact, clothing and sexual activity. Experiences were relatively consistent across the country samples. Based on pilot testing and cognitive debriefing, the BPT-DD was reduced to 4 items (and renamed the Breast Pain Daily Diary - BP-DD) and the BSIQ was reduced to 13 items due to conceptual redundancy. Women taking EPT in the US, China, Mexico and Italy reported breast sensations that have a detrimental impact on quality of life. Two new measures were developed to assess the severity and impact of breast pain specific to EPT. This work highlights that EPT-related symptoms should be part of treatment decision-making, and treatments with less burdensome side effects are needed.

AB  - Objective: Feelings of fatigue and low energy are widespread among middle-aged women and have been shown to negatively affect quality of life. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations among adiposity, physical activity, and feelings of fatigue and energy in postmenopausal women.Methods: Postmenopausal women (N = 74; mean [SD] age, 58.9 [3.8] y) were assessed for adiposity (via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), steps per day, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day (via an accelerometer), prior week intensity of psychological vigor (via the Profile of Mood States-Short Form), and prior month frequency of energy feelings (via the vitality scale of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Survey--Short Form). Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale.Results: Adiposity was negatively related to steps per day (r = -0.55, P < 0.05) and minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day (r = -0.48, P < 0.05). Adiposity was not significantly related to vigor, vitality, or any other psychological measures. Greater vitality was associated with lower total number of medications (r = -0.31, P < 0.01), more steps per day (r = 0.28, P < 0.05), and higher minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day (r = 0.37, P < 0.01). Prior week feelings of vigor were unrelated to any variable of interest. Regression analyses revealed that minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day independently explained 8% of the variance in vitality, whereas sleep quality was also a significant predictor of vitality (both P < 0.05).Conclusions: Engaging in recommended amounts of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day is associated with higher monthly frequency of energy feelings, regardless of adiposity status, in middle-aged postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To improve mechanistic understanding, this pilot randomized controlled trial examined mediators of an exercise intervention effects on sleep in breast cancer survivors (BCS).Methods: Forty-six postmenopausal BCS (≤Stage II, off primary treatment) were randomized to a 3-month exercise intervention or control group. Intervention included 160 min/week of moderate intensity aerobic walking, twice weekly resistance training (resistance bands), and six discussion groups (to improve adherence). Blinded assessments at baseline and post-intervention included sleep disturbance (PSQI and PROMIS®), objective sleep quality (accelerometer), serum cytokines, accelerometer physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, fatigue, and psychosocial factors. Mediation was tested using Freedman-Schatzkin difference-in-coefficients tests.Results: When compared with control, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in PSQI sleep duration (i.e., fewer hours of sleep/night) (d = 0.73, p = .03). Medium to large but non-significant standardized effect sizes were noted for PSQI daytime somnolence (d = -0.63, p = .05) and accelerometer latency (d = -0.49, p = .14). No statistically significant mediators were detected for PSQI sleep duration score or accelerometer latency. Daytime somnolence was mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mediated 23% of intervention effect, p < .05), interleukin (IL)-6:IL-10 (16%, p < .01), IL-8:IL-10 (26%, p < .01), and fatigue (38%, p < .05). Mediating or enhancing relationships for several of the sleep outcomes were noted for accelerometer physical activity, PROMIS® fatigue, exercise social support, and/or physical activity enjoyment.Conclusions: Inflammation and psychosocial factors may mediate or enhance sleep response to our exercise intervention. Further study is warranted to confirm our results and translate our findings into more effective interventions aimed at improving sleep quality in BCS.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and predictors of depressive symptoms in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In a cross-sectional study of 114 women seeking consultation for symptoms of PCOS (menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and/or acne), personal and family history of depression ( HD and FHD respectively) were enquired. Vitamin D status ( n = 104) and manifest depressive symptoms assessed by personal health questionnaire (PHQ) ( MD) were evaluated in a subset (85). Relationships between HD and MD with PCOS symptoms, FHD, and vitamin D status were assessed using adjusted analyses. Thirty-five percent acknowledged a HD; MD (PHQ > 4) was apparent in 43 %. HD was associated with hirsutism (OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.01-5.9), disturbed sleep (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 1.3-6.9), and with FHD (OR 4.8, 95 % CI 1.7-13.5). Disturbed sleep (OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.01-5.7) and FHD (OR 3.8, 95 % CI 1.3-11.2) were independent predictors of HD adjusting for race and BMI. An inverse correlation was noted between serum 25 OH vitamin D (25OHD) levels and PHQ score, but only in those with vitamin D deficiency (25OHD ≤ 30 ng/ml, n = 57, r =−0.32, p = 0.015). 25OHD < 20 ng/ml (OR 3.5, 95 % CI 1.1-11.8) and HD (OR 12.8, 95 % CI 3.6-45.2) predicted scoring in the highest PHQ tertile after adjusting for hirsutism, BMI, and race. In women with PCOS, disturbed nocturnal sleep and FDH predicted personal HD, whereas HD and vitamin D deficiency related to the severity of MD symptoms.

AB  - Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age-related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post-partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post-partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well-being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi-factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well-being.

AB  - Objective; To probe into menopausal symptoms in perimenopausal women and its influencing factors. Methods: The general questionnaire and menopausal symptoms rating scale were used to investigate 417 cases of perimenopausal women. Results: The main influencing factors of influencing perimenopausal symptoms included family relations, height shortening, history of chronic disease or not, sleep, menopausal status, sexual life and drinking history. Conclusion: The incidence of menopausal symptoms among perimenopausal women is relatively common, widely and with many influencing factors. Therefore, health care providers should take appropriate interventions according to the individual situation, and then to improve the status of perimenopausal symptoms.

AB  - Aims: To determine the effects of herbal therapies on hot flushes and at least one other symptom including, sleep, mood, cognition, and pain that women experience during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause.Methods: An extensive search of PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, AMED, and Alt-Health Watch for randomized, controlled trials reported in English between January 2004 and July was conducted by an experienced reference librarian. There were 1193 abstracts identified but only 58 trials examined effectiveness of therapies for hot flushes and at least one additional co-occurring symptom.Results: Seventeen studies used herbal preparation including seven studies of black cohosh, two studies of black cohosh mixed with other herbals, and eight studies of other herbals. Of these, one study of black cohosh, two studies of black cohosh mixed with other herbals, and four other herbal studies had significant effects on hot flushes and at least one additional co-occurring symptom. The adverse events of herbal therapies were various, ranging from mild to moderate and women were generally tolerant of the preparations.Conclusions: Black cohosh mixed with other herbals, Rheum rhaponticum, and French maritime pine bark had significant effects on hot flushes and at least one other symptom. These herbal therapies may be a promising alternative treatment to hormonal treatment. Future studies should classify women based on their menopausal stages, report each symptom separately, have adequate sample size, focus on multiple co-occurring symptoms, and target symptom management of menopausal symptoms.

AB  - To gain a better understanding of temporomandibular disorders ( TMD) pain in adolescents, it is important to study the factors associated with its presence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate potential predictors for TMD pain in adolescents, thereby including a diversity of factors from the biopsychosocial model to determine the strongest predictors. The sample of this cross-sectional study consisted of 1094 adolescents. The presence of TMD pain was assessed using the RDC/ TMD, Axis I. Apart from demographical characteristics, the roles of parafunctional habits, psychosocial aspects, menarche and other bodily pain complaints were evaluated. Single and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify associations between the predictor variables and TMD pain. Painful TMD had a prevalence of 25·5%. Logistic regression analyses showed that TMD pain was associated with sleep bruxism ( OR = 1·8 95% CI = 1·34-2·34), awake bruxism ( OR = 2·1 95% CI = 1·56-2·83), other parafunctional habits ( OR = 2·2 95% CI = 1·17-4·08) and bodily pain complaints ( OR = 5·0 95% CI = 3·48-7·28). Parafunctional habits and other bodily pain complaints may play an important role in the presence of TMD pain in adolescents. Of course, it remains unclear whether the observed associations between the investigated factors and the adolescent's TMD pain have a true causal linkage.

AB  - Background: Women report many nonvasomotor symptoms across the menopausal transition, including sleep disturbances, depressed mood, and sexual problems. The co-occurrence of these three symptoms may represent a specific menopausal symptom triad. We sought to evaluate the interrelatedness of disturbed sleep, depressed mood, and sexual problems in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) and determine the characteristics of women exhibiting this symptom triad. Methods: SWAN is a multisite, multiethnic observational cohort study of the menopausal transition in the United States. Sleep disturbance, sexual problems, and depressed mood were determined based on self-report. Women who reported all three symptoms simultaneously were compared to those who did not. Logistic regression models estimated the association of demographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics with the symptom triad. Results: Study participants ( n=1716) were 49.8 years old on average and primarily in very good or excellent health. Sixteen and a half percent had depressed mood, 36.6% had a sleep problem, and 42.2% had any sexual problem. Five percent of women ( n=90) experienced all three symptoms. Women with the symptom triad compared with those without had lower household incomes, less education, were surgically postmenopausal or late perimenopausal, rated their general health as fair or poor, and had more stressful life events and lower social support. Conclusions: The symptom triad of sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and sexual problems occurred in only 5% of women, and occurred most often among women with lower socioeconomic status, greater psychosocial distress, and who were surgically menopausal or in the late perimenopause.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to investigate the influence of menopausal status on sleep patterns in a representative sample of women from São Paulo, Brazil.Study Design: A population-based survey with a probabilistic three-stage cluster sample of the city of São Paulo was used to represent the local population according to gender, age (20-80 years) and socioeconomic status.Main Outcome Measures: The female participants answered a sleep questionnaire, underwent polysomnographic recording and allowed their hormone levels to be measured. They also completed a gynecological questionnaire for classification of the reproductive aging stages: premenopausal or reproductive, perimenopausal or menopausal transition, and postmenopausal, defined as being after 12 months of amenorrhea. Women were allocated into early (the first 5 years after menopause) and late (after the first 5 years) stages.Results: A total of 535 women were included in this study: 339 were premenopausal, 53 were early postmenopausal, 118 were late postmenopausal and 25 were using hormone therapy or isoflavone compounds. Our main findings were that women in postmenopause spent more time in N3 sleep, had a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and lower SaO2 compared with premenopausal women after an analysis adjusted for confounding factors. We found no significant differences between early and late postmenopausal women in the adjusted analysis.Conclusion: Our results indicate menopause itself exerts a modest, but important influence on objective sleep patterns, independent of age, in particular on AHI and SaO2.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine levels of awareness and knowledge regarding male climacteric or andropause in Japanese women. We also examined whether there are differences in these levels between nurses as a health profession group and office workers as a general population group.Methods: Two thousand and eight hundred female registered nurses and women with office-related general occupations aged 20-65 years in Japan completed health questionnaires regarding awareness and knowledge of male climacteric, including male menopausal symptoms and treatments.Results: The proportion in women who had heard of the term male climacteric in nurses was significantly higher than that in office workers. Nurses with past or current experience of menopausal symptoms were likely to recognize male climacteric. Nurses also had a higher level of knowledge than did office workers regarding male menopausal symptoms. High proportions of both nurses and office workers acknowledged depressed mood, irritability, nervousness and sleep problems as male menopausal symptoms. The proportions of women with sympathy for men with male climacteric were high in women with experience of past or current menopausal symptoms and in women who were close to men who suffered from menopausal symptoms.Conclusions: Nurses with past or current experience of menopausal symptoms had high levels of awareness and knowledge of male climacteric. To spread more information and knowledge regarding male climacteric, provision of education for these nurses may be needed.

AB  - Symptoms of the menopause transition-altered cycle length, change in amount of bleeding, sleep disruption, fatigue, mood swings, forgetfulness, heat intolerance, and palpitations-can also reflect thyroid dysfunction, common in midlife women. Although many clinicians are familiar with diagnosis and management of overt thyroid disorders, subclinical thyroid disease adds an entirely new dimension to this arena.

AB  - Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity. The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of 45 decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Hearing impairment is diagnosed in 2% to 10% of preterm infants versus 0.1% of the general paediatric population. Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to 45 dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes. Primary objectiveTo determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. Secondary objectives1. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity).2. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age.3. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance.4. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings 2000 to 2014 (Abstracts2View(TM)), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November 2014. Preterm infants (< 32 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < 1500 g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit. We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < 48 hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > 48 hours old. There was no significant difference in weight at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) 111 g (95% confidence interval (CI) -151 to 374 g) (n = 23). There was no significant difference in weight at 18 to 22 months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.31 kg, 95% CI -1.53 to 2.16 kg (n = 14). There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD 14.00, 95% CI 3.13 to 24.87 (n = 12), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at 18 to 22 months corrected age: MD -2.16, 95% CI -18.44 to 14.12 (n =12). To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Multiple health issues affect women throughout the life course differently from men, or do not affect men at all. Although attention to women's health is important in all stages in life, health among middle-aged and elderly women has not received sufficient attention by scientists and policy-makers. Related to the menopausal transition and the experiences accumulated until that age, many diseases occur or further develop in middle-aged and elderly women. To improve women's quality of life and guarantee a long-lasting and active role for middle-aged and elderly women in society, prevention of chronic diseases and disability is a key aspect. In this manuscript we give an overview of the major health issues for peri- and post-menopausal women, we summarize risk factors and interventions to improve menopausal health. Based on the available scientific literature and the global burden of disease endeavor, we have selected and herein describe the following top 11 key health issues, selected in terms of burden exerted in women's mortality, morbidity, disability and quality of life: cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, cancer, cognitive decline and dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, depression, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbances and migraine.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of obesity increases during female mid-life and although many factors have been identified, data from Latin America is lacking.Objective: To assess factors related to obesity among middle-aged women and determine the association with depressive symptoms, sedentary lifestyle and other factors.Methods: A total of 6079 women aged 40-59 years of 11 Latin American countries were asked to fill out the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Menopause Rating Scale, the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a general questionnaire containing personal socio-demographic data, anthropometric measures and lifestyle information. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m(2).Results: Obesity was observed in 18.5% and sedentary lifestyle in 63.9%. A 55.5% presented vasomotor symptoms, 12.2% had severe menopausal symptoms and 13.2% used hormone therapy for the menopause. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was 46.5% and anxiety 59.7%. Our logistic regression model found that significant factors associated to obesity included: arterial hypertension (OR: 1.87), depressive symptoms (OR: 1.57), sedentary lifestyle (OR: 1.50) diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.34), higher number of individuals living at home (OR: 1.31), sleep problems (OR:1.22), anxiety (OR: 1.21), having a stable partner (OR: 1.20), parity (OR: 1.16) and vasomotor symptoms (OR:1.14). A lower risk for obesity was found among women using hormonal contraceptives (OR: 0.69).Conclusion: Obesity in middle-aged women is the consequence of the interaction of multiple factors. It was associated to hypertension, depressive symptoms, sedentary lifestyle, climacteric symptoms and other factors.

AB  - Objective: Sleep disturbances are common among women in midlife; prevalence increases among perimenopausal/postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. Paroxetine 7.5 mg is the only nonhormonal treatment that has been approved in the United States for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. In two pivotal phase 3 studies evaluating its efficacy and safety, improvements in sleep disturbances were also prospectively evaluated.Methods: Postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms were randomly assigned to paroxetine 7.5 mg (n = 591) or placebo (n = 593) once daily for 12 weeks (both studies) or 24 weeks (24-wk study). Predefined assessments on weeks 4, 12, and 24 included number of nighttime awakenings attributed to vasomotor symptoms, sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep-related adverse events. The two studies' data for weeks 1 to 12 were pooled.Results: At baseline, participants reported a mean of 3.6 awakenings/night attributed to vasomotor symptoms. Nighttime awakenings attributed to vasomotor symptoms were significantly reduced within 4 weeks of initiating paroxetine 7.5 mg treatment (39% reduction vs 28% for placebo; P = 0.0049), and reductions were sustained through 12 or 24 weeks of treatment. Paroxetine 7.5 mg treatment also significantly increased nighttime sleep duration (week 4, +31 vs +16 min for placebo; P = 0.0075), but no significant between-group differences in sleep-onset latency or sleep-related adverse events such as sedation were observed.Conclusions: In postmenopausal women treated for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, paroxetine 7.5 mg significantly reduces the number of nighttime awakenings attributed to vasomotor symptoms and increases sleep duration without differentially affecting sleep-onset latency or sedation.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate patterns in actigraphy-defined sleep measures across the menstrual cycle by testing the hypothesis that sleep would be more disrupted in the premenstrual period (ie, within the 14 d before menses).Methods: A community-based longitudinal study of wrist actigraphy-derived sleep measures was conducted in 163 (58 African American, 78 white, and 27 Chinese) late-reproductive-age (mean [SD], 51.5 [2.0] y) women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. Daily measures of sleep (sleep efficiency [%] and total sleep time [minutes]) and movement during sleep (mean activity score [counts]) were characterized using wrist actigraphy across a menstrual cycle or 35 days, whichever was shorter. Data were standardized to 28 days to account for unequal cycle lengths and divided into four weekly segments for analyses.Results: Sleep efficiency declined gradually across the menstrual cycle, but the decline became pronounced on the fourth week (the premenstrual period). Compared with the third week, sleep efficiency declined by 5% (P < 0.0001) and mean total sleep time was 25 minutes less (P = 0.0002) on the fourth week. We found no significant differences between the mean for the second week and the mean for the third week. The association of weekly segments with sleep efficiency or total sleep time was modified by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, including body mass index, race, study site, financial strain, marital status, and smoking.Conclusions: Among late-reproductive-age women, sleep varies systematically across the menstrual cycle, including a gradual decline in sleep efficiency across all weeks, with a more marked change premenstrually during the last week of the menstrual cycle. These sleep changes may be modified by altering lifestyle factors.

AB  - Obesity is a serious problem worldwide and particularly in the United States, and in women is associated with an increased risk of death and morbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypercholesterolemia) as well as malignancies such as endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer. Adverse effects after gynecologic surgery, such as surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and wound complications, are more prevalent in obese women than in normal-weight women. Preoperative consultation with an anesthesiologist should be considered for the obese patient in whom the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea is suspected on clinical grounds or who is at risk of coronary artery disease, has a difficult airway, or has poorly controlled hypertension. Gynecologic surgeons should have the knowledge to counsel obese women on the risks specific to this group. As with all patients, evidence demonstrates that, in general, vaginal hysterectomy is associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomy. Postoperative care of the obese patient is similar to postoperative care of the normalweight patient and comorbid conditions should be taken into consideration.

AB  - Purpose: Dysmenorrhea refers to the experience of pelvic pain/cramps experienced by women around or during menstruation. A literature review indicated that no existing patient-reported outcome measure was adequate to support labeling claims in dysmenorrhea. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a new measure that could be used as a primary end point in dysmenorrhea clinical trials.Methods: Open-ended interviews were conducted with 52 dysmenorrhea patients, including a subset of 12 women with a comorbid pelvic pain condition (PPC). Verbatim transcripts were analyzed thematically. The findings were used to generate draft items for an electronic diary (eDiary). A further 24 dysmenorrhea patients pilot-tested the eDiary for 1-5 weeks and completed cognitive interviews to assess content validity. Revisions to the eDiary were implemented based on the findings.Results: In the first set of interviews, 51 women (98 %) spontaneously reported pain/cramps in or around the pelvic region (abdomen, lower back, legs/upper thighs, and vaginal area). Pain experiences reported were similar across dysmenorrhea and dysmenorrhea plus PPC subgroups, except that the pelvic pain among PPC patients occurred throughout the month, not only during menstruation. All participants described the detrimental impact of dysmenorrhea on health-related quality of life.Conclusions: The eDiary was conceptually comprehensive and easy to complete/understand during cognitive debriefing. The resulting nine-item diary included assessment of: menstrual bleeding severity; pain severity; use of analgesics; impact on work/school, physical activities, social and leisure activities, and sleep. Psychometric validation is ongoing and will assess the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the eDiary as a comprehensive dysmenorrhea assessment.

DESIGN: 3-arm double-blind randomized trial. Participants assigned in a 2:2:3 ratio to 17[beta] estradiol 0.5 mg/day (n = 97), venlafaxine XR 75 mg/day (n = 96), or placebo (n = 146) for 8 weeks. SETTING: Academic research centers. PARTICIPANTS: 339 community-dwelling perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with >=2 bothersome hot flashes per day. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) at baseline, week 4 and 8; 325 women (96%) provided ISI data and 312 women (92%) provided PSQI data at baseline and follow-up. At baseline, mean (SD) hot flash frequency was 8.1/day (5.3), mean ISI was 11.1 (6.0), and mean PSQI was 7.5 (3.4). Mean (95% CI) change from baseline in ISI at week 8 was -4.1 points (-5.3 to -3.0) with estradiol, -5.0 points (-6.1 to -3.9) with venlafaxine, and -3.0 points (-3.8 to -2.3) with placebo (P overall treatment effect vs. placebo 0.09 for estradiol and 0.007 for venlafaxine). Mean (95% CI) change from baseline in PSQI at week 8 was -2.2 points (-2.8 to -1.6) with estradiol, -2.3 points (-2.9 to -1.6) with venlafaxine, and -1.2 points (-1.7 to -0.8) with placebo (P overall treatment effect vs. placebo 0.04 for estradiol and 0.06 for venlafaxine). CONCLUSIONS: Among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes, both low dose oral estradiol and low-dose venlafaxine compared with placebo modestly reduced insomnia symptoms and improved subjective sleep quality.

AB  - Background: Although fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety are associated with pain in breast cancer patients, it is unknown whether acupuncture can decrease these comorbid symptoms in cancer patients with pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress in breast cancer survivors who experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).Methods: The authors performed a randomized controlled trial of an 8-week course of EA compared with a waitlist control (WLC) group and a sham acupuncture (SA) group in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who self-reported joint pain attributable to AIs. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression were measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The effects of EA and SA versus WLC on these outcomes were evaluated using mixed-effects models.Results: Of the 67 randomly assigned patients, baseline pain interference was associated with fatigue (Pearson correlation coefficient [r]=0.75; P < .001), sleep disturbance (r=0.38; P=.0026), and depression (r=0.58; P < .001). Compared with the WLC condition, EA produced significant improvements in fatigue (P=.0095), anxiety (P=.044), and depression (P=.015) and a nonsignificant improvement in sleep disturbance (P=.058) during the 12-week intervention and follow-up period. In contrast, SA did not produce significant reductions in fatigue or anxiety symptoms but did produce a significant improvement in depression compared with the WLC condition (P=.0088).Conclusions: Compared with usual care, EA produced significant improvements in fatigue, anxiety, and depression; whereas SA improved only depression in women experiencing AI-related arthralgia.

AB  - Objective: To quantify the impact of objectively recorded hot flashes on objective sleep in perimenopausal women.Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants underwent 1-5 laboratory-based polysomnographic recordings for a total of 63 nights, including sternal skin-conductance measures, from which 222 hot flashes were identified according to established criteria. Data were analyzed with hierarchical mixed-effect models and Spearman's rank correlations.Setting: Sleep laboratory.Patient(s): Thirty-four perimenopausal women (age ± SD: 50.4 ± 2.7 years).Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): Perceived and polysomnographic sleep measures (sleep quality, amount of time spent awake after sleep onset, and number of awakenings). Subjective (frequency and level of bother) and objective (frequency and amount of hot flash-associated awake time) hot-flash measures.Result(s): Women had an average of 3.5 (95% confidence interval: 2.8-4.2, range = 1-9) objective hot flashes per night. A total of 69.4% of hot flashes were associated with an awakening. Hot flash-associated time awake per night was, on average, 16.6 minutes (95% confidence interval: 10.8-22.4 minutes), which accounted for 27.2% (SD 27.1) of total awake time per night. Hot flash-associated time awake, but not hot flash frequency, was negatively associated with sleep efficiency and positively associated with waking after sleep onset. In addition, self-reported wakefulness correlated with hot flash-associated waking, suggesting that women's estimates of wakefulness are influenced by the amount of time spent awake in association with hot flashes during the night. Having more perceived and bothersome hot flashes was correlated with more perceived wakefulness and awakenings and more objective hot flash-associated time awake and hot-flash frequency.Conclusion(s): The presence of physiological hot flashes accounts for a significant proportion of total objective time awake during the night in perimenopausal women.

AB  - Sleep disturbance is a common complaint for women going through the menopausal transition. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies showed a small but significant relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance and menopausal stage and highlighted a possible influence of culture. However, the longitudinal relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance and menopausal transition has not been explored. This paper aimed to review literature on the longitudinal relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance and menopausal transition among community dwelling midlife women. Multiple electronic databases were systematically searched. Literature published prior to 2013 was reviewed. A narrative synthesis was used to analyse the results due to high level of heterogeneity across the included studies. Overall, review of eligible studies showed a small increased risk of self-reported sleep disturbance as women go through the menopausal transition after adjustment of potential confounders. Although the methodological quality of the majority of included studies was classified as high, the impact of culture on this relationship could not be explored, as all of the included studies were conducted in western countries. Like vasomotor symptoms, self-reported sleep disturbance is one of the core menopausal symptoms. Management strategies should be put in place to help women manage sleep disturbance to prevent complications and to improve health related quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because premenstrual symptoms in fertile age resemble menopausal symptoms, many women with premenstrual symptoms fear that they have an increased risk for developing vasomotor symptoms in menopause. We investigated the impact of premenstrual symptoms on the occurrence and severity of menopausal vasomotor symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: One hundred fifty recently postmenopausal healthy women recorded hot flashes prospectively (23, none; 34, mild; 30, moderate; 63, severe), and their quality of life was assessed using the Women's Health Questionnaire. We measured the occurrence of premenstrual symptoms in fertile age using the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool and calculated a premenstrual score reflecting symptom severity. RESULTS: One hundred seven women (89.2%) reported premenstrual symptoms (median score, 7.0; range, 0-38), which had impaired work efficiency or social relations in 64 women (53.3%). The occurrence of premenstrual symptoms was similar in women with and without hot flashes of different magnitudes, as the mean (SEM) premenstrual score was 7.8 (1.4) for no hot flashes, 5.0 (1.0) for mild hot flashes, 7.7 (1.3) for moderate hot flashes, and 9.4 (1.2) for severe hot flashes (P = 0.10). The severity of premenstrual symptoms failed to correlate with the severity of postmenopausal hot flashes (r = 0.087, P = 0.346). A history of premenstrual symptoms was associated with impaired memory and concentration capacity (r = -0.448, P < 0.001), depressive mood (r = -0.263, P = 0.02), sleep problems (r = -0.282, P = 0.01), and feeling less attractive (r = -0.260, P = 0.02) during the first menopausal years. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of premenstrual symptoms in fertile age is associated with impaired quality of life, but not hot flashes, in recently postmenopausal women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between menopausal stages and sleep disturbance reported using subjective methods. Secondary aims included examining the influence of culture/ethnicity on the relationship between menopausal stages and sleep disturbance. METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were searched from the first available year to November 2013, and a manual search of the reference lists of review articles identified was also conducted. Twenty-four studies with a total of 63,542 midlife women were identified, coded, and analyzed. RESULTS: The crude and adjusted odds of experiencing sleep disturbance were small but statistically significant for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, using premenopause as the reference group. The ethnicity of the samples influenced effect sizes; Asian and white women both experienced an increased rate of sleep disturbance at the perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages compared with the premenopausal stage, whereas Hispanic women experienced no change in sleep disturbance across the menopausal transition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of sleep disturbance is higher in perimenopausal, postmenopausal, and surgical menopausal women than in premenopausal women. There is an independent relationship between menopausal stages and sleep disturbance beyond the effects of aging and other confounders, although the magnitude of the relationship is small. Culture, ethnicity, or both might affect the levels of sleep disturbance at various menopausal stages.

AB  - Objective: The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes of an adjustable Single Incision Sling (Ajust™ C.R. Bard Inc., New Providence, NJ, USA) for the treatment of SUI, with a 2-year follow-up. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the safety of this procedure and the impact of this mini-sling on the filling and voiding phases of the bladder.Study Design: In our prospective multicenter study we included 95 females with a clinical symptomatic and urodynamic diagnosis of primary SUI, and unsuccessful previous conservative treatment. Cure rate was evaluated objectively, using a standardized cough stress test and subjectively using the patient global impression of improvement. The King's Health questionnaire was used to evaluate quality of life (QoL). Urgency was evaluated using the patient perception of intensity of urgency scale. Complications were assessed intra-, peri- and post-operatively. All patients underwent urodynamic studies pre-operatively and at 6 months. The McNemar chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, the paired t-test for continuous parametric variables, and the Fisher exact test for continuous non-parametric variables. A logistic regression model and odds ratios (with 95 percent confidence intervals) were used to assess the independent prognostic value of four variables for the outcome (age, parity, body mass index and menopausal status).Results: 92 Patients completed the 2-year follow-up. The objective cure rate was 83.7% and the subjective cure rate was 81.5%. De novo urgency was present in 9 patients (9.8%) and was associated with de novo urge incontinence in 6 patients (6.5%). Only 1 patient with de novo urge incontinence showed de novo detrusor overactivity. Regarding QoL, the King's Health Questionnaire indicated a statistically significant improvement in all domains except sleep. We observed no intraoperative complications. Post-operatively 1 patient referred pain in the right leg, 3 patients had mesh extrusions, 1 patient had recurrent urinary tract infections. Post-operative urodynamics showed a statistically significant increase of detrusor pressure at maximum flow and a reduction of maximum flow rate. No patients were obstructed according to the Blaivas and Groutz nomogram.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with menopause-related symptoms in older women.Methods: A randomly selected subset of 1,407 women, among 26,104 potentially eligible participants of the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D trial of postmenopausal women aged 51 to 80 years, had 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels measured at the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D trial baseline visit. Information about menopause-related symptoms at baseline was obtained by questionnaire and included overall number of symptoms and composite measures of sleep disturbance, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue, as well as individual symptoms. After exclusions for missing data, 530 women (mean [SD] age, 66.2 [6.8] y) were included in these analyses.Results: Borderline significant associations between 25(OH)D levels and total number of menopausal symptoms were observed (with P values ranging from 0.05 to 0.06 for fully adjusted models); however, the effect was clinically insignificant and disappeared with correction for multiple testing. No associations between 25(OH)D levels and composite measures of sleep disturbance, emotional well-being, or energy/fatigue were observed (P's > 0.10 for fully adjusted models).Conclusions: There is no evidence for a clinically important association between serum 25(OH)D levels and menopause-related symptoms in postmenopausal women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate subjective sleep quality in premenopausal and postmenopausal women and to study its association with night sweats, hot flashes, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: A total of 158 healthy women were recruited; 107 were premenopausal (44-48 y) and 51 were postmenopausal (53-58 y). Sleep quality was evaluated with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, night sweats and hot flashes were evaluated with a specific symptom questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Postmenopausal women had poorer general sleep quality (P < 0.001), slept more restlessly (P = 0.020), and had more nocturnal awakenings (P = 0.015). However, the frequency of difficulty falling asleep, snoring, witnessed apnea, or use of sleep medication was similar between the groups. Furthermore, sleep latency, morning tiredness, or daytime tiredness did not differ between the groups. Postmenopausal women did not report more unintentional falling asleep at work or during leisure time; however, when not active, they dozed off more easily than premenopausal women (P < 0.001). Postmenopausal women had more night sweats (P < 0.001), hot flashes (P < 0.001), and depressive symptoms (P < 0.001). Even a low frequency of night sweats disturbed sleep in postmenopausal women, whereas only frequent night sweats were disturbing in premenopausal women. Depressive symptoms disturbed sleep regardless of menopause status. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance insomnia, most evidently because of night sweats and hot flashes, seems to be the major type of insomnia in postmenopausal women and has to be considered when choosing insomnia treatment for this group. Initiation of sleep and daytime vitality are not, in general, affected by menopause.

AB  - Objective: The study examined prevalence of self-reported use of medication recommended or prescribed by a doctor for depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep problems; and modelled baseline factors that predicted use over 3 years for each condition.Methods: Analyses were undertaken on the 2001 and 2004 surveys of mid-aged women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Dependent variables were self-reported use in past 4 weeks of medications recommended or prescribed by a doctor for depression, anxiety, stress, or sleep problems in 2001 and 2004. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to predict medication use for each condition over 3 years.Results: Prevalence of prescribed medication use (2001, 2004) for each condition was depression (7.2, 8.9 %), anxiety (7.4, 9.0 %), stress (4.8, 5.7 %), and sleep problems (8.7, 9.5 %). Multivariable analyses revealed that odds of medication use across 3 years in all four conditions were higher for women with poorer mental and physical health, using hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or having seen a counsellor; and increased over time for depression, anxiety, and stress models. Medication use for depression was also higher for overweight/obese women, ex-smokers, and unmarried. Medication use for anxiety was higher for unmarried and non-working/low occupational women. Medication use for stress was higher for non-working women. Additional predictors of medication for sleep were surgical menopause, and area of residence.Conclusions: Self-reported use of prescribed medication for four mental health conditions is increased over time after controlling for mental and physical health and other variables. Research needs to explore decision-making processes influencing differential rates of psychoactive medication use and their relationship with health outcomes.

AB  - Migraine is, to a great extent, a genetically determined disorder and once it has manifested itself, it generally continues for years if not for decades. While the migraine is active, headaches can seemingly occur spontaneously but are often reportedly precipitated by events or factors, known as migraine triggers, the interplay of which is the topic of this paper. Among migraine triggers, the menstrual cycle is an important one that probably accounts for much of the excess of migraine in women compared with men. Much has also been written about stress as a trigger of migraine, with headache occurring after rather than during stress, when relaxation occurs. Stress is also 1 of the 4 most often acknowledged headache triggers in general, the others being fatigue, not eating on time, and lack of sleep. Singularly, the triggers are generally necessary but not sufficient, ie, not powerful enough to bring on headache by themselves and, hence, compounding of those triggers is usually required. There is evidence to suggest that the premenstrual phase has a magnifying effect on the stress-headache interaction. The same is true for low-sleep duration with the (predictive) model fitting best when stress and low-sleep duration are considered additive. Menstruation has been identified as possibly the only absolute trigger of headache that is both necessary and sufficient. The scientific study of migraine triggers requires knowledge not just of how often in an individual a trigger is followed by migraine headache but also of how often it is not. Having identified trigger-headache associations, it needs to be determined which triggers are causative in the individual, either singly or in combination with others. This requires running an experiment with the individual that involves behavioral intervention to change exposure to a given trigger and determine whether that improves migraine. The ubiquitous adoption of the smart phone as a personal-data entry device, along with the possibility of bringing the results of sophisticated statistical analysis into the hands of patients and physicians, may well provide us with an important set of tools that will finally allow the unravelling of the age-old migraine-trigger puzzle.

AB  - Objective To better familiarize the reader with a migraine-related disorder, cyclic vomiting syndrome ( CVS) in adults, and to discuss its diagnosis and treatment. Background CVS is a profoundly disabling disorder characterized by recurrent, stereotypic episodes of incapacitating nausea and vomiting, separated by completely asymptomatic intervals. CVS episodes tend to start at the same time of day, persist for the same duration, and present with the same intensity and associated symptoms. Most patients experience prodromal symptoms and can identify triggers that precipitate attacks, such as menstruation, lack of sleep, certain foods, physical exertion, and stress. The prevalence of CVS in adults is unknown, but since its occurrence in this age group has been little recognized, patients typically experience lengthy delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Method Literature review, case reports, and discussion. Results Given genetic links of CVS to migraine, as well as its comorbidity, typical migraine triggers, and response to similar acute and preventive medications, CVS likely represents a disorder on the migraine spectrum. Conclusion Adult CVS is not only highly comorbid with migraine, but it responds to migraine preventives, and in some cases to injectable sumatriptan even in the absence of headache.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease with major consequences. Obesity and aging, as well as male gender, are recognized risk factors for OSA; however, the condition of OSA in women and the elderly has received only minimal attention. OSA in women is perhaps under-appreciated due to the traditional stereotype of an older obese man presenting with OSA. However, OSA in women, particularly post-menopause, can have important sequelae. Similarly, OSA in the elderly may have unique mechanisms, and the consequences are still debated. Further work is clearly needed to define the mechanisms and consequences of OSA in special populations.

AB  - Summary Purpose The purpose of this study was to validate the Actiwatch with behaviorally determined sleep–wake state in preterm infants and to explore the influence of postmenstrual age on the accuracy of Actiwatch. Methods A prospective and comparative research design was used. Twenty-four preterm infants with postmenstrual age ranging from 28–38 weeks were studied. The infants were studied for 2 hours between two feedings. Infant's sleep and wake state was measured every 30 seconds using Actiwatch and the Anderson Behavioral State Scale simultaneously. Results Actiwatch demonstrated high agreement, sensitivity, and predictivity of sleep state, when validated with the Anderson Behavioral State Scale at the setting of high and automatic activity thresholds, and was not influenced by the infant's postmenstrual age. However, lower specificity and predictivity were found in the wake state, and influenced by postmenstrual age. Conclusion Results of this study suggest that high activity thresholds are the most accurate for determining sleep state in preterm infants, and health care professionals must take the limitations into consideration while using the Actiwatch to assess wake states.

AB  - Breast pain has been investigated in clinical populations; however we have yet to understand the prevalence and severity of this condition in the general population to determine whether more should be done to minimize the impact of this condition on women's quality of life. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence, severity, and impact of breast pain on quality of life and factors associated with breast pain in a normal population sample. 1,659 females (34.1 ± 13.2 years) completed the Breast Pain Questionnaire online, providing information on demographics, duration, frequency, and severity of breast pain, its association with the menstrual cycle, relieving, and aggravating factors and the impact on quality of life. Over half the sample (51.5%) experienced breast pain, with a severity similar to that reported in clinical populations. There was a higher prevalence of breast pain in older participants, larger breasted participants and those who were less fit and active. Of symptomatic participants, 41% and 35% reported breast pain affecting quality of life measures of sex and sleep and 10% of symptomatic participants had sufferer for over half their lives. The results of this study suggest that breast pain is a significant issue within the general population and yet this is the first study to investigate it. It is concluded that this condition warrants increased investigation, awareness, and treatment. The reported relationship between breast pain and fitness/activity levels may offer an alternative treatment in the form of exercise intervention strategies to reduce breast pain.

AB  - Background: There is convincing evidence that circadian disruption mediated by exposure to light at night promotes mammary carcinogenesis in rodents. The role that light at night plays in human breast cancer etiology remains unknown. We evaluated the relationship between estimates of indoor and outdoor light at night and the risk of breast cancer among members of the California Teachers Study.Methods: Indoor light-at-night estimates were based on questionnaire data regarding sleep habits and use of nighttime lighting while sleeping. Estimates of outdoor light at night were derived from imagery data obtained from the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program assigned to geocoded addresses of study participants. Analyses were conducted among 106,731 California Teachers Study members who lived in California, had no prior history of breast cancer, and provided information on lighting while sleeping. Five thousand ninety-five cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed 1995-2010 were identified via linkage to the California Cancer Registry. We used age-stratified Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for breast cancer risk factors and neighborhood urbanization and socioeconomic class.Results: An increased risk was found for women living in areas with the highest quintile of outdoor light-at-night exposure estimates (HR = 1.12 [95% CI = 1.00-1.26]; test for trend, P = 0.06). Although more pronounced among premenopausal women (HR = 1.34 [95% CI = 1.07-1.69]; test for trend, P = 0.04), the associations did not differ statistically by menopausal status (test for interaction, P = 0.34).Conclusions: Women living in areas with high levels of ambient light at night may be at an increased risk of breast cancer. Future studies that integrate quantitative measurements of indoor and outdoor light at night are warranted.

AB  - Background/objectives: The extent to which alterations in energy expenditure (EE) in response to sleep restriction contribute to the short sleep-obesity relationship is not clearly defined. Short sleep may induce changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR), thermic effect of food (TEF) and postprandial substrate oxidation.Subjects/methods: Ten females (age and body mass index: 22-43 years and 23.4-28 kg m(-2)) completed a randomized, crossover study assessing the effects of short (4 h per night) and habitual (8 h per night) sleep duration on fasting and postprandial RMR and respiratory quotient (RQ). Measurements were taken after three nights using whole-room indirect calorimetry. The TEF was assessed over a 6-h period following consumption of a high-fat liquid meal.Results: Short versus habitual sleep did not affect RMR (1.01±0.05 and 0.97±0.04 kcal min(-1); P=0.23). Fasting RQ was significantly lower after short versus habitual sleep (0.84±0.01 and 0.88±0.01; P=0.028). Postprandial EE (short: 1.13±0.04 and habitual: 1.10±0.04, P=0.09) and RQ (short: 0.88±0.01 and habitual: 0.88±0.01, P=0.50) after the high-fat meal were not different between conditions. TEF was similar between conditions (0.24±0.02 kcal min(-1) in both; P=0.98), as was the ~6-h incremental area under the curve (1.16±0.10 and 1.17±0.09 kcal min(-1) × 356 min after short and habitual sleep, respectively; P=0.92).Conclusions: Current findings observed in non-obese healthy premenopausal women do not support the hypothesis that alterations in TEF and postprandial substrate oxidation are major contributors to the higher rate of obesity observed in short sleepers. In exploring a role of sleep duration on EE, research should focus on potential alterations in physical activity to explain the increased obesity risk in short sleepers.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the separate and interactive associations of menopausal stage, menopausal symptoms, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with cognition. We hypothesized that HIV-infected perimenopausal women would show the greatest cognitive difficulties and that menopausal symptoms would be inversely associated with cognition.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 708 HIV-infected and 278 HIV-uninfected premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal women (64% African American; median age, 44 y) from the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Participants completed tests of verbal learning and memory, attention/processing speed, and executive function. We administered a menopausal symptom questionnaire that assessed anxiety, vasomotor, and sleep symptoms and obtained measures of depressive symptoms.Results: In multivariable regression analyses controlling for relevant covariates, HIV infection, but not menopausal stage, was associated with worse performance on all cognitive measures (P's < 0.05). Depressive symptoms were associated with lower cognitive performance on measures of verbal learning and memory, attention, and executive function (P's < 0.05); anxiety symptoms were associated with lower performance on measures of verbal learning and memory (P's < 0.05). Vasomotor symptoms were associated with worse attention (P < 0.05). HIV and anxiety symptoms interacted to influence verbal learning (P's < 0.05); elevated anxiety was associated with worse verbal learning in HIV-infected women only.Conclusions: Vasomotor, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, but not menopausal stage, are associated with worse cognitive performance in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, although elevated anxiety symptoms are more associated with verbal learning deficits in HIV-infected women. Because cognitive problems can interfere with everyday functioning, including treatment adherence, it may be important to screen and treat anxiety in HIV-infected women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbance is an important change in menopause because it affects quality of life and can lead to other conditions such as depression. This study measured sleep alterations and explored associated physical, emotional, hormonal, and lifestyle factors during perimenopause and postmenopause. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 160 women who were classified as perimenopausal (n = 85) or postmenopausal (n = 75). Using diaries, we collected data on duration of sleep, time awake in bed, and sleep efficiency. Follicle-stimulating hormone, 17[beta]-estradiol, and cortisol levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay, and serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlations between sleep measurements and symptoms were assessed using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: The reported duration of sleep was similar for both groups of women (close to 6.9 h), and sleep efficiency was 88%. We did not find any factor that was associated with duration of sleep. Sleep efficiency was negatively associated with age, perimenopause/postmenopause status, loss of sexual interest, hot flashes, and depressed mood. Time awake in bed was positively associated with depressed mood (P < 0.000001), cigarette smoking (P < 0.000041), menopause status (P < 0.00009), and age (P < 0.0009). These associations remained after controlling for exercise, alcohol consumption, and caffeine consumption as confounding variables. Finally, morning salivary cortisol was reduced in postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Time awake in bed shows the most significant associations. Depressed mood, age, and menopause status are the main factors associated with sleep disturbances.

AB  - Background: Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy results in substantial survival benefits for patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The rates of poor adherence and discontinuation of AI therapy are high, primarily because of treatment-related toxicities like musculoskeletal pain. Although pain-related symptoms may worsen during AI therapy, the authors hypothesized that nonpersistence with AI therapy was associated with symptoms that were present before treatment initiation.Methods: Postmenopausal women initiating AI therapy who were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial completed questionnaires at baseline to assess sleep, fatigue, mood, and pain. Reasons for treatment discontinuation during the first year of treatment were recorded. Associations between baseline patient-reported symptoms and treatment discontinuation because of toxicity were identified using logistic regression.Results: Four hundred forty-nine patients were evaluable. The odds of treatment discontinuation were higher in patients who reported a greater number of symptoms before AI initiation. Baseline poor sleep quality was associated with early treatment discontinuation, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.89; P = .002). Baseline presence of tired feeling and forgetfulness had similar ORs for discontinuation (tired feeling: OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.15-2.67; P = .009; forgetfulness: OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.11-2.48; P = .015). An increasing total number of baseline symptoms was associated with an increased likelihood of treatment discontinuation, with an OR of 1.89 (95% CI, 1.20-2.96; P = .006) for 3 to 5 symptoms versus 0 to 2 symptoms.Conclusions: Symptom clusters in breast cancer survivors that are present before the initiation of adjuvant AI therapy may have a negative impact on a patient's persistence with therapy. Interventions to manage these symptoms may improve breast cancer outcomes and quality of life.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Labisia pumila var alata ( L. pumila) water extract for improving quality of life, cardiovascular and hormonal balance. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 16-week study in healthy pre- and postmenopausal women aged 40-60 years was conducted in Kelantan, Malaysia. The subjects were randomized to 400 mg propriety extract of L. pumila or placebo. A Women's Health Questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data. A total of 197 subjects ( L. pumila: n=102 and placebo: n=95) were analyzed. Subjects in the herbal group showed improved memory/concentration, vasomotor symptoms, menstrual symptoms, and sleep problems by 8.3%, 15.9%, 11.8%, and 31.0%, respectively. The greatest improvement was observed for the question: 'I get frightened or panic feelings for apparently no reason at all' with a 53% decrease as compared with placebo. Improvements were also seen in the cardiovascular parameters, and the safety profiles were normal. Postmenopausal women supplemented with L. pumila showed no changes in gynecological relevant hormones luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and 17 β-Estradiol. Water extract of L. pumila was shown to be safe and effective for improving several parameters of quality of life and cardiovascular risks factors (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]).

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is often overlooked in the context of schizophrenia because its hallmark, daytime sleepiness, is so easily attributable to antipsychotic drugs. This is a special problem for women. Aims: To underscore the importance of diagnosing and treating OSA in women with schizophrenia. Methods: A review of the recent literature (search terms: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea; Schizophrenia; Women (or Gender); Obesity; Antipsychotics; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)) as it applies to a composite case vignette taken from the files of a specialty clinic that treats women with psychosis. Results: The rate of OSA in women who are both obese and postmenopausal is very similar to that of men. Family history, smoking, and the use of tobacco, alcohol and of antipsychotic medication increase the risk. Despite reluctance, patients with schizophrenia generally agree to undergo sleep studies. Compliance with CPAP is difficult, but can be aided by the physician and is, on the whole, relatively high in women. CPAP improves sleep parameters and may also improve cardiometabolic and cognitive indices, although this still needs to be more fully researched. Conclusion: Schizophrenia and untreated OSA are both associated with high mortality rates in women as well as men.

AB  - Aims: Review controlled clinical trials of isoflavones and amino acid preparation effects on hot flashes and at least one other symptom including mood, sleep, pain, and cognitive function that women report during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause.Methods: An experienced reference librarian searched PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, AMED, and Alt-Health Watch for English-language randomized controlled trials between 2004 and July 2011. Seventeen trials of isoflavones and amino acid effects on hot flashes and one additional symptom were identified.Results: In five trials of soy isoflavone preparations, two (6g soy germ extract and 25 g soy protein in soy nuts) significantly decreased hot flashes, but no other symptoms. In the seven trials of other isoflavones, six significantly reduced hot flashes; in addition, red clover (80 mg) significantly reduced mood symptoms; Rexflavone (350 mg) for women with Kupperman Index>20 significantly reduced sleep symptoms; two trials had significant reductions for pain: isoflavone powder (90 mg) and red clover (80 mg). The only trial in this systematic review that significantly reduced cognitive symptoms was red clover (80 mg). In one trial, red clover isoflavone (80 mg/day) significantly relieved hot flashes, mood, pain, and cognitive symptoms. Amino acids yielded no significant results. Equol supplements of 30 mg/day for non-Equol producing women significantly reduced mood symptoms in one trial. The magnolia bark extract combination significantly reduced hot flashes, mood, and sleep symptoms.Conclusions: Isoflavone trials yielded significant reductions on hot flashes and co-occurring symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopause, but studies require replication with larger sample sizes and attention to measurement of outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between menopause and self-reported sleep quality in Chinese women without vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from a decoded database of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Menopause was defined as absence of menses for at least 12 months or a history of hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A higher global PSQI score indicates poorer self-reported sleep quality, and a global PSQI score greater than 5 differentiates poor sleepers from good sleepers. RESULTS: Of the 1,088 women recruited, 353 (32.4%) were in postmenopause status. Postmenopausal women had higher mean (SD) global PSQI scores (8.0 [3.3] vs 6.1 [2.2], P < 0.001) and a greater prevalence of poor sleepers (73.1% vs 60.8%, P < 0.001) compared with premenopausal women. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that menopause ([beta] = 1.532; 95% CI, 1.135 to 1.949; P < 0.001) and snoring ([beta] = 0.764; 95% CI, 0.299 to 1.228; P = 0.001) were positively associated with global PSQI scores, whereas long sleep duration ([beta] = -0.791; 95% CI, -1.113 to -0.468; P < 0.001) was negatively associated with global PSQI scores. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that menopause (odds ratio, 1.453; 95% CI, 1.030 to 2.051; P < 0.05), long sleep duration (odds ratio, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.418 to 0.710; P < 0.001), and snoring (odds ratio, 2.022; 95% CI, 1.312 to 3.116; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of poor sleepers. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women without vasomotor symptoms have significantly higher global PSQI scores and a higher risk of being poor sleepers than premenopausal women. In addition, menopause and snoring are associated with an increased risk of poor self-reported sleep quality independently of cardiometabolic factors and lifestyle, whereas long sleep duration is associated with a decreased risk of poor self-reported sleep quality.

AB  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. OSA is an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease, particularly among men, but the independent contribution of OSA to cardiovascular risk in climacteric women is not clear.Methods: We evaluated 277 consecutive women (age, 56 [52-61] years; BMI, 28 [25-32] kg/m2) without manifest cardiovascular disease (heart failure, coronary disease, or stroke). All women underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, arterial stiffness evaluation (pulse wave velocity), and portable sleep study.Results: OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 events/h) and moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15 events/h) were diagnosed in 111 (40.1%) and 31 (11.1%) women, respectively. None of the participants had received a previous diagnosis of OSA. Women with moderate to severe OSA vs those without OSA had a higher prevalence of hypertension, were prescribed more medications for hypertension, had higher awake BP (systolic, 133 [125-142] vs 126 [119-134] mm Hg [P < .01]; diastolic, 82 [78-88] vs 79 [74-85] mm Hg [P = .07]), higher nocturnal BP (systolic, 125 [118-135] vs 115 [109-124] mm Hg [P < .01]; diastolic, 73 [69-79] vs 69 [62-75] mm Hg [P < .01]), and more arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, 11.5 [10.1-12.3] m/s vs 9.5 [8.6-10.8] m/s, P < .001). Oxygen desaturation index during the night was independently associated with 24-h arterial BP and arterial stiffness (per five-unit increase in oxygen desaturation index, β = 1.30 [95% CI, 0.02-2.54; P = .04] vs 0.22 [95% CI, 0.03-0.40; P = .02] in women with vs without OSA, respectively).Conclusions: OSA is common, underdiagnosed, and independently associated with high BP and increased arterial stiffness in perimenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of acupuncture on hot flushes and other menopause-related symptoms used in an integrated system, including such therapeutic techniques as diet therapy and Tuina self-massage. Design: Randomized trial. Setting: Outpatient center. Participants: One hundred women in spontaneous menopause with at least three episodes of hot flushes daily were randomly allocated to two treatment groups (50 per group): Women in group A were given diet, self-massage training, and treatment with acupuncture, and women in group B (the control group) were given the same diet and self-massage training, but treatment with acupuncture started 6 weeks after they were enrolled into the study. Intervention: Acupuncture treatments were scheduled twice weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. Outcome measures: Mean change in frequency and/or intensity in menopause-related symptoms were estimated by questionnaire after treatment at week 4. Results: Treatment with acupuncture significantly reduced the occurrence of hot flushes and sudden sweating ( p<.001). Other symptoms (sleep disorders, tightness in the chest, irritability, bone pain, feeling depressed) significantly improved. Conclusions: Acupuncture in an integrated system that includes therapeutic techniques such as diet therapy and Tuina self-massage can be used to treat hot flushes and selected symptoms in postmenopausal women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been associated with increased adverse health outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sleep duration with risk of elevated hs-CRP levels in Taiwanese adults. METHODS: We examined the association between sleep duration and hs-CRP in 353 healthy adults recruited from the physical examination center at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. Elevated hs-CRP was defined as a plasma level >= 0.20 mg/dL. Short sleep duration was defined as <= 5.5 h per day. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of short duration of sleep with elevated hs-CRP levels. RESULTS: In this study, short duration of sleep (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-4.30), aged 70 years or older (OR = 4.58; 95% CI: 1.70-12.66), menopause (OR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.52-5.3), higher heart rate (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.10-1.75), higher body mass index (OR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09-1.34), higher white blood cell count (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.14-1.66), and higher uric acid level (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.06-1.63) were significantly associated with an increased risk of elevated hs-CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of healthy Taiwanese adults, short duration of sleep was significantly associated with elevated hs-CRP levels. Activation of pro-inflammatory pathways might represent a mechanism by which short sleep duration affects health. CITATION: Chiang JK.

AB  - Objectives/hypothesis: To identify whether relationships exist between epistaxis and migraines in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), to potentially provide further preventative and therapeutic options for the debilitating nosebleeds that are often very difficult to manage in clinical practice. Study Design: Study participants were recruited from a UK specialist service, and online following advertisement by the HHT Foundation International. They completed a nonbiased questionnaire in which paired questions on nosebleeds and migraines were separated by at least 17 other questions. Methods: Migraines were defined as headaches with associated autonomic and/or neurological features. The reported frequencies and precipitants of epistaxis and migraines were compared using numerical scales applied equally for each condition. Results: The 220 HHT-affected respondents reported frequent nosebleeds, 153 (69.5%) used iron tablets, and 39 (17.7%) had received at least 10 blood transfusions. Migraines displaying typical features were reported by 51 (23.2%), and were more common with pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thirty of 51 (58.8%) migraine sufferers reported that nosebleeds occurred at the same time as their migraines. More frequent migraines were reported by patients with more frequent nosebleeds (r2=15%, P=.007), or transfusions (r2=16.9%, P=.004). In menstrual, lifestyle, and dietary analyses, consistency was observed between factors having no effect, and those provoking both nosebleeds and migraines in multiple patients (premenses; activity; lack of sleep; stress; caffeine, cheese, alcohol, and chocolate). Conclusions: We demonstrate an unexpected and provocative association between nosebleeds and migraines in HHT patients. Evaluation of whether antimigraine approaches limit HHT nosebleeds may be appropriate. Level Of Evidence: 4.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: After we demonstrated a substantial drop in postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) in France after 2002, we sought to compare health characteristics assessed before menopause and reasons for beginning treatment among women who started postmenopausal HT before and after this year. METHODS: Among participants of the GAZEL (GAZ and ELectricité) cohort of employees of the French national power company, we studied 1,229 women who reached menopause before 2002 and 562 women who reached menopause after 2002. We analyzed HT use among these newly postmenopausal women before and after 2002 and its relations to self-rated health, simple and troublesome hot flushes, and various other symptoms before menopause. RESULTS: After 2002, compared with before 2002, women starting HT were more likely to have reported troublesome hot flushes before menopause (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0-5.4). The groups of new HT users did not differ significantly except for health characteristics. Significantly higher proportions of women starting HT reported using it for hot flushes (68.1% vs 52.9%, P = 0.02) and sleep disorders (11.1% vs 2.8%, P = 0.001) and a significantly lower proportion of women starting HT reported using it for osteoporosis prevention (12.5% vs 43.9%, P < 0.001) after 2002 than before 2002. CONCLUSIONS: After 2002, HT tended to be prescribed for more severe hot flushes, but almost one third of prescriptions were still written for reasons not linked to hot flushes. Doctors seem to be following recommendations to not use HT as a first-line treatment of osteoporosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of hot flashes and various forms of hormone therapy on health-related quality of life and sexual well-being in recently postmenopausal women. METHODS: We prospectively interviewed 150 healthy women about hot flashes and health-related quality of life (using the Women's Health Questionnaire and the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire), menopause-related symptoms, and general health. The women were classified into those with (n = 72) and without (n = 78) hot flashes and treated for 6 months with transdermal estradiol (1 mg/d), oral estradiol (2 mg/d) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg/d), or placebo. RESULTS: At baseline, hot flashes contributed most strongly to poor sleep (correlation coefficient r = -0.525, P < 0.0001), somatic symptoms such as muscle pains (r = -0.348, P < 0.0001), menstrual cycle-resembling complaints (r = -0.304, P < 0.0001), anxiety and fears (r = -0.283, P < 0.0001), decreased memory and concentration (r = -0.279, P = 0.001), and sexual behavior (r = -0.174, P = 0.035). The different hormone therapy regimens alleviated hot flashes equally effectively and were therefore combined into a single group for further analysis. In women with baseline flashes, hormone therapy use significantly improved the scores for sleep (0.787 [0.243] vs 0.557 [0.249], hormone therapy vs placebo, P = 0.001, at 6 mo), memory and concentration capacity (0.849 [0.228] vs 0.454 [0.301], P < 0.0001, at 6 mo), and anxiety and fears (0.942 [0.133] vs 0.826 [0.193], P = 0.005, at 6 mo). Hormone therapy use showed no significant impact on these variables in women without baseline flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Hot flashes contribute differently to various variables affecting health-related quality of life shortly after menopause. Estradiol or an estradiol-medroxyprogesterone acetate combination similarly alleviates hot flashes and improves health-related quality of life in relation to elimination of hot flashes. Hormone therapy use does not confer any detectable quality-of-life benefit over placebo in women without disturbing baseline flashes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent studies suggest that shift workers who experience exposure to light at night could be at increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes. METHOD: Defined by cyclical patterns of circulating hormones, the reproductive system is vulnerable to shifts in circadian rhythms, either through sleep disturbances, altered melatonin production, exposure to light at night, or some other mechanism. Several occupational groups, including health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters, and manufacturing workers are required to work night shifts. Worldwide, millions work at least one night per month. RESULTS: Research will be reviewed on shift work and reproductive outcomes, including menstrual cycle patterns, fertility, pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and birth weight. The limitations of current research will also be discussed: is there a dose response effect from the number of years of shift work, or can the effects be reversed once shift work stops? Are there different effects from permanent night shift versus rotating shift involving nights? CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs will be identified, including the need for validation of self-reported shift work data and the mechanisms by which shift work affects reproductive health. Recommendations for shift workers and employers will be explored.

AB  - Rationale: Better phenotypic descriptions are needed for chronic lung disease among surviving premature infants.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of respiratory inductance plethysmography in characterizing respiratory system mechanics in preterm infants at 32 weeks postmenstrual age.Methods: Respiratory inductance plethysmography was used to obtain the phase angle, Φ, to describe rib cage and abdominal dyssynchrony in 65 infants born between 23 and 28 weeks gestation, all of whom were studied at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Up to 60 breaths were evaluated for each subject. Sources of intrasubject variability in Φ arising from our methods were explored using mechanical models and by evaluating interobserver agreement.Measurements and Main Results: The mean Φ from infants ranged from 5.8-162.9°, with intrasubject coefficients of variation ranging from 11-123%. On the basis of the mechanical model studies, respiratory inductance plethysmography recording and analysis software added <2.3% to the intrasubject variability in Φ. Potential inconsistencies in breaths selected could have contributed 8.1%, on average, to the total variability. The recording sessions captured 22.8 ± 9.1 minutes of quiet sleep, and enough breaths were counted to adequately characterize the range of Φ in the session.Conclusion: Φ is quite variable during even short recording sessions among preterm infants sleeping quietly. The intrasubject variability described herein arises from the instability of the rib cage and abdominal phase relationship, not from the recording and analytical methods used. Despite the variability, Φ measurements allowed the majority (80%) of infants to be reliably categorized as having relatively synchronous or dyssynchronous breathing. Respiratory inductance plethysmography is easy to use and should prove useful in quantifying respiratory mechanics in multicenter studies of preterm infants.

AB  - Background. Anecdotal evidence suggests that mood, sleep, and health quality change in women from premenopausal to menopausal period; however, data supporting these assumptions from non-Western countries are scarce. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess premenopausal and menopausal Iranian women with regard to mood, sleep, and general health. Methods. One hundred and twenty Iranian women took part in the study. Sixty were in a premenopausal state (mean age (M): = 46.9 years) and 60 in a menopausal state (M = 53.8 years). They completed a series of self-rating questionnaires related to sleep, mood, and health quality. Results. Compared to premenopausal women, menopausal women reported more difficulties such as falling asleep, and less general physical activities and vitality. No statistically significant differences were found for sleep quality, sleep schedules, difficulties in social life, general mood state, or general physical and mental health. Menopausal women reported to be more irritable, and to have more energy. Conclusions. Data suggest that among a sample of Iranian premenopausal and menopausal women, differences in mood, sleep, and general health are small. Data, therefore, do not support 'beliefs' and hearsay that mood, sleep, and general health do decrease from premenopausal to menopausal state.

AB  - Background: This study characterized the self-reported reason for a gynecology visit among midlife women in three different practice settings. We hypothesized that women seeking specialty care were more likely to report nonvasomotor symptoms potentially related to the menopausal transition. Methods: Participants were 625 women aged 40-60 seen by gynecologists at three sites: an urban, academic, gynecologic menopause practice (Midlife Practice, or MLP) and urban (site A) and suburban (site B) locations of a general, nonacademic obstetrics and gynecology practice. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire asking them to choose and weigh the reason for their visit as 'very much,' 'somewhat,' or 'not at all' for 15 common gynecologic and menopausal concerns. Demographic questions included age, self-rated health status, race/ethnicity, difficulty of paying for basics, and education. Comparisons between the three groups were made using parametric and nonparametric tests as appropriate. The main outcome measure was the response to the reason for participants' visit compared across the three sites. Results: Women presenting to the MLP were significantly older and more likely to report vasomotor symptoms (VMS), moodiness, sexual problems, sleep problems, and weight and to learn more about menopause. When 'very much' and 'somewhat' reasons were combined, nearly 80% of the MLP responses listed sleep problems, 60% listed vaginal dryness or low desire, 34% listed weight gain, and 30.7% listed mood. Conclusions: Midlife women seeking care in a menopause gynecology practice had significantly more visits for vasomotor and nonvasomotor concerns than did women seeing general gynecologists. Women sought care for a broad range of concerns that are not typically in gynecologists' scope of practice, including sleep disturbances, moodiness, and weight management.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine mediators of fatigue response to an exercise intervention for breast cancer survivors in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Methods: Postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (n = 46; ≤stage 2), off primary treatment, and reporting fatigue and/or sleep dysfunction were randomized to a 3-month exercise intervention (160 min•wk-1 of moderate-intensity aerobic walking, twice weekly resistance training with resistance bands) or control group. Six discussion group sessions provided behavioral support to improve adherence. Fatigue, serum cytokines, accelerometer physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, sleep dysfunction, and psychosocial factors were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Results: The exercise intervention effect sizes for fatigue were as follows: fatigue intensity d = 0.30 (P = 0.34), interference d = -0.38 (P = 0.22), and general fatigue d = -0.49 (P = 0.13). Using the Freedman-Schatzkin difference-in-coefficients tests, increase in fatigue intensity was significantly mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6) (82%), IL-10 (94%), IL-6/IL-10 (49%), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α):IL-10 (78%) with reduced sleep dysfunction increasing the relationship between intervention and fatigue intensity rather than mediating intervention effects (-88%). Decrease in fatigue interference was mediated by sleep dysfunction (35%), whereas IL-10 and pro-anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios increased the relationship between intervention and interference (-25% to -40%). The reduction in general fatigue was significantly mediated by minutes of physical activity (76%), sleep dysfunction (45%), and physical activity enjoyment (40%), with IL-10 (-40%) and IL-6/IL-10 (-11%) increasing the intervention-fatigue relationship. In the intervention group, higher baseline fatigue, anxiety, depression, and perceived exercise barrier interference predicted a greater decline in fatigue interference and/or general fatigue during the intervention. Conclusions: Biobehavioral factors mediated and enhanced intervention effects on fatigue, whereas psychosocial factors predicted fatigue response. Further study is warranted to confirm our results and to improve understanding of relationships that mediate and strengthen the intervention-fatigue association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gastroretentive gabapentin (G-GR) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe menopausal hot flashes. METHODS: The primary endpoints of this randomized, placebo-controlled study of G-GR (600 mg am/1,200 mg pm) were the mean daily frequency and severity of hot flashes at weeks 4 and 12. Secondary endpoints included Patients' Global Impression of Change, Clinicians' Global Impression of Change, and daily sleep interference at week 24. RESULTS: Six hundred women with 7 or more moderate-to-severe hot flashes/day enrolled; 66.2% completed 24 weeks of treatment. At weeks 4 and 12, G-GR-treated women experienced significantly greater reductions in mean hot flash frequency and severity than placebo-treated women (frequency: week 4, -1.7, P < 0.0001; week 12, -1.14, P = 0.0007; severity: week 4, -0.21, P < 0.0001; week 12, -0.19, P = 0.012). Similar reductions were maintained up to week 24. On the Patient Global Impression of Change, more women receiving G-GR than placebo were 'much' or 'very much' improved (week 12: 58% vs 44%, P = 0.0008; week 24: 76% vs 55%, P < 0.0001). G-GR significantly reduced sleep interference compared with placebo at week 12 (P = 0.0056) and week 24 (P = 0.0084). Approximately 5% more women taking G-GR withdrew because of adverse events (G-GR/placebo, 16.7%/11.5%). The most common adverse events were dizziness (12.7%/3.4%), headache (9.3%/8.1%), and somnolence (6.0%/2.7%); incidences dropped to sustained low levels after a few weeks. CONCLUSIONS: G-GR is a modestly effective nonhormone therapy option for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hot flashes due to menopause and is well tolerated with titration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has been found in recent randomized controlled trials (MENOS1 and MENOS2) to reduce the impact of hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS). In the MENOS2 trial, group CBT was found to be as effective as self-help CBT in reducing the impact of HFNS. This study investigates for whom and how CBT works for women in the MENOS2 trial. METHODS: This study performed a secondary analysis of 140 women with problematic HFNS who were recruited to the MENOS2 trial: 48 were randomly assigned to group CBT, 47 were randomly assigned to self-help CBT, and 45 were randomly assigned to usual care. Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 6 weeks postrandomization, and 26 weeks postrandomization. Potential moderators and mediators of treatment effects on the primary outcome-hot flush problem rating-were examined using linear mixed-effects models and path analysis, respectively. RESULTS: CBT was effective at reducing HFNS problem rating regardless of age, body mass index, menopause status, or psychological factors at baseline. Fully reading the manual in the self-help CBT arm and completing most homework assignments in the group CBT arm were related to greater improvement in problem rating at 6 weeks. The effect of CBT on HFNS problem rating was mediated by changes in cognitions (beliefs about coping/control of hot flushes, beliefs about night sweats and sleep) but not by changes in mood. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CBT is widely applicable for women having problematic HFNS, regardless of sociodemographic or health-related factors, and that CBT works mainly by changing the cognitive appraisal of HFNS.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the role of personality factors in the development of DSM-IV insomnia coincident with perimenopause.Methods: Perimenopausal women (35 women with DSM-IV insomnia and 28 women with self-reported normal sleep) underwent clinical assessments and completed menopause-related questionnaires, the NEO Five Factor Inventory and the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality. Logistic regressions determined whether personality factors and hot flash-related interference were associated with an insomnia diagnosis concurrent with the menopausal transition.Results: Women with insomnia reported higher neuroticism, lower agreeableness, and lower conscientiousness than controls on the NEO Five Factor Inventory. Moreover, women with insomnia were more likely to meet DSM-IV criteria for cluster C personality disorders, particularly obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, on the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality. Women with insomnia were more likely to have had a past depressive episode and a history of severe premenstrual symptoms. Findings from regressions revealed that higher neuroticism and greater interference from hot flashes were associated with insomnia classification even after controlling for history of depression, suggesting that sensitivity to hot flashes and a greater degree of neuroticism are independent contributors toward establishing which women are most likely to have sleep problems during perimenopause.Conclusions: Findings show the relevance of personality factors, particularly neuroticism and obsessive-compulsive personality, to a woman's experience of insomnia as she goes through the menopausal transition.

AB  - Objective: During the menopausal transition and early postmenopause, participants in the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study were likely to belong to one of three symptom severity classes: severe hot flashes with moderate sleep, mood, cognitive, and pain symptoms (high-severity hot flash); moderate levels of all but hot flashes (moderate severity); and low levels of all (low severity). We tested models of the differential effects of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) biomarkers on the three symptom severity classes.Methods: The Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study participants recorded symptoms monthly in diaries and provided overnight urine samples several times per year that were analyzed for estrone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), cortisol, testosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Multilevel latent class analysis with multinomial regression was used to determine the effects of HPO axis, HPA axis, and ANS biomarkers on symptom severity class membership.Results: Having lower estrogen and higher FSH levels was significantly associated with belonging to the high-severity hot flash class versus the low-severity class. Having lower epinephrine and higher norepinephrine levels increased the likelihood of belonging to the high-severity hot flash class versus the low-severity class. Having lower epinephrine levels was significantly associated with belonging to the moderate-severity class versus the low-severity class. Cortisol and testosterone were unrelated to symptom severity class membership.Conclusions: The association of HPO axis biomarkers (estrogen and FSH) with the high-severity hot flash class is anticipated based on prior hot flash research, and the associations of HPA axis biomarkers are as expected based on earlier laboratory studies. The association of lower epinephrine levels with the moderate-severity class suggests that these symptoms may be mediated by the ANS.

AB  - Objectives: Women report greater sleep disturbance during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle and during menses. However, the putative hormonal basis of perceived menstrual cycle-related sleep disturbance has not been investigated directly. We examined associations of objective measures of sleep fragmentation with reproductive hormone levels in healthy, premenopausal women.Methods: Twenty-seven women with monthly menses had hormone levels measured at two time points during a single menstrual cycle: the follicular phase and the peri-ovulatory to mid-luteal phase. A single night of home polysomnography (PSG) was recorded on the day of the peri-ovulatory/mid-luteal-phase blood draw. Serum progesterone, estradiol, and estrone levels concurrent with PSG and rate of change in progesterone (PROGslope) from the follicular blood draw to PSG were correlated with log-transformed wake after sleep onset (lnWASO%) and number of wakes/hour of sleep (lnWake-Index) using linear regression.Results: Sleep was more fragmented in association with a steeper PROGslope (lnWASO% p=0.016; lnWake-Index p=0.08) and higher concurrent estrone level (lnWASO% p=0.03; lnWake-Index p=0.01), but the effect of estrone on WASO was lost after accounting for PROGslope. WASO% and Wake-Index were not associated with concomitant progesterone or estradiol levels.Conclusions: A steeper rate of rise in progesterone levels from the follicular phase through the mid-luteal phase was associated with significantly greater WASO, establishing a link between reproductive hormone dynamics and sleep fragmentation in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

AB  - The objective of this study was to adapt the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) to women who speak Turkish and are from the Turkish culture, and to assess the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the scale. A convenience sample of women undergoing the menopausal transition or in the postmenopausal period was recruited at one primary health care center in Erzurum, Turkey. The researchers selected consecutive women who applied to the center for health care services. Three hundred sixty-six women were asked to participate in the study and to complete the WHQ during their appointment at the health care center in 2010. In the assessment of construct validity, nine factors were identified: depressed mood; menstrual symptoms; somatic symptoms; anxiety/fears; attractiveness; sexual behaviour; vasomotor symptoms; memory; and sleep problems. The nine factors explained 56.5% of the total variance. The overall internal reliability coefficient of this scale was 0.80. Evidence of the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the questionnaire was provided in this study. The Turkish version of the questionnaire is easy to understand and allows evaluation of women's quality of life for various purposes.

AB  - Background: Careful management of symptoms, particularly sleep and mood disturbances, may assist women in discontinuing hormone therapy (HT). We sought to describe characteristics associated with successful HT cessation in women who attempted to discontinue estrogen pills/patches with or without progestin. Methods: We invited 2,328 women, aged 45-70, enrolled January 1, 2005, to May 31, 2006, at Group Health in Washington State and Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in Massachusetts, to participate in a telephone survey about HT practices. For the sample, we selected 2,090 women with estrogen dispensings (pharmacy data) during the study period, 200 women without HT dispensing after January 2005, and 240 women with no estrogen dispensings; 1,358 (58.3%) completed the survey. These analyses are based on survey responses. Results: Among 802 women who attempted HT discontinuation, the mean age was 50 years, 93% were postmenopausal, 90% were white, 30% had had a hysterectomy, and 75% experienced hot flashes after discontinuation. Those who did not succeed had greater trouble sleeping (74% vs. 57%) and mood disturbances (51% vs. 34%) than those who succeeded. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with successful discontinuation included doctor advice (odds ratio [OR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.68-4.08), lack of symptom improvement (OR 4.21, CI 1.50-12.17), vaginal bleeding (OR 5.96, CI 1.44-24.6), and learning to cope with symptoms (OR 3.36, CI 2.21-5.11). Factors associated with unsuccessful HT discontinuation included trouble sleeping (OR 0.40, CI 0.26-0.61) and mood swings or depression (OR 0.63, CI 0.42-0.92). Conclusions: Doctor advice is strongly associated with successful HT discontinuation. Symptom management, particularly sleep and mood disturbances, may help women discontinue HT.

AB  - Objectives: Somatosensory amplification is the experience of sensing everyday bodily sensations as intense, agitating, and unpleasant. Using data from menopausal breast cancer survivors and midlife women without cancer, the study purposes were to (1) explore the psychometric properties of the Somatosensory Amplification Scale and (2) to describe somatosensory amplification and its relationship to menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, mood and sleep disturbance.Study Design: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study using demographic, e-diary, and questionnaire data from 99 breast cancer survivors and 138 midlife women.Main Outcome Measures: Somatosensory amplification, hot flashes (frequency, severity, bother, interference, perceived control), mood, and sleep.Results: Cronbach's alphas for the scale were low. When an 8-item version of the scale was evaluated, alphas improved and item-total correlations remained strong or improved. Midlife women and breast cancer survivors did not have significantly different somatosensory amplification total or item scores after adjusting for group differences in demographics. Somatosensory amplification was significantly correlated with hot flash interference, perceived control over hot flashes, and mood and sleep disturbance in both groups but the patterns of correlations differed slightly between groups and depending on whether the 10-item or 8-item scale was used.Conclusion: Somatosensory amplification may be a relevant concept to assess in relation to the menopausal symptom experience of midlife women with and without breast cancer as it may represent a potential intervention target to improve the menopausal symptom experience.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Melatonin synthesis and secretion are partly modulated by estrogen and progesterone. Changes in melatonin concentrations, possibly related to the menopausal transition, may be associated with climacteric mood, sleep, and vasomotor symptoms. The aims of this study were to compare the serum concentrations of melatonin in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and to evaluate melatonin's influence on mood, sleep, vasomotor symptoms, and quality of life. METHODS: We analyzed the data of 17 healthy perimenopausal women (aged 43-51 y) and 18 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 58-71 y) who participated in a prospective study. On study night (9:00 pm-9:00 am), serum melatonin was sampled at 20-minute (9:00 pm-12:00 midnight; 6:00-9:00 am) and 1-hour (12:00 midnight-6:00 am) intervals. Questionnaires were used to assess depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), insomnia and sleepiness (Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire [BNSQ]), subjective sleep quality, vasomotor symptoms, and quality of life (EuroQoL). RESULTS: Postmenopausal women had lower nighttime serum melatonin concentrations than perimenopausal women. The duration of melatonin secretion tended to be shorter in postmenopause, whereas melatonin peak time did not differ. Mean melatonin concentrations and exposure levels did not correlate with follicle-stimulating hormone level, estradiol level, body mass index, Beck Depression Inventory score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score, BNSQ insomnia score, BNSQ sleepiness score, subjective sleep score, climacteric vasomotor score, or quality of life. In perimenopause, the later is the melatonin peak, the higher is the level of anxiety (P = 0.022), and the longer is the melatonin secretion, the better is the quality of life (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal research is needed to better understand the possible contributory role of menopause in lower melatonin levels.

AB  - Objective: Short sleep duration induces hormonal perturbations contributing to hyperphagia, insulin resistance, and obesity. The majority of these studies are conducted in young adults. This analysis in a large (n = 769) sample of postmenopausal women (median age 63 years) sought to (a) confirm that sleep duration and sleep quality are negatively correlated with circulating leptin concentrations and (b) to examine the relationship between self-reported sleep, dietary energy intake, and diet quality, as well as, investigate the role of leptin in these associations.Methods: Sleep duration/quality, insomnia, and dietary intake were determined via self-report. Blood samples were collected following an overnight fast to assess serum leptin concentration. All analyses were adjusted for total body fat mass.Results: Women reporting ≤6 hr sleep/night had lower serum leptin concentrations than those reporting ≥8 hr sleep (P = 0.04). Furthermore, those with ≤6 hr sleep/night reported higher dietary energy intake (P = 0.01) and lower diet quality (P = 0.04) than the reference group (7 hr sleep/night). Women sleeping ≥8 hr also reported lower diet quality than the reference group (P = 0.02). Importantly, serum leptin did not confound these associations.Conclusions: These results provide evidence that sleep duration is inversely associated with serum leptin and dietary energy intake in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Background & Aim: The aim of present study was to assess psychometric properties of premenstrual symptoms screening tool (PSST) to provide a fast and appropriate screening tool for women who suffer from severe PMS/PMDD and their clinicians. Methods & Materials: It was a cross-sectional study. The study included 404 female students studying at Semnan University who were randomly selected using stratified method. In order to assess psychometric properties, we used the exploratory factor analysis, convergent validity (evaluated by symptom checklist-90-Revised), criterion-related validity (calculated by comparing psychiatrist diagnosis and PSST). Sensitivity and specificity coefficients of optimal cutoff points were calculated by the ROC Curve; and construct validity was evaluated by the PSST ability to separate PMS and PMDD groups from healthy group. Reliability was evaluated using the cronbach’s alpha and test-retest method. Results: The principle component analysis revealed that the PSST consists of four factors: interest reduction, interference in functions, physical and neurotic symptoms, and eating and sleep patterns. As an evidence of convergent validity, PSST scores showed significant correlations with the SCL-90-R’s dimensions. Agreement coefficient between psychiatrists and the PSST diagnosis was 0.314 for the PMS; and 0.80 for the PMDD. This tool separated the PMS and PMDD groups from healthy group well. Optimal Cutoff point for separating females suffering from PMDD was 2.22. The sensitivity and specificity coefficients were 0.9 and 0.77, respectively. The cronbach’s alpha was 0.91 and the test-retest reliability was 0.56 for the total tool. Conclusion: The translated version of the premenstrual symptoms screening tool can be used as a valid tool for Iranian females. This instrument can be useful for rapid screening and identifying women who suffer from severe PMS/PMDD, especially in clinical settings.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to determine the efficacy of exercise training for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.Methods: Late perimenopausal and postmenopausal sedentary women with frequent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted in three sites: 106 women randomized to exercise and 142 women randomized to usual activity. The exercise intervention consisted of individual facility-based aerobic exercise training three times per week for 12 weeks. VMS frequency and bother were recorded on daily diaries at baseline and on weeks 6 and 12. Intent-to-treat analyses compared between-group differences in changes in VMS frequency and bother, sleep symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire).Results: At the end of week 12, changes in VMS frequency in the exercise group (mean change, -2.4 VMS/d; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.7) and VMS bother (mean change on a four-point scale, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4) were not significantly different from those in the control group (-2.6 VMS/d; 95% CI, -3.2 to -2.0; P = 0.43; -0.5 points; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4; P = 0.75). The exercise group reported greater improvement in insomnia symptoms (P = 0.03), subjective sleep quality (P = 0.01), and depressive symptoms (P = 0.04), but differences were small and not statistically significant when P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Results were similar when considering treatment-adherent women only.Conclusions: These findings provide strong evidence that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise do not alleviate VMS but may result in small improvements in sleep quality, insomnia, and depression in midlife sedentary women.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) frequency and bother in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.Methods: This study was a 12-week, three-by-two factorial, randomized controlled trial. Eligible women were randomized to a double-blind comparison of omega-3 (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) capsules, and simultaneously to yoga (n = 107), aerobic exercise (n = 106), or their usual physical activity (n = 142). Participants received 1.8 g of omega-3 daily for 12 weeks. Each capsule contained ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (425 mg), docosahexaenoic acid (100 mg), and other omega-3s (90 mg). Primary outcomes were VMS frequency and bother. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index), depressive symptoms (Physician's Health Questionnaire-8), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7).Results: The mean baseline frequency of VMS per day was 7.6 (95% CI, 7.0 to 8.2). After 12 weeks, the reduction in VMS frequency with omega-3 (-2.5; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.9) did not differ significantly from that with placebo (-2.7; 95% CI, -3.3 to -2.2), with a relative difference of 0.3 fewer hot flashes per day (95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P = 0.28). Changes in VMS bother at 12 weeks were also similar between groups, with no relative difference on a four-point scale (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = 0.36). Omega-3s compared with placebo showed no improvement in self-reported sleep or mood (P > 0.09 for all comparisons).Conclusions: Among healthy, sedentary perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, a 12-week treatment with omega-3 does not improve VMS frequency, VMS bother, sleep, or mood compared with placebo.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Menopause predisposes women to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep disturbances. Progestin has a potential to stimulate breathing and to induce sleep. Our goal was to test these effects objectively and to compare them with the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is the standard treatment of SDB. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we investigated 34 postmenopausal women (17 in the placebo group and 17 in the medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] group) whose SDB had been treated with nasal CPAP for 6 months to 8 years prior to study entry. The 6-week trial included measurements with CPAP at baseline, after 14 days of placebo or MPA (60 mg daily), and after a 3-week washout. The participants discontinued their nasal CPAP therapy 1 week after baseline measurements and went on with study medication. RESULTS: Two weeks after discontinuation of CPAP therapy, nightly oxygen saturation was sustained higher (P = 0.004) and arterial carbon dioxide tension was lower (P < 0.001) with MPA than with placebo. Carbon dioxide was also lower than during CPAP (P < 0.001), and this effect was sustained beyond 3 weeks after the cessation of MPA (P < 0.001). However, the apnea-hypopnea index of CPAP increased and sleep deteriorated similarly on MPA and placebo after withdrawal of CPAP therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with SDB, MPA induces a long-lasting stimulatory effect on breathing without improving sleep quality or the apnea-hypopnea index.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of back pain on the quality of sleep, quality of life and depression in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. We also evaluated the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and these parameters. Materials and Methods: One hundred and five patients diagnosed with postmenopausal osteoporosis were included in this study. The patients were evaluated on the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The intensity of back pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Patients ranged in age from 46 to 75, with a mean age of 61.16±7.59. As pain scores increased, depression scores increased and sleep quality and quality of life were impaired (p<0.01). There were strong positive correlations among depression, sleep quality and quality of life (p<0.01), but we did not find significant correlations among lumbar spine (L1-L4) T-scores, L1-L4 BMD values, VAS, PSQI total scores, QUALEFFO-41 total scores and BDI scores. Conclusion: High pain scores in postmenopausal patients may be related to low quality of sleep and of life, and depression. Depression, sleep disorder and low quality of life may affect each other. Treating back pain, a frequent symptom in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients, may produce favorable effects on quality of sleep and life and on depression, as well as basic management.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health, specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. Methods A systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words 'shift-work' and 'female/women.' Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause. Results Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure. Discussion Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mediation modeling was used to evaluate the direct effects of bazedoxifene (BZA)/conjugated estrogens (CE) on sleep, compared with its indirect effects via improvements in hot flushes, in postmenopausal women enrolled in the SMART (Selective estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy)-2 and SMART-5 trials. METHODS: Statistical mediation modeling estimated the direct effects of BZA/CE on sleep disturbance (Medical Outcomes Study sleep scale) and its indirect effects via hot flush improvement (item 1 of the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire). In SMART-2, a total of 318 women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) received BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, or placebo; in SMART-5, a total of 1,843 women seeking menopausal symptom treatment received BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, CE 0.45 mg/medroxyprogesterone acetate 1.5 mg, BZA 20 mg, or placebo. The SMART-5 sleep substudy enrolled 459 women with bothersome VMS and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: In SMART-2, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg had a primarily direct effect on sleep in symptomatic women (64% and 66%, respectively; P < 0.001). Conversely, in the overall SMART-5 population, effects were primarily indirect (82% and 75% for BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, respectively; P < 0.01), suggesting that sleep improvement was largely mediated via hot flush improvements. In a subpopulation of SMART-5 (participants with bothersome VMS), BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg and BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg affected sleep disturbance directly (82% and 76%, respectively; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: BZA/CE improves sleep in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe and milder VMS. This study suggests that improvements occur directly in women with moderate to severe VMS and indirectly in less symptomatic women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of bazedoxifene (BZA)/conjugated estrogens (CE) on sleep and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were evaluated in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women who were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled phase 3 trial. METHODS: The sleep/HRQoL substudy enrolled 459 women with bothersome moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms who were randomized to BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, BZA 20 mg, CE 0.45 mg/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1.5 mg, or placebo for 1 year. On months 3 and 12, sleep parameters were evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study sleep scale, and HRQoL was assessed using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire. RESULTS: BZA/CE and CE/MPA significantly improved sleep and HRQoL compared with placebo. On month 3, most Medical Outcomes Study sleep parameter improvements with BZA/CE and CE/MPA versus placebo were not significant. On month 12, both BZA/CE doses and CE/MPA significantly improved time to fall asleep and sleep disturbance (P < 0.05 vs placebo); BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg and CE/MPA also showed significant improvements in sleep adequacy and sleep problem indices I and II (P < 0.01 vs placebo). Both BZA/CE doses and CE/MPA significantly improved MENQOL vasomotor function score versus placebo at 3 and 12 months (P < 0.001). At 3 months, total MENQOL score was significantly improved with BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg and CE/MPA versus placebo (P < 0.05); at 12 months, both BZA/CE doses and CE/MPA showed significant improvements (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic postmenopausal women who are treated with BZA/CE for 1 year demonstrate significant improvements in sleep and HRQoL, similar to women treated with CE/MPA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness has been defined as being intentionally aware of internal and external experiences that occur at the present moment, without judgment. Techniques that develop mindfulness, such as meditation, have positive effects on reducing insomnia, a sleep disorder that is common both during and after menopause. Our aim was to establish whether postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than postmenopausal women without sleep disorders. METHODS: Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years who did not use hormone therapy were recruited for the study. The sample included 14 women with insomnia and 12 women without insomnia or any other sleep disorder. The groups were comparable in age, schooling, and anxiety level. To assess mindfulness, we used the validated Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the attentiveness domain of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded Form. RESULTS: Participants with insomnia were less mindful than healthy women. The level of mindfulness was able to discriminate the group with insomnia from the healthy group, with 71.4% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than women without insomnia. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as meditation, may be beneficial for postmenopausal insomnia.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea is an increasingly common disorder of repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, leading to oxygen desaturation and disrupted sleep. Features include snoring, witnessed apnoeas, and sleepiness. Pathogenesis varies; predisposing factors include small upper airway lumen, unstable respiratory control, low arousal threshold, small lung volume, and dysfunctional upper airway dilator muscles. Risk factors include obesity, male sex, age, menopause, fluid retention, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and smoking. Obstructive sleep apnoea causes sleepiness, road traffic accidents, and probably systemic hypertension. It has also been linked to myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and diabetes mellitus though not definitively. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice, with adherence of 60-70%. Bi-level positive airway pressure or adaptive servo-ventilation can be used for patients who are intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure. Other treatments include dental devices, surgery, and weight loss.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates.Methods: Newborn infants (≥35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated.Results: Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 ± 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p = 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores.Conclusions: Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

AB  - Testosterone (T) and other androgens are incorporated into an increasingly wide array of human sexuality research, but there are a number of issues that can affect or confound research outcomes. This review addresses various methodological issues relevant to research design in human studies with T; unaddressed, these issues may introduce unwanted noise, error, or conceptual barriers to interpreting results. Topics covered are (1) social and demographic factors (gender and sex; sexual orientations and sexual diversity; social/familial connections and processes; social location variables), (2) biological rhythms (diurnal variation; seasonality; menstrual cycles; aging and menopause), (3) sample collection, handling, and storage (saliva vs. blood; sialogogues, saliva, and tubes; sampling frequency, timing, and context; shipping samples), (4) health, medical issues, and the body (hormonal contraceptives; medications and nicotine; health conditions and stress; body composition, weight, and exercise), and (5) incorporating multiple hormones. Detailing a comprehensive set of important issues and relevant empirical evidence, this review provides a starting point for best practices in human sexuality research with T and other androgens that may be especially useful for those new to hormone research.

AB  - Background: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been associated with decrements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The objective of this study was to assess whether real acupuncture (RA), compared with sham acupuncture (SA), improves PROs in patients with breast cancer who are receiving an adjuvant AI.Methods: Postmenopausal women with a stage 0 through III breast cancer who received an AI and had treatment-associated musculoskeletal symptoms were randomized to receive 8 weekly RA versus SA in a dual-center, randomized controlled trial. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) menopausal symptoms questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the hot flash daily diary, the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDI), and the European quality-of-life survey (EuroQol) were used to assess PROs at baseline and at 4weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks.Results: The intention-to-treat analysis included 23 patients in the RA arm and 24 patients in the SA arm. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. Compared with baseline, scores in the RA arm improved significantly at week 8 on the CESD (P = .022), hot flash severity (P = .006), hot flash frequency (P = .011), the HFRDI (P = .014), and NSABP menopausal symptoms (P = .022); scores in the SA arm improved significantly on the EuroQol (P = .022),the HFRDI (P = .043), and NSABP menopausal symptoms (P = .005). Post-hoc analysis indicated that African American patients (n = 9) benefited more from RA than SA compared with non-African American patients (n = 38) in reducing hot flash severity (P < .001) and frequency (P < .001) scores.Conclusions: Both RA and SA were associated with improvement in PROs among patients with breast cancer who were receiving AIs, and no significant difference was detected between arms. Racial differences in response to acupuncture warrant further study.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance in midlife women has been studied extensively, although less is known about sleep after menopause. This study examined the relative impact of sociodemographics, modifiable lifestyle factors, and health status on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women from Queensland, Australia. Methods: The longitudinal Healthy Aging of Women (HOW) Study examines health-related quality of life (HRQOL measured by the 12-item Short Form [SF-12®] survey [Medical Outcomes Trust, Hanover, CA]); chronic illness; modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking; and sleep disturbance (General Sleep Disturbance Scale [GSDS] (Lee, San Francisco, CA) ≥43 represents poor sleep) in midlife and older women from low- and high-socioeconomic rural and urban areas of South East Queensland, Australia. This article presents cross-sectional data from the 322 women, aged 60-70 years, participating in the HOW study in 2011. Results: For women in this study, sleep disturbance was relatively common, with 23% ( n=83) reporting poor sleeping (GSDS ≥43). Sleep-disturbance scores were strongly correlated with being unemployed or on a disability support pension (β=18.69, p<0.01), sedentary lifestyle (β=23.84, p<0.01), and lower mental (β=−0.60, p<0.01) and physical HRQOL scores (β=−0.32, p=0.01), and these variables explained almost one-third of variance in sleep-disturbance scores (ηρ2=29%). Conclusions: Multivariable analysis revealed that sleep disturbance was correlated with physical and mental HRQOL, disability, and sedentary lifestyle but not other lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. It may be, however, that modifiable lifestyle factors may indirectly impact sleep by influencing health status.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of live and recorded lullabies on physiological and behavioural state outcomes of stable preterm infants. We conducted a prospective, repeated measures crossover study, involving 35 stable infants of less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Each infant received a different intervention for three consecutive days (live lullabies, recorded lullabies, and no-music sessions). The infant was observed every 5 min for 30 min before, 20 min during, and 30 min after the intervention. The results revealed that the infants’ heart rate (HR) decreased significantly for the live and recorded lullabies conditions but not for the control condition (p= .02). The findings also suggest that the live lullabies condition resulted in a deeper sleep than the recorded lullabies condition (p= .02) and the control condition (p= .006). No changes were observed in oxygen saturation level. The results of this study show that lullabies effectively reduce the HR of preterm infants less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age, and live lullabies have a greater beneficial impact on their sleep state than recorded lullabies.

AB  - Objective: Inadequate self-reported sleep is related to high blood pressure (BP). Our study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between poor sleep measured by in-home polysomnography (PSG) and BP.Methods: Midlife participants (132 black, 164 white, and 59 Chinese) were from the SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) ancillary sleep study. In-home PSG measured sleep apnea, duration, efficiency, and electroencephalogram (EEG) total delta and beta power during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Women subsequently were followed annually for 4.5 (1-7)years for BP and hypertensive status (>140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive medication). Covariates were age, race, site, and educational attainment, with time-covariates of BP medications, body mass index, diabetes mellitus (DM), cigarette smoking, and menopausal status.Results: Sleep duration and efficiency were unrelated to BP cross-sectionally or longitudinally in multivariate models. Women with higher total beta power were more likely to be hypertensive at the time of the sleep study; women with lower total delta power were more likely to show increases in diastolic BP (DBP) and to be at risk for incident hypertension across follow-up.Conclusions: Low NREM delta power may be a risk factor for future hypertension. Quantitative EEG measures are worthy of future investigations of hypertension risk.

AB  - Studies on menopause-related quality of life (QoL), especially using the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS), in Asian women are scarce. This study surveyed menopausal symptoms in a convenience sample of 442 Chinese women aged 40–60 years who attended the Well-Women Clinic, Macau, China, in a public health center. The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, the MRS, and a novel question on which area of QoL was affected. The average age of the participants was 49.2 ± 5.08 years, and 98.9% of them reported experiencing menopausal symptoms. The four most prevalent menopausal symptoms were physical and mental exhaustion (90.3%), joint and muscle discomfort (88.5%), irritability (78.1%), and sleep problems (77.1%). The average MRS score was 14.2 ± 8.80. A severe MRS score (≥17) was found in 35.5% of participants. Severe scores in the psychological, somatic, and urogenital MRS subscales were found in 17.9%, 42.8%, and 34.8%, of women, respectively. Menopausal symptoms affected QoL in 57.2% of women: daily life in 36.7%, work in 29.2%, sexual life in 17.0%, and relationship with husband in 13.8%. Daily life was significantly affected by hot flushes and joint/muscular discomfort; work was reportedly affected by irritability and exhaustion; sexual life was reported to be affected by hot flushes, sexual problems, and vaginal dryness, and relationship with husband was affected by sexual problems. We concluded that menopausal symptoms were highly prevalent among midlife Chinese women and often affected their QoL. The MRS, however, did not have a high sensitivity in detecting impaired QoL.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Periodic limb movements (PLMs) are characterized by involuntary movements of the lower extremity during sleep. The etiology of PLM has been suggested to involve the dopaminergic system which, in turn, can be modulated by estrogen. It is currently unknown whether PLMs are associated with the menopausal transition and/or concomitant vasomotor symptoms. The aim of the present study was to examine if objectively diagnosed PLMs (with and without arousals) are more common in postmenopausal women or in women with vasomotor symptoms. A secondary aim was to analyze the influence of PLMs on self-reported HRQoL. METHODS: A community-based sample of 348 women underwent full-night polysomnography. PLMs (index > 15) and associated arousals (PLM arousal index > 5) were evaluated according to AASM scoring rules. Health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-36 questionnaire. The occurrence of peri- and postmenopausal symptoms were evaluated by a questionnaire and plasma levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors, vasomotor symptoms remained a significant explanatory factor for the occurrence of PLMs (adj. OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03-3.37). In women with PLM arousals, adjusted OR for vasomotor symptoms was 1.61, 95% CI 0.76-3.42. PLMs did not seem to affect HRQoL. CONCLUSION: We found that clinically significant PLMs, but not PLM with arousals, were more common among women with vasomotor symptoms, even after controlling for confounding factors. Menopausal status per se, as evidenced by FSH in the postmenopausal range, was not associated with PLMs. CITATION: Wesström J; Ulfberg J; Sundström-Poromaa I; Lindberg E.

AB  - Introduction:We live in environments abundant with stress; even when individuals overcome stressful situations, its physiological effects will remain in body for a period of time. Stress includes factors which canalter body‘s homeostasis or consists of responses to adverse environmental or psychological stimuli. Cultural, professional, and physiological differences may modify or exacerbateresponse to stress, which in turn, can incite changes in operations of reproductive system. Reproductiveprocessesare natural processes within living organisms, and it bears psychological and social dimensions in addition to physiological aspects inhuman beings; thus, diagnosis of fertility carries significant social and psychological importance(approximately 25-15% of couplesfacethisproblem).psychosocial consequences of infertilityhas made itthe third leading causeof divorce in country, sincestress andinfertility form a positivecycle exacerbating each other. Infertile coupleswhoknowtheirinfertility blame each other for the problem, which results in increasingstressand the problem turns more acute. Materials and Methods: Thisresearch has been conducted by documentary methodology using recent books and articles available on infertilityand its effects. Results: Stresshormones(corticosteroids-cortisol) evoke highsecretion ofprolactinfromthe pituitary gland bya direct effectonthe hypothalamus-pituitary have caused, which can cause some disorders inovulationprocess. Excessive stress, in addition, prevents the formation of sex cells or their activity by producing disorders in hormones secretion and also in the metabolism of cells, and leads to the replacementof estrogen with masculineandrogen in women‘s blood. It should be noted that androgen increase can cause fat excess in waist and reduce estrogen levels, which can finally halt menstrual cycle, end up ovulation and result is infertility.Infertilitystressacts against feelingsof self-worth and self-confidence, and effect negative mental imageswhich are especially more traumatic insocieties wherefertilityis seenas an emblem ofmasculinity or femininity. Additionally, related problems in sleep, work, relationships (especiallymarriage), can fuel extremesensitivity to environmental stimuli. Conclusion: According to the evidence,women whoweretreated forstress, showsignificant increaseintheir ability to be conceived. Infact, evenwomen whowerepreviouslytreatedfor infertility and were more successful, using stress management. Therefore, stress managementstrategyfor treating infertility may include behavior therapy, teaching how to deal with stress, getting rest, doing exercises, having proper nutrition, socializing with friends and family, listening to relaxing music, getting acupuncture, practicingyoga,gettingregular massages, studying,doing favorite art works and above all trust in God.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between dysmenorrhea and insomnia, as well as variability in sleep across the menstrual cycle. Participants were 89 women, ages 18 to 24 (M= 18.63,SD= 0.93), who completed daily surveys for five weeks. On the second day of menses, they completed a questionnaire regarding dysmenorrhea. Participants having insomnia rated their dysmenorrhea as being more severe and causing more interference with daily activities than did participants without insomnia. Insomnia severity was directly associated with dysmenorrhea severity and interference. Sleep onset latency was longer and sleep efficiency was lower in participants with severe dysmenorrhea than in those with mild dysmenorrhea. Further, participants with mild dysmenorrhea reported significantly better sleep quality than did those having moderate or severe dysmenorrhea. Additionally, wake time after sleep onset was shortest and number of awakenings was lowest around the time of ovulation. Future research should examine whether treating dysmenorrhea or insomnia alone results in improvements in the other condition.

AB  - Background: Exercise has favorable effects on biomarkers associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, however it is unclear if higher doses of exercise provide additional effects. No clinical trial has systematically examined how different exercise volumes influence the mechanisms underlying breast cancer etiology. The Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA) - a follow-up study to the Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial - is examining how a one-year, high versus moderate volume aerobic exercise intervention influences several biomechanisms hypothesized to influence breast cancer risk in a group of postmenopausal women. Secondary aims are to compare intervention effects on psychosocial and quality of life outcomes as well as understand exercise adherence at 12 and 24 months, and maintenance of all study outcomes at 24 months.Methods/design: The BETA Trial is a two-center, two-armed randomized controlled exercise intervention trial conducted in 400 previously inactive, postmenopausal women aged 50-74 years, in Alberta, Canada. Participants were randomly assigned to a one-year aerobic exercise intervention of either high volume (300 minutes/week) or moderate volume (150 minutes/week). Blood draws and accelerometry were performed at baseline, six and 12 months. Baseline and 12-month measurements were taken of adiposity (including dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography scans), physical fitness, dietary intake, self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior, quality of life, perceived stress, happiness, sleep, and determinants of exercise adherence. Exercise maintenance was assessed and all study measurements were repeated at 24 months. Blood will be analyzed for endogenous estrogens, insulin resistance indicators, and inflammatory markers.Discussion: The BETA Trial will compare the impact of a high versus moderate volume of aerobic exercise on a variety of biological, physiological, and psychological outcomes of relevance to postmenopausal women. A tightly controlled exercise intervention and objective outcome measurements are methodological strengths. The BETA Trial will inform future prevention initiatives by assessing adherence to a high volume of exercise over 12 months by postmenopausal women, and the ability of these women to maintain activity over the longer-term. The ultimate objective is to inform public health guidelines for reducing breast cancer risk through physical activity.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Registration Number: NCT01435005.

AB  - Prior studies demonstrated improved menopausal symptom relief following treatment with compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy; however, clinical effectiveness studies evaluating different routes of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy administration are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of sublingual and topical compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of vasomotor, mood, and other quality-of-life symptoms in post-menopausal women. This was a prospective, observational cohort study of women > or = 18 years of age who received a compounded sublingual or topical bioidentical hormone replacement therapy preparation between January 1, 2003 and October 1, 2010 in a community pharmacy. Data collection included patient demographics, comorbidities, hormone regimens, and therapeutic outcomes. Patients rated their vasomotor, mood, and quality-of-life symptoms as absent, mild, moderate, or severe at baseline, at one to three months follow-up, and three to six months follow-up. Baseline characteristics were compared using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Symptom intensity between baseline and follow-up periods were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A total of 200 patients met study criteria; 160 received topical bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, and 40 received sublingual bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Most sublingually-treated patients (70%) received an estrogen combination and 100% received progesterone. Nearly half (43%) of the topically treated patients received an estrogen combination (43%) and 99% received progesterone. The percentage of sublingually treated patients reporting 'moderate' or 'severe' symptoms was significantly reduced at one to three months follow-up for the following target symptoms: hot flashes (31%, P = 0.04), night sweats (38%, P < 0.01), irritability (36%, P = 0.01), anxiety (42%, P < 0.01), emotional lability (38%, P < 0.01), sleep disturbances (35%, P < 0.01), memory loss (35%, P = 0.04), fatigue (33%, P = 0.04), and libido (26%, P = 0.03). Similar reductions were seen at three to six months follow-up compared to baseline. Patients who received topical therapy did not experience significant symptom reductions at one to three months follow-up; however, significant symptom reduction was seen at three to six months for the following: emotional lability (31%, P < 0.01), irritability (29%, P = 0.02), and night sweats (20%, P = 0.04). Compounded sublingual bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is effective in reducing vasomotor, mood, and quality-of-life symptoms experienced in post-menopausal women. Topical therapy does not appear to improve symptoms as extensively or rapidly as sublingual therapy.

AB  - Background: Bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens (BZA/CE), a novel tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC), has been evaluated in the Selective estrogens, Menopause And Response to Therapy (SMART) trials. Secondary outcomes from these trials were evaluated to determine whether the effects of BZA/CE are influenced by years since menopause (YSM). Methods: SMART-1 and SMART-2 were randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 3 trials in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women. Outcomes were evaluated for women <5 or ≥5 YSM in SMART-1 (BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg, n=433; BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, n=414; PBO, n=427) and SMART-2 (BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg, n=127; BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, n=128; PBO, n=63). Hot-flush frequency and severity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), sleep, treatment satisfaction, cumulative amenorrhea, and breast pain were assessed for each study individually, using defined statistical analysis protocols. Results: For <5 and ≥5 YSM subgroups, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 and 0.625 mg showed significant decreases in hot-flush frequency and severity at 3 months compared with PBO ( p<0.05 for both). Both BZA/CE doses showed significant improvements compared with PBO in HRQoL scores, sleep parameters, and satisfaction with treatment at 3 months irrespective of YSM ( p≤0.05 vs. PBO for all). Similar to PBO, BZA/CE showed high proportions of cumulative amenorrhea (SMART-1) and low incidences of breast pain (SMART-1 and SMART-2) for women <5 and ≥5 YSM. Conclusions: The positive effects of BZA/CE on secondary outcomes were consistent among women <5 or ≥5 YSM.

AB  - Objective: To measure knowledge of the health consequences of obesity among overweight/obese Black and Hispanic adults and examine the relationship to prior weight loss.Methods: Knowledge of the health consequences of obesity was assessed among 410 Black and Hispanic adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 enrolled in a behavior change weight loss study. The relationship between obesity risk knowledge and previous weight loss was also examined.Results: The majority of participants were knowledgeable of the risk of hypertension (94%), diabetes (96%), high cholesterol (91%), joint pains/arthritis (89%) and sleep apnea (89%) associated with obesity. Among post-menopausal age women, 53% were aware of the increased risk of breast cancer. There was no significant relationship between obesity risk knowledge and previous weight loss of 10 pounds or more (OR = 1.075, 95% CI: [0.808, 1.430]).Conclusions: We found that knowledge of the health consequences of obesity was high, except for knowledge of the risk of breast cancer. Obesity risk knowledge was not associated with past weight loss.Practice Implications: Further health education is needed regarding the increased risk of breast cancer associated with obesity. Our data suggest that knowledge of the health consequences of obesity is not associated with weight loss success.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in children and adolescents with autistic disorders. Methods: In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5-17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg/day for those weighing 20 to <45 kg, and 1.75 mg/day for those weighing ≥45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone's safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point. Results: Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common (≥5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n=9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n=7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n=6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n=5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n=4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11-15%) and body mass index (5-10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase. One potentially prolactin-related AE (irregular menstruation) was reported. The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale (24.6). All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE. Conclusions: During this OLE, safety findings with risperidone treatment (maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg/day or 1.75 mg/day) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase, and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders. Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors. Clinical Trials Registry: This phase-4 study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00576732).

AB  - Objective: The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Participants: An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.Conclusions: We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

AB  - Aims and objectives To evaluate sexual dysfunction and the factors that affect sexual dysfunction in women with chronic disease. Background Sexual dysfunction is one of the most common problems in women with chronic disease. There is limited understanding of the related factors of sexual dysfunction in women with chronic disease, with research currently limited to other problems and problems related to chronic diseases. Design This research was conducted as a descriptive survey. Methods This study involved 100 female inpatients at clinics of internal medicine of a university hospital. Data were collected with a patients identification form and a female sexual function index (KCFI). Kruskal- Wallis test, test of significance of difference between two means and test of significance of difference between two pairs were used in the data analysis. Results Sixty-five percentage of women in the sample were defined to have sexual dysfunction. The majority of women expressed pain during sexual intercourse, problems in orgasm and satisfaction, and reluctance to have sex. Older age, being unemployed, being in menopause, fatigue, sleep disorder, and pain and weakness in extremities were the factors that were found to significantly affect the prevalence of sexual dysfunction ( p < 0·05). Conclusions This study concluded that sexual function of women with chronic disease is affected negatively. Chronic disease-related symptoms, experienced changes in the body and psychosocial problems are changing the lives of women. Ultimately, these changes also affect sexual activity. Relevance to clinical practice Determination of the factors affecting sexual activity in women with chronic disease is important for women' ability to cope with sexual dysfunction and keep it under control. To be able to accomplish this, it is necessary for healthcare personnel, the partners and family to work together.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep interruption is often reported by women with hot flashes and night sweats (or vasomotor symptoms, VMS). Although women report that VMS awaken them, polysomnography (PSG) studies have not consistently supported this contention. DESIGN: We mimicked menopause using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to investigate whether VMS increase awakenings and wake after sleep onset (WASO). VMS, serum estradiol, and at-home PSGs (two pretreatment, two posttreatment) were measured before and after 4 weeks on GnRHa. Regression models were used to determine the effect of increasing VMS frequency on awakenings and WASO, as measured objectively and subjectively. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine healthy women (mean 27.3 y). SETTING: Academic medical center. INTERVENTIONS: Depot GnRHa (leuprolide 3.75-mg). RESULTS: Serum estradiol was rapidly and uniformly suppressed on GnRHa. Persistent VMS were reported by 69% of women. The number of nighttime VMS correlated directly with the degree of sleep disturbance. Each additional reported nighttime VMS was associated with a 62% increase from baseline in PSG-measured WASO (P = 0.007), a 3% increase in awakenings (P = 0.05), and 6% increase in %N1 sleep (P = 0.02). Nighttime VMS were also associated with increased perceived WASO (312%; P = 0.02), awakenings (16%; P = 0.007), Insomnia Severity Index (P = 0.03), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P = 0.03) scores, and decreased perceived sleep efficiency (P = 0.01). Objectively recorded nighttime VMS correlated with PSG-measured WASO (rs = 0.45, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This menopause model demonstrates that nighttime vasomotor symptoms correlate with increased sleep fragmentation. These findings are consistent with a specific contribution of vasomotor symptoms to polysomnography-measured sleep interruption suggesting that nighttime vasomotor symptoms interrupt sleep in the setting of menopause.

AB  - CONTEXT: Arthralgia is common and debilitating for a significant proportion of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) and leads to poor adherence to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Despite increased recognition of the negative impact of arthralgia on function and the poor adherence that results, very few interventions have been developed to target this side effect. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of tai chi to improve well-being for women experiencing AI-associated arthralgias (AIAAs). DESIGN: The study was a pilot to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment and retention for a tai chi trial, (2) determine the safety of tai chi, and (3) identify the outcomes (function, pain, and quality of life[QOL]) that tai chi may impact. SETTING: The study took place at the Gilda's Club South Jersey in Linwood, NJ, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Postmenopausal women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer reporting AIAA were enrolled. INTERVENTION: Group tai chi was practiced for 1 h 2 x/wk for 8 wks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional outcomes included (1) sit-and-reach (SR), (2) functional reach (FR), (3) the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and (4) timed up-and-go (TUG). The following patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were evaluated pre- and postintervention: (1) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (2) the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), (3) the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), (4) the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), (5) the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-Ntx), and (6) the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Spiritual Well-being Scale (FACIT-Sp). Participants also recorded their tai chi experiences in a journal. RESULTS: For the 12 participants, adherence to the classes was 75%, with no adverse events reported. Participants experienced significant improvement from baseline to follow-up for the HADS anxiety (P = .003) and depression (P = .020) scales, the emotional well-being scale of the FACT-B (P = .027), the FACIT-Fatigue (P = .030), and the sit-and-teach test (P = .016). The BBS (P = .090), TUG (P = .241), BPI severity subscale (P = .058), and physical well-being subscale of the FACT-B (P = .052) showed no significant improvement. Participants reported increased relaxation, reduced stress, and enhanced sleep quality and duration. They valued the group's and the instructor's support. CONCLUSION: The research team demonstrated the feasibility of a tai chi intervention for improving wellbeing for breast cancer patients with AIAA and identified measures that may be sensitive to the impact of a tai chi intervention in this population.

AB  - Abstract: The onset of Menopause in women is frequently associated with sleep disruption with hot flushes intensifying problems. Thus the use of supplementary drugs to ameliorate these symptoms is of significance. Objectives: The purpose of this research was to determine whether valerian/lemon balm could assist by enhancing sleep patterns in this client group. Methods: 100 women aged 50–60 years who complained of sleep disorders were studied. Subjects were selected randomly in a sampling method utilizing two groups of 50 people (intervention group with valerian/lemon balm and placebo group). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered pre and post-intervention. Results: A significant difference was observed with reduced levels of sleep disorders amongst the experimental group when compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: Valerian/lemon balm may assist in reducing symptoms of sleep disorder during the menopause.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and left ventricular mass (LVM) in morbid obesity and the influence of gender, menopausal status, anthropometry, body composition, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors in this relationship. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. METHODS: Polysomnographic and echocardiographic studies were performed in a cohort of 242 patients (86 men, 100 premenopausal (PreM) and 56 postmenopausal (PostM) women), with grade II obesity and above (BMI: 43.7 ± 0.4 kg/m(2)) to investigate OSA and LVM respectively. Anthropometry, body composition, glucose tolerance, and blood pressure were also recorded. RESULTS: OSA to different degrees was diagnosed in 76.2% of the patients (n: 166), its prevalence being 90.9% (n: 70) for men, and 76% (n: 38) and 63.8% (n: 58) for PostM and PreM women, respectively (p < 0.01). LVM excess was greatest for PostM women (90.2%), followed by men (81.9%) and PreM females (69.6%) (p < 0.01). LVM values increased in accordance to OSA severity (absence, 193.7 ± 6.9 g; mild, 192.6 ± 7.8 g; moderate, 240.5 ± 12.5 g; severe, 273.6 ± 14.6 g; p < 0.01). LVM magnitude correlated with the menopausal state, age, central adiposity, hypertension (HT), type 2 diabetes (DM), desaturation index (DI), and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (r = 0.41; p < 0.01). The relationship between LVM and AHI persisted in the multivariate analysis ([beta] = 0.25; p < 0.05) after adjusting for age, gender, menopausal state, BMI, waist circumference, neck circumference, DI, fasting plasma glucose, DM, and HT. But if tobacco habits are included, the statistical difference disappears ([beta] = 0.22; p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Morbid obesity is frequently associated with abnormal LVM, particularly in patients with OSA; this association is independent of HT, BMI, body composition, and other clinical factors, supporting a direct role of OSA on LVM in morbid obesity. This suggests that OSA and LVM might be taken as predictors of the cardiovascular risk in these patients.

AB  - Objective: Little is known about the impact of hot flashes on cardiac autonomic regulation, particularly vagal control. Therefore, we assessed the cardiac autonomic profile associated with physiological hot flashes occurring in undisturbed sleep.Methods: Eleven perimenopausal women (45-56 y) had overnight laboratory recordings of polysomnography, electrocardiography, and skin conductance. Eighteen hot flashes that occurred in stable non-rapid eye movement sleep undisturbed by arousals were analyzed. Heart rate variability measures were obtained for three consecutive 2-minute windows starting from 4 minutes before (baseline and preflash periods) to 2 minutes after the onset of hot flashes (hot flash period).Results: Heart rate increased by, on average, 4 beats/minute with the occurrence of a hot flash compared with both baseline (P < 0.001) and preflash (P < 0.001). High-frequency power was reduced, reflecting a decrease in vagal activity, at the onset of a hot flash compared with baseline (P < 0.001) and preflash (P < 0.001). There was no change in sympathovagal balance with the onset of a hot flash. The magnitude of the hot flash (ie, skin conductance amplitude) was associated with increased heart rate (r = 0.78, P < 0.001) and decreased vagal tone (r = -0.56, P = 0.014).Conclusions: Physiological hot flashes per se, recorded during undisturbed sleep periods and independent of any arousals, are associated with increased heart rate and decreased cardiac autonomic vagal activity. These data support the hypothesis that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is involved in the cardiac response to a hot flash.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the duration of sleep, sleep quality, insomnia, or sleep disturbance was associated with incident breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Women enrolled in one of the Clinical Trial (CT) arms or the Observational Study (OS) from the WHI conducted in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: This study included 110,011 women age 50 to 79 years with no history of cancer. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Typical sleep duration, sleep quality, and other self-reported sleep measures over the past 4 weeks were assessed during the screening visits for both the CT and OS participants. The presence of insomnia and level of sleep disturbance was calculated from an index of the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale. The outcome for this study was primary, invasive breast cancer. A total of 5,149 incident cases of breast cancer were identified in this study. No statistically significant associations were found between sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia, or level of sleep disturbance with the risk of breast cancer after multivariable adjustment. A positive trend was observed for increasing sleeping duration with the risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, but the association estimates for each sleep duration category were weak and nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide strong support for an association between self-reported sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia, or sleep disturbance with the risk of breast cancer.

AB  - Background: Indexes of associations between OSA and impaired vascular function are mainly based on small, clinic-based studies of conduit artery function in men with severe sleep apnea. Larger population-based studies show no independent associations or associations in women only. Sex differences in OSA-related mortality may exist, and sex differences in vascular function in subjects with OSA need to be explored. We, therefore, assessed whether OSA is associated with digital vascular function in a large population-based sample and whether this association is influenced by sex.Methods: From a population-based cohort of 30,000 subjects aged 30 to 65 years, we examined 479 subjects (mean age, 48 years; 43% women). Oversampling of subjects at high risk of OSA was performed. Sleep apnea was assessed by inhospital polysomnography. Endothelial function was assessed by digital peripheral arterial tonometry and was expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI).Results: OSA was diagnosed in 266 subjects (55.5%). The RHI was significantly lower in subjects with severe OSA than in those without OSA (P = .002). In the multivariate model for RHI, a significant interaction between OSA and sex was found. In sex-specific multivariate linear regression models, adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors, OSA was an independent predictor of a low RHI in women (P = .006) but not in men. The association between OSA and low RHI in women was independent of postmenopausal status.Conclusions: In a large population-based sample of middle-aged subjects, OSA was independently associated with impaired digital vascular function in women only.

AB  - Background: The intensity and persistence of treatment-related symptoms among breast cancer survivors is incompletely understood. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate prevalence of severe symptoms well after initial treatment for breast cancer, to test whether symptom intensity diminishes with time or varies by treatment received. Design, setting, subjects: This was a cross-sectional survey of female survivors of stage I-III invasive breast cancer, seen for routine follow-up a year or more after diagnosis. Measurements: Data was derived from three validated questionnaires indicating physical and emotional domains. Symptoms rated in the top two levels of four- or five-item Likert scales were 'severe.' Associations with symptom intensity were tested using multivariate linear regression. Results: Survey response was 68.5% (50/73). Respondents were age 55.4 (±9.1) years, median 2.2 (1.0-13.1) years since diagnosis; 64% were receiving endocrine therapy. Severe levels of hot flashes (42% of respondents), weight gain (32%), low libido (32%), and joint pain (30%) were common; (36%) of respondents rated sleep 'fairly poor' or 'very bad;' 30% were fatigued at least half the day. For 34%, health typically limited vigorous activities 'a lot.' Most (84%) respondents were experiencing at least one severe symptom. Symptom intensity did not vary with time since diagnosis. Of seven symptoms, three (hot flashes, weight gain, low libido) were more intense when systemic treatment had included endocrine therapy. Time in past month feeling down, nervous, or worn out increased with intensity of physical symptoms. Conclusions: Given their severity, persistence, and association with emotional burden, treatment-related symptoms among breast cancer survivors (BCS) merit greater attention toward clinical management, patient education, and longitudinal study.

AB  - Objective: The impact of hot flashes on sleep is of great clinical interest, but results are inconsistent, especially when both hot flashes and sleep are measured objectively. Using objective and subjective measurements, we examined the impact of hot flashes on sleep by inducing hot flashes with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.Methods: The gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide was administered to 20 healthy premenopausal volunteers without hot flashes or sleep disturbances. Induced hot flashes were assessed objectively (skin conductance monitor) and subjectively (daily diary) during 1-month follow-up. Changes from baseline in objective sleep quality (actigraphy) and subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between women who developed and women who did not develop objective hot flashes and, in parallel analyses, subjective hot flashes.Results: New-onset hot flashes were recorded in 14 (70%) women and reported by 14 (70%) women (80% concordance). Estradiol was universally suppressed. Objective sleep efficiency worsened in women with objective hot flashes and improved in women without objective hot flashes (median decrease, 2.6%; median increase, 4.2%; P = 0.005). Subjective sleep quality worsened more in those with subjective hot flashes than in those without subjective hot flashes (median increase in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 2.5 vs 1.0; P = 0.03). Objective hot flashes were not associated with subjective sleep quality, nor were subjective symptoms linked to objective sleep measures.Conclusions: This experimental model of induced hot flashes demonstrates a causal relationship between hot flashes and poor sleep quality. Objective hot flashes result in worse objective sleep efficiency, whereas subjective hot flashes worsen perceived sleep quality.

AB  - Objective: Women with breast cancer have been found to have poorer cognitive function before the initiation of systemic adjuvant therapy than their age- and education-matched counterparts. The basis for this may partly include hormone exposure during the course of a woman's life.Methods: We compared cognitive function between postmenopausal women with breast cancer before the initiation of systemic adjuvant therapy and healthy age- and education-matched postmenopausal women and examined whether factors related to lifetime exposure to hormones predicted cognitive function before therapy.Results: We found that, compared with healthy women, women with breast cancer had poorer memory (P = 0.05) and attention (P = 0.006). Controlling for the covariates age and estimated verbal intelligence, we found that factors related to greater lifetime hormone exposure (oral contraceptive use, greater years since menopause, and longer duration of hormone therapy) predicted cognitive function (executive function, verbal learning and memory, attention, psychomotor efficiency, and visual sustained attention) in women with and without breast cancer but did not explain the differences in cognitive function observed at pretreatment in women with breast cancer.Conclusions: Other factors may explain the poorer pretreatment cognitive function in women with breast cancer, including persistent effects of surgical operation and anesthesia, sleep problems, and tumor-related factors. Additional studies are needed to explicate the basis of poorer pretherapy cognitive function in this population.

AB  - Clinical Scenario: A 51-year-old postmenopausal third-grade teacher requests help for her hot flashes. She finds them especially troubling as she stands in front of her class and starts sweating. Although one student offers her tissues, others make fun of her--disrupting the class. Her sleep is interrupted several times a night. She refuses to use any form of estrogen because her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 60 years. Perhaps alternative therapies can help her.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to determine if selected genetic polymorphisms in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-signaling pathway and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) are associated with insomnia and early awakening in middle-aged women.Methods: Women aged 45 to 54years (n=639) were recruited into a middle-aged health study and agreed to complete questionnaires and donate blood samples. Questionnaires were used to assess sleep outcomes. Blood samples were processed for genotyping for the selected polymorphisms: AHR (rs2066853), AHR repressor (AHRR) (rs2292596), aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) (rs2228099), and CLOCK (rs1801260). Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Results: Women heterozygous for the AHRR alleles (GC) had decreased odds of insomnia compared to women homozygous for the AHRR_C allele (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.96). Women with at least one of the AHRR_G or CLOCK_C alleles had significantly decreased odds of insomnia compared to women homozygous for the AHRR_C and CLOCK_T alleles (aOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.96). Additionally, women homozygous for the AHRR_G and CLOCK_C alleles had significantly decreased odds of insomnia compared to women homozygous for the AHRR_C and CLOCK_T alleles (aOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.89). None of the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or combinations of SNPs were significantly associated with early awakening.Conclusions: Selected genetic polymorphisms in the AHR-signaling pathway (i.e., AHRR) and CLOCK may play a role in decreasing the risk for experiencing insomnia during the menopausal transition.

AB  - The menopausal transition is frequently accompanied by adverse physical and emotional changes that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. Hormone replacement therapy has been the most commonly used menopause-related treatment to date, particularly for the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms; recent studies, however, have questioned its long-term safety for some women. We aimed to develop a cognitive-behavioral group treatment (CBGT) program as an alternative or complementary treatment option for reducing the frequency and intensity of debilitating menopausal symptoms in midlife women. Eight subjects participated in two, 10-week pilot groups ( n = 4 participants per group) with participants being drawn from referrals through the Women's Health Concerns Clinic and community advertising efforts. This pilot study confirmed a reduction in the frequency and interference associated with vasomotor symptoms, less depression and general anxiety, and an overall improvement in quality of life. Participants also reported high levels of satisfaction with this type of treatment for menopausal symptoms. Furthermore, there was a trend towards a reduction in sleep difficulties and sexual concerns over the course of treatment. This pilot CBGT program appears to be a promising alternative or complementary treatment for both the physical and emotional symptoms experienced during menopause. Further studies are needed on its efficacy through larger, controlled trials.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth impairs the infant's stress response due to interruption of autonomic nervous system (ANS) development. Preterm infants demonstrate a prolonged and aberrant sympathetic response to stressors. ANS development may be promoted by massage therapy (MT), which has been shown to improve stress response in preterm infants.Aims: The aim of this study was to compare preterm infant ANS function and stress response during sleep and caregiving epochs, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV), after two weeks of twice-daily MT.Study Design: A subset of participants from a larger randomized, masked, controlled trial was used.Subjects: Twenty-one infants (8 males and 13 females) from a larger study of 37 medically stable preterm infants were studied. The infants were receiving full volume enteral feedings with a mean post-menstrual age of 31.4 (MT) and 30.9 (control) weeks.Outcome Measures: Low to high frequency (LF:HF) ratio of HRV was the outcome of interest.Results: There was a significant group×time×sex interaction effect (p<.05). Male control infants demonstrated a significant decline in LF:HF ratio from baseline to the second caregiving epoch, suggesting decreased mobilization of sympathetic nervous system response when exposed to stressors. Male MT infants demonstrated increased LF:HF ratio during caregiving and decreased LF:HF ratio during sleep epochs, suggesting improved ANS function, although this was not statistically significant. LF:HF ratio was similar in female MT and female control infants during caregiving and sleep.Conclusions: Control males had decreased HRV compared to MT males. There was no difference in HRV between MT and control females.

AB  - Objective: Researchers have suggested that poor sleep may play a role in the association between discrimination and health, but studies linking experiences of discrimination to sleep are limited. The authors examined associations between reports of everyday discrimination over 4 years (chronic everyday discrimination) and subjective and objective indicators of poor sleep. Method: Participants were 368 African American, Caucasian, and Chinese women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. Everyday discrimination was assessed each year from baseline through the third follow-up exam via questionnaire with the Everyday Discrimination Scale (intraclass correlation coefficient over 4 years = .90). Subjective sleep complaints were measured beginning in Year 5 with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Objective indices of sleep continuity, duration, and architecture were assessed via in-home polysomnography, beginning in Year 5. Results: In linear regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ ethnicity, and financial strain, chronic everyday discrimination was associated with more subjective sleep complaints (Estimate = 1.52, p < .001) and polysomnography-assessed wakefulness after sleep onset (Estimate = .19, p < .02), a marker of sleep continuity. Findings did not differ by race/ethnicity and remained significant after adjusting for menopausal status, body mass index, medication use, and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Experiences of chronic everyday discrimination are independently associated with both subjective and objective indices of poor sleep. Findings add to the growing literature linking discrimination to key markers of biobehavioral health.

AB  - The article offers medical news briefs as of June 3, 2013. A study reveals that more than 10 hours of sleep while experiencing symptoms of insomnia increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). A study suggests that general practitioners (GPs) do not look into women's need for information about herbal remedies to lessen symptoms of menopause. According to a survey younger and older adults and women of higher social groups are most likely to quit smoking.

AB  - Background: Long and short sleep duration are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, evidence is inconsistent. We sought to identify whether self-reported sleep duration and insomnia, based on a validated questionnaire, are associated with increased incident CHD and CVD among postmenopausal women. Methods: Women's Health Initiative Observational Study Participants (N=86,329; 50-79 years) who reported on sleep at baseline were followed for incident CVD events. Associations of sleep duration and insomnia with incident CHD and CVD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models over 10.3 years. Results: Women with high insomnia scores had elevated risk of CHD (38%) and CVD (27%) after adjustment for age and race, and in fully adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR]=1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.30; 1.11 95% CI 1.03-2.00). Shorter (≤5 hours) and longer (≥10 hours) sleep duration demonstrated significantly higher incident CHD (25%) and CVD (19%) in age- and race-adjusted models, but this was not significant in fully adjusted models. Formal tests for interaction indicated significant interactions between sleep duration and insomnia for risk of CHD ( p<0.01) and CVD ( p=0.02). Women with high insomnia scores and long sleep demonstrated the greatest risk of incident CHD compared to midrange sleep duration (HR=1.93, 95% CI 1.06-3.51) in fully adjusted models. Conclusions: Sleep duration and insomnia are associated with CHD and CVD risk, and may interact to cause almost double the risk of CHD and CVD. Additional research is needed to understand how sleep quality modifies the association between prolonged sleep and cardiovascular outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate subjective sleep in premenopausal and postmenopausal women by assessing differences between workdays and leisure days. METHODS: Ninety-one regularly working women-of which 58 were premenopausal (aged 44-48 y) and 33 were postmenopausal (aged 53-58 y)-were recruited. A 14-day sleep diary was used to investigate total sleep time (TST), nocturnal sleep time (ST), sleep latency, and number of awakenings after workdays and leisure days. RESULTS: TST (P = 0.002 during the 14-d period, P < 0.001 during workdays) and ST (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) were shorter, and the number of awakenings (P = 0.033 and P = 0.043) during the entire 14-day period and after workdays was higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. No differences were observed during leisure days. Falling asleep took longer in postmenopausal women during the entire 14-day period (P = 0.011), during workdays (P = 0.040), and during leisure days (P = 0.010). After adjustment for the depression score, TST and ST during the 14-day period (P = 0.006 for TST, P = 0.004 for ST) and during workdays (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) remained shorter in postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported sleep problems are more common in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women, and the difference is more pronounced during workdays than during leisure days. These observations suggest that postmenopausal women have the capacity for good sleep but are more vulnerable to sleep problems related to work-related stress.

AB  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a 'multispeciality' disorder suspected in patients with irregular menses and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism such as acne, seborrhoea, hirsutism, irregular menses, infertility, and alopecia. Recently, PCOS has been associated with the metabolic syndrome. Patients may develop obesity, insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias, hypertension, non-alcoholic liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea. Good clinical examination with hematological and radiological investigations is required for clinical evaluation. Management is a combined effort involving a dermatologist, endocrinologist, gynecologist, and nutritionist. Morbidity in addition includes a low 'self image' and poor quality of life. Long term medications and lifestyle changes are essential for a successful outcome. This article focuses on understanding the normal and abnormal endocrine functions involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Proper diagnosis and management of the patient is discussed.

AB  - Objective: The aims of this cross-sectional study were to determine if cognitive function differs across stages of reproductive aging and to evaluate whether hormones or menopausal symptoms predict cognition in perimenopause. We hypothesized that women in late menopausal transition and early postmenopause would perform more poorly than those in the late reproductive stage on attention and verbal memory tasks, and that estradiol, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, hot flashes, and sleep disturbance would predict cognitive performance on those tasks.Methods: One hundred seventeen middle-aged women enrolled in the Rochester Investigation of Cognition Across Menopause were categorized into late reproductive stage (n = 34), early menopausal transition stage (n = 28), late menopausal transition stage (n = 41), or early postmenopause stage (n = 14) according to criteria from the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop +10. We administered a neuropsychological battery assessing six domains of cognition, assessed menopausal symptoms, and measured serum levels of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone. Multivariate regressions were conducted to determine the impact of menopausal stage and symptoms on cognition.Results: Women in the first year of postmenopause performed significantly worse than women in the late reproductive and late menopausal transition stages on measures of verbal learning, verbal memory, and motor function. They also performed significantly worse than women in the late menopausal transition stage on attention/working memory tasks.Conclusions: Cognitive function does not change linearly across perimenopause. Decreases in attention/working memory, verbal learning, verbal memory, and fine motor speed may be most evident in the first year after the final menstrual period.

AB  - Objective: The relationship between depression and estrogen withdrawal remains controversial. The authors examined the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist-induced ovarian suppression on mood, sleep, sexual function, and nighttime hot flushes. They focused on whether participating women experienced clinically significant depressive symptoms and whether specific symptoms associated with hypogonadism (nighttime hot flushes and disturbed sleep) increased susceptibility to depression.Method: Participants were 72 healthy premenopausal women, ages 19-52 years, with no current or past axis I psychiatric diagnosis or gynecological or other medical illness. After 2 months of baseline screening, women received monthly injections of leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg) for 2-3 months. Outcomes were measured using the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and a daily rating scale measuring the severity of several affective and behavioral symptoms. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance using PROC MIXED (for mixed models).Results: BDI scores ≥10 were reported in four of the 72 women (5.6%). Relative to baseline, induced hypogonadism was associated with significantly decreased sexual interest, disturbed sleep, and more severe nighttime hot flushes, but no significant change in any mood-related symptom score. Hot flush severity was significantly correlated with disturbed sleep.Conclusions: These data demonstrate that clinically significant depressive symptoms were rare accompaniments of short-term estradiol withdrawal and induced hypogonadism in healthy premenopausal women. Additionally, neither nighttime hot flushes nor disturbed sleep were sufficient to cause depressive symptoms in hypogonadal women.

AB  - Introduction: Among the various symptoms related to menopause are sleep disturbances, hot flashes, mood changes, and psychological changes related to depression and panic. Objective: To evaluate the effects of resistance training (RT) on climacteric symptoms. Methods: For this study, we chose sixteen sedentary postmenopausal women who were not using any kind of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medications. Results: There was a reduction of climacteric symptoms in the training group (TG) compared with the control group (CG) for the parameters of insomnia in weeks 5, 6, 7, 8 and hot flashes in week 4, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. Conclusion: The RT decreased the intensity of the symptoms of insomnia and hot flashes in sedentary postmenopausal women.

AB  - Case: Kristen is a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome (DS) who was seen urgently with concerns of cognitive and developmental regression including loss of language, social, and toileting skills. The evaluation in the DS clinic focused on potential medical diagnoses including atlantoaxial joint instability, vitamin deficiency, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and seizures. A comprehensive medical evaluation yielded only a finding of moderate OSA. A reactive depression was considered in association with several psychosocial factors including moving homes, entering puberty/onset of menses, and classroom change from an integrated setting to a self-contained classroom comprising unfamiliar peers with behavior challenges.Urgent referrals for psychological and psychiatric evaluations were initiated. Neuropsychological testing did not suggest true regression in cognitive, language, and academic skills, although decreases in motivation and performance were noted with a reaction to stress and multiple environmental changes as a potential causative factor. Psychiatry consultation supported this finding in that psychosocial stress temporally correlated with Kristen's regression in skills.Working collaboratively, the team determined that Kristen's presentation was consistent with a reactive form of depression (DSM-IV-TR: depressive disorder, not otherwise specified). Kristen's presentation was exacerbated by salient environmental stress and sleep apnea, rather than a cognitive regression associated with a medical cause. Treatment consisted of an antidepressant medication, continuous positive airway pressure for OSA, and increased psychosocial supports. Her school initiated a change in classroom placement. With this multimodal approach to evaluation and intervention, Kristen steadily improved and she returned to her baseline function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with 'resilience' and 'vulnerability' to hot flushes and night sweats. METHODS: A total of 4,407 women aged 45 to 54 years who were recruited from family practices in northeast Scotland responded to a postal questionnaire. Among respondents reporting high-frequency hot flushes (n = 628) or night sweats (n = 628), we compared those with low levels of bother ('resilient') with the rest. Similarly, among women reporting low-frequency hot flushes (n = 459) or night sweats (n = 459), those with high bother ('vulnerable') were compared with the rest. Forward stepwise logistic regression examined social, psychological, and physical factors associated with resilience or vulnerability to each symptom. RESULTS: Women resilient to hot flushes were those who had previously not been bothered by their menstrual periods; were not experiencing somatic symptoms or night sweats; and perceived their symptoms as having low consequences on their lives. Those vulnerable to hot flushes had children; had a high body mass index; reported night sweats; and perceived their symptoms as having high life consequences. Women resilient to night sweats were nonsmokers; were not experiencing sleep difficulties; were not using psychological symptom management strategies; and perceived their menopausal symptoms as having low life consequences. Those vulnerable to night sweats had low educational attainment; had previously been bothered by their menstrual periods; had below-average physical health; reported musculoskeletal symptoms and hot flushes; and perceived their menopausal symptoms as having high life consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with resilience or vulnerability differ by symptom studied, although relationships with illness perceptions exist in all models. Our results suggest that a single approach to managing these symptoms is likely to be unsuccessful.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to study the efficacy of group therapy with applied relaxation on vasomotor symptoms and health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In this open, randomized controlled trial, 60 healthy postmenopausal women with at least seven moderate to severe hot flashes per 24 hours were randomized to either group therapy with applied relaxation (n = 33) or untreated control group (n = 27) for 12 weeks. A follow-up visit was scheduled 3 months after the end of therapy or participation in the control group. Salivary cortisol was measured three times during a 6-month period. Hot flashes were recorded in self-registered diaries, and health-related quality of life was assessed with the Women's Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: The number of hot flashes decreased by 5.0 per 24 hours in the applied relaxation group compared with 1.9 in the control group on the 12th week (P < 0.001) and still remained at the same level at the 3-month follow-up (P < 0.001). Health-related quality of life for vasomotor symptoms, sleep, and memory improved significantly on the 12th week measurement in the applied relaxation group compared with the control group. Salivary cortisol concentration was lowered markedly in the applied relaxation group on a single measurement but was otherwise mainly stable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Applied relaxation can be used to treat vasomotor symptoms in healthy postmenopausal women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between self-reported sleep quality, menopausal symptom intensity, and correlates (including ethnicity) among middle-aged women. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study involved 1,078 Colombian women aged 40 to 59 years who completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and a general questionnaire exploring sociodemographic data. RESULTS: The median [interquartile range] age of the whole sample was 49.0 [9.0] years. Among the participants, 45.4% were postmenopausal, 57.2% had increased body mass index values, 13.9% were black, 20.7% had hypertension, 74.1% had a stable partner, and 3.8% used hormone therapy. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 57.1% (PSQI global score >=5). Significant correlations between PSQI global scores and MRS total and subscale scores were found. Multiple linear regression analysis found that higher PSQI scores (poorer quality of sleep) correlated with higher MRS psychological and somatic subscale scores (more severe symptoms), smoking habit, and hypertension. Menopause status and black ethnicity were excluded from the final regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Despite study limitations, poor sleep quality is highly prevalent in this large middle-aged Colombian female sample and is related to menopausal symptom severity, tobacco use, and presence of hypertension.

AB  - To identify the awareness about Sleep Hygiene in women attended at a menopause clinic. Method: The data were obtained from responses to a Sleep Hygiene questionnaire, from 72 women in perimenopause / menopause, with 30 of them being attended by the general climacteric clinic and 42 by the "sleep disorders" clinic. Statistical analyses were conducted using simple frequency, differentiating between the awareness, or not, of sleep hygiene, and a chi-square comparison between the subgroups. Results: For this group of women, overall, it was ascertained that 79,2% of them were not aware of the term Sleep Hygiene, despite, in many cases, recognizing the steps that lead to adequate sleep. Conclusion: The article suggests the importance of professional health assistance for women during the menopausal and postmenopausal transition phases with regard to promoting an awareness of the importance of the quality of sleep.
AB  - Identificar o conhecimento sobre a Higiene do Sono em mulheres que frequentavam um ambulatório de climatério. Método: Os dados foram obtidos pelo preen­chimento de questionário sobre a higiene do sono, por 72 mulheres na perimenopausa/pós-menopausa, sendo que 30 eram atendidas pelo ambulatório geral do climatério e 42 pelo ambulatório de "distúrbios do sono". Foram realizadas análises estatísticas por frequência simples, diferenciando entre o conhecimento ou não da higiene do sono e com­paração entre os subgrupos pelo qui-quadrado. Resultados: No grupo total de mulheres, foi identificado que 79,2% delas não conheciam a expressão higiene do sono, apesar de, muitas vezes, reconhecerem as medidas que induzem a um sono adequado. Conclusão: O artigo sugere a impor­tância da assistência dos profissionais de saúde durante a fase de transição menopáusica e pós-menopausa no que se refere à promoção de conhecimento sobre a importância da qualidade do sono.

AB  - To identify the awareness about Sleep Hygiene in women attended at a menopause clinic. Method: The data were obtained from responses to a Sleep Hygiene questionnaire, from 72 women in perimenopause / menopause, with 30 of them being attended by the general climacteric clinic and 42 by the 'sleep disorders' clinic. Statistical analyses were conducted using simple frequency, differentiating between the awareness, or not, of sleep hygiene, and a chi-square comparison between the subgroups. Results: For this group of women, overall, it was ascertained that 79,2% of them were not aware of the term Sleep Hygiene, despite, in many cases, recognizing the steps that lead to adequate sleep. Conclusion: The article suggests the importance of professional health assistance for women during the menopausal and postmenopausal transition phases with regard to promoting an awareness of the importance of the quality of sleep.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Women with menopausal symptoms have been reported to have reduced risk of breast cancer, possibly reflecting differences in endogenous hormone levels. We examined the associations between menopausal symptoms and breast cancer in women under age 50. Methods: We carried out a sister-controlled case-control study, the Two Sister Study, comparing 1422 women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 and their 1669 sisters who were free of breast cancer and had enrolled in the prospective Sister Study cohort. History and age at first occurrence of menopause-associated symptoms (e.g. hot flashes, poor sleep or night sweats) were ascertained using computer-assisted telephone interviews. To equalise opportunity for exposure, we assessed exposures in relation to a sibship-based index age (the minimum of the age at diagnosis of the case sister and the age at interview of her control sister(s)), and estimated odds ratios using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for menopausal status and birth order. Findings: Having had menopause-associated symptoms (n =706) prior to the index age was associated with reduced risk of young-onset breast cancer (odds ratio (OR), 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40–0.61). Similar results were seen for hot flashes and for “other” menopausal symptoms. The association between menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk was somewhat stronger for oestrogen receptor positive tumours than for oestrogen receptor negative tumours (heterogeneity p =0.07). Menopausal status, age at menopause, BMI and hormone replacement therapy did not modify the associations, but the inverse association between menopausal symptoms and breast cancer attenuated with increasing index age (p <0.01). Interpretation: Menopause-associated symptoms were associated with markedly reduced risk of young-onset breast cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm the association and elucidate possible pathways.

AB  - Objective: The use of estrogen and progesterone to manage vasomotor symptoms (ie, hot flashes and night sweats) has declined because of concerns about their risks, and there is an increased interest in alternate, effective, and low-risk treatments. This study reports the results of a randomized controlled trial of clinical hypnosis for treating vasomotor symptoms among postmenopausal women.Methods: This is a randomized, single-blind, controlled, clinical trial involving 187 postmenopausal women reporting a minimum of seven hot flashes per day (or at least 50 hot flashes a week) at baseline between December 2008 and April 2012. Eligible participants received five weekly sessions of either clinical hypnosis or structured-attention control. Primary outcomes were hot flash frequency (subjectively and physiologically recorded) and hot flash score assessed by daily diaries on weeks 2 to 6 and week 12. Secondary outcomes included measures of hot flash-related daily interference, sleep quality, and treatment satisfaction.Results: In a modified intent-to-treat analysis that included all randomized participants who provided data, reported subjective hot flash frequency from baseline to week 12 showed a mean reduction of 55.82 (74.16%) hot flashes for the clinical hypnosis intervention versus a mean reduction of 12.89 (17.13%) hot flashes for controls (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 36.15-49.67). The mean reduction in hot flash score was 18.83 (80.32%) for the clinical hypnosis intervention as compared with 3.53 (15.38%) for controls (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 12.60-17.54). At 12-week follow-up, the mean reduction in physiologically monitored hot flashes was 5.92 (56.86%) for clinical hypnosis and 0.88 (9.94%) for controls (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 2.00-5.46). Secondary outcomes were significantly improved compared with controls at 12-week follow-up: hot flash-related interference (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 2.74-4.02), sleep quality (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 3.65-5.84), and treatment satisfaction (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 7.79-8.59).Conclusions: Compared with structured-attention control, clinical hypnosis results in significant reductions in self-reported and physiologically measured hot flashes and hot flash scores in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Postural tachycardia syndrome is a chronic condition with frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance or sympathetic activation and excessive tachycardia while standing, without significant hypotension. Orthostatic symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurring of vision, near faints, weakness in legs, poor concentration, nausea, and headaches. Somatic symptoms include fatigue, sleep disorder, widespread pain, abdominal pain, and menstrual irregularities. Psychological problems may overlap with physical complaints. This review discusses the normal physiology of orthostatic change, different pathophysiological mechanisms of postural tachycardia syndrome, including hypovolemia, venous pooling, autonomic neuropathy, and hyperadrenergic responses. In addition, an outline for management tailored to the patient's clinical syndrome is presented, along with concluding thoughts on future research needs.

AB  - Background: Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is diagnosed when an impairment in the sexual response cycle is associated with distress in women. The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and FSD has been poorly investigated with conflicting results. Aim: To assess the role of OSA in determining FSD in pre menopausal obese women. Methods: Forty-six women underwent standard polysomnography. Data on sexual function and sexual-related distress were obtained using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS). Women with both abnormal FSFI and FSDS scores were classified as having FSD. Results: Thirty-one women were classified as having OSA. Fourteen (30.4%) women had both sexual difficulties and sexual distress resulting in FSD; they showed higher values of sleep time spent with SpO(2) <90% (T(90) 16.8 ± 24.4 vs. 3.2 ± 5.2%; p = 0.004). FSD was present in 10 women with OSA (32.2%); in this group T(90) was higher (23.5 ± 26.3) in women with FSD than in those without FSD (4.8 ± 5.8; p = 0.003). In a logistic multiple regression analysis, T(90) was the only factor associated with an increased risk for FSD (odds ratio [OR] 1.07) (confidence interval [CI]) 1.006-1.13]; p = 0.03). Conclusions: In premenopausal obese women the presence of FSD is correlated with OSA only when nocturnal hypoxia is present.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine the influences of hormones and menstrual cycle on the severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in reproductive women. Materials and Methods: A total of 381 volunteered women (aged 14- 53 years) were interviewed using a validated diagnostic questionnaire to determine the presence of the disease. Volunteers were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics. 54 women who fulfilled the disease criteria were administered the International RLS Severity Scale. The patients were also assessed by using the Short Form-36 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in order to evaluate the quality of life. Blood samples were drawn on the days 3, 13 and 23 of the menstrual cycle to determine hormone levels. Results: There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of the 381 women surveyed, 14.2% were positive for the disease. Severity of the disease symptoms were not correlated with hormone levels. We found no association of RLS with educational level, smoking, marital status and number of parity. However, a significant difference was found in alcohol intake and caffeine consumption between patients and controls (p<0.05). Perceived RLS severity was increased significantly in the follicular phase. The severity of the disease symptoms affected sleep quality and quality of life. No correlation was observed between hormone levels and SF-36 scores. Conclusion: RLS is a common disease, affecting women in reproductive ages more often than in post-menopausal ages. Female hormonal changes do not correlate with the severity of RLS symptoms. RLS is perceived more severely in the follicular phase. Estradiol levels do not affect SF-36 scores in reproductive ages as it does in post-menopausal ages. Turk J Phys Med Rehab 2013;59:45-51.
AB  - Amaç: Çalışmamızın amacı doğurganlık dönemindeki kadınlarda huzursuz bacak sendromu (HBS) sıklığını ortaya koymak ve kadınlarda oluşan hormonal değişikliklerin, semptom şiddeti, uyku ve yaşam kalitesi üzerine etkisini saptamaktı. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışmaya katılma konusunda onayı alınmış 381 gönüllü kadından oluşan gruba, yüz yüze görüşmeyle demografik değerlendirme formu doldurtuldu. Bu gruba HBS tanı kriterleri soruldu. Tanı kriterlerini karşılayan ve onayı alınan 54 hasta çalışmaya dahil edildi. Menstruel siklusun 3, 13 ve 23. günlerinde hastalara yüz yüze görüşmeyle Uluslararası HBS Şiddet Skalası formu doldurtuldu. Hastaların uyku ve yaşam kalitesini değerlendirmek için, hastalara Pittsburgh Uyku Kalitesi İndeksi ve Kısa Form- 36 anket formu doldurtuldu. Bu hastaların hormon düzeyine bakmak için adetlerinin 3, 13 ve 23. günlerinde kan alındı. Bulgular: Üç yüz seksen bir gönüllü kadından %14,2’si HBS tanı kriterlerini karşılıyordu. Menopoz öncesi dönemde hastalık oldukça sık görüldü, ancak hormon düzeylerinin hastalık şiddetine etkisi yoktu. Periyodik bacak hareketlerinin neden olduğu uyku bozukluğu ise hastaların %53,7’sinde vardı. Medeni durum, adet düzeni, adet süresi, düşük sayısı ve çocuk sayısı açısından hasta ve kontrol grubu arasında fark bulunmadı. Ancak hasta olanlar ve olmayanlar arasında alkol kullanımı ve kafein kullanımı açısından istatistiksel olarak anlamlı fark vardı (p<0,05). Çalışmamızda doğurgan dönemdeki kadınlarda foliküler evrede hastalığın daha şiddetli olduğu belirlendi. Hormon düzeyleri ile KF-36 komponentleri arasında ilişki yoktu. Menopoz dönemine ait yapılan çalışmaların aksine, Estradiol düzeyinin yaşam kalitesi ölçekleri üzerinde etkisi yoktu. Sonuç: Bu çalışmada kadınlarda HBS’nin doğurganlık döneminde, menopoz dönemine göre daha sık olduğu gösterildi. Ancak hormon düzeylerinin hastalık şiddeti ve yaşam kalitesi üzerinde etkisi yoktu. Foliküler evrede hastalığın daha şiddetli algılandığı ortaya kondu. Türk Fiz T›p Rehab Derg 2013;59:45-51.

In this report, we examined the effects of treatment with quetiapine extended release (XR), 150-300 mg/day, on sleep and QOL in 23 midlife women with major depressive disorder (MDD). Quetiapine XR improved subjective sleep distress, overall sleep parameters, and sleep-related QOL, ultimately leading to significant improvement in menopause-related QOL. While larger, controlled trials are still awaited, these preliminary results are encouraging and suggest that quetiapine XR may be a useful tool in treating symptomatic midlife women with MDD.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of the phases of the menstrual cycle and the use of hormonal contraception on sleep patterns in a population-based study.Methods: In a prospective study carried out among premenopausal women between July and December 2007, a 3-stage cluster sampling was used to ensure accurate representation of the general population of São Paulo, Brazil. Questionnaires were administered, hormonal assays were performed, and full-night polysomnography was recorded.Results: The study sample included 297 premenopausal women. Women in the follicular phase complained of fatigue more than those in the luteal phase and those using hormonal contraceptive treatment. Premenopausal women using hormonal contraceptives had a significantly lower apnea-hypopnea index (1.1 ± 2.0) compared with women in both the follicular (2.2 ± 4.5) and the luteal (2.9 ± 5.4) phases (P=0.01). Women taking hormonal contraceptives tended to have increased sleep efficiency compared with women in either the follicular or luteal phases.Conclusion: The use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a lower apnea-hypopnea index and a trend toward improved sleep efficiency. The current findings suggest that the use of hormonal contraceptives has a stronger association with sleep duration compared with menstrual cycle phase.

AB  - Background: Paced respiration has been internationally recommended for vasomotor symptom management, despite limited empirical evidence.Objective: To evaluate efficacy of a paced respiration intervention against breathing control and usual care control for vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.Design: A 16-week, 3-group, partially blinded, controlled trial with 2:2:1 randomization and stratification by group (breast cancer, no cancer), in a Midwestern city and surrounding area.Participants: Two hundred and eighteen randomized women (96 breast cancer survivors, 122 menopausal women without cancer), recruited through community mailings and registries (29 % minority).Interventions: Training, home practice support, and instructions to use the breathing at the time of each hot flash were delivered via compact disc with printed booklet (paced respiration intervention) or digital videodisc with printed booklet (fast shallow breathing control). Usual care control received a letter regarding group assignment.Main Measures: Hot flash frequency, severity, and bother (primary); hot flash interference in daily life, perceived control over hot flashes, and mood and sleep disturbances (secondary). Intervention performance, adherence, and adverse events were assessed.Key Results: There were no significant group differences for primary outcomes at 8-weeks or 16-weeks post-randomization. Most intervention participants did not achieve 50 % reduction in vasomotor symptoms, despite demonstrated ability to correctly do paced respiration and daily practice. Statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes at 8 and 16 weeks were small, not likely to be clinically relevant, and as likely to favor intervention as breathing control.Conclusions: Paced respiration is unlikely to provide clinical benefit for vasomotor or other menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors or menopausal women without cancer.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To examine the characteristics of hypertension-related factors in female family caregivers in Japan who provide care in the home, in comparison with general community non-caregivers. Background. Hypertension is more frequently encountered in female caregivers than in non-caregivers. Lifestyle factors including sleep and eating habits differ in Japanese female caregivers and the general population. Therefore, hypertension-related factors in caregivers may also differ from those in the general population. Design. A cross-sectional study. Methods. The subjects were 150 female caregivers (aged 62·4, SD 12·2 years) who provided home care for persons with physical impairments and/or dementia and 154 female controls (aged 62·7, SD 2·2 years) who did not provide home care. Persons with a history of ischaemic heart disease or cerebral stroke were excluded. Subjects were examined using a self-reporting questionnaire that included a food frequency questionnaire and the tri-axial coping scale. Urine examinations and blood pressure measurements were also done. Logistic regression analysis was conducted for each group with the same variables as explanatory variables. Results. Hypertension was present in 46·7% of caregivers and 34·4% of controls ( p < 0·05). Menopause was a factor related to hypertension in both the caregivers and controls. In the caregiver group, hypertension was associated with the estimated 24-h Na excretion in urine and the carbohydrate-energy ratio for nutriti. BMI was associated with hypertension in the control group, but not in the caregiver group. Conclusions. Hypertension was associated with nutritional factors, such as greater Na excretion in urine and higher carbohydrate energy ratio, in Japanese female caregivers and with obesity in non-caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice. To prevent hypertension, it is necessary to carefully monitor salt intake and nutritional balance in female caregivers in Japan.

AB  - Background: Sleep duration is dependent on circadian rhythm that controls a variety of key cellular functions. Circadian disruption has been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis in experimental studies. We prospectively examined the association between sleep duration and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods: In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, 75 828 postmenopausal women reported habitual sleep duration at baseline 1993-1998. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of CRC and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI).Results: We ascertained 851 incident cases of CRC through 2010, with an average 11.3 years of follow-up. Compared with 7 h of sleep, the HRs were 1.36 (95% CI 1.06-1.74) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.10-1.96) for short (≤5 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration, respectively, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, fatigue, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), physical activity, and waist to hip ratio. The association was modified by the use of HRT (P-interaction=0.03).Conclusion: Both extreme short and long sleep durations were associated with a moderate increase in the risk of CRC in postmenopausal women. Sleep duration may be a novel, independent, and potentially modifiable risk factor for CRC.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is one of the major brain disorders worldwide. Breakthrough seizures carry a heavy burden of epilepsy, with increased morbidity and risk of premature mortality. Several factors have been suggested to precipitate break through seizures but these have not been studied in our setting. The study sought to determine the prevalence of breakthrough seizures, as well as precipitating factors in adults with epilepsy attending Mulago hospital.Methods: This study was conducted in Mulago Hospital, using a cross sectional study design between August and December 2009. Subjects with epilepsy and had been receiving anti-epileptics treatment for at least 6 months prior to the study were consecutively enrolled.Results: A total of 256 patients with epilepsy were recruited. Prevalence of breakthrough seizures among epilepsy patients attending Mulago hospital was 75.3%. Factors found to be significantly associated with breakthrough seizures were non compliance to anti-epileptic therapy (p < 0.0001); duration of treatment (p < 0.0001); infections (p < 0.044) and menses among female study participants (p < 0.0001). The level of education, sleep deprivation, alcohol and substance abuse, and flickering lights were not associated with breakthrough seizures.Conclusions: Breakthrough seizures are high in Mulago National referral hospital, with drug non-compliance the commonest cause. The attending physicians need to identify precipitating factors among patients attending Mulago hospital and have them addressed appropriately during patient care.

AB  - Infants born very preterm (<= 30 weeks estimated gestational age [EGA]) annually and are at greatest risk to develop significant neurodevelopmental abnormalities. These neurodevelopmental abnormalities are the result of complex conditions involving the interaction between multiple biological, genetic, and environmental risks. In an effort to manipulate and support the extra-uterine environment, infant massage has been aimed at decreasing stress and optimizing the infant's sensory experience. However, the majority of existing infant massage studies has varying protocols, are limited to healthy or convalescing preterm infants greater than 32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and are seldom contingent on infant behavioral cues.The M Technique is a gentle, structured, comforting touch method aimed at limiting stress and anxiety in fragile intensive care patients who are unable to tolerate conventional massage. Little is known about the effects of this technique on infants born very preterm. Therefore, the purpose of this matched case-control pilot study was to systematically test the cumulative effect of the M Technique on infant neurodevelopment, growth velocity, and physiologic and behavioral state in hospitalized very preterm infants in a Midwestern academic level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Results indicate that very preterm infants who received the M Technique over a 5-week period did not differ significantly in neurobehavioral developmental and growth velocity compared to control infants. However, very preterm infants who received the M Technique had improved physiologic stability and more quiet sleep states from baseline to 10 minutes post the M Technique intervention over all three time points, suggesting improved physiologic stability and more quiet sleep state over time.Research regarding the type, timing, and duration of comforting touch in infants born very preterm starting at 30 weeks' PMA is lacking. Preliminary findings from this study support an infant-driven (e.g., where the protocol is based on each infant response or cues) M Technique intervention to promote comfort and relaxation in high-risk infants born very preterm. A longitudinal research design with a larger sample size is needed to confirm and expand on the effects and potential mechanisms of the M Technique on neurobehavior and growth velocity.

AB  - Menopause impacts 25 million women world wide each year, and the World Health Organization estimates 1.2 billion women will be postmenopausal by 2030. Menopause has been associated with symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, dysphoric mood, sleep disturbance, and conditions of cardiovascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, depression, dementia, and frailty. Conventional hormone replacement therapy results in increased thrombotic events, and an increased risk of breast cancer and dementia as evidenced in large prospective clinical trials including Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study I and the Women's Health Initiative. A possible mechanism for these adverse events is the unfavorable net effects of conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate on the hemostatic balance and inflammatory and immune factors. Physiologic sex steroid therapy with transdermal delivery for peri/postmenopausal women may offer a different risk/benefit profile, yet long-term studies of this treatment model are lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term effects of compounded bioidentical transdermal sex steroid therapy including estriol, estradiol, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone on cardiovascular biomarkers, hemostatic, inflammatory, immune signaling factors; quality-of-life measures; and health outcomes in peri/postmenopausal women within the context of a hormone restoration model of care. A prospective, cohort, closed-label study received approval from the Human Subjects Committee. Recruitment from outpatient clinics at an academic medical center and the community at large resulted in three hundred women giving signed consent. Seventy-five women who met strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled. Baseline hormone evaluation was performed along with baseline experimental measures. Following this, women received compounded transdermal bioidentical hormone therapy of BiEst (80%Estriol/20%Estradiol), and/or Progesterone for eight weeks to meet established physiologic reference ranges for the luteal phase in premenopausal women. The luteal phase hormone ratios were selected based on animal and epidemiologic studies demonstrating favorable outcomes related to traumatic, ischemic, or neuronal injury. Follow-up testing was performed at eight weeks and adjustment to hormone regimens were made including addition of androgens of DHEA and Testosterone if indicated. Experimental subjects were monitored for 36 months. Baseline, 2-month, and annual values were obtained for: blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose, Homeostasis Metabolic Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting triglycerides, total Factor VII, Factor VIII, fibrinogen, Antithrombin III, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor1(PAL-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1), and sex steroid levels. Psychosocial measures included: Greene Climacteric Scale, Visual Analog Pain Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Holmes Rahe Stress Scale, Job Strain, and Home Strain. Health outcome measures included the number of prescribed medications used, number of co-morbidities, and endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women with intact uteri. Subjects receiving compounded transdermal bioidentical hormone therapy showed significant favorable changes in: Greene Climacteric Scale scores, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Visual Analog Pain Scale, fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, MMP-9, C-reactive Protein, fibrinogen, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1, and health outcomes of co-morbidities and a number of prescribed medications. Antithrombin III levels were significantly decreased at 36 months. All other measures did not exhibit significant effects. Administration of compounded transdermal bioidentical hormone therapy in doses targeted to physiologic reference ranges administered in a daily dose significantly relieved menopausal symptoms in peri/postmenopausal women. Cardiovascular biomarkers, inflammatory factors, immune signaling factors, and health outcomes were favorably impacted, despite very high life stress, and home and work strain in study subjects. The therapy did not adversely alter the net prothrombotic potential, and there were no associated adverse events. This model of care warrants consideration as an effective and safe clinical therapy for peri/postmenopausal women especially in populations with high perceived stress and a history of stressful life events prior to, or during the menopausal transition.

AB  - The article discusses perimenopausal sleep disturbance in women. Sleep disturbance is a common problem for women progressing through the menopausal transition and can affect quality of life. Sleep disturbance can be assessed by Insomnia Severity Index tool; physician assistants (PAs) should look for symptoms like hot flushes, night sweats, changes in mood. Treatment options include hormone replacement therapy or even nonpharmacologic therapies, such as massage and/or yoga.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a relatively low daily dosage of Pycnogenol French maritime pine bark extract for improvement of climacteric symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study 170 perimenopausal women were enrolled and treated with 30 mg Pycnogenol or placebo twice daily over a period of 3 months. Climacteric symptoms were evaluated by the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and by the Kupperman index, accompanied by an investigation of sex hormones and routine blood chemistry. RESULTS: Seven women dropped out of each group due to noncompliance or personal reasons, but not as a result of treatment. A significant placebo effect was apparent in this study, suggesting an improvement of a majority of the WHQ categories. Compared to baseline, Pycnogenol significantly (p<0.05) improved all symptoms with the exception of formication sensation and abnormal perceptions. Pycnogenol was found to be especially effective for improving vasomotor and insomnia/sleep problem symptoms, which were significantly better after 4 and 12 weeks than with placebo (p<0.05). Total Kupperman's index for perimenopausal symptom severity score decreased significantly by 56% as compared to placebo (DS39%) after 12 weeks of treatment (p<0.05). Symptom score was also significantly better already after 4 weeks of treatment with Pycnogenol as compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: This study, applying a relatively low daily dose, allows identification of those climacteric symptoms which respond particularly well to supplementation with Pycnogenol.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of symptoms associated with the menopausal transition and early postmenopause on quality of life and to determine if there is a clustering of symptoms that has a larger effect on quality of life than individual symptoms. METHODS: This study used data from a cross-sectional study on women aged 45 to 60 years. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: More than 60% of the participants reported three or more symptoms. The symptom clusters that had the highest impact on quality of life were sleep disturbances and vaginal dryness, which accounted for 9.7% of the variance in quality-of-life scores. A parsimonious model of individual symptoms, including sleep disturbances, fatigue, and anxiety, accounted for 16.7% of the variance in quality of life. This group of symptoms, not represented by a cluster, had the highest impact on quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms found to most significantly affect quality of life are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and anxiety, suggesting that appropriate management of sleep disorders and anxiety may be beneficial to women undergoing the transition to postmenopause. Unanticipated clusters of symptoms point toward a unique symptom experience influenced by factors other than a decline in ovarian function. In this study, symptoms commonly associated with the menopausal transition and early postmenopause negatively affect quality of life; however, the results indicate that quality of life in midlife women is affected by these symptoms only to a small extent.

AB  - This ethnographic study, as part of the larger research project, "Living Healthy through Yoga of Yoga Masters: A Qualitative Inquiry," sought to explore the experiences of nine female yogi masters as they managed their menopausal transition (i.e., women's reproductive senescence in the continuum of reproductive aging) via a yogic lifestyle. Their yogic lifestyle included regular yoga practice, healthy food habits, adequate sleep, and the use of nature cure techniques (i.e., fasting, detoxification, selection of suitable food products, and living in well-ventilated houses) that facilitated the art of living in tune with nature. Personal interviews, supplemented with telephonic interviews, participant observations, administration of a questionniare, and field notes were carried out to explore the yogi masters' experiences. Using Spradley's method of analysis, qualitative data were gathered and analyzed simultaneously. The findings revealed the yogi masters perceived having: mild menopausal symptoms; positive attitudes towards their menopausal experiences; and, a smooth menopausal transition. Their yogic lifestyle helped the middle-aged Thais deal with their menopausal transition and provided them with a positive step towards healthier aging. Thus, it appears that health professionals need to encourage positive attitudes, among women, towards menopause and mind-body awareness, through use of yoga.

AB  - Past research suggests that women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have higher levels of alcohol use/abuse. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that women with diverse patterns of affective response to the menstrual cycle (PMS pattern, mid-cycle pattern, and noncyclical pattern) would show mean-level differences on measures of self-reported affective response to alcohol, alcohol use, and sleep changes following alcohol use. All participants from an initial study of n = 213 college-aged women who had prospectively completed daily questionnaires for two full menstrual cycles were asked to complete a one-time retrospective questionnaire regarding their alcohol use and typical affective response when consuming alcohol. From that original study, n = 161 also participated in the present study. Results showed significant differences, in the expected direction, on three out of five measures (hard alcohol use, negative affective response to alcohol, and change in sleep following alcohol use). Women in the PMS pattern group reported (retrospectively) higher levels of hard alcohol use, a less negative affective response associated with alcohol use, and lower levels of sleep changes in relation to alcohol use, as compared to the mid-cycle group. The discussion considers potential mechanisms that may be responsible for these associations (i.e., GABA modulation).

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Review recent research on the roles of gender, race/ethnicity, residential socioeconomics and age in obstructive sleep apnea syndromes (OSA) and their treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Men have a higher prevalence of OSA than women and require higher continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressures for treatment, given similar severity of OSA. When comparing age, women have less severe apnea at all ages. Menopause, pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome increase the risk for OSA in women. Neck fat and BMI influence apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) severity in women; abdominal fat and neck-to-waist ratio do so in men. Obesity, craniofacial structure, lower socioeconomic status and neighborhood disadvantage may better explain ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA. Ethnicity was no longer significantly associated with OSA severity when WHO criteria for obesity were used. SUMMARY: OSA has a male predominance; women have a lower AHI than men during certain stages of sleep; women require less CPAP pressure for treatment of similar severity of OSA, and there are ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and severity of OSA but these may be due to environmental factors, such as living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

AB  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

AB  - Background: Abnormal sleep duration, either long or short, is associated with disease risk and mortality. Little information is available on sleep duration and its correlates among Chinese women.Methods: Using information collected from 68,832 women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), we evaluated sleep duration and its correlations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, health status, and anthropometric measurements and their indexes using polynomial logistic regression.Results: The mean age of the study population was 59.6 years (SD=9.0; range: 44.6-79.9 years) at time of sleep duration assessment. Approximately 80% of women reported sleeping 6-8 h/day, 11.5% slept 5h or less, and 8.7% slept 9h or more. As expected, age was the strongest predictor for sleep duration and was negatively correlated with sleep duration. In general, sleep duration was positively associated with energy intake, intakes of total meat and fruits, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC) after adjustment for age and other factors. Both short and long sleep duration were negatively associated with education level, family income, and leisure-time physical activity and positively associated with number of live births, history of night shift work, and certain chronic diseases, compared to sleep duration around 7 h/day (6.5-7.4h/day). Short sleep duration was related to tea consumption and passive smoking. Long sleep duration was related to menopausal status and marital status.Conclusions: In this large, population-based study, we found that sleep duration among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women was associated with several sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and with disease status. The main limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design that does not allow us to draw any causal inference. However, this study provides information for future investigation into the nature of these associations so that recommendations can be developed to reduce sleep problems in middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. It also provides important information on potential confounders for investigation of sleep duration on health outcomes in this population.

AB  - Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in female adolescents living in Tbilisi, Georgia; find possible risk factors and establish an association, if any, with nutrition and sleep hygiene. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was used. A retrospective case control study was used to identify risk factors. Participants: A total of 2561 women consented to participate in the research. 431 participants were included in the case-control study. Interventions: Detailed questionnaire included: reproductive history, demographic features, menstrual pattern, severity of dysmenorrhea and associated symptoms; information about nutrition and sleep hygiene. Results: The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 52.07%. Due to pain, 69.78% reported frequent school absenteeism. The risk of dysmenorrhea in students who had a family history of dysmenorrhea was approximately 6 times higher than in students with no prior history. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was significantly higher among smokers compared with non-smokers 3.99% vs. 0.68% (p=.0.05 OR:6.102). Those women reporting an increased intake of sugar reported a marked increase of dysmenorrhea compared to women reporting no daily sugar intake (55.61% vs. 44.39%, p=.0023 LR:0.0002). However, alcohol, family atmosphere and nationality showed no correlation with dysmenorrhea. Our study revealed two most important risk factors of dysmenorrhea: meal skipping 59.78% vs. 27.03%, p=.00000 LR: 0.00000 OR:4.014 and sleep hygiene-receiving less sleep 38.77% vs. 19.59%, p=0.000055 LR: 0.000036 OR:2.598. Conclusion: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common problem in the adolescent population of Tbilisi Geogia. It adversely affects their educational performance. Meal skipping and sleep quantity are associated with dysmenorrhea and may cause other reproductive dysfunctions.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify menstrual distress, coping method and relief of symptoms among female nurses who worked with 3-shift. Methods: A total of 185 participants were recruited from November 18, 2011 to January 30, 2012. The measurement included menstrual distress and coping method questionnaire and relief of symptoms. The data were analyzed using t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficients with SPSS 19.0 Results: The level of menstrual distress was moderate (mean 3.0), and there were significant differences in menstrual distress by age, education, stress, regularity of menstrual cycle. Among the coping methods, coping according to menstrual cycle specific was the most frequently used, followed by active recognizing coping, active behavioral coping, and avoidance coping. Among the degree of symptom relief, symptom relief score was the highest when used coping according to menstrual cycle specific. Menstrual distress was associated with stress, adequate amount of sleep, dysmenorrhea and number of coping method total. Conclusion: Nurses experienced moderate levels of menstrual distress and used various types of coping to relieve it. There is a need for hospital nurses to develop an effective nursing intervention to relieve the menstrual distress and utilize active coping methods.

Design: This was a randomized, controlled trial comparing a home-based yoga group and a control group. Participants: The trial comprised 98 healthy female nursery school and kindergarten teachers. Interventions: A DVD of a simple home-based yoga program was provided for a period of 2 weeks. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the reported change in body pain at 2 weeks (after intervention) and 4 weeks (follow-up). The secondary outcome measure was the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ30) score and physical function. Results: The 67 yoga group participants reported improved menstrual pain at 4 weeks; menstrual pain was reduced from 57.0±27.8 to 37.8±26.7 in the yoga group, versus 52.4±36.5 to 46.9±32.1 in the control group (change from baseline in the yoga group versus change from baseline in the control group, −15.3 points; p=0.044). The total GHQ30 score and the GHQ subscale scores ('sleep disturbance' and 'anxiety and dysphoria') improved significantly at 4 weeks in the yoga group, but not in the control group. In the good-adherence group, low back pain improved during the intervention ( p=0.006) and follow-up ( p=0.001) periods. Menstrual pain was also improved ( p=0.044). No adverse events were observed. Conclusions: A home-based simple yoga program may improve the health status of child-care workers.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of escitalopram on insomnia symptoms and subjective sleep quality in healthy perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes.Methods: A randomized, blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled parallel-group 8-week trial with 205 women (95 African American, 102 white, 8 other) was conducted between July 2009 and June 2010. The participants received escitalopram (10-20 mg/d) or placebo. Insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) at weeks 4 and 8 were the prespecified secondary outcomes. A total of 199 women (97%) provided ISI data, and 194 (95%) women provided PSQI data at follow-up.Results: At baseline, mean hot flash frequency was 9.78 per day (SD, 5.60), mean ISI was 11.4 (SD, 6.3), and mean PSQI was 8.0 (SD, 3.7). Treatment with escitalopram reduced ISI at week 8 (mean difference, -2.00; 95% CI, -3.43 to -0.57; P < 0.001 overall treatment effect), with mean differences of -4.73 (95% CI, -5.72 to -3.75) in the escitalopram group and -2.73 (95% CI, -3.78 to -1.69) in the placebo group. The reduction in PSQI was greater in the escitalopram than in the placebo group at week 8 (mean difference, -1.31; 95% CI, -2.14 to -0.49; P < 0.001 overall treatment effect). Clinical improvement in insomnia symptoms and subjective sleep quality (≥50% decreases in ISI and PSQI from baseline) was observed more frequently in the escitalopram group than in the placebo group (ISI, 50.0% vs 35.4%, P = 0.04; PSQI, 29.6% vs 19.2%, P = 0.09).Conclusions: Among healthy perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes, escitalopram at 10 to 20 mg/day compared with placebo reduced insomnia symptoms and improved subjective sleep quality at 8 weeks of follow-up.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to identify symptom clusters that characterize women's experiences through the late reproductive stage, the menopausal transition, and early postmenopause and to explore the influence of the menopausal transition stages and early postmenopause, compared with that of the late reproductive stage, on the clusters of symptoms women experience.Methods: Participants from the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study whose symptom calendars were staged for the menopausal transition provided data for a total of 6,857 occasions. Multilevel latent class analysis was used to identify classes using scores for hot flashes and symptom factors (sleep, cognitive, mood, pain, tension).Results: Class 1 included observations of low severity levels for all symptoms, whereas class 2 included low-severity hot flashes and moderate-severity levels for all other symptom factors. Class 3 included high severity hot flashes with lower severity levels of all other symptom factors. During the early and late menopausal transition stages and early postmenopause, the likelihood of being in class 3 was significantly greater than being in class 1 relative to the late reproductive stage. There were no significant effects of the menopausal transition stages on the likelihood of being in class 2.Conclusions: This effort is the first to examine the latent classes or clusters of symptoms during the prolonged period from late reproductive stage to early postmenopause. As such, the data contribute to the understanding of symptom experiences beyond our early efforts to characterize the late menopausal transition stage.

AB  - Objective: The overall aim of this study was to examine the relationship between subjective memory complaints and objective cognitive performance in perimenopausal women. The specific aims were to determine (1) if subjective complaints of memory problems relate to objective performance on memory tests, (2) if subjective complaints of memory problems relate to other domains of cognitive function, and (3) if subjective memory complaints relate to other noncognitive factors, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep quality.Methods: Seventy-five perimenopausal women completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, which included measures of attention, working memory, verbal memory, verbal fluency, visuospatial skill, and fine motor dexterity; completed self-report inventories of their perceived memory and menopausal symptoms; and provided serum levels of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone.Results: Memory complaints were not associated with verbal learning or verbal memory but were associated with working memory and complex attention/vigilance. Memory complaints were also associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and sleep disturbance. Regression analyses revealed that memory complaints were best predicted by depressive symptoms, somatic complaints, and working memory performance.Conclusions: Memory complaints in the menopausal transition may reflect true difficulties with attentionally mediated cognitive processes. Memory complaints may also be associated with other menopausal-related symptoms.

AB  - Objective: Many women report vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and sleep problems during the menopausal transition. Although reported VMS are consistently related to reported sleep disturbance, findings using physiologic measures of VMS or sleep have been more mixed. Our objective was to examine whether more VMS during sleep are associated with poorer sleep among midlife women with VMS using physiologic measures of both VMS and sleep.Methods: A subcohort of participants (N = 52) with VMS, a uterus and both ovaries, and free of medications affecting VMS from the Pittsburgh site of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation underwent four 24-hour periods of in-home ambulatory VMS and sleep measurement. Measures included sternal skin conductance for the measurement of VMS, actigraphy for assessing sleep, a VMS diary, and a sleep diary completed before bed and upon waking. Associations between VMS and sleep were evaluated using generalized estimating equations with covariates age, body mass index, medications affecting sleep, race, financial strain, and depressive symptoms.Results: More VMS recalled upon waking were associated with significantly lower actigraphy-assessed sleep efficiency, significantly higher wakefulness after sleep onset, and somewhat longer sleep latency. Conversely, physiologically measured VMS and VMS reported during the night were largely unrelated to sleep characteristics.Conclusions: Associations between VMS and sleep may depend more on the awareness of and recall of VMS rather than solely on their physiologic occurrence.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative roles and interaction of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and obesity on interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort. SETTING: The Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort. PARTICIPANTS: 454 untreated OSA patients (380 males and 74 females), mean ± standard deviation age 54.4 ± 10.6 yr. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants underwent a sleep study, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging to measure total abdominal and visceral fat volume, and had fasting morning IL-6 and CRP levels measured in serum. A significantly higher correlation was found for BMI than visceral fat volume with CRP and IL-6 levels. Oxygen desaturation index, hypoxia time, and minimum oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) significantly correlated with IL-6 and CRP levels, but apnea-hypopnea index did not. When stratified by body mass index (BMI) category, OSA severity was associated with IL-6 levels in obese participants only (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). A multiple linear regression model with interaction terms showed an independent association of OSA severity with IL-6 levels and an interaction between OSA severity and BMI, i.e., degree of obesity altered the relationship between OSA and IL-6 levels. An independent association of OSA severity with CRP levels was found for minimum SaO(2) only. A similar interaction of OSA severity and BMI on CRP levels was found for males and postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: OSA severity is an independent predictor of levels of IL-6 and CRP but interacts with obesity such that this association is found only in obese patients.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between long sleep duration and functional capacities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Department of Kinanthropology at the University of Quebec at Montreal. Forty eight non-frail postmenopausal women aged between 49 to 75 years were recruited using advertisements in local papers. Body weight, body mass index, fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, number of steps per day, SF-36 total (healthy questionnaire), resting metabolic rate, total energy intake, sleep duration, knee extensor strength (dynamometer), chair stand test and balance opened eyes test were measured. RESULTS: WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN HOURS OF SLEEP AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY: chair stand test (r = -0.33, p = 0.02), balance opened eyes test (r = -0.45, p = 0.001), muscle strength (r = -0.43, p = 0.002) and skeletal muscle mass (r = -0.39, p = 0.007). In addition, long sleepers (> 9 h) had significantly lower values for skeletal muscle mass (p = 0.03), muscle strength (p = 0.01), chair stand test (p = 0.03), and balance opened eyes test (p = 0.001). Finally, linear regression analysis showed that sleep duration was an independent predictor of the chair stand test (p = 0.024), balance opened eyes test (p = 0.001), and muscle strength (p = 0.035) in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Long sleepers were associated with lower functional capacities in our cohort of sedentary postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objectives: The study objectives were to examine the effect of a 12-week 30-minute-a-day Ping Shuai Qigong exercise program on climacteric symptoms and sleep quality in perimenopausal women. Design: This was a prospective observational study. Settings/location: The subjects ( N=70) from two communities were women aged 45 years and above who were experiencing menopausal symptoms. Subjects: Thirty-five (35) women from one community were assigned to a Ping Shuai Qigong intervention group, while 35 women from the other community were assigned to the control group. Interventions: This was a 12-week, 30-minute-a-day Ping Shuai Qigong program. Outcome measures: The Greene Climacteric Symptom scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were the outcome measures. Methods: Descriptive analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used. Results: Pretest scores at baseline found no significant group differences in climacteric symptoms or sleep quality. Significant improvements in climacteric symptoms were found at 6 weeks and 12 weeks ( t=4.07, p<0.001 and t=11.83, p<0.001) in the intervention group. They were also found to have significant improvements in sleep quality in those times ( t=5.93, p<0.001 and t=10.58, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Ping Shuai Qigong improved climacteric symptoms and sleep quality in perimenopausal women at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The longer a person practiced this form of meditative exercise, the greater the improvement in sleeping quality and climacteric symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Intrinsic skin aging represents the biological clock of the skin cells per se and reflects the reduction processes that are common in internal organs. The reduced secretion of the pituitary, adrenal glands, and the gonads contributes to characteristic aging-associated body and skin phenotypes as well as behavior patterns. Our knowledge of whether there is a direct or indirect connection between hormonal deficiency and skin aging still remains limited. In females, serum levels of 17[beta]-estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone, growth hormone (GH), and its downstream hormone insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are significantly decreased with increasing age. In males, serum levels of GH and IGF-I decrease significantly, whereas it can decrease in late age in a part of the population. Hormones have been shown to influence skin morphology and functions, skin permeability, wound healing, sebaceous lipogenesis, and the metabolism of skin cells. Prevention of skin aging by estrogen/progesterone replacement therapy is effective if administered early after menopause and influences intrinsically aged skin only. Vitamin D substitution and antioxidant treatment may also be beneficial. Replacement therapy with androgens, GH, IGF-I, progesterone, melatonin, cortisol, and thyroid hormones still remains controversial.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated associations among subjective and objective measures of sleep and the metabolic syndrome in a multi-ethnic sample of midlife women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Caucasian (n = 158), African American (n = 125), and Chinese women (n = 57); mean age = 51 years. Age range = 46-57 years. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was measured in the clinic and sleep quality was assessed by self-report. Indices of sleep duration, continuity/fragmentation, depth, and sleep disordered breathing were assessed by in-home polysomnography (PSG). Covariates included sociodemographics, menopausal status, use of medications that affect sleep, and self-reported health complaints and health behaviors known to influence metabolic syndrome risk. Logistic regression was used to test the hypothesis that the metabolic syndrome would be associated with increased subjective sleep complaints and PSG-assessed sleep disturbances. In univariate analyses, the metabolic syndrome was associated with decreased sleep duration and efficiency and increased NREM beta power and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). After covariate adjustment, sleep efficiency (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-3.93), NREM beta power (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.09-3.98), and AHI (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.40-2.48) remained significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio values are expressed in standard deviation units). These relationships did not differ by race. CONCLUSIONS: Objective indices of sleep continuity, depth, and sleep disordered breathing are significant correlates of the metabolic syndrome in midlife women, independent of race, menopausal status and other factors that might otherwise account for these relationships.

AB  - A Chinese medicine (CM) approach, designed based on the clinical experiences of the West Los Angeles Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, is a practical path for assessing and treating breast cancer survivors. The approach consists of balancing the body with deciphering the cause of the patient's chief complaints by assessing and recognizing the six physiological dysfunctions that include gastrointestinal problems, sleeps problems, emotional imbalance, low body energy, menstrual change and pain. Multifaceted interventions are used for eliminating various CM pathologies based on identifying the basic CM patterns (syndromes) differentiation. Watching to assess the above two situations dynamically is used for outcome evaluation and predicting prognosis. Therefore this approach is called BMW. It can serve as a reference for CM clinical practice and integrative clinical care. It also can be used to simplify the clinical interpretation of CM and provide an easier way for CM doctors to communicate with Western medical doctors and patients. Additionally, it can be used as a guide for patients to assess their own symptoms for self-monitoring and self-care.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined associations of leisure-time physical activity and sleep with cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women.Methods: We analyzed 48-month cross-sectional follow-up data from 393 participants of the Women on the Move Through Activity and Nutrition Study, a behavioral weight loss trial. Leisure-time physical activity data were collected with the past-year Modifiable Activity Questionnaire, whereas sleep data were collected with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We compared physical activity and sleep categories using analysis of variance, post hoc Scheffe tests, and multivariate analyses based on groups above/below the median leisure-time physical activity level, above/below the sleep quality value of 5, and above/below the sleep duration of 7 hours/day.Results: The average sleep quality and sleep duration did not significantly differ between women with high and women with low physical activity levels. When women with good sleep quality were compared, higher physical activity levels were associated with lower body mass index (2.0 kg/m; 25, 75 quartiles, 0.3, 3.6), waist circumference (6.3 cm; 1.7, 10.9), and total body fat (2.1%; 0.3, 4.0; P < 0.05). When participants with poor sleep quality were compared, highly active women had lower trunk fat, total body fat, and insulin levels than less active women did (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, physical activity was significantly associated with high-density lipoprotein level, trunk fat, and total body fat after controlling for sleep quality, sleep duration, age, hormone therapy and smoking status, and body mass index.Conclusions: The combined associations of leisure-time physical activity and sleep suggest that cardiovascular risk factors are more favorable in highly active women relative to less active women regardless of sleep.

AB  - Increases in life expectancies mean that women are spending longer periods of their life in a hypo-oestrogenic state. A cross-sectional study was designed to assess the prevalence of postmenopausal symptoms among elderly Egyptian women in the geripausal phase. A sample of 400 community-dwelling elderly women aged > 65 years were recruited from 6 geriatric social clubs in Cairo. A full personal and medical history was taken from all participants. The menopause rating scale was applied to all participants after translation and linguistic validation in the Arabic language. The most prevalent postmenopausal symptoms were joint pain (90.3%), followed by sleep problems (84.0%) and physical and mental exhaustion (80.0%). A statistically significant positive correlation was found between total menopause rating scale score and age, duration of menopause and number of chronic diseases but not with age of menopause.

AB  - Increases in life expectancies mean that women are spending longer periods of their life in a hypo-oestrogenic state. A cross-sectional study was designed to assess the prevalence of postmenopausal symptoms among elderly Egyptian women in the geripausal phase. A sample of 400 community-dwelling elderly women aged > 65 years were recruited from 6 geriatric social clubs in Cairo. A full personal and medical history was taken from all participants. The menopause rating scale was applied to all participants after translation and linguistic validation in the Arabic language. The most prevalent postmenopausal symptoms were joint pain (90.3%), followed by sleep problems (84.0%) and physical and mental exhaustion (80.0%). A statistically significant positive correlation was found between total menopause rating scale score and age, duration of menopause and number of chronic diseases but not with age of menopause.

AB  - Background & Aims: Perimenopause is the stage of a woman's life that begins several years before menopause, when the ovaries gradually begin to produce less estrogen. A number of factors gang up in Perimenopause to disturb women's sleep. Most therapies for sleep problem use a mixture of different psycho physiological therapies including pharmacotherapy, cognitive therapy, and behavioral therapy. And some of them say that complementary methods as yoga are useful. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether yoga intervention has any effect on Perimenopausal women's problem sleep. Materials & Methods: To achieve our aim, first the Pittsburgh sleep quality index was administered to women of 40-50 years old in the exercise classes. The base of the result questionnaires and interviews selected 20 subjects that had sleeping problem. Then 20 women who had poor sleep, but no sports experience were selected as control group. Experimental group participated in yoga for 10 weeks, 3 sessions of 1.5 hour. Finally Pittsburgh sleep quality index was administrated to both groups again. Analysis of the data involved both descriptive and inferential statistics including means, standard deviations, t-test and co-variance analyses. Result: Analysis of the data submitted to t-test, and analysis of co-variance indicated significant differences between the pretest and posttest results. In other words, there was significant differences among the experimental vs., control group as for as the level of Impairment in daily functioning was decreased. Further analysis through the co-variance test showed that the level of sleep disorder significantly decreased in yoga group. Further more, there was no significant difference among groups, as far as the level of Delay in falling asleep. Conclusion: The result of this study shows that yoga based lifestyle intervention has positive effects on Perimenopausal women's sleep problem.

AB  - Background: Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) affect 65-85% of women after breast cancer treatment; they are distressing, causing sleep problems and decreased quality of life. Hormone replacement therapy is often either undesirable or contraindicated. Safe, effective non-hormonal treatments are needed. We investigated whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help breast cancer survivors to effectively manage HFNS.Methods: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited women from breast clinics in London, UK, who had problematic HFNS (minimum ten problematic episodes a week) after breast-cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either usual care or usual care plus group CBT (1:1). Randomisation was done in blocks of 12-20 participants, stratifying by age (younger than 50 years, 50 years or older), and was done with a computer-generated sequence. The trial statistician and researchers collecting outcome measures were masked to group allocation. Group CBT comprised one 90 min session a week for 6 weeks, and included psycho-education, paced breathing, and cognitive and behavioural strategies to manage HFNS. Assessments were done at baseline, 9 weeks, and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference in HFNS problem rating (1-10) between CBT and usual care groups at 9 weeks after randomisation. Analysis of the primary endpoint was done by modified intention to treat. The trial is registered, ISRCTN13771934, and was closed March 15, 2011.Findings: Between May 5, 2009, and Aug 27, 2010, 96 women were randomly allocated to group CBT (n=47) or usual care (n=49). Group CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 9 weeks after randomisation compared with usual care (mean difference -1·67, 95% CI -2·43 to -0·91; p<0·0001) and improvements were maintained at 26 weeks (mean difference -1·76, -2·54 to -0·99; p<0·0001). We recorded no CBT-related adverse events.Interpretation: Group CBT seems to be a safe and effective treatment for women who have problematic HFNS after breast cancer treatment with additional benefits to mood, sleep, and quality of life. The treatment could be incorporated into breast cancer survivorship programmes and delivered by trained breast cancer nurses.Funding: Cancer Research UK.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To quantify sources of night-to-night variability. METHODS: This project was conducted in 285 middle-aged African American, Caucasian, and Chinese women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Sleep Study living in Chicago, the Detroit area, Oakland, and Pittsburgh. The study used 3 repeated nights of in-home polysomnography (PSG) measures. Night 1 data included assessment of sleep staging, sleep apnea, and periodic limb movements, while Nights 2 and 3 focused on sleep staging. RESULTS: Mean total sleep time (TST) increased substantially from 365 minutes on Night 1 to 391 minutes and 380 minutes, respectively, on Nights 2 and 3. Mean percent sleep efficiency (SE%) for the 3 nights were 83%, 85%, and 85%, respectively. Night 1 sleep values were significantly different than Nights 2 and 3 measures except for S2 (%), S1 (min), and Delta (S3+4)%. Nights 2 and 3 differences in variability were negligible. Obesity, past smoking, and financial strain measures were associated with greater Night 1 vs. Night 2 or Night 3 differences. We concluded that there was significant Night 1 vs. Nights 2 and 3 variability and, though relatively modest, it was sufficient to bias estimates of association. Additionally, personal characteristics including smoking, obesity, and financial strain increased night-to-night variability. CONCLUSIONS: This reports adds new information about between and within person sources of variation with in-home PSG and identifies elements that are essential in the design and planning of future sleep studies of multi-ethnic groups in social and physiological transition states such as the menopause.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and cardiometabolic risk factors are male prevalent. Objective: This study investigated whether gender differences remained prominent after matching for the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and postmenopause. Methods: In a retrospective analysis of 350 eligible SDB patients, female patients were matched with male patients of the same age and body mass index (BMI) (age-BMI-matched [nAHImt]; n = 102 pairs) or were matched with male patients of the same age, BMI, and AHI (age-BMI-AHI-matched [AHImt]; n = 66 pairs). The nAHImt or AHImt patients were further separated into junior and senior subgroups. Results: In the nAHImt/junior group, women had shorter neck circumferences, better sleep architecture, and lower AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and uric acid (UA) than nAHImt/junior men. In the AHImt/junior group, women had shorter neck circumferences, lower waist/hip ratios, ESS, BP, TG, and UA than AHImt junior men. In the nAHImt/senior group, women had lower AHI, neck circumferences, waist/hip ratios, diastolic BP, and UA than men. In contrast, in the AHImt/senior group, most cardiometabolic parameters were similar between women and men. After further matching for the AHI, many elements of gender differences disappeared. Conclusions: Compared with AHImt men, women had lower UA, TG, BP, and daytime sleepiness before menopause, but gender differences became indistinguishable postmenopause. We suggested that matching sleep quality or adjusting AHI would be noteworthy and required for studying gender differences.

International Journal of Nursing Practice 2012; 18: 20-27 The assessment of quality of life in female Turkish patients with overactive bladder The objective of this study was to examine the quality of life in female Turkish patients with overactive bladder (OAB). The investigation was conducted as a cross-sectional study between January and April 2010. Two hundred eighty female patients responded to the Overactive Bladder Validated Eight-Question Screener, the OAB disease-specific health-related quality-of-life scale (OAB questionnaire (OAB-q)) and the general quality-of-life scale EuroQol Five-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D) for the study. Of the 280 patients, 38.9% was classified as having OAB. The mean age was 47.0 ± 8.7. All of the quality-of-life domains (coping, concern, sleep and social) and OAB-q total scores in women with OAB were significantly worse than in women without OAB ( P < 0.001 for all). Similarly, the EQ-5Dindex and EQ-5DVAS scores for women with OAB were significantly worse than for women without OAB ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). OAB-q and EQ-5Dindex scores in menopausal women were significantly lower than non-menopausal women ( P < 0.05) in patients with OAB. In conclusion, OAB negatively affects quality of life in Turkish women. However, many women's quality of life can be improved if the patients seek medical treatment. Thus, nurses should encourage the patients to seek medical support in order to cope with health-related quality-of-life problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become the cornerstone of treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer. However, treatments are associated with a number of adverse effects that collectively are referred to as andropause syndrome, or the male menopause. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the experience and impact of andropause symptoms, particularly hot flashes, among men undergoing ADT for metastatic prostate cancer. METHODS: Twenty-one men receiving ADT for metastatic prostate cancer underwent a qualitative interview focusing on the adverse effects of ADT and the impact of these symptoms on daily living and coping strategies. RESULTS: The most frequently mentioned adverse effects were hot flashes and night sweats, gynecomastia, cognitive decline, and changes in sexual function. Hot flashes did impact on everyday functioning, and night sweats regularly disturbed sleep patterns and led to participants feeling tired and irritable. Participants reported a lack of control over their hot flashes and night sweats. There was reluctance among our sample to disclose the type of symptoms experienced to others. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of andropause symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats, was common among this sample. Participants reported a range of cognitive and behavioral responses to these symptoms. There was some reluctance about discussing a prostate cancer diagnosis or the occurrence of symptoms with others. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings have implications for a range of individual and couple interventions to manage the impact of this constellation of symptoms.

AB  - Context: Low overnight urinary melatonin metabolite concentrations have been associated with increased risk for breast cancer among postmenopausal women. The Postmenopausal Women's Alcohol Study was a controlled feeding study to test the effects of low to moderate alcohol intake on potential risk factors for breast cancer including serum and urinary levels of hormones and other biomarkers. Previously, we observed significant increases in concentrations of serum estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in participants after consumption of 15 or 30 g (one or two drinks) of alcohol per day.Objective: In the present analysis, we evaluated the relationship of alcohol consumption with 24-h urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) concentration (micrograms per 24 h).Design and Participants: Healthy postmenopausal women (n = 51) consumed a controlled diet plus each of three treatments (a nonalcoholic placebo beverage or 15 or 30 g alcohol/d) during three 8-wk periods in random order under conditions of weight maintenance.Measures: 6-SMT was measured in 24-h urine samples that were collected at entry into the study (baseline) and at the midpoint (4 wk) and end (8 wk) of each of the three diet periods.Results: Concentration of 6-SMT was not significantly modified by the alcohol treatment after adjustment for body mass index, hours of sleep, daylight hours, and baseline level of 6-SMT.Conclusions: These results suggest that low to moderate daily alcohol consumption does not significantly affect 24-h urinary levels of melatonin among healthy postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: Sleep disturbance and hot flashes are common during menopause, but their association is not well understood. We sought to understand the associations among sleep disturbance and the frequency, bothersomeness, and interference of hot flashes in mid-life women.Study Design: STRIDE is a study of women ages 40-65 years at varied menopausal stages. We examined the cross-sectional associations of sleep disturbance with the frequency and bothersomeness of hot flashes, and interference of hot flashes with work, social, and leisure activities during the 2nd year of STRIDE.Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported sleep disturbance.Results: Of the 623 women with complete data, 370 (59%) reported having hot flashes. Bivariate analyses showed that reporting hot flashes with bother, but not hot flashes alone, was associated with sleep disturbance (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.8 [2.0-4.0] and 1.3 [0.7-2.5], respectively). In multivariable models, women reporting bothersome hot flashes were more likely to report sleep disturbance (OR [95% CI]: 2.1 [1.4-3.2]) compared to women who reported no hot flashes. When the perceived interference of hot flashes with work, social activities, and leisure activities were included in the model, the relationships between bothersome hot flashes and sleep disturbance disappeared.Conclusions: Hot flashes are not associated with sleep disturbance, unless they are bothersome. Mid-life patients should routinely be queried about the bothersomeness of their hot flashes.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a pilot study for the feasibility of planning a definitive clinical trial comparing traditional acupuncture (TA) with sham acupuncture (SA) and waiting control (WC) on menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (VMS), quality of life, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.Methods: Thirty-three perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with at least seven VMS daily were randomized to TA, SA, or WC. The TA and SA groups were given three treatments per week for 12 weeks. Outcomes included the number and severity of VMS, Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Instrument, Pittsburgh Quality Sleep Index, 24-hour urine cortisol and metabolites, and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing.Results: Both the TA and SA groups demonstrated improved VMS trends compared with the WC group (Δ -3.5 ± 3.00 vs -4.1 ± 3.79 vs -1.2 ± 2.4, respectively; P = 20) and significantly improved Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire vasomotor scores (Δ -1.5 ± 2.02 vs -1.8 ± 1.52 vs -0.3 ± 0.64, respectively; P = 0.04). There were no psychosocial group differences. Exit 24-hour urinary measures were lower in the TA versus the SA or WC group in total cortisol metabolites (4,658.9 ± 1,670.9 vs 7,735.8 ± 3,747.9 vs 5,166.0 ± 2,234.5, P = 0.03; respectively) and dehydroepiandrosterone (41.4 ± 27.46, 161.2 ± 222.77, and 252.4 ± 385.40, respectively; P = 0.05). The response data on adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation cortisol also trended in the hypothesized direction (P = 0.17).Conclusions: Both TA and SA reduce VMS frequency and severity and improve VMS-related quality of life compared with WC; however, TA alone may impact the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This association is viewed as preliminary and hypothesis generating and should be explored in a large clinical trial.

AB  - Background and Aim: Neonatal opioid use for pain management and therapeutic sedation may contribute to untoward patterns of brain function, or change rhythmic cycles that form the basis for sleep structure. This study aimed to: 1) describe differences in pattern characteristics of limited channel EEG, and 2) evaluate changes in brain wave signal variability with quantification of cyclicity by spectral density distribution before and after standard morphine administration.Method: This within-subject naturalistic experiment acquired EEG data by limited channel amplitude-integrated (aEEG) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Participants were recruited in two phases: 1) medically stable (n=16, 28-32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) and 2) critically ill receiving morphine for pain or sedation (n=9, 26-39 weeks PMA). The first phase established feasibility, the second employed aEEG to describe brain function before and after opioid administration. Amplitude-integrated EEG signal was quantified by measures of bandwidth voltage, lower border voltage, and variance of each with two simple quantitative measures of peak counts 10 microV above baseline, and proportion of time below 10 microV. Further analysis presented frequency changes across time to describe morphine effect on EEG spectral measures in younger infants who received morphine in the NICU.Results: Less mature infants had higher peak counts and more time at low voltage within epoch: median peak counts 3.625 (SD1.740), median proportion less than 10 microV 22% (SD 0.200). Except for spectral edge frequency (SEF50), morphine effect did not emerge until focused analysis included mini-bands (2Hz) of spectral power. Moreover, the log transformed 'mini-band' of 14-16 Hz showed a significant difference in mean rank (n=9, chi 2 = 5.444, df=1, p<.020) between 15 minutes prior and 60 minutes after the dose. Younger infants demonstrated high power in lower frequency (delta) bands. Among older infants, shifts within the spectrum after morphine administration were observed from high frequency bands toward lower frequencies.Conclusion: Description of brain function patterns is quantifiable. Although morphine effects may be masked by the heavy presence of power in the delta range early in gestation, exploration of spectral densities offers a framework for understanding shifts of spectral frequencies in premature infant brain function.

AB  - Background. Supine sleep after hospital discharge reduces sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); however, neonatal intensive care infants are primarily positioned nonsupine. It is unknown if or when nurses transition premature infants. In addition, there is no empirical data describing the physiological impact of transitioning premature infants.Objectives. The purpose of this retrospective chart review is to document the practice and effect of supine transitioning in premature infants.Method. A retrospective chart review was conducted in two tertiary level neonatal intensive care units in Upstate New York.Results. Infants were transitioned (n=241) supine prior to hospital discharge (89%) and the difference between transition and discharge was one+/- one week. The overall mean postmenstrual age at transition was 35.7+/-1.2 weeks. There is a quadratic relationship between gestational age at birth and the postmenstrual age at transition. The youngest and oldest gestational ages at birth had the highest postmenstrual age at transition with the vertex at 30 weeks. Statistical differences were found between sites for the percentage of infants' transitioned supine, postmenstrual age at supine transition, the timing of transition and the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-II (SNAP-II) score, p<0.05.Discussion. The majority of premature infants were transitioned supine prior to hospital discharge, but not as early as experts recommend. Results support that it is physiologically safe (as weight gain & head growth were not compromised) to transition infants at 35 weeks. Continued research is needed to determine the ideal time to transition premature infants supine to reduce SIDS while supporting physiological and neurological development.

AB  - Insomnia is a frequent climacteric symptom. This pilot, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial compared estradiol associated with trimegestone or placebo in 12 women with perimenopausal insomnia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered, and polysomnography was performed at baseline and after 28 days. Sleep efficiency and median score of the PSQI improved significantly in the hormone therapy group (HT) ( p = 0.041 and p = 0.027, respectively) and not in placebo group. Perimenopausal insomnia improved after short-term HT.

AB  - Background: Climacteric symptoms such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness are very common in breast cancer patients, resulting either from age or adjuvant therapy. Tibolone, a synthetic steroid, is effective in reducing these symptoms in healthy post-menopausal women, but this has never been studied in a large breast cancer population.Objectives: The primary objective of LIBERATE trial was to study safety of tibolone 2.5mg daily versus placebo as primary, in symptomatic breast cancer survivors. The aim of this present paper was to report effects of tibolone on climacteric symptoms, vaginal dryness and health-related quality of life in the study population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, n. NCT00408863.Methods: The trial was conducted between June 2002 and July 2007. Concerning quality of life variables, a daily Diary Cards during the first three months and the Climacteric Symptoms Form and at each visit were used to register frequency and intensity of hot flushes. Mean vaginal dryness scores were calculated on the basis of individual ratings at baseline and at week 104. A subset of patients assessed their quality of life filling in the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ).Results: Of the 3148 women recruited, 3133 received trial medication (1575 in the tibolone group and 1558 in the placebo group). The median duration of treatment was 2.75 years. In total 3098 women (1556 on tibolone, 1542 on placebo) were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population for efficacy analysis. Data on vaginal dryness are available for 2144 patients and 883 women (438 on tibolone, 445 on placebo) answered to WHQ. The mean change in number of hot flushes per day was 2.74 (43.1%) in the tibolone group and -1.77 (-27.5%) in the placebo group (p<0.0001) at week 12 and -4.62 (-65.6%) on tibolone as compared to -3.73 (-52.5%) on placebo (p<0.0001) at week 104. For the composite score the mean changes at week 12 were -0.19 (-10.6%) and -0.14 (-7.7%), respectively (p=0.0006). Vaginal dryness score improved at week 104 in the tibolone group as compared to placebo (-0.46 versus -0.29, respectively; p<0.0001). Across the assessments up to two years with WHQ, tibolone was more effective than placebo in improving sexual health, sleep quality and mood domains. Women using tamoxifen showed less improvement in climacteric symptoms with tibolone, than women only receiving tibolone without any adjuvant therapy.Conclusion: The results of the LIBERATE trial show that tibolone is effective in symptomatic breast cancer patients and improves their quality of life. However, this finding should be judged within the context of the main outcome of the trial, showing that tibolone increases the risk of recurrence. The use of tibolone in women with breast cancer will remain contraindicated and any off-label use incurs a now proven risk.

AB  - Objective: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are common during the menopausal transition. Negative affect is consistently associated with self-reported VMS, but the interpretation of this relationship is limited by the infrequent measurement and retrospective recall of VMS. Using prospective data from daily diaries, we examined the daily association between negative affect and reported VMS, as well as the temporal associations between negative affect and next-day VMS and between VMS and next-day negative affect.Methods: Data were derived from the third wave of the Daily Hormone Study (N = 625). The Daily Hormone Study is a substudy of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a multisite community-based prospective cohort study of the menopausal transition. Participants reported VMS and affect in daily diaries for 12 to 50 days. Multilevel mixed models were used to determine the associations between reported VMS and negative affect, adjusted by antidepressant use, age, education, menopause status, self-reported health, and race/ethnicity, drawn from annual Study of Women's Health Across the Nation visits.Results: VMS were reported by 327 women (52.3%). Negative affect was positively associated with VMS (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.43-2.17; P < 0.001) in cross-sectional analyses. Negative affect, adjusted by same-day VMS, was not predictive of next-day VMS (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.85-1.35; P = 0.55), whereas VMS, adjusted by same-day negative affect, was predictive of negative affect for the next day (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.58; P = 0.01).Conclusions: Negative affect is more likely to be reported on the same day and the day after VMS. Potential mechanisms underlying this relationship include negative cognitive appraisal, sleep disruption, and unmeasured third factors.

AB  - Previous research in lean subjects has found lower leptin levels associated with shorter sleep duration. Since leptin levels are higher and some of the actions of leptin are impaired in obese individuals, one cannot assume that sleep will be similarly associated with leptin in obese individuals. The aim of this paper was to examine the cross-sectional association between habitual sleep duration and quality and plasma leptin levels in a sample of 80 obese men and premenopausal women aged 18-50 years. Leptin levels (ng/ml) were assayed on a fasting blood sample taken in the morning. We calculated a relative leptin level by dividing leptin by body fat percentage. Sleep duration and sleep efficiency were measured by 2 weeks of wrist actigraphy and respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a measure of sleep disordered breathing, was assessed by a portable screening device on a single night. Mean leptin levels and body fat percentage were higher in women than men (P < 0.001), however, mean RDI was higher in men (P = 0.01). There were no significant associations between relative leptin level and any of the sleep measures, including sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep disordered breathing. There was also no difference between men and women in the association between sleep and leptin. In conclusion, contrary to what has been reported in other studies, measures of sleep duration and quality were not associated with leptin levels in our sample of obese adults.

AB  - Objective. FM is a disorder of altered pain regulation and is characterized by pain, fatigue, poor sleep and psychological impairments; thus, it is classified as a central sensitivity syndrome. Female carriers of a premutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene frequently have widespread musculoskeletal pain and sometimes have been diagnosed with FM, especially if they have the motor signs of fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Studies suggest that FM occurs in persons with a genetic predisposition. We describe the clinical features of female FMR1 premutation carriers with symptoms of FM.Methods. A sample of patients was selected that participated in studies at two tertiary referral academic centres on the phenotype and therapy of FXTAS.Results. This selected sample of patients, five female premutation carriers, has FM symptoms or diagnoses and other central sensitivity syndromes.Conclusion. Since FM affects 2–4% of the world's population and about 1 in 250 females are FMR1 carriers, a study screening females with FM for the presence of the FMR1 premutation is worthwhile. A finding of increased prevalence of FMR1 carriers among females with FM would impact the standard evaluation of FM. Presently, guidelines for FMR1 genetic testing includes early menopause, congenital intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, tremor or ataxia, and a family history of FXTAS or fragile X syndrome. The latter is a common cause of autism and developmental delay. Such testing is important because female carriers are at risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome.

AB  - CONTEXT: Mounting evidence suggests that many cancer patients suffer from sleep difficulty, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the prevalence and predictors of this adverse symptom. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the prevalence and predictors of clinically significant sleep difficulty in women with primary breast cancer. METHODS: Danish women (n=3343) with primary breast cancer completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) along with measures of depression, anxiety, physical activity/functioning, and health behaviors three to four months postsurgery. Data on disease status, treatment, and comorbidity were obtained from the Danish Cancer Cooperative Group and surgical departments, and information on sociodemographic factors and psychiatric history was obtained from Danish national longitudinal registries. RESULTS: More than half (57.9%) of the women reported clinically significant sleep difficulty (PSQI >5). Multiple logistic regression identified seven significant predictors of sleep difficulty in the full sample. In order of strength, these were the following: more depressive symptoms, poorer physical functioning, older age, higher levels of trait anxiety, consuming more cigarettes, having undergone lumpectomy, and lower levels of physical activity. Subgroup analysis found that more depressive symptoms and poorer physical functioning were the only two predictors that were significant in both pre- and postmenopausal women. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a high proportion of women with breast cancer experience sleep difficulty. Depression and poorer physical functioning appear to be robust predictors of sleep difficulty, whereas other predictors may depend on sample characteristics, including menopausal status.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Women report increasing sleep difficulties during menopause, but polysomnographic measures do not detect sleep disturbances. We examined whether two spectral analysis sleep measures, delta and beta power, were related to menopausal status. DESIGN: The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Sleep Study compared cross-sectionally spectral sleep measures in women in different stages of menopause. SETTING: Sleep EEG was recorded in the participants' homes with ambulatory recorders. PARTICIPANTS: A multi-ethnic cohort of premenopausal and early perimenopausal (n = 189), late perimenopausal (n = 73), and postmenopausal (n = 59) women. MEASUREMENTS: EEG power in the delta and beta frequency bands was calculated for all night NREM and all night REM sleep. Physical, medical, psychological, and socioeconomic data were collected from questionnaires and diaries. RESULTS: Beta EEG power in NREM and REM sleep in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exceeded that in pre- and early perimenopausal women. Neither all night delta power nor the trend in delta power across the night differed by menopausal status. In a multivariate model that controlled for the physical, demographic, behavioral, psychological, and health-related changes that accompany menopause, beta power in both NREM and REM sleep EEG was significantly related to menopausal status. The frequency of hot flashes explained part but not all of the relation of beta power to menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated beta EEG power in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women provides an objective measure of disturbed sleep quality in these women. Elevated beta EEG activity suggests that arousal level during sleep is higher in these women.

AB  - Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance: Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) is widely used in menopause symptoms strategy. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of isopropanolic black cohosh extract (iCR) on the central body temperature (CBT) of ovariectomized rats (OVX) and elaborate its possible effects in alleviating menopause related hot flushes. Materials and methods: 64 female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 230±10g and aged 6–8 weeks, were divided into four groups: ovariectomy (OVX), sham, ovariectomy plus estradiol valerate (OVX+E), and ovariectomy plus iCR (OVX+ICR). The sham group underwent a sham surgery without ovariectomies, while the other three groups underwent bilateral ovariectomies under sterile conditions and a temperature implant was embedded in the abdominal cavity of all four groups. After 2-week recovery period, the temperature of all animals was monitored for 6 weeks. Results: CBT of four groups maintained a normal circadian rhythm, with a low day CBT and a high night CBT. CBTs of the sham group were lower than that of the other three groups. The day CBTs of the (OVX+E) group and (OVX+ICR) group were lower than that of the OVX group from day 2 and day 22 respectively. For the difference between day and night CBT, the sham group was smallest, while (OVX+E) and (OVX+ICR) groups were higher than that of OVX group. The amplitude of day and night CBT, CBT fluctuation frequency at 5min intervals, were higher for the OVX group than the sham group; the amplitude of day and night CBT of (OVX+E) group and the amplitude of night CBT of (OVX+ICR) group were higher than those of OVX group; while the amplitude of day CBT of (OVX+ICR) group was lower than that of OVX group; CBT fluctuation frequency at 5min intervals was higher for the (OVX+E) and (OVX+ICR) groups than the OVX group. Conclusions: Ovariectomized rats had abnormal thermoregulation, demonstrating an increase in day and night CBT, greater difference between day and night CBT, higher amplitude of day and night CBT, and more CBT fluctuation frequency. For the herbal extract iCR, the onset of affecting abnormal thermoregulation took longer than that of estradiol valerate. ICR had a significant effect on day CBT but was only little effective on night CBT of ovariectomized rats.

AB  - Cancer-related fatigue is common, complex, and distressing. It affects 70-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy and a significant number who have completed their treatments. We assessed a number of variables in women newly diagnosed with primary breast cancer (BrCa) to determine whether biological and/or functional measures are likely to be associated with the development of clinically significant fatigue (CSF). Two hundred twenty-three women participated in a study designed to document the impact of the diagnosis and treatment of primary breast cancer on function. Forty-four had complete data on all variables of interest at the time of confirmed diagnosis but prior to treatment (baseline) and ≥ 9 months post-diagnosis. Objective measures and descriptive variables included history, physical examination, limb volume, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and glucose. Patient-reported outcomes included a verbal numerical rating of fatigue (0-10, a score of ≥ 4 was CSF), five subscales of the SF-36, Physical Activity Survey, and Sleep Questionnaire. At baseline, the entire cohort (n = 223) and the subset (n = 44) were not significantly different for demographic, biological, and self-reported data, except for younger age (p = 0.03) and ER+ (p = 0.01). Forty-five percent had body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25, 52% were post-menopause, and 52% received modified radical mastectomy, 39% lumpectomy, 52% chemotherapy, 68% radiation, and 86% hormonal therapy. Number of patients with CSF increased from 1 at baseline to 11 at ≥ 9 months of follow-up. CSF at ≥ 9 months significantly correlated with BMI ≥ 25, abnormal white blood cell count, and increase in limb volume and inversely correlated with vigorous activity and physical function (p < 0.05). Fatigue increases significantly following the treatment of BrCa. Predictors of CSF include high BMI and WBC count, increase in limb volume, and low level of physical activity. These are remediable.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the adherence, safety, and effectiveness of a paper versus an electronic insulin infusion protocol. Design: This quasi-experimental implementation study compared experimental and control groups using a nonrandomized prospective cohort design. Setting: The study was performed at 2 surgical units within a federal tertiary care teaching hospital. Sample: Fifty-eight registered nurses volunteered. Methods: We compared time intervals using electronic time stamps from glucometers and insulin infusion devices to measure protocol adherence. We assessed perceived adherence using a nurse survey, and, to evaluate safety, we reviewed each paper protocol infusion calculation for correctness. Findings: Median times from blood glucose acquisition to infusion rate adjustment did not differ significantly between groups (P = .215). The majority of infusions (96.6%) had glucose acquisition times within the acceptable range. Median values of time to next 'glucose due' did not differ significantly (P = .88), and relative variation in median glucose reporting times did not differ significantly between groups (P = .16). Evaluation of 877 paper protocol entries demonstrated a 10.7% (n = 94) calculation error rate. Registered nurses within the electronic group reported greater ease in balancing workload when compared with paper protocol use (P = .03). Attitudes did not differ significantly between groups in areas of determining infusion adjustment, bolus insulin dose, next glucose due, ease of access, understanding protocol, or overall satisfaction. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that one can adhere to an insulin infusion protocol, regardless of the format (paper or electronic), in the medical-surgical setting. Our results suggest there are safety and nurse workload benefits when an electronic protocol was used. Implications: Adherence, safety, and effectiveness can be achieved when using insulin infusion in the medical-surgical setting.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: Fatigue and disrupted sleep often coexist and both are prominent clinical problems in cancer affecting quality of life. Disrupted sleep patterns are likely related to cancer-related fatigue. The relationship needs further investigation. This study aimed to characterize and compare disrupted sleep patterns in fatigued breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with postmenopausal women without a history of cancer. Anxiety levels were also examined. Methods: Data for this secondary analysis came from two studies. Global sleep quality and state anxiety were self-reported by 30 fatigued female breast cancer chemotherapy outpatients and 32 non-cancer postmenopausal women using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Results: Fatigued breast cancer patients showed significant sleep difficulties, characterized by prolonged sleep onset latency (M =54.3, SD=49.2min) and frequent nighttime awakenings, despite 40% of the patients using sleep medications three or more times a week. Compared to the non-cancer comparison group, fatigued patients reported significantly longer sleep latency (p =0.041), more use of sleep medications (p =0.006), and higher total PSQI scores (p =0.005). State anxiety levels did not differ between the two groups (p =0.88). Conclusions: Sleep is disrupted in fatigued breast cancer women undergoing chemotherapy. Nearly all fatigued patients (97%) had trouble sleeping (global PSQI scores>5), indicating significant difficulties in overall sleep quality among those patients. Knowledge of the nature of sleep disruption among cancer patients may contribute to CRF symptom management leading to tailored interventions designed to improve sleep quality in cancer patients thereby managing fatigue and improving quality of life.

AB  - Objective: To report longitudinal home recordings of hemoglobin O(2) saturation by pulse oximetry (Spo(2)) during unperturbed sleep in preterm and term infants.Study Design: We recorded continuous pulse oximetry during the first 3 minutes of each hour of monitor use (nonevent epochs) for 103 preterm infants born at <1750 g and ≤ 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and 99 healthy term infants.Results: Median baseline Spo(2) was approximately 98% for both the preterm and term groups. Episodes of intermittent hypoxemia occurred in 74% of preterm and 62% of term infants. Among infants with intermittent hypoxemia, the number of seconds/hour of monitoring <90% Spo(2) was initially significantly greater in the preterm than the term group and declined with age at a similar rate in both groups. The 75(th) to 95(th) percentiles for seconds/hour of Spo(2) <90% in preterm infants were highest at 36 weeks PMA and progressively decreased until 44 weeks PMA, after which time they did not differ from term infants.Conclusions: Clinically inapparent intermittent hypoxemia occurs in epochs unperturbed by and temporally unrelated to apnea or bradycardia events, especially in preterm infants at 36 to 44 weeks PMA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : Sleep disturbances reduce the quality of life. About 50% of postmenopausal women experience sleep disturbances such as insomnia. Complementary and alternative medical therapies may be useful for the management of sleep disturbances among postmenopausal women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of valerian extract taken nightly on the improvement of sleep quality in postmenopausal women experiencing insomnia. METHODS: : A randomized, triple-blind, controlled trial design was used for this study. Participants consisted of 100 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 60 years who were experiencing insomnia. A demographic data form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to collect data. The women were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received either 530 mg of concentrated valerian extract or a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: : A statistically significant change was reported in the quality of sleep of the intervention group in comparison with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Also, 30% of the participants in the intervention group and 4% in the placebo group showed an improvement in the quality of sleep (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: : Valerian improves the quality of sleep in women with menopause who are experiencing insomnia. Findings from this study add support to the reported effectiveness of valerian in the clinical management of insomnia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : The aim of this study was to assess longitudinally the relationship between hot flashes and insomnia symptoms in women receiving adjuvant treatments for breast cancer. METHODS: : Fifty-eight participants completed a 7-day daily diary assessing hot flashes, the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index, before and after chemotherapy or radiotherapy and at a 3-month follow-up evaluation. RESULTS: : A first canonical correlation analysis (n = 55) revealed a marginally significant relationship between pretreatment versus posttreatment change scores in hot flashes and sleep (R = 0.39), and a second analysis (n = 51) showed a significant relationship between posttreatment and follow-up changes in hot flash activity and sleep (R = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: : These results show that increases in vasomotor symptoms occurring within the few months after the termination of initial adjuvant treatments for breast cancer are significantly associated with concurrent increases in insomnia symptoms and vice versa.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Examine associations of vasomotor and mood symptoms with visually scored and computer-generated measures of EEG sleep. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Community-based in-home polysomnography (PSG). PARTICIPANTS: 343 African American, Caucasian, and Chinese women; ages 48-58 years; pre-, peri- or post-menopausal; participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study (SWAN Sleep Study). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Measures included PSG-assessed sleep duration, continuity, and architecture, delta sleep ratio (DSR) computed from automated counts of delta wave activity, daily diary-assessed vasomotor symptoms (VMS), questionnaires to collect mood (depression, anxiety) symptoms, medication, and lifestyle information, and menopausal status using bleeding criteria. Sleep outcomes were modeled using linear regression. Nocturnal VMS were associated with longer sleep time. Higher anxiety symptom scores were associated with longer sleep latency and lower sleep efficiency, but only in women reporting nocturnal VMS. Contrary to expectations, VMS and mood symptoms were unrelated to either DSR or REM latency. CONCLUSIONS: Vasomotor symptoms moderated associations of anxiety with EEG sleep measures of sleep latency and sleep efficiency and was associated with longer sleep duration in this multi-ethnic sample of midlife women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of a sericite which emits far infrared rays in the management of primary dysmenorrhea. DESIGN: A multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: One hundred four patients with primary dysmenorrhea were randomized to wear a sericite or placebo belt during sleep for 3 menstrual cycles, and followed for 2 menstrual cycles. Hot packs were used to heat the ceramics and ensure slight pain relief in both groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were the severity of dysmenorrhea assessed by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) and the number of patients who took analgesics at each menstrual cycle. Safety was evaluated by physical examination and self-reporting of adverse events. RESULTS: The baseline VAS scores were 7.27±0.19 in the experimental group and 7.38±0.19 in the control group. The severity of dysmenorrhea gradually decreased during the treatment period in both groups, with major improvements observed in the third treatment cycle (4.96±0.30 in the experimental group and 5.69±0.30 in the control group, p=0.087). During the follow-up period, the decreased VAS score was maintained in the experimental group, whereas the VAS score gradually returned to baseline in the control group, which resulted in significant difference between the groups (5.08±0.31 vs. 6.47±0.31 at cycle 5, difference -1.39 [95% CI, -2.25 to -0.53], p=0.0017). The number of patients who took analgesics decreased in both groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. No serious adverse events related to wearing the sericite belt occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a far infrared-emitting sericite belt with a hot pack might be used as an effective and safe non-pharmacologic treatment option for women with primary dysmenorrhea, with a prolonged effect after treatment.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of TU-025, keishibukuryogan, a Japanese prescription herbal medicine used for hot flash management, in American women.Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial enrolled 178 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 58 years with a Mayo hot flash score greater than 28 per week who met other inclusion criteria. After a 1-week placebo run-in period, participants were randomly assigned placebo, or 7.5 g/day, or 12.5 g/day groups, for 12 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Mayo Clinic Hot Flash Diary, the Greene Climacteric Index, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.Results: At 3 months, hot flash scores, climacteric symptoms, and sleep quality improved by 34% in the placebo group, 40% in the 7.5 g/day group, and 38% in the 12.5 g/day group. (P < 0.001). However, the differences in changes between groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.990). Diarrhea unexpectedly developed in 20% of participants receiving active medication.Conclusions: For American women, unlike the clinical experience for Japanese women, TU-025 did not significantly reduce the frequency and severity of hot flash symptoms, improve climacteric symptoms, or benefit sleep quality. This study identified several potentially significant methodological factors to be considered in future scientific assessments of traditional Asian medicines.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if heart rate variability changes during hot flashes recorded during sleep.Methods: This study was performed in a university medical center laboratory with 16 postmenopausal women demonstrating at least four hot flashes per night. Polysomnography, heart rate, and sternal skin conductance to indicate hot flashes were recorded in controlled, laboratory conditions.Results: For the frequency bin of 0 to 0.15 Hz, spectral power was greater during waking compared with non-rapid eye movement sleep and less during stages 3 and 4 compared with stages 1 and 2. Power was greater during hot flashes compared with subsequent periods for all hot flashes. Power was greater during hot flashes compared with preceding and subsequent periods for those recorded during stage 1 sleep. For waking hot flashes, power in this band was higher before hot flashes than during or after them.Conclusions: These data are consistent with our theory of elevated sympathetic activation as a trigger for menopausal hot flashes and with previous work on heart rate variability during the stages of sleep.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the association of employment and work schedule with shorter DNA telomeres, a marker of cellular ageing and disease risk factor, and consider whether differences were related to health, behaviours and sociodemographic factors, or varied by stress levels or menopausal status.Methods: This cross-sectional analysis of 608 women aged 35-74 in the Sister Study examined determinants of relative telomere length (rTL) measured by quantitative PCR in leucocyte DNA. Age-adjusted regression models estimated base pair (bp) rTL differences for current and lifetime schedule characteristics (ie, part-time, full-time or overtime hours; multiple jobs; irregular hours; shiftwork; work at night). Covariates included race, smoking, perceived stress, sleep, physical activity, health and menopausal status, education, marital status, live births, children under 18, measured body mass index and urinary stress hormones.Results: Compared with non-employed women with moderate or substantial past work histories (n=190), those currently working full-time (n=247; median 40 h/week) had a shorter rTL, an age-adjusted difference of -329 bp (95% CI -110 to -548). Longer-duration full-time work was also associated with shorter rTL (age-adjusted difference of -472 bp, 95% CI -786 to -158 for 20+ vs 1-5 years). Findings were not explained by health and demographic covariates. However, rTL differences for working at least full-time were greater in women with higher stress and epinephrine levels.Conclusions: Current and long-term full-time work were associated with shorter rTL, with differences of similar magnitude to smoking and history of heart disease or diabetes. Longitudinal data with specific stress measures are needed to further evaluate the impact of work schedule on rTL.

AB  - Goals Of Work: The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, and mood as measured by actigraphy and self-report prior to treatment and at the end of four cycles of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer.Patients and Methods: Data on sleep quality (measured using actigraphy and self-report) and mood were collected prior to treatment and 12 weeks later at the end of four cycles of chemotherapy in 69 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. In addition, each filled out the Greene Climacteric Scale. Based on reported occurrence of menses, participants were categorized post hoc into three menopausal status groups: pre-menopausal before and after chemotherapy (Pre-Pre), pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal before and peri-menopausal after chemotherapy (Pre/Peri-Peri), and post-menopausal before and after chemotherapy (Post-Post).Main Results: Results suggested that women within the Pre-Pre group evidenced more fragmented sleep with less total sleep time (TST) after chemotherapy compared to baseline. Compared to the other groups, the Pre-Pre group also experienced less TST and more awakenings before and after chemotherapy. Although the Pre/Peri-Peri group evidenced a greater increase in vasomotor symptoms after chemotherapy, there was no relationship with sleep. All groups evidenced more depressive symptoms after chemotherapy, but depression was not related to measures of sleep.Conclusions: Contrary to the study hypothesis, these results suggest that women who are pre-menopausal or having regular menses before and after four cycles of chemotherapy have worse sleep following chemotherapy. Those women who maintain or become peri-menopausal (irregular menses) experience an increase in climacteric symptoms but do not experience an associated worsening of sleep. These results are preliminary and more research is necessary to further explain these findings.

AB  - Dysmenorrhoea is the most common gynecological disorder among adolescents with a prevalence of 60 - 93%. According to United States of America (USA) based studies, 42% of affected adolescents describe their menstrual pain as severe, 33% as moderate and 25% as mild. A number of studies have shown that in 10 - 15% of female students, dysmenorrhoea interferes with daily activities including school activities. Dysmenorrhoea accounts for 600 million lost work hours and US $ 2 billion in lost productivity annually. Objectives of the study were to, (i) identify the adolescent girls with menstrual discomfort. (ii) find the association between menstrual discomforts and selected variables such as onset of menarche, family support, dietary pattern, exercise, socio economic status, family history of dysmenorrhea, sleep pattern and academic performance. (iii) determine the effect of acupressure technique on severity of menstrual discomforts among adolescent girls in terms of reduction in menstrual discomforts as measured by menstrual discomfort severity assessment scale. In order to achieve the objectives of the study it was essential to carry out the research in two phases. In phase I, survey approach was used and in phase II evaluative approach is used. The intervention given was Acupressure procedure. Results indicated that acupressure was an effective technique in reducing the menstrual discomforts among adolescent girls.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and polysomnographic correlates of insomnia in subjects with self-reported medical disorders. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Community-based sample of 3282 men and women aged 18 to 65 years old, with a subset who underwent polysomnography. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported measures of sleep habits and current health, and polysomnographic sleep variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia was 21.4%. The adjusted odds of insomnia were 2.2 times as high in persons with any medical disorders as in those without medical disorders. Specifically, odds of insomnia were higher in people with heart disease (OR = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.2-23], P = 0.004), hypertension (1.5 [12-18], P < 0.001), diabetes (1.4 [105-20], P = 0.04), stomach ulcers (2.1 [1.6-2.7], P < 0.001), arthritis (1.8 [1.5-2.2], P < 0.001), migraine (1.8 [1.5-2.1], P < 0.001), asthma (1.6 [1.3-2.0], P = 0.04), COPD (1.9 [1.5-2.5], P < 0.001), neurological problems (2.0 [1.5-2.7], P < 0.001), and menstrual problems (1.7 [1.3-2.1], P < 0.001) than in people without these disorders. Prevalence of insomnia increased with increasing number of medical disorders. However, polysomnographic sleep was not significantly different in persons with or without medical disorders for most disorders assessed. CONCLUSION: This large population-based study suggests that insomnia is highly prevalent in diverse chronic medical disorders. However, polysomnographic evidence of disturbed sleep is present in only a subset of comorbid insomnia populations.

Method: A qualitative interview study was carried out with 11 women, aged 60--93 years (median age 68 years), participating in the BMTP for 4 months. Analysis of the open interviews was supported by qualitative content analysis. Findings: Two categories and four sub-categories were constructed from the analysis: Awareness and experiences of the body through back muscle exercise (sub-categories; Sense and awareness of straightening the back and The usefulness of increased bodily strength and mobility) and Social dimensions of group training (sub-categories: Affinity and support and Sense of trust and safety). The women experienced both bodily and social benefits from participation in the BMTP, including improved mobility, increased strength, physical activity, better sleep, reduced pain and uncertainty as well as positive experiences of training in a group under professional supervision. Conclusion: The study showed that professionally supervised specific back exercise training brought benefits to everyday life, increased well-being and quality of life, and provided an empowering complement to pharmacological therapy in this group of women.

AB  - Objectives: The sedating antidepressant mirtazapine is used off label for insomnia in perimenopausal women. Despite its apparent efficacy, mirtazapine causes significant increases in appetite and weight gain. Prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) is approved for primary insomnia in patients aged 55 years and older. A clinical experience with PRM add-on to mirtazapine in facilitating mirtazapine withdrawal while maintaining improved sleep quality and abrogating weight gain in perimenopausal women with insomnia is described. Methods: Eleven perimenopausal women (ages 45-52; FSH = 53 ± 8; normal BMI, 22.9 ± 0.6) with insomnia, who do not suffer from depression as assessed by the Hamilton scale, were treated with 15 mg mirtazapine (Remeron®) for 2-4 weeks. PRM, 2 mg (Circadin®), was then added on, and mirtazapine was tapered off for another 1-3 months. Prospective data on body weight and subjectively assessed sleep quality and well-being (assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI, and Well-Being Index, WHO-5, respectively) were collected before, during, and at the end of the treatment. Results: Sleep quality ratings improved significantly (by 103% on average) during combined mirtazapine and PRM intake and 180% during subsequent intake of PRM alone or together with very low doses of mirtazapine ( P < 0.05 for all). Well-being significantly improved by 83% during the treatment. Seven of 11 women demonstrated weight gain following mirtazapine intake, five of whom have started to reduce weight following mirtazapine withdrawal and PRM intake. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Application of mirtazapine followed by PRM add-on and monotherapy improves sleep in perimenopausal women while evading mirtazapine-induced weight gain. These results warrant further investigation of a larger population in controlled clinical trials.

AB  - Background: In patients with breast cancer (BC) undergoing systemic chemotherapy, cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common problem that can negatively impact quality of life. Guarana ( Paullinia cupana) is a plant native to the Amazon basin that has been used as a stimulant since pre-Columbian times. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of guarana extract on fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety, depression symptoms, and menopause in a group of BC chemotherapy patients. Patients and methods: Patients with progressive fatigue after their first cycle of chemotherapy were randomized to receive either guarana 50 mg by mouth twice daily (32 patients) or placebo (43 patients) for 21 days. After a 7-day washout period, patients were crossed over to the opposite experimental arm. All patients were evaluated on days 1, 21, and 49. The primary endpoint was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire score, and secondary endpoints were the results of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Guarana significantly improved the FACIT-F, FACT-ES, and BFI global scores compared to placebo on days 21 and 49 ( p < 0.01). The Chalder Scale improved significantly on day 21 ( p < 0.01) but not on day 49 ( p = 0.27). Guarana did not produce any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grades 2, 3, or 4 toxicities and did not worsen sleep quality or cause anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Guarana is an effective, inexpensive, and nontoxic alternative for the short-term treatment of fatigue in BC patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate their generalizability to chronic CRF and to other types of cancer.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of participation in a mindfulness training program (mindfulness-based stress reduction, [MBSR]) on the degree of bother from hot flashes and night sweats.Methods: This study was a randomized trial of 110 late perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women experiencing an average of 5 or more moderate or severe hot flashes (including night sweats)/day. A wait-list control (WLC) was used with 3-month postintervention follow-up. The main outcome was the degree of bother from hot flashes and night sweats in the previous 24 hours. Secondary measures were hot flash intensity, quality of life, insomnia, anxiety, and perceived stress.Results: Baseline average (SD) hot flash frequency was 7.87 (3.44) and 2.81 (1.76) night sweats/day. Mean (SD) bothersomeness score was 3.18 (0.55; "moderately bothered/extremely bothered"). All analyses were intention to treat and were controlled for baseline values. Within-woman changes in bother from hot flashes differed significantly by treatment arm (week × treatment arm interaction, P = 0.042). At completion of the intervention, bother in the MBSR arm decreased on average by 14.77% versus 6.79% for WLC. At 20 weeks, total reduction in bother for MBSR was 21.62% and 10.50% for WLC. Baseline-adjusted changes in hot flash intensity did not differ between treatment arms (week × treatment arm interaction, P = 0.692). The MBSR arm made clinically significant improvements in quality of life (P = 0.022), subjective sleep quality (P = 0.009), anxiety (P = 0.005), and perceived stress (P = 0.001). Improvements were maintained 3 months postintervention.Conclusions: Our data suggest that MBSR may be a clinically significant resource in reducing the degree of bother and distress women experience from hot flashes and night sweats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the changes in self-reported sleep symptoms and cardiac sympathovagal activity among women with postmenopausal insomnia (PI) who received auricular acupressure (AA) therapy. METHODS: : A pretest/posttest study design was conducted at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, from August 2008 to July 2009. Forty-five women (mean ± SD age, 56.2 ± 5.4 years) with PI (4.9 ± 3.5 years of insomnia) received an AA therapy course on five auricular points every night before going to sleep for 4 weeks. Heart rate variability (HRV), the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Menopause Rating Scale were measured before and after AA treatment. RESULTS: : The total sleep duration and sleep efficiency were increased, and the sleep latency was shortened significantly (P < 0.01) after AA therapy. The total Menopause Rating Scale and somatovegetative subscale scores were reduced significantly (P < 0.05) after the intervention. A greater percentage change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was moderately correlated with both a lower percentage change in high-frequency power of HRV (r = -0.660, P < 0.001) and a greater percentage change in normalized low-frequency power (nLF) of HRV (r = 0.599, P < 0.001). An elevation of high-frequency power and a reduction of nLF of HRV were observed in the responder group, whereas a raise in nLF of HRV was noted in the nonresponder group. CONCLUSIONS: : This study suggests that AA intervention leads to more cardiac parasympathetic and less cardiac sympathetic activity, which contributes to the improvement of PI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : The aim of this study was to describe the changes in symptom interference during the menopausal transition (MT) stages and early postmenopause (PM), including the effects of age, MT-related factors (estrone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, MT stages), symptoms (hot flashes, depressed mood, awakening during the night, anxiety, backache, joint pain, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating), health-related factors (perceived health), and stress-related factors (perceived stress, cortisol). METHODS: : A subset of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study participants provided data during the late reproductive, early and late MT stages, or early PM (n = 184), including menstrual calendars for staging the MT; annual health reports completed between 1990 and 2008; morning urine samples assayed for estrone glucuronide, follicle-stimulating hormone, and cortisol; and symptom diary ratings several times each year. Interference was rated in the diary along with symptoms, perceived health, and stress. Multilevel modeling with an R program was used to test the patterns of symptom interference related to age, MT-related factors, symptoms, and health- and stress-related factors, with as many as 5,656 observations. Median age was 47.4 years. RESULTS: : Interference with work was significantly associated with individual covariates such as perceived health, stress, hot flashes, depressed mood, anxiety, difficulty getting to sleep, awakening during the night, early morning awakening, backache, joint pain, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating (for hot flashes, P = 0.01; all others, P < 0.001). A final multivariate model included perceived health, stress, depressed mood, and difficulty concentrating. Interference with relationships was significantly associated with age and individual covariates such as perceived health, estrone, perceived stress, depressed mood, anxiety, sleep symptoms, backache, joint pain, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating (for estrone, P = 0.03; all others, P < 0.001). A final multivariate model included perceived health, stress, depressed mood, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and awakening during the night. CONCLUSIONS: : Women's reports of how much the way they felt interfered with work and relationships were influenced by both their perceived health and stress levels. Interference was also influenced by depressed mood and difficulty concentrating, suggesting that these two symptoms may be most important to address, to enhance functioning during the MT and early PM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : The current study was conducted on a subsample of postmenopausal women with a high frequency of hot flashes who participated in the Norwegian Acupuncture on Hot Flushes Among Menopausal Women study. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory; the effect of acupuncture therapy for menopausal hot flashes on depressive symptoms; and the associations between depressive symptoms and hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and self-reported health. METHODS: : The Acupuncture on Hot Flushes Among Menopausal Women study was a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. The present subsample consisted of 72 women who were randomized to two groups: self-care only and acupuncture in addition to self-care for a period of 12 weeks. RESULTS: : The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 30.6% at baseline, decreased similarly in both study groups during the study period, and was 14.1% at the end of the intervention. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with sleep disturbances and self-reported health, but not with frequency of hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: : Postmenopausal women experiencing a high frequency of hot flashes reported a high prevalence of depressive symptoms compared with the general female population. Study results lend support to previous findings of an increased risk for depression during menopause, at least in women with severe hot flashes. Results further indicate that symptoms of depression in postmenopausal women may be alleviated with limited resources.

AB  - Background: Menopause leads to changes in hormonal balance that often have a significant impact on a woman's sense of well-being. Most notable among the changes that impact quality of life are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes.1 Hot flashes are a sudden sensation of intense heat with flushing and/ or sweating that can occur with high frequency and interrupt daily activity and disturb sleep. Pub Med and Ebsco Host searches produce a number of small studies that have concluded that Chinese medicine in the form of acupuncture, herbal remedies or in combination, warrant further study in the control of vasomotor instability or hot flashes.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Objective: To examine the approach of a single practitioner of Chinese Medicine to hot flashes associated with the menopausal transition. Method: A single case is presented illustrating an approach to the complaint of menopausal hot flashes as treated by Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. Results: A significant decrease in frequency and intensity of hot flashes as reported by the patient within six weeks of twice weekly acupuncture and daily herbal preparation. At a six-month follow-up, the hot flashes continued to be a minimal and manageable discomfort. Conclusions: In a case of hot flashes, Chinese medicine offers a possible key to effective management without the use of hormone replacement therapy. While the presentation of one practitioner's experience may add little to the call for further study, it can highlight its clinical relevancy.

AB  - Purposes: To describe changes in levels of cognitive symptoms (forgetting and difficulty concentrating) during the menopausal transition (MT) stages and early postmenopause, including effects of age, MT-related factors(MT stages, estrone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone), symptoms (hot flush, sleep, mood), health-related factors (alcohol use, smoking, exercise, perceived health), stress-related factors (perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, cortisol, catecholamines) and social factors (partner and parenting status, education, employment).Methods: A subset was studied of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study participants who provided data during the late reproductive, early and late MT stages or postmenopause (n=292) including menstrual calendars for staging the MT, annual health questionnaires for social factors, morning urine samples assayed for estrone glucuronide (E1G), testosterone, FSH, cortisol and catecholamines and health diaries for rating symptoms several times each year. Multilevel modeling (R program) was used to test patterns of cognitive symptoms related to age, MT-related factors, symptoms, health-related, stress-related and social factors with as many as 6811 observations.Results: As individual covariates and in the multivariate model, age, anxiety, depressed mood, night-time awakening, perceived stress, perceived health, and employment were each significantly related to difficulty concentrating. Hot flushes, amount of exercise and history of sexual abuse had a significant effect as individual covariates but not in the final multivariate model. The best predictors of forgetfulness when analyzed as individual covariates and in the multivariate model were age, hot flushes, anxiety, depressed mood, perceived stress, perceived health and history of sexual abuse. Awakening during the night, although significant as an individual covariate, had no significant effect on forgetfulness in the final multivariate model.Conclusions: Menopausal transition-related factors were not significantly associated with difficulty concentrating or forgetfulness. Consideration of women's ages and the context in which they experience the menopausal transition may be helpful in understanding women's experiences of cognitive symptoms.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which the upper airway becomes constricted or occluded during sleep, leading to decreased or absent airflow, hypoxia, and sympathetic activation. This chain of events, occurring dozens of times an hour, can contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. This article discusses the epidemiology of comorbid OSA and cardiovascular disease, the pathophysiology of OSA, how it acts as a risk factor for cardiovascular problems, and how appropriate treatment of OSA ameliorates the consequences. The importance of having a high suspicion for OSA in people with risk factors (including obesity, middle age, male or postmenopausal female) or symptoms (snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating) is pointed out. The article concludes with clinical and research implications.

AB  - Background. Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant disease among women world wide. Survival has been improving leading to an increasing number of breast cancer survivors, in the US estimated to about 2.6 million. Material and methods. The literature was reviewed with focus on data from the Nordic countries. Results. Local therapies such as breast cancer surgery and radiotherapy may cause persistent pain in the breast area, arm, and shoulder reported by 30-50% of patients after three to five years, lymphedema in 15-25% of patients, and restrictions of arm and shoulder movement in 35%. Physiotherapy is the standard treatment for the latter while no pain intervention trials have been published. Chemotherapy may cause infertility and premature menopause, resulting in vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and osteoporosis, which are similar to the side effects of endocrine treatment in postmenopausal women. Awareness of cardiotoxicity is needed since anthracyclines, trastuzumab, and radiotherapy can damage the heart. Breast cancer survivors have an increased risk of a major depression and far from all receive adequate anti-depressive treatment. Other psychological symptoms include fear of recurrence, sleep disturbances, cognitive problems, fatigue, and sexual problems. Discussion. To improve rehabilitation, specific goals have to be formulated into national guidelines and high priority directed towards research into developing and testing new interventions for alleviating symptoms and side effects experienced by breast cancer survivors.

AB  - : Most postmenopausal women have insomnia. Some of these women also have respiratory sleep disorders. Recent reports have documented that the phytohormones, isoflavones, are capable of reducing the symptoms of climacterium. The purpose of this investigation was to examine subjective and objective sleep parameters and to measure changes in these parameters during treatment with isoflavones in a controlled, double-blinded study in postmenopausal women with insomnia.

AB  - Background and Purpose: This guideline provides an overview of the evidence on established and emerging risk factors for stroke to provide evidence-based recommendations for the reduction of risk of a first stroke.Methods: Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the AHA Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writing group used systematic literature reviews (covering the time since the last review was published in 2006 up to April 2009), reference to previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard AHA criteria (Tables 1 and 2). All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. The guideline underwent extensive peer review by the Stroke Council leadership and the AHA scientific statements oversight committees before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.Results: Schemes for assessing a person's risk of a first stroke were evaluated. Risk factors or risk markers for a first stroke were classified according to potential for modification (nonmodifiable, modifiable, or potentially modifiable) and strength of evidence (well documented or less well documented). Nonmodifiable risk factors include age, sex, low birth weight, race/ethnicity, and genetic predisposition. Well-documented and modifiable risk factors include hypertension, exposure to cigarette smoke, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and certain other cardiac conditions, dyslipidemia, carotid artery stenosis, sickle cell disease, postmenopausal hormone therapy, poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity and body fat distribution. Less well-documented or potentially modifiable risk factors include the metabolic syndrome, excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse, use of oral contraceptives, sleep-disordered breathing, migraine, hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated lipoprotein(a), hypercoagulability, inflammation, and infection. Data on the use of aspirin for primary stroke prevention are reviewed.Conclusions: Extensive evidence identifies a variety of specific factors that increase the risk of a first stroke and that provide strategies for reducing that risk.

AB  - Background: This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a group cognitive behavioural intervention to alleviate menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) in women who have had breast cancer treatment. Hot flushes and night sweats are highly prevalent but challenging to treat in this population. Cognitive behaviour therapy has been found to reduce these symptoms in well women and results of an exploratory trial suggest that it might be effective for breast cancer patients. Two hypotheses are tested:Compared to usual care, group cognitive behavioural therapy will:1. Significantly reduce the problem rating and frequency of hot flushes and nights sweats after six weeks of treatment and at six months post-randomisation.2. Improve mood and quality of life after six weeks of treatment and at six months post-randomisation.Methods/design: Ninety-six women who have completed their main treatment for breast cancer and who have been experiencing problematic hot flushes and night sweats for over two months are recruited into the trial from oncology and breast clinics in South East London. They are randomised to either six weekly group cognitive behavioural therapy (Group CBT) sessions or to usual care. Group CBT includes information and discussion about hot flushes and night sweats in the context of breast cancer, monitoring and modifying precipitants, relaxation and paced respiration, stress management, cognitive therapy for unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, managing sleep and night sweats and maintaining changes.Prior to randomisation women attend a clinical interview, undergo 24-hour sternal skin conductance monitoring, and complete questionnaire measures of hot flushes and night sweats, mood, quality of life, hot flush beliefs and behaviours, optimism and somatic amplification. Post-treatment measures (sternal skin conductance and questionnaires) are collected six to eight weeks later and follow-up measures (questionnaires and a use of medical services measure) at six months post-randomisation.Discussion: MENOS 1 is the first randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for hot flushes and night sweats that measures both self-reported and physiologically indexed symptoms. The results will inform future clinical practice by developing an evidence-based, non-medical treatment, which can be delivered by trained health professionals.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN13771934.

AB  - Women with an inherited BRCA mutation are at significantly increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, often diagnosed at an earlier age than sporadic cancers. Prophylactic surgery, with bilateral mastectomy and/or bilateral prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy, represents an option for risk reduction. The purpose of this study was to explore quality of life, sexual functioning, menopausal symptoms, psychological well-being and satisfaction with risk management decisions for BRCA-positive women ages 21 to 50 (M = 38.4 years), without a personal history of cancer. A web-based, cross-sectional study design was utilized to compare women opting for any prophylactic surgery (n = 160) with those without a history of prophylactic surgery (n = 71). Quality of life (per the Quality of Life Index, Self-Anchoring Striving Scale and Body Image Quality of Life measures) and Psychological General Well-Being Index scores were essentially the same across the entire study sample. While controlling for age, prophylactic surgery (PS) predicted more severe symptoms of sexual dysfunction as measured by the Female Sexual Functioning Index (total score, Desire, Arousal, Lubrication and Satisfaction domains). Similarly, PS predicted menopausal symptoms and sleep difficulties. Women who had not undergone any prophylactic surgery had higher levels of Stigma and lower levels of Mastery, as measured by the BRCA Self-Concept scale. Prophylactic surgery also predicted higher levels of Satisfaction with Decision for hereditary cancer risk management. Findings from this exploratory study provide insight into the quality of life, sexual functioning and psychological well-being for unaffected, BRCA-positive women. Additional research is needed to examine sexual functioning prospectively, to further investigate the potential sequelae of risk-reducing surgery.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate how prominent gynecological factors (regular/irregular menstrual cycle, premenstrual complaints, or menopause) can influence both subjective and objective sleep data.Methods: A total of 931 women who sought clinical assistance because of a sleep complaint were included in the investigation. All subjects filled out a sleep and gynecological questionnaire prior to undergoing a polysomnography (PSG) recording.Results: Premenopausal women with an irregular menstrual cycle were more likely to report sleep difficulties (related to falling sleep and insomnia symptoms) than those with a regular cycle (odds ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.5). These women showed increased light sleep stages and awakenings. Premenstrual complaints were reported by a higher percentage of women with periodic leg movement, lower time in saturation under 90%, and higher sleep efficiency. A lower percentage of women who took hormonal contraceptives reported snoring, had fewer arousals and longer REM latency compared to those not taking hormonal contraceptives. Menopausal women with hot flushes had more restless leg complaints. Awake time was shorter in hormone therapy users compared with non-users. Women with menopause are more likely to have an apnea-hypoapnea index greater than 5/h.Conclusion: The present findings suggest that gynecological status is associated with subjective sleep quality and objective sleep parameters in women with sleep complaints.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances and fatigue are two of the most common complaints in perimenopausal women. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore sleep quality, fatigue, and related factors among perimenopausal women. Methods: A cross-sectional correlation survey was conducted. Data were collected through purposive sampling conducted from January to April 2008 at gynecological clinics and perimenopausal support groups in Taipei City. Informed consent was obtained from patients. Results: Eighty-five women with a mean age of 52.73 years were recruited. The total score for sleep quality was 7.71 ± 4.66, and 62.4% of women were identified as poor sleepers. The mean score of perimenopausal fatigue was 3.02 ± 2.41, indicating mild fatigue. Results showed that the quality of sleep among perimenopausal women was significantly affected by factors including long-term drug use, hormone and/or nutritional supplement consumption, perimenopausal status, and tendency toward anxiety and/or depression ( = 5.43, < .01; = -3.15, < .01; = -3.33, < .001; = 4.33, < .05; = 20.20 and 12.73, < .001.). Fatigue and perimenopausal disturbances were related to sleep quality ( = .63 and .61, < .01), and 43% of sleep quality variance was explained by fatigue and depression. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: It is crucial to assess sleep quality in perimenopausal women who complain of fatigue and/or depression. In addition, health providers should integrate assessments of factors of significant influence on the sleep quality of perimenopausal women (e.g., fatigue; long-term drug, hormone, and/or nutritional supplements use; menopausal status, and tendency toward anxiety and/or depression).

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Inflammation and pro-coagulation biomarkers may be a link between sleep characteristics and risk for cardiometabolic disorders. We tested the hypothesis that worse sleep characteristics would be associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, factor VIIc, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 in a multi-ethnic subsample of mid-life women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health across the Nation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: African American, Chinese, and Caucasian women (N = 340) participated in 3 days of in-home polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring and had measures of inflammation and coagulation. Regression analyses revealed that each of the biomarkers were associated with indicators of sleep disordered breathing after adjusting for age, duration between sleep study and blood draw, site, menopausal status, ethnicity, residualized body mass index, smoking status, and medications that affect sleep or biomarkers. Among African American women, those who had higher levels of CRP had shorter PSG-sleep duration and those who had higher levels of fibrinogen had less efficient sleep in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inflammation and pro-coagulation processes may be an important pathway connecting sleep disordered breathing and cardiometabolic disorders in women of these ethnic groups and that inflammation may be a particularly important pathway in African Americans.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between menopausal transition status and self-reported sleep difficulty.Methods: With the use of data on women participating in the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development who have been followed up from birth in March 1946 (n = 962), relationships between menopausal transition status and self-reported sleep difficulty were assessed annually in women between ages 48 and 54 years.Results: Menopausal transition status was related to severe self-reported sleep difficulty. The odds of reporting severe self-reported sleep difficulty were increased approximately by 2- to 3.5-fold (95% CI ranges from 1.08-3.27 to 1.99-6.04) for women in most menopausal transition statuses compared with women who remained premenopausal. After adjustment for current psychological, vasomotor, and somatic symptoms and waking frequently at night to use the toilet, only women who had a hysterectomy remained at an increased risk for moderate sleep difficulty.Conclusions: The modest relationship between menopausal transition status and moderate sleep difficulty may be related to greater variation in individual definitions of moderate difficulty. Attention to the level of sleep difficulty in this group of women will assist in the decision to address current health symptoms versus sleep itself. Women without prior health problems may experience severe self-reported sleeping difficulty during the menopausal transition and require tailored care from health professionals.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to describe changes in levels of back pain and joint pain during the stages of menopausal transition stages and early postmenopause, including the effects of age, menopausal transition-related factors (estrone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone), menopausal transition stages, symptoms (hot flush, sleep, mood, cognitive), health-related factors (body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, well-being), stress-related factors (perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, cortisol, catecholamines) and social factors (partner and parenting status, education).Methods: A subset was studied of the participants in the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study who provided data during the late reproductive, early and late menopausal transition stages or postmenopause (n = 292) including menstrual calendars for staging the menopausal transition, annual health reports completed between 1990 and 2006, and morning urine samples assayed for estrone glucuronide (E(1)G), testosterone, FSH, cortisol and catecholamines, and symptom diary ratings several times each year. Multilevel modeling with an R program was used to test patterns of pain symptoms related to age, menopausal transition-related factors, symptoms, health-related, stress-related and social factors, with as many as 6812 observations. Age was centered at 47.4 years.Results: Women experienced a slight, non-significant rise in back pain with age and a significant increase in back pain during the early (p = 0.003) and late menopausal transition stages (p = 0.002) and early postmenopause (p = 0.02), but urinary E(1)G, FSH and testosterone levels were unrelated. Of the stress-related factors, perceived stress (p = 0.01) and lower overnight urinary cortisol levels were associated with more severe back pain (p = 0.03); history of sexual abuse and catecholamines did not have a significant effect. Those most troubled by symptoms of hot flushes, depressed mood, anxiety, night-time awakening, and difficulty concentrating reported significantly greater back pain (all p < 0.0001). Of the health-related factors, having worse perceived health (p < 0.0001), exercising more (p = 0.005), using analgesics (p < 0.0001), and having a higher body mass index (p < 0.0001) were associated with more back pain, but alcohol use and smoking did not have significant effects. Of the social factors, only having a more formal education (p = 0.004) was associated with less back pain; parenting, having a partner, and employment were not significant. Factors associated with joint pain included age (p < 0.0001), but not menopausal transition-related factors. Symptoms of hot flushes, night-time awakening, depressed mood, and difficulty concentrating were each significantly associated with joint pain (p < 0.0001). Poorer perceived health, more exercise, higher body mass index, and greater analgesic use were all associated similarly with joint pain. History of sexual abuse was the only stress-related factor significantly related to joint pain severity (p = 0.024).Implications: Clinicians working with women traversing the menopausal transition should be aware that managing back and joint pain symptoms among mid-life women requires consideration of their changing biology as well as their ongoing life challenges and health-related behaviors.

AB  - Objectives: Women taking tamoxifen experience hot flashes and night sweats (HF? acupuncture may offer a nonpharmaceutical method of management. This study explored whether traditional acupuncture (TA) could reduce HF&NS frequency, improve physical and emotional well-being, and improve perceptions of HF&NS. Design/settings/location: This was a single-arm observational study using before and after measurements, located in a National Health Service cancer treatment center in southern England. Subjects: Fifty (50) participants with early breast cancer completed eight TA treatments. Eligible women were ≥35 years old, ≥6 months post active cancer treatment, taking tamoxifen ≥6 months, and self-reporting ≥4 HF&NS incidents/24 hours for ≥3 months. Interventions: Participants received weekly individualized TA treatment using a core standardized protocol for treating HF&NS in natural menopause. Outcome measures: Hot Flash Diaries recorded HF&NS frequency over 14-day periods; the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) assessed physical and emotional well-being; the Hot Flashes and Night Sweats Questionnaire (HFNSQ) assessed HF&NS as a problem. Measurements taken at five points over 30 weeks included baseline, midtreatment, end of treatment (EOT), and 4 and 18 weeks after EOT. Results for the primary outcome: Mean frequency reduced by 49.8% (95% confidence interval 40.5-56.5, p < 0.0001, n = 48) at EOT over baseline. Trends indicated longer-term effects at 4 and 18 weeks after EOT. At EOT, seven WHQ domains showed significant statistical and clinical improvements, including Anxiety/Fears, Memory/Concentration, Menstrual Problems, Sexual Behavior, Sleep Problems, Somatic Symptoms, and Vasomotor Symptoms. Perceptions of HF&NS as a problem reduced by 2.2 points (standard deviation = 2.15, n = 48, t = 7.16, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: These results compare favorably with other studies using acupuncture to manage HF&NS, as well as research on nonhormonal pharmaceutical treatments. In addition to reduced HF&NS frequency, women enjoyed improved physical and emotional well-being, and few side-effects were reported. Further research is warranted into this approach, which offers breast cancer survivors choice in managing a chronic condition.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in a sample comprising women of mostly Hispanic descent and low socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: Demographic data and symptoms related to sexuality were analyzed from 102 women who consecutively came to the Women's Life Center at Hartford Hospital (2004-2008). FSD was defined as decreased sexual desire, dyspareunia, or vaginal dryness; depression as one positive response to a validated three-question screening instrument; and anxiety as a positive response to whether the patient experiences anxiety sometimes or often. Results: The cohort was 52.9 ± 6.8 years of age (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) and 80.0% Hispanic, and 47.8% were unemployed. The majority (92.8%) earned <$25,000, and most (95.8%) did not have a college degree. The prevalence of FSD was 75.6%. The prevalence of depression was 80.9% vs. 52.8% ( p = 0.01) and that of anxiety was 76.6% vs. 45.7% ( p = 0.01) among women with vs. without a decrease in sexual desire. The prevalence of depression was 83.3% vs. 55.9% ( p = 0.03) and that of anxiety was 76.7% vs. 52.9% ( p = 0.07) among women who reported dyspareunia vs. those who did not. Problems sleeping was the only variable associated with a statistically higher likelihood of FSD (odds ratio [OR] 5.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-25.33, p = 0.03). No significant differences were seen when comparing FSD between Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Conclusions: This sample of predominantly Hispanic women of low SES had a high prevalence of FSD. These data also suggest that poor sleep is significantly associated with FSD and that women of low SES with FSD may have a significantly higher prevalence of depression and anxiety.

AB  - Background It is hypothesised that sleep duration affects the production of melatonin and subsequently influences cancer risk. The relationship between sleep duration and risk of breast cancer has been investigated recently but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent and have not been summarised quantitatively. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of observational studies of the association between sleep duration and breast cancer. Methods Relevant publications were identified from reviews and computer-aided searches using PubMed, with keywords “sleep duration”, “breast cancer”, “survival rate”, “mortality”, “morbidity”, “incidence” and “risk”, up to July 23rd, 2009. RR estimates and 95% CIs were extracted for the comparison between the highest exposure group, women who slept ≥ 9 hours, and the reference group that comprised women who had a moderate sleep duration (7 or 8 hours). Summary RRs were estimated by calculating the average of the log RRs, weighted by the inverse variances of the log RRs. Results Five studies, four with prospective data and one case-control study, were identified on the risk of breast cancer in relation to sleep duration. The published data include 9166 women with incident invasive breast cancer and 147 344 women without breast cancer. When results from these studies were combined, the aggregate RR was 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to −1.07) for women with the longest sleep duration compared to those in the reference group with a shorter sleep duration. When analysis was restricted to prospective data, the aggregate RR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). There was no evidence for significant heterogeneity in this association by menopausal status. Conclusion Meta-analysis of the published epidemiological data provides no strong evidence for a relationship between sleep duration and risk of breast cancer.

AB  - Background.--Many migraineurs report attack 'triggers,' but relatively few published data exist regarding the relative prevalences of individual triggers, variations related to gender, duration of migraine or migraine subtype, or the existence of any regional variations in the prevalences and distributions of triggers.Objective.--We sought to determine the prevalence and types of migraine triggers in our clinic population, to determine what influence gender, migraine subtype, or duration of migraine might have on the prevalences and types of triggers reported and to compare our findings with data derived from surveys we previously had conducted involving 2 clinic-based populations and 1 general population sample from other regions of the USA.Methods.--We evaluated 200 consecutive new migraine patients referred to our clinic. All patients specifically were queried as to whether they had noted any of 7 specific factors to serve consistently as migraine attack triggers and additionally were surveyed as to whether they might have 'other' triggers not listed on the intake questionnaire. Among the other data collected and analyzed were age, gender, age at time of migraine onset, and migraine subtype (ie, episodic vs chronic). Actively cycling females who reported menses as a trigger were questioned as to whether their menstrual migraine (MM) attacks differed from their non-menstrual migraines and, if so, how they differed.Results.--One hundred and eighty-two patients (91%) reported at least 1 migraine trigger, and 165 (82.5%) reported multiple triggers. The most common trigger reported (59%) was 'emotional stress,' followed by 'too much or little sleep' (53.5%), 'odors' (46.5%), and 'missing meals' (39%). Females or subjects of either gender with chronic migraine were no more likely than males or subjects with episodic migraine to report triggers or multiple triggers. Similarly, longer exposure to migraine did not correlate with a higher likelihood of reporting a trigger or multiple triggers. Fifty-three (62%) of 85 actively cycling females reported menses as a trigger, and of the 51 with menstrually related migraine, 34 (67%) reported their MM to be more severe, more refractory to symptomatic therapy or of longer duration than their non-menstrual attacks; 13 (24.5%) of the 53 women with apparent MM reported their MM to be at least occasionally manifested as status migrainosus. The prevalence and type of triggers reported by this predominantly white female population were similar to those reported by clinic-based populations in San Diego, California and Mobile, Alabama, and in a population-based sample of Hispanics in San Diego County.Conclusions.--A large majority of migraineurs report migraine attack triggers, and the triggers most commonly reported include emotional stress, a disrupted sleep pattern, and various odors. These findings do not appear to vary according to geographic region or race/ethnicity. Among the triggers, MM appears inclined to provoke headache that is more severe, less amenable to treatment, or longer in duration than headaches that occur at other times during the cycle.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of thyroid autoantibodies in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to investigate the relationship of these antibodies with depression, quality of life, and disease symptoms. Materials and Methods: Sixty-five patients with FM, 39 patients with RA, and 40 healthy controls were included in the study. Serumfree thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, thyrotropin, and anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) were measured by immunometric assay. Sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol use, smoking status, morning stiffness, number of joints affected by pain, and presence of accompanying symptoms were recorded. All patients were questioned about the severity of pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and morning fatigue. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used to evaluate the quality of life and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to evaluate the presence of depression. Results: The rates of TPOAb and TgAb positivity were 13.8% and 15.4%, 2.6% and 5.1%, and 5.0% and 5.0% in the FM, RA, and control groups, respectively; there was no significant difference between the groups. Thyroid autoimmunity was noted in 18.5%, 5.1%, and 7.5% of the patients in the FM, RA, and control groups, respectively; there was no significant difference between these groups. There were significant differences between the groups with respect to widespread pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and morning fatigue evaluated by VAS and the mean FIQ and BDI scores; the highest values were noted in the FM group. Significantly higher ESR, CRP and TSH levels, and proportion of postmenopausal women were noted in FM patients with thyroid autoimmunity compared to FM patients without thyroid autoimmunity. No significant difference existed between RA patients with or without thyroid autoimmunity. Conclusion: No significant differences existed between FM patients, RA patients, and healthy controls in terms of thyroid autoimmunity. We suggest that there is no association between thyroid autoimmunity and quality of life, severity and frequency of accompanying symptoms, and presence of depression in patients with FM and RA.

AB  - The menopause is seen as a highly variable adjustment phase where for some women difficult symptoms can significantly impact on quality of life and in breast cancer that adjustment phase can be intensified and prolonged by anti-oestrogen medication. Homeopathy, defined as one of the many complementary and alternative medicines which women use to manage this transition, has been delivered within the National Health Service since its inception and has been used to alleviate menopausal symptoms both in the climacteric and more recently in breast cancer survivors. Individualized treatment by a homeopath, regarded as the gold standard of homeopathic care, is a complex intervention where the homeopathic medicine is matched to a woman presenting with a range of symptoms such as hot flushes, sleep and mood disturbance, joint pains and fatigue. These symptoms are thought to represent a whole system disturbance and the homeopathic medicine chosen reflects this disturbance. This article describes the delivery of homeopathic care within the UK, as part of an integrated approach to difficult symptoms, basic science that might offer a potential model of action, and reviews available data from observational studies and randomised trials in this clinical setting.

AB  - itle. Sleep quality and quality of life in female shift-working nurses. Aim. This paper is a report of a study of the factors that influence sleep quality and quality of life among shift-working nurses and the relationship between their sleep quality and quality of life. Background. Although shift-working nurses strive to adapt their life schedules to shift rotations, they tend to suffer from severe sleep disturbances and increased rates of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, digestive disease and irregular menstrual cycles. Poor sleep is also associated with medical errors and occupational injuries. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 with a convenience sample of 435 female nurses from five regional hospitals in Taiwan. Data were collected on sleep quality and quality of life using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-BREF Taiwan version respectively. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, analysis of variance and Pearson correlations. Findings. The majority of female shift workers (57%) had global sleep-quality scores ≥5, indicating poor sleep and all mean scores in four domains of the quality-of-life measure were statistically significantly lower than those of females in Taiwan’s general population. Scores for poor sleep quality and quality of life were related to premenstrual dysphoria, occupational injury, illness and medication use. In addition, the associations between scores on the sleep-quality and quality-of-life scales were statistically significantly inversely correlated. Conclusion. Advice should be included in both undergraduate programmes and continuing education to help nurses to recognize and improve their own sleep quality and life quality managers should create a supportive environment to encourage shift-working nurses to engage in healthy behaviours.

AB  - This summary addresses the progress and limitations of existing research on the physiologic properties of the isoflavone daidzein metabolite equol. Previous research demonstrating that physiological equol is its S-enantiomer has led to the preparation of S-(-)equol-enriched products formed by the bacterial fermentation of soy germ. Although this product has interesting properties as described in this workshop, the following important issues must be addressed: 1) the product should be evaluated against a preparation containing an equal amount of pure S-(-)equol to determine whether other components resulting from the fermentation are contributing to the physiological effects; 2) evaluation of the cellular mechanisms of S-(-)equol using cell culture methods should be conducted at concentrations consistent with those encountered physiologically (in the nmol/L range) and in several cell lines representing a target tissue; and 3) in follow-up studies in animal models and in human clinical trials, standardized preparations of S-(-)equol should be made available. Research opportunities now exist to determine whether equol's apparent effects on menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, sleep disturbances, bone health) in equol producers can be extended to equol nonproducers. It will be important to ensure that such research is not complicated by cultural differences, differences in lifetime exposure to soy products, experimental techniques, and other variables. Further areas of research that would benefit from the availability of S-(-)equol preparations include its use in skin care (either as an antioxidant or as an estrogen receptor agonist) and in the treatment of brain injury as well as postmenopausal cognitive decline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to describe a unique model of multidisciplinary care for women with menopausal symptoms after breast cancer and present preliminary data for 653 women. METHODS:: The nature and severity of menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer were measured using a standardized scale. RESULTS:: A total of 578 women with breast cancer were managed at the Menopausal Symptoms After Cancer Clinic between January 2003 and December 2008. The most common reasons for these women to seek treatment were hot flushes (41%), night sweats (36%), loss of interest in sex (30%), difficulty sleeping (25%), and fatigue (22%). Extreme vaginal dryness was also reported in 19% of these women. Chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure was reported by 29% of the breast cancer patients seen. A range of management approaches were offered, with 55% of the women prescribed nonhormonal pharmacological therapies for vasomotor symptoms, including vitamin E 400 IU twice daily (21%), venlafaxine 75 mg CR once daily (13%), clonidine 50 mug twice daily (11%), or gabapentin 300 mg three times daily (4%). CONCLUSIONS:: Vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbance are the most distressing menopausal symptoms requiring management after breast cancer. Menopausal symptom management after breast cancer may be complex, and we present a novel model of care using a multidisciplinary approach. Additional benefits of this multidisciplinary approach include education opportunities, improved communication and networking opportunities, and decision making in line with evidence-based guidelines.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:: The aims of this study were to identify the risk of depression in the transition to menopause in women with and without a history of depression and to consider that the changing hormonal milieu is one of multiple risk factors for perimenopausal depression. METHOD:: A review of epidemiologic studies of depressed mood in the menopausal transition since the State-of-Science Report of the National Institutes of Health in 2005 was conducted. RESULTS:: Recent longitudinal cohort studies indicate that the likelihood of depressed mood in the menopausal transition is approximately 30% to three times greater compared with that during premenopause. Women with a history of depression are nearly five times more likely to have a diagnosis of major depression in the menopausal transition, whereas women with no history of depression are two to four times more likely to report depressed mood compared with premenopausal women. In some studies, the changing hormonal milieu is significantlyassociated with depressive symptoms in the menopausal transition. Other risk factors for depressed mood in perimenopausal women include poor sleep, hot flashes, stressful or negative life events, employment status, age, and race. CONCLUSIONS:: The findings support the concept that the menopausal transition is a 'window of vulnerability' for some women and is framed by the changing hormonal milieu of ovarian aging.

AB  - A long-standing, but unproven hypothesis is that menopause symptoms cause cognitive difficulties during the menopause transition. This 6-year longitudinal cohort study of 1,903 midlife US women (2000-2006) asked whether symptoms negatively affect cognitive performance during the menopause transition and whether they are responsible for the negative effect of perimenopause on cognitive processing speed. Major exposures were depressive, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and menopause transition stages. Outcomes were longitudinal performance in 3 domains: processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)), verbal memory (East Boston Memory Test), and working memory (Digit Span Backward). Adjustment for demographics showed that women with concurrent depressive symptoms scored 1 point lower on the SDMT (P < 0.05). On the East Boston Memory Test, the rate of learning among women with anxiety symptoms tested previously was 0.09 smaller per occasion (P = 0.03), 53% of the mean learning rate. The SDMT learning rate was 1.00 point smaller during late perimenopause than during premenopause (P = 0.04); further adjustment for symptoms did not attenuate this negative effect. Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a small, negative effect on processing speed. The authors found that depressive, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms did not account for the transient decrement in SDMT learning observed during late perimenopause.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the peer-reviewed literature regarding the effects of self-administered mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms.Methods: To identify qualifying studies, we searched 10 scientific databases and scanned bibliographies of relevant review papers and all identified articles. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed systematically using predefined criteria.Results: Twenty-one papers representing 18 clinical trials from 6 countries met our inclusion criteria, including 12 randomized controlled trials (N=719), 1 non-randomized controlled trial (N=58), and 5 uncontrolled trials (N=105). Interventions included yoga and/or meditation-based programs, tai chi, and other relaxation practices, including muscle relaxation and breath-based techniques, relaxation response training, and low-frequency sound-wave therapy. Eight of the nine studies of yoga, tai chi, and meditation-based programs reported improvement in overall menopausal and vasomotor symptoms; six of seven trials indicated improvement in mood and sleep with yoga-based programs, and four studies reported reduced musculoskeletal pain. Results from the remaining nine trials suggest that breath-based and other relaxation therapies also show promise for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms, although intergroup findings were mixed. Most studies reviewed suffered methodological or other limitations, complicating interpretation of findings.Conclusions: Collectively, findings of these studies suggest that yoga-based and certain other mind-body therapies may be beneficial for alleviating specific menopausal symptoms. However, the limitations characterizing most studies hinder interpretation of findings and preclude firm conclusions regarding efficacy. Additional large, methodologically sound trials are needed to determine the effects of specific mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms, examine long-term outcomes, and investigate underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Women are at a higher risk than men of developing depression and anxiety and such increased risk might be particularly associated with reproductive cycle events. Recent evidence suggests that the transition to menopause may constitute a window of vulnerability for some women for the development of new onset and recurrent depression. Several biological and environmental factors seem to be independent predictors or modulating factors for the occurrence of depression in menopausal women; they include the presence and severity of hot flushes, sleep disturbances, history of severe premenstrual syndrome or postpartum blues, stressful life events, history of depression, socioeconomic status, and use of hormones and psychotropic agents. The regulation of monoaminergic systems by ovarian hormones might explain, at least in part, the emergence of depressive symptoms and/or anxiety in biologically predisposed subpopulations. The use of transdermal estradiol, as well as serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants, is an efficacious strategy in the treatment of depression and vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic women in midlife. In this review, the authors discuss the existing evidence of a greater risk for the development of depression during the menopausal transition and the putative underlying mechanisms contributing to this window of vulnerability. Hormonal and nonhormonal treatment strategies for depression and anxiety in this particular population are critically examined, although more tailored treatment options are still needed.Copyright © 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity. Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts, and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment.Copyright © 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: There are conflicting results for the association between obstructive sleep apnoea and raised C reactive protein (CRP) levels. A study was undertaken to investigate whether nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, a surrogate marker for obstructive sleep apnoea, was associated with CRP levels among a community-dwelling Japanese population. Methods: Among participants in the Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS), 1422 male and 2466 female community residents aged 40-69 years were tested during sleep. No nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, mild nocturnal intermittent hypoxia and moderate to severe nocturnal intermittent hypoxia were defined using 3% oxygen desaturation index cut-off points at 5 and 15 events/h, respectively. High-sensitivity CRP levels were measured using a latex particle-enhanced immunonephelometric assay. Multivariate analysis was adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, current alcohol intake, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus and menopausal status for women. Results: Multivariable-adjusted mean CRP levels among men were 0.70 mg/l (95% CI 0.65 to 0.75) for no nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, 0.82 mg/l (95% CI 0.74 to 0.89) for mild nocturnal intermittent hypoxia and 0.84 mg/l (95% CI 0.70 to 1.00) for moderate to severe nocturnal intermittent hypoxia (p for trend=0.03). The values for women were 0.59 mg/l (95% CI 0.57 to 0.62), 0.66 mg/l (95% CI 0.59 to 0.73) and 0.82 mg/l (95% CI 0.62 to 1.03), respectively (p for trend=0.008). Compared with no nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, the prevalence of a high CRP level (>or=1.0 mg/l) was 1.4-1.7-fold higher for mild to severe nocturnal intermittent hypoxia in both sexes. Conclusions: Nocturnal intermittent hypoxia is associated with raised serum CRP levels among middle-aged Japanese subjects.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence indicates that reduced sleep duration may be associated with an increased risk of hypertension with possibly stronger effects among women than men. We therefore examined cross-sectional sex-specific associations of sleep duration with hypertension in a large population-based sample from the Western New York Health Study (1996<2001). METHODS: Participants were 3027 white men (43.5%) and women (56.5%) without prevalent cardiovascular disease (median age 56 years). Hypertension was defined as blood pressure at least 140 or at least 90&mmHg or regular use of antihypertensive medication. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of hypertension comparing less than 6&h of sleep per night versus the reference category (&6&h) while accounting for a number of potential confounders. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, less than 6&h of sleep was associated with a significant increased risk of hypertension compared to sleeping at least 6&h per night, only among women [OR&=&1.66 (1.09 to 2.53)]. No significant association was found among men [OR&=&0.93 (0.62 to 1.41)].In subgroup analyses by menopausal status, the effect was stronger among premenopausal women [OR&=&3.25 (1.37 to 7.76)] than among postmenopausal women [OR&=&1.49 (0.92 to 2.41)]. CONCLUSION: Reduced sleep duration, by increasing the risk of hypertension, may produce detrimental cardiovascular effects among women. The association is independent of socioeconomic status, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and psychiatric comorbidities, and is stronger among premenopausal women. Prospective and mechanistic evidence is necessary to support causality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aerobic exercise is known to improve health-related quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a 16-week walking program on eating behaviors and QoL between late premenopausal and early postmenopausal obese and sedentary women, once chronological aging is taken into account. METHODS: Sixteen women 49 +/- 2 years old and 14 women 53 +/- 2 years old, whose body mass index ranged between 29 and 35 kg/m, were subjected to three sessions per week of 45-minute walking at 60% of their heart rate reserve. Fat mass and lean mass (bioelectrical impedance), cardiorespiratory fitness estimated by maximum oxygen consumption (2-km walking test), eating behaviors (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire), and QoL, estimated by the Short Form-36 Health Survey, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Perceived Stress Scale-10 questionnaires, were recorded before and after exercise. RESULTS: With the exception of a higher attitude of self-regulation in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women (P = 0.05), no between-group differences were observed in body composition, eating behaviors, and QoL at baseline. In all participants, body weight and fat mass decreased, whereas cardiorespiratory fitness increased after walking (0.001 < P < 0.0001). Situational susceptibility was the only eating behavior reduced after training in all women (P = 0.02). Neither the sleep quality index nor the perceived stress score changed in response to endurance exercise. Finally, in all women, Short Form-36 physical and mental scores increased after walking (0.001 < P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest body weight and fat mass losses, a 16-week walking program seems to be sufficient to improve physical and mental well-being, irrespective of menopause status.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Women experience insomnia more frequently than men. Menstrual cycle changes in reproductive hormones and circadian rhythms may contribute to sleep disruptions. Our aim, therefore, was to clarify the interaction between menstrual and circadian processes as it affects sleep. DESIGN: Participants entered the laboratory during the mid-follicular (MF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle for an ultra-rapid sleep-wake cycle (URSW) procedure, consisting of 36 cycles of 60-min wake episodes alternating with 60-min nap opportunities. This procedure concluded with an ad libitum nap episode. SETTING: Time-isolation suite. PARTICIPANTS: Eight unmedicated, physically and mentally healthy females with regular ovulatory menstrual cycles. INTERVENTIONS: N/A MEASUREMENTS: Polysomnographic sleep from nocturnal sleep episodes and 60-min naps; subjective alertness; core body temperature (CBT); salivary melatonin; urinary estradiol; and urinary progesterone. RESULTS: Increased CBT values at night and decreased CBT amplitude were observed during ML compared to MF. Circadian phase of CBT and the circadian melatonin profile were unaffected by menstrual phase. All analyzed sleep parameters showed a circadian variation throughout the URSW procedure, with no menstrual phase differences observed for most, including slow wave sleep (SWS). The circadian variation of REM sleep duration, however, was sensitive to menstrual phase, with reduced REM sleep during ML at circadian phase 0 degrees and 30 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate but significant changes in REM sleep across the menstrual and circadian cycles were observed. These results support an interaction between circadian and menstrual processes in the regulation of REM sleep.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Describe the severity of getting to sleep, nighttime awakening, and early morning awakening across the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopause (PM) and their relationship to age, menopausal transition factors, symptoms, stress-related factors, and health related factors. DESIGN: Cohort. SETTING: community. PARTICIPANTS: 286 women from the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study cohort. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed annual menstrual calendars for MT staging, diaries in which they rated their symptoms, stress levels, and perceived health multiple times per year from 1990-2007 and provided first morning urine samples assayed for E1G, FSH, cortisol, and catecholamines. Multilevel modeling (R program) was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Severity of self-reported problems going to sleep was associated with all symptoms, perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, perceived health (-), alcohol use (-) (all P < 0.001), and lower cortisol (P = 0.009), but not E1G or FSH. Severity of nighttime awakening was significantly associated with age, late MT stage, and early PM, FSH, E1G (-), hot flashes, depressed mood, anxiety, joint pain, backache, perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, perceived health (-), and alcohol use (-) (all P < 0.001, except E1G for which P = 0.030). Severity of early morning awakening was significantly associated with age, hot flashes, depressed mood anxiety, joint pain, backache, perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, perceived health (-) (all P < or = 0.001, except E1G for which P = 0.02 and epinephrine (P = 0.038), but not MT stages or FSH. Multivariate models for each symptom included hot flashes, depressed mood, and perceived health. CONCLUSION: Sleep symptoms during the MT may be amenable to symptom management strategies that take into account the symptom clusters and promote women's general health rather than focusing only on the MT.

AB  - Objective: Migraine is a recurrent primary headache disorder characterized by different clinical presentations. Migraneurs report excessive sensitivity to light, sound, motion, odours, and other sensory stimuli in and between acute migraine attacks. This study was undertaken to document different trigger factors and to evaluate the differences in episodic and chronic migraine forms. Headache trigger factors were questioned in 190 patients. Methods: Headache triggering factors were questioned in 190 patients. A set of questions concerning the trigger factors were prepared and the information about the triggering factors was collected by a structured interview. All the patients were administered Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All analyses in this study were performed by NCSS 2007 packet programme. Results: The trigger factors reported in this study were stressor factors, noise, sleep disturbances, fatigue, hunger, physical effort, light, sun, cold, factors affecting scalp, traveling by motor vehicle, eye strain, crowd , odours, crying, weather, high blood pressure, cigarette smoke and menstruation respectively. Conclusion: The prophylactic treatment of migraine decreases the frequency of headaches by affecting various factors. Understanding the link between the trigger factors and headache may yield novel preventative and therapeutic approaches in the management of headache.

AB  - While human infants can display distinctive behavioural and physiological spinal cord and brainstem responses to noxious stimulation, it is not known whether cortical neurons are specifically activated by noxious stimuli in newborns. Here, using a novel approach to time-lock an EEG recording to a clinically required heel lance, we show the presence of a distinct nociceptive-specific potential in newborn infants (35-39 weeks postmenstrual age). The potential can be observed in single trials in the central electrodes (Cz and CPz) and using principal component analysis is characterised by a positivity that occurs at approximately 560 ms post-stimulus (N420-P560; P, positive; N, negative). The magnitude of the nociceptive-specific potential is not dependent on sleep state, whereas an earlier potential (N150-P260-N430), which is sleep-state dependent, is evoked by both noxious and non-noxious stimulation. These results provide the first direct evidence of specific noxious-evoked neural activity in the infant brain and suggest that newborn infants are capable of the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain experience.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The previously published Acupuncture on Hot Flashes Among Menopausal Women study compared the effectiveness of individualized acupuncture treatment plus self-care versus self-care alone on hot flashes and health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women. This article reports on the observational follow-up results at 6 and 12 months. METHODS: The Acupuncture on Hot Flashes Among Menopausal Women study was a pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms, conducted in 2006 to 2007. The 267 participants were postmenopausal women experiencing, on average, 12.6 hot flashes per 24 h. The acupuncture group received 10 individualized acupuncture treatments during 12 weeks and advice on self-care, whereas the control group received only advice on self-care. Hot flash frequency and intensity (0-10 scale) and hours of sleep per night were registered in a diary. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Women's Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: From baseline to 6 months, the mean reduction in hot flash frequency per 24 hours was 5.3 in the acupuncture group and 5.0 in the control group, a nonsignificant difference of 0.3. At 12 months, the mean reduction in hot flash frequency was 6.0 in the acupuncture group and 5.8 in the control group, a nonsignificant difference of 0.2. Differences in quality-of-life scores were not statistically significant at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: The statistically significant differences between the study groups found at 12 weeks were no longer present at 6 and 12 months. Acupuncture can contribute to a more rapid reduction in vasomotor symptoms and increase in health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women but probably has no long-term effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the involvement of peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity in the ventilatory pattern during sleep in preterm neonates exposed in utero to maternal smoking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral chemoreceptor activity was measured at thermoneutrality in neonates (postmenstrual age: 36.1 +/- 1.2 weeks) born to nonsmoking (n = 21) or smoking (n = 16) mothers by performing a 30-second hyperoxic test during active and quiet sleep. Blood oxygen saturation, baseline ventilatory parameters, and central apnea were monitored. RESULTS: Prenatal smoking exposure did not modify baseline ventilation. It was interesting to note that prenatal smoking exposure decreased the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity during active sleep and increased the response time during quiet sleep. These changes could explain the increase in the time spent in apnea (both with and without blood oxygen desaturation) and in the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation found in neonates exposed to smoking in utero. The involvement of a change in the chemoreceptor function is supported by the fact that the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity was negatively correlated with the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation in the control group only. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that prenatal smoking exposure does not directly modify baseline ventilatory parameters in the neonate but has a negative impact on peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity. These alterations may increase the risk of sleep respiratory disorders, especially via apnea with desaturation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Menopause-associated insomnia is commonly associated with other symptoms (hot flashes, depression, anxiety). Given frequent symptom cooccurrence, therapies targeting sleep may provide an important approach to treatment during midlife. STUDY DESIGN: Peri/postmenopausal women (40-65 years old) with sleep-onset and/or sleep-maintenance insomnia cooccurring with hot flashes and depressive and/or anxiety symptoms were randomized to eszopiclone 3 mg orally or placebo in a double-blinded, crossover 11 week trial. Changes in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale and secondary outcomes (diary-based sleep parameters, depression/anxiety, hot flashes, quality of life) were analyzed using repeated-measure linear models. RESULTS: Of 59 women, 46 (78%) completed the study. Eszopiclone reduced ISI scores by 8.7 + or - 1.4 more points than placebo (P < .0001). Eszopiclone improved (P < .05) all sleep parameters, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and nighttime but not daytime hot flashes. CONCLUSION: Eszopiclone treats insomnia and cooccurring menopause-related symptoms. Our results provide evidence that hypnotic therapies may improve multiple domains of well-being during midlife.

AB  - Aims: To describe levels of sexual desire across the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopause (PM), including effects of age, MT-related factors, health, stress, symptoms (hot flash, sleep, mood), and social opportunity factors. Methods: A subset of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study (SMWHS) participants who provided data during the early reproductive, early and late menopausal transition stages, or postmenopause ( n = 286), including menstrual calendars for staging the MT, annual health reports between 1990 and 2005, and morning urine samples assayed for estrone glucuronide (E1G), testosterone (T), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was included. Multilevel modeling using the R program was used to test factors related to sexual desire. Results: Women experienced a significant decrease in sexual desire during the late MT stage ( p < 0.01) and early PM ( p < 0.0001). Those with higher urinary E1G and T reported significantly higher levels of sexual desire, whereas those with higher FSH levels reported significantly lower sexual desire ( p < 0.0001, 0.06, and 0.0002, respectively). Women using hormone therapy also reported higher sexual desire ( p = 0.02). Those reporting higher perceived stress reported lower sexual desire ( p < 0.0001), but history of sexual abuse did not have a significant effect. Those most troubled by symptoms of hot flashes, fatigue, depressed mood, anxiety, difficulty getting to sleep, early morning awakening, and awakening during the night also reported significantly lower sexual desire ( p range from <0.03 to 0.0001), but there was no effect of vaginal dryness. Women with better perceived health reported higher sexual desire ( p < 0.0001), and those reporting more exercise and more alcohol intake also reported greater sexual desire ( p < 0.0001). Having a partner was associated with lower sexual desire. Conclusions: Clinicians working with women traversing the MT should be aware that promoting healthy sexual functioning among midlife women requires consideration of their changing biology as well as ongoing life challenges.

AB  - Objective: To describe which dietary nutrient variables are related to subjective and objective habitual sleep and subjective and objective napping.Methods: Participants were 459 post-menopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative. Objective sleep was estimated using one week of actigraphy. Subjective sleep was prospectively estimated with a daily sleep diary. Dietary nutrients were calculated from food frequency questionnaires.Results: The most significant correlations were with subjective napping, including (from strongest to weakest): total fat, calories, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, trans fat, water, proline, serine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, valine, cholesterol, leucine, glutamic acid, ash, isoleucine, histidine, sodium, tryptophan, protein, threonine, cystine, methionine, phosphorous, polyunsaturated fat, animal protein, aspartic acid, arginine, lysine, alanine, caffeine, riboflavin, gamma-tocopherol, glycine, retinol, delta-tocopherol, Vitamin D, and selenium. Actigraphic nocturnal sleep duration was negatively associated with total fat, monounsaturated fat, trans fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, calories, gamma-tocopherol, cholesterol, and alpha-tocopherol-eq.Conclusions: Actigraphic total sleep time was negatively associated with intake of fats. Subjective napping, which may be a proxy for subjective sleepiness, was significantly related to fat intake as well as intake of meat.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance and insomnia are commonly reported by postmenopausal women. However, the relationship between hormone therapy (HT) and sleep disturbances in postmenopausal community-dwelling adults is understudied. Using data from the multicenter Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), we tested the relationship between HT and sleep-wake estimated from actigraphy.Methods: Sleep-wake was ascertained by wrist actigraphy in 3,123 women aged 84 +/- 4 years (range 77-99) from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). This sample represents 30% of the original SOF study and 64% of participants seen at this visit. Data were collected for a mean of 4 consecutive 24-hour periods. Sleep parameters measured objectively included total sleep time, sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and nap time. All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders (age, clinic site, race, BMI, cognitive function, physical activity, depression, anxiety, education, marital status, age at menopause, alcohol use, prior hysterectomy, and medical conditions).Results: Actigraphy measurements were available for 424 current, 1,289 past, and 1,410 never users of HT. Women currently using HT had a shorter WASO time (76 vs. 82 minutes, P = 0.03) and fewer long-wake (> or = 5 minutes) episodes (6.5 vs. 7.1, P = 0.004) than never users. Past HT users had longer total sleep time than never users (413 vs. 403 minutes, P = 0.002). Women who never used HT had elevated odds of SE <70% (OR,1.37;95%CI,0.98-1.92) and significantly higher odds of WASO > or = 90 minutes (OR,1.37;95%CI,1.02-1.83) and > or = 8 long-wake episodes (OR,1.58;95%CI,1.18-2.12) when compared to current HT users.Conclusions: Postmenopausal women currently using HT had improved sleep quality for two out of five objective measures: shorter WASO and fewer long-wake episodes. The mechanism behind these associations is not clear. For postmenopausal women, starting HT use should be considered carefully in balance with other risks since the vascular side-effects of hormone replacement may exceed its beneficial effects on sleep.

AB  - Childhood obesity is a public health crisis that continues to grow in size and whose impact threatens the future well-being of today's children. The causes are complex and multi-factorial; and the consequences are both chronic and serious in nature. Insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndromes, fatty liver disease, menstrual abnormalities, gallstones, sleep apnea, poor body image, low self esteem, and discrimination are all potential consequences of childhood obesity. Research indicates that school-based interventions have the potential to be effective in reducing body mass index and childhood obesity. Increasing physical activity opportunities, requiring nutritional education for all students, altering the environment to encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors, and creating a school wellness council have all shown to be effective in decreasing childhood obesity, although to varying degrees. This paper proposes an evidence-based guideline for the management of childhood obesity in schools, based on the available literature. However, some findings are inconsistent and some of the interventions are expensive to implement. Further research is suggested in an effort to further refine these guidelines.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify the burden associated with chronic sleep maintenance insomnia characterized by nighttime awakenings (CINA) among women with menopausal symptoms.Methods: Data were obtained from the 2006 US National Health and Wellness Survey, an annual cross-sectional study of US adults 18 years or older. Analyses were limited to female respondents currently experiencing symptoms of menopause. The definition of CINA was experiencing nighttime awakenings at least twice per week for more than 1 month that have moderate to severe impact on daily life and not experiencing difficulty falling asleep. No insomnia was defined as not self-reporting insomnia, sleep difficulties, or sleep symptoms. Outcomes included resource utilization in the past 6 months, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8). Linear regression models were developed to assess the independent associations of CINA on outcomes, while adjusting for demographics and comorbidity.Results: Among women with menopausal symptoms, 141 met the criteria for CINA and 1,305 met the criteria for no insomnia. Adjusting for demographics and comorbidity, those experiencing CINA had 0.1 (P = 0.041) more emergency department visits, 20.8% (P < 0.001) greater activity impairment, and SF-8 physical and mental summary scores that were 4.7 (P < 0.001) and 5.4 (P < 0.001) points, respectively, lower than those of women who are not experiencing insomnia. Among women with menopausal symptoms employed full-time, those experiencing CINA had greater impairment while working (presenteeism; 17.3%, P < 0.001) and overall (16.1%, P < 0.001) than did those who are not experiencing insomnia.Conclusions: Among women with menopausal symptoms, CINA in relative isolation was associated with a significant negative impact on healthcare utilization and its associated costs, health-related quality of life, and work productivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among daily reports of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and/or sweats), same-day sleep problems, and next-day mood reports in middle-aged women. METHODS: Fifty-five healthy middle-aged women were recruited to keep daily records for up to 5 years or until menopause. For each participant, the first 252 days of contiguous data with the highest weekly frequency of vasomotor symptoms was selected for the current analyses. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to test whether changes in daily vasomotor symptom occurrence predicted changes in occurrence of same-day sleep problems and changes in next-day positive and negative mood ratings and whether sleep problems mediated any predictive effect of symptoms on next-day mood. RESULTS: Controlling for initial depression, daily vasomotor symptoms predicted same-day sleep problems (b = 0.59, P < 0.001) and next-day positive mood (b = -0.07, P < 0.01), although significant direct relationships between vasomotor symptoms and mood were found primarily in women with initial depression scores in the low to moderate range. Sleep problems predicted next-day positive (b = -0.08, P < 0.01) and negative (b = 0.10, P < 0.001) mood more robustly than vasomotor symptoms did. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep problems predicted worse mood on the following day and accounted for only a small portion of the relationship between vasomotor symptoms and mood. These findings suggest that any effect of vasomotor symptoms on mood may occur largely through a mechanism other than sleep disruption.

AB  - Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction, usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors.

AB  - Change in facial expression over a fixed time after a noxious stimulus is the key measure used to calculate pain scores in preterm and newborn infants. We hypothesised that the latency of facial motor responses would be longer in the youngest premature infants and that behavioural scoring methods of pain may need to take this into account. One hundred and seventy-two clinically required heel lances were performed in 95 infants from 25 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Sixty-four percentage of the heel lances evoked a change in facial expression. Change in facial expression was observed in infants across the whole age range from 25 weeks PMA and the latency to the facial expression response ranged from 1 to 17s. Latency to facial expression change was dependent on the infants' PMA at the time of the heel lance. Infants below 32 weeks PMA had a significantly longer latency to change in facial expression than older infants (54% increase in infants below 32 weeks; p < 0.001). Sleep state and presence of brain damage (IVH grades 1-4) did not significantly increase the latency (p > 0.05 for each variable). Intravenous morphine at the time of the heel lance significantly increased the latency to facial expression response (p < 0.001) but the analysis shows that latency is highly dependent on PMA independent of morphine administration. These findings highlight developmental changes underlying infant behaviour that are critically important if pain scores are to be correctly interpreted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined. METHODS: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine). RESULTS: Women gained 14.4 (+/-5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4 kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-19.32; OR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors.

AB  - Goal Of Work: Breast cancer survivors have limited options for the treatment of hot flashes and related symptoms. Further, therapies widely used to prevent recurrence in survivors, such as tamoxifen, tend to induce or exacerbate menopausal symptoms. The aim of this preliminary, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a yoga intervention on menopausal symptoms in a sample of survivors of early-stage breast cancer (stages IA-IIB).Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven disease-free women experiencing hot flashes were randomized to the 8-week Yoga of Awareness program (gentle yoga poses, meditation, and breathing exercises) or to wait-list control. The primary outcome was daily reports of hot flashes collected at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months after treatment via an interactive telephone system. Data were analyzed by intention to treat.Main Results: At posttreatment, women who received the yoga program showed significantly greater improvements relative to the control condition in hot-flash frequency, severity, and total scores and in levels of joint pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, symptom-related bother, and vigor. At 3 months follow-up, patients maintained their treatment gains in hot flashes, joint pain, fatigue, symptom-related bother, and vigor and showed additional significant gains in negative mood, relaxation, and acceptance.Conclusions: This pilot study provides promising support for the beneficial effects of a comprehensive yoga program for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms in early-stage breast cancer survivors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to analyze gabapentin's effect on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores in menopausal women. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a cohort of menopausal women participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin 300 mg three times daily (TID) for hot flashes. The outcomes of interest were PSQI global and factor scores at weeks 4 and 12. RESULTS: Subjects randomized to gabapentin demonstrated improvement in the sleep quality factor score, compared to placebo-treated subjects, at 4 and 12 weeks (p < 0.03). There was also gabapentin-associated improvement in the global PSQI score (p = 0.004) and the sleep efficiency factor score (p = 0.05) at 4 weeks. There was no significant effect of gabapentin on the daily disturbance factor score. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin may improve sleep quality in menopausal women with hot flashes. These results warrant further prospective investigation, with an emphasis on measuring subjective sleep quality and maintenance.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) during the menopausal transition, controlling for chronological aging, symptoms, and other covariates.Methods: This was a prospective, longitudinal study of women aged 42 to 52 years at baseline recruited at seven US sites (N = 3,302) in the multiethnic Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Women eligible for the cohort had an intact uterus, had at least one ovary, were not currently using exogenous hormones, were either premenopausal or early perimenopausal, and were self-identified as one of the study's designated racial/ethnic groups. Data from the baseline interview and six annual follow-up visits are reported. HRQL was assessed with five subscales from the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey, with reduced functioning defined as being in the lowest 25% on a subscale. Covariates included symptoms, medical conditions, sociodemographics variables, physical activity, and psychological factors.Results: With adjustment for baseline age, chronological aging, and relevant covariates, the odds of reduced role-physical functioning were significantly greater at late perimenopause (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.08-1.99) and postmenopause (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.04) compared with premenopause. Menopause status was unrelated to bodily pain, vitality, role-emotional, or social functioning. Hormone therapy users were more likely to report reduced functioning. Other variables significantly related to HRQL across all domains included vasomotor symptoms, urine leakage, poor sleep, arthritis, depressed mood, perceived stress, and stressful life events.Conclusions: The menopausal transition showed little impact on HRQL when adjusted for symptoms, medical conditions, and stress.

AB  - The overall goal of this study was to determine the role of ethnicity on features of hot flashes (HFs) in a population of menopausal women in North Central Texas. A total of 397 ethnically diverse menopausal women from North Central Texas were administered our Menopausal Vasomotor Symptoms (MVS) survey to ascertain accurate information about number, length, intensity and behaviorally disruptive effects of hot flash episodes for subsequent analysis for the role of ethnicity in the occurrence of hot flashes. The mean (SD) age for participants was 50.2 (5.3) years; 40% were Caucasian, 38% were African-American and 22% were Hispanic. To evaluate and identify potential associations of hot flash (HF) features, ethnicity, and other independent variables, ordinal/multinomial/binary logistic regression models were used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analysis demonstrates strong associations with ethnicity and the number of HF's/day, the length of each HF episode, the intensity of HFs, and the interruption of daily activities and sleep. Ethnicity was important in the crude and adjusted model describing the association between the number of HFs per day and ethnicity. African-American women were 2.22 (95% CI, 1.38-3.56) times and Hispanic women were 1.85 (95% CI, 1.08-3.18) times more likely to experience more frequent HFs per day than Caucasian women. In contrast, Hispanic women were less likely than Caucasian women to experience sweating and disruption of both daily activities and sleep. Collectively, our results show more frequent and more bothersome HFs in African-American women and more frequent, but less intense and bothersome HFs in Hispanic women in comparison to Caucasian women.

AB  - Aim. To generate a descriptive theory framework regarding the experiences of sleep disturbances among perimenopausal women in Taiwan. Background. Although studies show that some perimenopausal women are troubled by sleep problems, little information was found about the subjective experiences of sleep disturbances among these women. Research is required to explore women's feelings or perceptions in dealing with their sleep problems. These understandings will be important to help alleviate perimenopausal women's sleep problems. Design. A grounded theory research design was applied. Method. Twenty-one Taiwanese sleep disturbed women, aged 46–57 years, participated in in-depth interviews. Results. ‘Getting back a good night’s sleep’ was the core theme for describing and guiding the process of the women’s sleep disturbance experiences. During the process, ‘disturbed sleep’ was identified as the antecedent condition that included subcategories: easy awakening, difficulty falling asleep, inner worries, physical discomfort and genetic and bodily constitution. Analyses showed five categories (some with subcategories) of the sleep disturbed women: (i) worsening health status – physical exhaustion, impaired social interactions, emotional swings and decreased work performance; (ii) living with lonely nights – self-help and endurance; (iii) a search for resources to relieve sleep difficulties – doctor shopping, trying alternative therapies, exercising and seeking support; (iv) vicious cycle and (v) acceptance of insomnia. Conclusions. Women expected to relieve their sleep disturbance by finding comprehensive counselling or by their body constitution responding to treatment. Healthcare providers need to value women’s individual concerns and subjective voices. Providers must seek out sleep counselling instead of simply prescribing drugs for their sleep difficulties. Relevance to clinical practice. It is crucial to integrate perimenopausal sleep care by implementing a multidimensional approach such as sleep assessment laboratories, sleep counselling, complementary alternative medicine, sleep strategies and support groups.

AB  - Objective: Two types of sleep preference have been supported in the literature. Morning types awaken early and are refreshed upon waking, whereas Evening types rise later and have more erratic sleep schedules. Sleep affects menstrual functioning in adult women. However, there is scant research on the association between sleep preference and menstrual functioning in adolescents. Thus, the present study examined the association between sleep preference and menstrual functioning in 210 adolescent girls (11-17 years old).Methods: Data represent baseline measures from a longitudinal study examining the association of psychological functioning and smoking with reproductive and bone health. Measures included the Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ), regularity and duration of menstrual cycles, and the Morningness/Eveningness scale (measuring sleep preference). MSQ factor scores were used in analyses: abdominal pain, negative affect/somatic complaints, back pain, and anxiety/fatigue.Results: The results from hierarchical linear regression analyses showed significant associations between Evening preference and more symptoms of abdominal pain (P<.01), negative affect/somatic complaints (P<.01), anxiety/fatigue (P<.01), and shorter menses (P<.05).Conclusion: Adolescent girls with Evening preference experience more menstrual symptoms than those with Morning preference. Future research should include sleep preference in studies of health and behavior particularly in adolescence when there is a normative shift toward Evening preference.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the risk for OSAS among females in the United States. METHODS: This is an analysis of data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. adults. The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the risk for OSAS among the U.S. female population. This instrument includes questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p < 0.05), obesity (p < 0.001), and menopause (p < 0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk. CONCLUSIONS: One in four women in America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological disorder that disrupts daytime functioning and nighttime sleep quality. We determined the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium, compared to placebo, in alleviating nighttime pain and restoring sleep architecture in women with primary dysmenorrhea. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy women (21 +/- 1 years) with a history of primary dysmenorrhea. INTERVENTIONS: Placebo or diclofenac potassium (150 mg per day) for menstrual pain. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We assessed objective measures of sleep (polysomnography) and subjective measures of sleep quality, mood, and intensity of menstrual pain. Compared to a pain-free phase of the menstrual cycle (mid-follicular), women receiving placebo for their menstrual pain had a poorer mood (P < 0.01), decreased sleep efficiency (P < 0.05), less REM sleep (P < 0.05), more stage 1 sleep (P < 0.01), and more sleep stage changes per hour of sleep during the night. Administration of diclofenac potassium compared to placebo not only attenuated the women's menstrual pain (P < 0.05), but also increased sleep efficiency (P < 0.05) and percentage of REM sleep (P < 0.01), decreased percentage of stage 1 sleep (P < 0.05) and number of sleep stage changes per hour of sleep (P < 0.05), and improved subjective ratings of sleep quality and morning vigilance (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Diclofenac potassium effectively attenuates nighttime dysmenorrheic pain and restores subjective and objective measures of sleep quality to values recorded in a pain-free phase of the menstrual cycle.

AB  - Objective: Depression occurs more commonly during the menopausal transition in women with vasomotor symptoms (VMS) than in those without, but most women with VMS do not develop depression. It has been hypothesized that VMS are associated with depression because VMS lead to repeated awakenings, which impair daytime well-being. We aimed to determine if objectively measured sleep and perceived sleep quality are worse in depressed women with VMS than in nondepressed women with VMS.Methods: Objectively and subjectively measured sleep parameters were compared between 52 depressed women with VMS and 51 nondepressed controls with VMS. Actigraphic measures of objective sleep conducted in the home environment and subjective measures of sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index) were compared using linear regression models.Results: On objective assessments, depressed women with VMS spent less time in bed (by 64.8 min; P < 0.001) and had shorter total sleep time (by 47.7 min; P = 0.008), longer sleep-onset latency (by 13.8 min; P = 0.03), and lower sleep efficiency (by 3.2 percentage points; P = 0.09), but did not awaken more or spend more time awake after sleep onset than nondepressed controls with VMS. Depressed women also reported worse sleep quality (mean Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index 12.0 vs 8.3; P < 0.001). Adjustment for VMS frequency and important demographic characteristics did not alter these associations.Conclusions: Sleep quality and selected parameters of objectively measured sleep, but not sleep interruption, are worse in depressed than in nondepressed women with VMS. The type of sleep disturbance seen in depressed participants was not consistent with the etiology of depression secondary to VMS-associated awakenings.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perimenopausal memory complaints and performance on objective neuropsychological tests. A secondary aim was to determine if putative deficits are related to other relevant factors, such as hormone levels, mood state, or sleep quality.Methods: Twenty-four perimenopausal women were enrolled. Participants completed questionnaires assessing mood, anxiety, menopausal symptoms, health, and subjective memory function. They also underwent comprehensive cognitive testing, which included measures of attention, working memory, verbal memory, verbal fluency, visuospatial skill, and fine motor dexterity. We obtained serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels on the day of testing.Results: We found no association between memory complaints and performance on tests of retentive memory. However, memory complaints were associated with poorer memory encoding and increased depressive symptoms. Regression analyses revealed that memory complaints were best predicted by depressive symptoms, whereas encoding performance was predicted by depressive symptoms and estrogen level. Women with significant memory complaints performed worse on tests of encoding, after controlling for depression and sleep disturbance.Conclusions: These results suggest a complex relationship between mood, memory, and hormones that may underlie perimenopausal memory complaints. Furthermore, they suggest that some women may be particularly vulnerable to the subjective experience of memory problems and relative decreases in attentionally mediated cognitive function.

AB  - Objective: Cortisol levels rise among some women during the late stage of the menopausal transition (MT), but we know little about changes in cortisol levels in relation to menopause-related factors (MT stage, urinary estrone glucuronide [E1G], testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]), stress-related factors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and perceived stress), symptoms (hot flashes, mood, memory, and sleep), social factors (income adequacy, role burden, social support, employment, parenting, and history of sexual abuse), and health-related factors (depressed mood, perceived health, physical appraisal, body mass index, and smoking). The aim of the study was to examine the influence of menopause-related factors, stress-related factors, symptoms, social factors, and health-related factors on cortisol levels during the MT.Methods: Participants were a subset of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study who provided data during the late reproductive, early and late MT stages, or early postmenopause and who were not using hormone therapy or corticosteroids (N = 132 women, up to 5,218 observations). Data provided included menstrual calendars for staging the MT, annual health reports, health diaries, and overnight urine specimens (assayed for cortisol, catecholamines, E1G, and FSH) between 1990 and 2005 were included. Perceived stress, symptoms, and health behaviors were assessed in a health diary. Health-related and social factors were assessed in an annual health update. Multilevel modeling was used to test the effects of menopause-related and other factors on overnight cortisol levels.Results: When tested with age as a measure of time, menopause-related covariates, including E1G, FSH, and testosterone, were associated with significant increases in overnight cortisol levels (P < 0.0001). Likewise, epinephrine and norepinephrine were each associated significantly with overnight cortisol levels (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, E1G, FSH, and testosterone constituted the best set of predictors.Conclusions: Overnight cortisol levels during the MT were associated with E1G, testosterone, and FSH levels. In addition, they were significantly and positively associated with epinephrine and norepinephrine. MT stage, symptoms, and social, stress-related, and health-related factors had little relationship to overnight cortisol levels when other biological indicators were considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of vasomotor and mood symptoms on insomnia in postmenopausal women. METHODS: One hundred sixty-three postmenopausal women, not receiving hormone therapy, attending a menopause clinic at the University of Athens, Greece, were included in this cross-sectional study. Climacteric symptoms were assessed by Greene's scale, whereas psychological morbidity was measured by Zung Self-Assessment Depression Scale, Symptom Checklist-90-R, and Athens Insomnia Scale. RESULTS: Vasomotor symptoms were significantly associated with insomnia (P = 0.001). When depressive symptomatology was added to the logistic regression analysis, the predictive ability of the model was significantly improved as defined by the increase in the log likelihood (P < 0.001) and the increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia in postmenopausal women attending a menopause clinic is related both to the effects of vasomotor symptoms and depressive symptomatology. Mood symptoms seem to affect sleep independently of vasomotor symptoms, suggesting that depression should be carefully assessed and treated in postmenopausal women with insomnia.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the differences in depressive symptoms and anxiety between (a) normal weight and overweight, and (b) morning type and evening type (sleep chronotype) adolescent girls. The interaction of sleep chronotype and weight and depressive symptoms and anxiety were also examined. METHOD: The design consisted of a cross-sectional study of 264 adolescent females (mean age = 14.9 +/- 2.2, range 11-17 years). Sleep chronotype, depressive symptoms, and anxiety were obtained by self-report questionnaire. The mean of three measurements of height and weight was used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). BMI was plotted on the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts to obtain percentile ranking. Participants were categorized into two groups according to BMI percentile: normal weight (<85th percentile) and overweight (> or =85th percentile). RESULTS: Compared with normal-weight females, overweight females were more likely to be non-Caucasian, lower socioeconomic status, have more advanced pubic hair and breast stages, and earlier age at menarche. No differences were observed with respect to sleep chronotype, depressive symptoms, and trait anxiety between normal weight and overweight females. Evening chronotype was associated with more depressive symptoms (beta = -.65, p < .01) and higher trait anxiety (beta = -.22, p < .05). Evening chronotype was associated with more depressive symptoms in both normal-weight and overweight females. However, the association was stronger in overweight females. CONCLUSIONS: Individually, sleep and weight impact physical and mental health during adolescence. The combination of evening chronotype and overweight appears to have the strongest association on the emotional health of adolescent females. Further investigations are needed to provide potential biological mechanisms for this relationship.

AB  - e20517 Background: Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is common in cancer survivors. CRF has been reported to be one of the most distressing symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment. Activity and biological profiles of those who suffer from CRF, have been poorly characterized. This IRB approved prospective, natural history study reports fatigue and associated findings in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer (BrCa), receiving standard treatment.Methods: All women were evaluated pre-operatively and at >9 months after diagnosis.Variables Measured: Age, height, marital status, presence of children, menopausal status, tumor size, node status, estrogen receptor (ER+), hemoglobin, white blood cell count, fasting blood glucose, and BMI. Patient reported outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) of fatigue (F), SF-36 version2, Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ, Harvard Alumni Health Study) and Sleep Questionnaire. Some variables were dichotomized to maximize the statistical power for the relatively small sample size. Bivariate correlations, and logistic regression analyses were performed using two fatigue conditions: presence of any F, or presence of clinically significant fatigue (CSF) defined as >=4 on the VAS.Results: 61 women, mean age of 51y, 39% had BMI >=25, 85% had >= 1 child, 52% were post-menopause, 92% ER+. Increased F at follow-up was statistically significant when compared to baseline (p=<0.0001, using paired t-test). Significant correlations (p<0.1) are reported between CSF and the following: node+, BMI>=25; inverse correlations with amount of vigorous activity (PAQ), physical function and vitality on SF-36. Physical function (SF-36) had significant inverse correlations with: age, menopause, and BMI. Low vitality was associated with: large tumor size, high WBC, longer time sleeping. Node+, BMI>=25, low physical function and vitality levels retained statistically significant relationships to CSF in the regression analyses.Conclusions: Node+ BrCa, BMI>=25, low level of physical activity and vitality (SF-36) are correlated with CSF. Except node status, each is treatable and may reduce CSF No significant financial relationships to disclose.

AB  - Emphasizing midlife women, this review describes sleep and compares self-report sleep data with objective findings from laboratory studies of women. Sleep disturbance is a more prevalent complaint for women than men. Not due to chronologic age per se, it is associated with menopausal symptoms and most importantly with comorbidities and stress. Sleep problems in midlife women should not be attributed only to the menopausal symptom experience and should trigger a clinical evaluation. Assessment guidelines are included.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the patterns and differences among sleep and hot flashes based on menopausal status (pre, peri, or post) in breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy patients before, during, and after treatment. Design: Secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient clinics and participants' homes. Patients/Participants: Two hundred nineteen (219) women; mean age of 52 years (29-79); postoperative, Stages I to IIIA breast cancer. Methods: Participants were randomized to a behavioral sleep intervention or a healthy eating control group. Variables measured were menopausal status (self-report), subjective sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), objective sleep (actigraphy), perceived interruption of sleep by hot flashes (diary), and demographic/medical characteristics. Data reported were collected 48 hours before initial chemotherapy, at treatment 4, and 30 days after the last treatment. Analysis included descriptives and repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance. Results: Objective sleep and the perceived interruption of sleep by hot flashes changed significantly over time. Sleep and hot flashes differed over time by menopausal status. Only hot flashes were significantly different by study group and by menopausal status over time. Conclusion: Women's menopausal status when starting chemotherapy was associated with differing patterns of sleep and hot flashes over time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effectiveness of individualized acupuncture plus self-care versus self-care alone on hot flashes and health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This study involved a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms. Participants were postmenopausal women experiencing, on average, seven or more hot flashes per 24 hours during seven consecutive days. The acupuncture group received 10 acupuncture treatment sessions and advice on self-care, and the control group received advice on self-care only. The frequency and severity (0-10 scale) of hot flashes were registered in a diary. Urine excretion of calcitonin gene-related peptide was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in mean hot flash frequency from baseline to 12 weeks. The secondary endpoint was change in health-related quality of life measured by the Women's Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: Hot flash frequency decreased by 5.8 per 24 hours in the acupuncture group (n = 134) and 3.7 per 24 hours in the control group (n = 133), a difference of 2.1 (P < 0.001). Hot flash intensity decreased by 3.2 units in the acupuncture group and 1.8 units in the control group, a difference of 1.4 (P < 0.001). The acupuncture group experienced statistically significant improvements in the vasomotor, sleep, and somatic symptoms dimensions of the Women's Health Questionnaire compared with the control group. Urine calcitonin gene-related peptide excretion remained unchanged from baseline to week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture plus self-care can contribute to a clinically relevant reduction in hot flashes and increased health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a group cognitive behavioural intervention to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women who have had treatment for breast cancer. METHODS: A single group design was used with pre- and post-treatment assessment and a 3-months follow-up. Seventeen women who had completed active breast cancer treatment were treated. Following a 2-week daily diary assessment they were offered 6 (90 min) weekly sessions of Group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The CBT included information and discussion, relaxation and paced breathing and CBT to reduce stress and manage hot flushes (HF), night sweats (NS) and sleep. The primary outcome measure was Hot Flush Frequency and Hot Flush Problem Rating; secondary outcomes included the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and health-related quality of life (SF 36). Beliefs about HF were monitored in order to examine the effects of cognitive therapy. RESULTS: HF and NS reduced significantly following treatment (38% reduction in frequency and 49% in problem rating) and improvements were maintained at 3 months follow-up (49% reduction in frequency and 59% in problem rating). Depressed mood, anxiety and sleep (WHQ) significantly improved, as did aspects of quality of life (SF 36) (emotional role limitation, energy/vitality and mental health). There was a significant reduction in negative beliefs about HF, NS and sleep following CBT. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT delivered in groups might offer a viable option for women with troublesome menopausal symptoms following breast cancer treatment, but further controlled trials are needed.

AB  - Positioning of preterm infants is a basic task of neonatal nursing care. A variety of outcomes are affected by different body positioning of preterm infants. This review evaluates the clinical evidence of the effects of positioning of preterm infants with regard to physiological outcomes and sleep states. Objectives To conduct a systematic review to determine the best available evidence related to the positioning of preterm infants. The specific review questions addressed were: the physiological outcomes affected by different positioning, and the best position for promoting sleep. Criteria for considering studies for this review This review considered all studies that included infants born before 37 weeks of gestational age in any hospital setting. Outcomes included measures for physiologic effects and sleep state. The review primarily considered any randomized clinical trails (RCTs) that explored different positions in preterm infant but also included quasi-experimental designs. Search strategy for identification of studies The search sought to find published and unpublished studies. The database search included: Pubmed, CINAHL, ProQuest, EMBASE, Science Direct, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Studies were additionally identified from reference lists of all studies retrieved. Assessment and data extraction All studies were checked for methodological quality by two reviewers and data was extracted using tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data analysis The study results were pooled in statistical meta-analysis using Review Manager Software and summarized in narrative form where statistical pooling was not appropriate or possible. Results Thirty two studies were included in the review. The results of this review support the prone position in preterm infants for improvement of arterial oxygen saturation, improved lung and chest wall synchrony of respiratory improvements, decreased incidence of apnea in infants with a clinical history of apnea, promoted sleep, and decreased gastroesophageal reflux. However, the prone position increased postural abnormalities, orthopaedic abnormalities of the feet, and delayed developmental musculature. The combined use of a postural support roll and a postural nappy while very preterm infants are nursed, improved hip and shoulder posture up to term postmenstrual age. The change in body position from horizontal to head-up tilt in very immature and unstable infants may affect the cerebral homodynamic. The management of position per se may not be sufficient for assisting preterm neonates to cope with the painful procedure. Furthermore, preterm infants are susceptible to oxygen desaturation in car seats and carrying slings. Conclusion Prone positioning was shown to have many advantages for prematurely born infants. But the longer, deep sleep period and fewer awakenings associated with a prone position would support higher vulnerability for preterm infants to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Therefore, all preterm infants placed in the prone position should have continuous cardio-respiratory and oxygen saturation monitoring. Preterm infants should be placed in a properly supported position to ensure functional support of all parts of the body as well as ensuring physical safety. In addition, preterm infants should not be left unattended in car safety seats and carrying slings.

AB  - The study aimed to improve understanding of the natural history and impact of hot flushes after breast cancer. Data were collected from women participating in an RCT of relaxation to reduce the incidence of flushes from breast cancer follow-up clinics from two hospitals in South-East England. Repondents were 150 women experiencing hot flushes following completion of primary treatment for breast cancer. This study utilized a flush diary, the Hot Flushes and Night Sweats Questionnaire (HFNSQ), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) and Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) as the main outcome measures. The study found that in this sample, 51 (34%) women experienced flushes more than five years after diagnosis and 75 (50%) more than 5 years after menopause. Sleep disruption occurred in 90 women (72% of those that returned diaries), affecting half of the nights they recorded. The mean problem rating on the HFNSQ was 4.85 out of 10. A peak incidence of flushes was apparent around 10 a.m. in women taking tamoxifen. It was concluded that hot flushes after breast cancer may be long-lasting and cause sleeping difficulties for many women. Tamoxifen may affect the diurnal pattern of flushes. After breast cancer, the duration of flushes, potential distress and disruption to women's lives should not be underestimated and appropriate interventions should be offered.

AB  - Up to 40 percent of adolescents experience some form of sleep difficulty, with adolescent girls often reporting higher levels of sleep disturbance and daytime fatigue than boys. This article explores the literature surrounding female adolescent sleep disturbance. The findings reveal that sleep problems in young women can be linked to girls being at an increased risk for puberty-related fatigue, sexual abuse, a higher prevalence of mental illness and sensitivity to familial disruption, and increased domestic and grooming expectations. Implications for nursing practice include initiating conversations about sleep, sleep disturbance and sleeping arrangements when working with adolescent girls. Nurses should gather accurate sleep histories, provide adolescent girls and their caregivers with information and recommend interventions to improve sleep if necessary. Nurses should remain sensitive to the confounding effects of pubertal status, menarche and the cyclic release of hormones when designing and conducting future research into female adolescent sleep disturbance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether greater frequency and severity of hot flashes are independently associated with insomnia symptoms and objective measures of disrupted sleep among healthy postmenopausal women with hot flashes. METHODS: A baseline cross-sectional analysis of a multicenter, randomized trial in 217 healthy postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years with hot flashes was conducted. Hot flash frequency and severity were recorded in a daily diary; frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes was the primary measure. Insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Hot flash frequency and severity and objective parameters of sleep-wake patterns (using a wrist actigraph) were concurrently measured over an average of seven consecutive 24-hour periods in a subcohort of 112 women. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 54 years, and 80% were white; 33% had an ISI score greater than 14, consistent with at least moderate insomnia. In multivariable analysis, the mean ISI score showed a stepwise increase in magnitude with higher frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes (adjusted mean ISI score, 9.5, 11.4, 11.9, and 13.0 for quartiles 1-4, respectively; P for trend = 0.002). Higher frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes was also independently associated in a graded manner with greater nighttime wakefulness (P for trend = 0.028) and a higher number of long wake episodes (P for trend = 0.008) but was not related to sleep efficiency, total sleep time, or sleep latency. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy postmenopausal women with hot flashes, frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes was independently associated in a graded manner with severity of insomnia symptoms and objective measures of nighttime wakefulness and sleep fragmentation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot double-blind, randomized clinical trial, which initially targeted breast cancer survivors, was to obtain preliminary evidence of the effect of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort extract) compared with placebo on symptoms and quality of life of symptomatic perimenopausal women. We also assessed practical difficulties in recruiting women to such a trial. METHODS: Symptomatic perimenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years who experience hot flashes (three or more per day, Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study scale) were randomly assigned to receive ethanolic St. John's wort extract (900 mg TID) or placebo. The women were asked to keep a daily diary during the week before randomization and during the week before the 3-month follow-up (primary outcome) to record hot flash frequency and intensity. A hot flash score (frequency x severity) was calculated. The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire was used to assess menopause-specific quality of life. RESULTS: Forty-seven women were randomized. After 12 weeks of treatment, a nonsignificant difference favoring the St. John's wort group was observed in the daily hot flash frequency (St. John's wort, -2.3 +/- 3.6; placebo, -1.0 +/- 2.2; P = 0.11) and the hot flash score (-3.8 +/- 8.3 and -1.8 +/- 6.5, respectively; P = 0.10). After 3 months of treatment, compared with the placebo group, women in the St. John's wort group reported significantly better menopause-specific quality of life (P = 0.01) and significantly fewer sleep problems (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hypericum perforatum may improve quality of life in ways that are important to symptomatic perimenopausal women, but these results need to be confirmed by a larger clinical trial.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the relations among hot flashes, other menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and depressive symptoms in midlife women.Methods: A large population-based cross-sectional study of 639 women (ages 45-54 years) consisting of a questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale, demographics, health behaviors, menstrual history, and menopausal symptoms.Results: After controlling for menopausal status, physical activity level, smoking status and current self-reported health status elevated CES-D score is associated with frequent nocturnal hot flashes, frequent trouble sleeping, experiencing hot flashes, nausea, headaches, weakness, visual problems, vaginal discharge, irritability, muscle stiffness, and incontinence.Conclusions: The present study found significant links between depressive symptoms and several menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, sleep disturbance, irritability, muscle stiffness, and incontinence after controlling for covariates. These findings suggest that a potential mechanism in which bothersome menopausal symptoms may influence depressed mood during the midlife is through sleep disturbance.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The objective was to psychometrically evaluate the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ), a self-report instrument designed to establish a clinically relevant case definition of insomnia consistent with widely used insomnia classification criteria, using methods from classical test theory and item response theory (IRT). METHODS: The ISQ was evaluated using IRT algorithms in a cohort of 362 pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women recruited for the SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) Sleep Study. This yielded a dichotomous outcome consistent with the presence/absence of insomnia. The internal consistency and criterion validity of the dichotomized ISQ were compared to traditional measures of sleep from sleep diaries, polysomnography, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using kappa statistics, and indices of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV), and likelihood ratio tests (LRs). RESULTS: The ISQ identified 9.8% of the sample as meeting insomnia, consistent with established diagnostic criteria. Reliability was established with Cronbach alpha (alpha = 0.89). The ISQ had high specificity (> 90%), but sensitivity, PPV, NPV, and LRs varied according to which sleep measure was used. Concurrent validity was not confirmed with any of the traditional sleep summary measures (kappas < 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: The ISQ captures the multidimensionality of insomnia better than traditional sleep measures as it ascertains symptoms of insomnia that are based on DSM-IV and RDC criteria. The high specificities suggest that the ISQ has a high probability of correctly identifying those without insomnia and would be a cost-effective tool in large observational studies in which the prevalence of insomnia is likely to be about 10%. Further evaluation of the ISQ, including validation against clinical interviews, is warranted.

AB  - Background: Gender differences in the prevalence of various manifestations of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is not as great as previously believed. The aim of the present study was to clarify the clinical patient characteristics of Japanese women and men with OSAS.Methods: A cross-sectional case-match control study was performed on patients from two sleep disorder centers. Two hundred forty-five women with OSAS were classified into premenopausal (n = 70) and postmenopausal (n = 175) groups. As well, 245 men matched for both age and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and another 245 men matched for age and body mass index (BMI) were established. We compared descriptive variables between genders in both the premenopausal and the postmenopausal female patient groups.Results: As a whole, female patients had significantly higher BMI than AHI-matched male patients (p < 0.05) and a significantly lower value of AHI than BMI-matched male patients (p < 0.001). Female patients had lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores than BMI-matched male patients (p < 0.05). On logistic regression analysis, presence of hypertension was significantly associated with BMI (>or=25 kg/m(2)), AHI (>or= 15 to < 30 events/h; >or= 30 to < 60 events/h; >or= 60 events/h), and presence of both hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. However, gender differences were not associated with the occurrence of hypertension. Female patients had significantly lower optimal levels of continuous positive airway pressure than male patients.Conclusions: Our results suggest that both the OSAS severity and the strength of pharyngeal closure is less in Japanese female patients than in male patients. Moreover, Japanese female patients are thought to have less daytime sleepiness than male patients but a similar rate of hypertension as male patients.

AB  - Common medical problems are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Patients with chronic medical disorders often have fewer hours of sleep and less restorative sleep compared to healthy individuals, and this poor sleep may worsen the subjective symptoms of the disorder. Individuals with lung disease often have disturbed sleep related to oxygen desaturations, coughing, or dyspnea. Both obstructive lung disease and restrictive lung diseases are associated with poor quality sleep. Awakenings from sleep are common in untreated or undertreated asthma, and cause sleep disruption. Gastroesophageal reflux is a major cause of disrupted sleep due to awakenings from heartburn, dyspepsia, acid brash, coughing, or choking. Patients with chronic renal disease commonly have sleep complaints often due to insomnia, insufficient sleep, sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. Complaints related to sleep are very common in patients with fibromyalgia and other causes of chronic pain. Sleep disruption increases the sensation of pain and decreases quality of life. Patients with infectious diseases, including acute viral illnesses, HIV-related disease, and Lyme disease, may have significant problems with insomnia and hypersomnolence. Women with menopause have from insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, or fibromyalgia. Patients with cancer or receiving cancer therapy are often bothered by insomnia or other sleep disturbances that affect quality of life and daytime energy. The objective of this article is to review frequently encountered medical conditions and examine their impact on sleep, and to review frequent sleep-related problems associated with these common medical conditions.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe any changes in health experienced by postmenopausal women after having acupuncture treatment for hot flashes. Materials and methods: Our sample was drawn from women participating in a randomized controlled trial (ACUFLASH) investigating the effect of acupuncture on menopausal hot flashes. One hundred and twentyseven (127) women from the intervention group who had received a course of 10 acupuncture treatments were asked to make a written statement about any kind of change they had perceived that they considered could be related to the acupuncture treatment. Qualitative data were analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results: Many women reported a substantial impact from the treatment with respect to a reduction in frequency and intensity of hot flashes both by night and by day. Changes related to improved sleep pattern were also reported, and a variety of different bodily and mental changes were described (i.e., feeling in a good mood, not so run down, and calmer). Several women were uncertain whether any changes had occurred. A few reported feeling worse. Conclusions: Our results describe a variety of health changes that may not be revealed by limited outcome measures in acupuncture studies. Further analysis of the relationship between such bodily experiences could lead to the development of hypotheses or models for how the acupuncture effect is mediated in complex bodily systems, and also contribute to development of outcome measures relevant for acupuncture studies.

AB  - This early phase study examined the effects of a series of ten standard-protocol acupuncture treatments over four weeks in 12 healthy, but symptomatic, menopausal women. In addition to measuring two biologic markers that may shed light on the physiologic impact of acupuncture, symptom experience data were collected. The two markers included heart rate variability to evaluate effects of acupuncture on the autonomic nervous system as it relates specifically to the heart, and interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine, to capture physiologic impact of acupuncture on the immune-inflammatory response.Women who exhibited significant menopausal symptoms, that included vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and sweats), fatigue, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, urogenital symptoms, and pain as measured by a minimum score of 22 out of a possible 44 points on the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), underwent 10 sessions of a standard acupuncture point protocol intervention over a four-week period. Daily symptoms were evaluated for 28 days using the MRS. Immediately after the intervention was complete, one final open-ended question was asked of each participant to explore subjective experiences not captured by the validated instrument. Physiologic measurements included a 30-minute continuous measure of electrocardiogram data before and during acupuncture, as well as pre and post acupuncture measures of serum interleukin 6 at the first and final acupuncture treatment. Each set of measures were taken at baseline, immediately before and after each acupuncture treatment throughout the four-week/10-treatment intervention. Heart rate variability was assessed using spectral analysis, and interleukin 6 changes were measured using enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay. Analysis included linear regression, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and Spearman correlation coefficients.After the acupuncture intervention, menopausal symptoms improved significantly. Various elements of heart rate variability did not show consistent or predictable intra or inter-subject changes, however several components of HRV, interleukin 6 and symptoms were found to have significant correlations with each other.The study was deemed feasible. Menopause symptoms improved. Heart rate variability showed no consistent changes or trends. Interleukin 6 decreased in seven subjects, between the first and tenth acupuncture treatment, but did not reach statistical significance.This small project suggests that heart rate variability, when measured at each acupuncture treatment, does not change in a consistent or predictable manner. Rather, acupuncture may provide a modulating influence that depends on the body's functional state at each treatment.

AB  - The present paper presents a review of the literature examining the efficacy of v eszopiclone for treating insomnia. The purpose of the paper was to evaluate both the statistical and clinical efficacy of eszopiclone for treating insomnia. Both subjective and objective assessments of insomnia were evaluated across various sleep variables. Additionally, the efficacy of eszopiclone for treating insomnia comorbid with other conditions (sleep disordered breathing, psychiatric diagnoses, peri/post-menopause, rheumatoid arthritis), transient insomnia, and across diverse samples (adults, older adults, and samples pooled by race) was reviewed. Finally, the impact of eszopiclone use on daytime functioning was examined.

AB  - While the use of supplemental oxygen has a long history in neonatal care, resulting in both significant health care benefits and harms, uncertainty remains as to the most appropriate range to target blood oxygen levels in preterm and low birth weight infants. Potential benefits of higher oxygen targeting may include more stable sleep patterns and improved long-term growth and development. However, there may be significant deleterious pulmonary effects and health service use implications resulting from such a policy. To determine whether targeting ambient oxygen concentration to achieve a lower vs. higher blood oxygen range, or administering restricted vs. liberal supplemental oxygen, effects mortality, retinopathy of prematurity, lung function, growth or development in preterm or low birth weight infants. The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. An additional literature search was conducted of the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases in order to locate any trials in addition to those provided by the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR). Search updated to week two July 2008. All trials in preterm or low birth weight infants utilising random or quasi-random patient allocation in which ambient oxygen concentrations were targeted to achieve a lower vs. higher blood oxygen range, or restricted vs. liberal oxygen was administered were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of the eligible trials was assessed independently by each review author for the degree of selection, performance, attrition and detection bias. Data were extracted and reviewed independently by the each author. Data analysis was conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. In the meta-analysis of the five trials included in this review, the restriction of oxygen significantly reduced the incidence and severity of retinopathy of prematurity without unduly increasing death rates The one prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial investigating lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels from 32 weeks postmenstrual age showed no significant differences in the rates of ROP, mortality or growth and development between the two groups. However, this study did show increased rates of chronic lung disease and home oxygen use. The results of this systematic review confirm that (the now historical) policy of unrestricted, unmonitored oxygen therapy has potential harms without clear benefits. However, the question of what is the optimal target range for maintaining blood oxygen levels in preterm/LBW infants was not answered by the data available for inclusion in this review.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Hot flashes are synonymous with menopause, yet some women begin experiencing hot flashes years before the final menstrual period. The purpose of this study was to examine salivary hormone profiles and symptoms of premenopausal women experiencing hot flashes as compared to women who did not experience hot flashes in relation to the menstrual cycle. The study group (participants experiencing hot flashes) was at increased risk of experiencing menstrual cycle changes, mastalgia and anovulation than the control group (participants who did not experience hot flashes).The study group was more symptomatic than the control group and these symptoms were cyclic in nature, increasing in frequency and intensity in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The study group also reported more anxiety and sleep disturbance than the control group. Finally, there was no difference between the two groups in estradiol or progesterone concentrations in saliva samples. However there was a significant difference in cortisol concentrations in one month of the study, suggesting adrenal involvement.Health care providers need to be aware that premenopausal women with regular menstrual cycles experience hot flashes and other symptoms (specifically menstrual cycle changes, cyclic mastalgia, anxiety and sleep disturbance) which suggest changes in hormone concentrations. These hormone changes may not be detected by standard clinical screenings. Other studies identified hot flashes to be associated with more serious diseases processes such as bone loss and cardiovascular changes. These conditions are processes that occur over years, even decades. Early detection by screening premenopausal women for hot flashes and other associated symptoms allows for timely intervention.

AB  - Objectives: We compared ventilation inhomogeneity assessed by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and multiple breath washout (MBW) in preterm and term-born infants. We hypothesised that EIT measurements in spontaneously breathing infants are repeatable and that differences in regional ventilation distribution measured by EIT can distinguish between preterm and term-born infants.Design: Cross-sectional group comparison study.Setting: Lung function laboratory at a University Children's Hospital.Participants: Seventeen healthy term-born and 15 preterm infants at a matched postmenstrual age of 44 weeks.Measurements and Results: We concurrently measured ventilation inhomogeneity by EIT, ventilation inhomogeneity (LCI) and functional residual capacity (FRC) by MBW and tidal breathing variables during unsedated quiet sleep. EIT measurements were highly repeatable (coefficient of variation 3.6%). Preterm infants showed significantly more ventilation of the independent parts of the lungs compared to healthy term-born infants assessed by EIT (mean difference 5.0, 95 CI 1.3-8%). Whereas the two groups showed no differences in lung volumes or ventilation inhomogeneities assessed by MBW, EIT discriminated better between term and preterm infants. (FRC/kg: mean difference 1.1 mL, 95% CI -1.4-3.8 mL; LCI: mean difference 0.03, 95% CI -0.32-0.25).Conclusions: EIT shows distinct differences in ventilation distribution between preterm and term-born infants, which cannot be detected by MBW. Although preterm infants are capable of dynamically maintaining overall functional residual volume and ventilation distribution, they show some spatial differences from fullterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of menopausal symptoms in a population of Sri Lankan women and the relationship with their health-related quality of life. DESIGN: A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on 683 women ages 45 to 60 years living in the district of Colombo, Sri Lanka. A cluster sampling method was used for recruitment of the sample. Information was collected on demographic, socioeconomic, menstrual, and reproductive history using structured interviews. The Menopause Rating Scale was used to assess menopausal symptoms and the Short Form 36 health survey was used to assess the health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Of the sample, 59.4% were postmenopausal and 18.4% were perimenopausal; 90% of the sample had one or more menopausal symptoms. The most prevalent menopausal symptoms were joint and muscular discomfort (74.7%), physical and mental exhaustion (53.9%), and hot flushes (39.1%). Hot flushes, sleep problems, and joint/muscular discomfort showed an increase in prevalence from the premenopausal category to the postmenopausal category (P < 0.05 for all). Chronic illness in the women was significantly associated with the presence of menopausal symptoms (P < 0.01). Women with menopausal symptoms had significantly lower (P < 0.05) quality-of-life scores in most of the domains of the Short Form 36 compared with women without symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of these Sri Lankan women reported one or more menopausal symptom. Chronic illness was significantly associated with these symptoms. The presence of menopausal symptoms was significantly associated with a decreased health-related quality of life in the women.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe a pilot study designed to determine whether mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) as a component of a program of research designed to change health behaviors could be an effective intervention to increase adoption of and adherence to heart health related behavior change. Forty nurses, aged 39--57 yrs, with a BMI >= 23 but <= 41 were recruited and enrolled in the study, stratified by BMI, and randomized into the MBSR (experimental) intervention or the perimenopausal education (active control) intervention. After recruitment and randomization, the 20 women enrolled in the experimental arm of the study completed a MBSR course and then participated in an eight-week program of diet and exercise. Women (n=20) in the active control arm attended educational classes on midlife health issues followed by the same eight week program of diet and exercise in which both groups participated together. Baseline measures of weight, height, body mass index, blood pressure, pulse, waist/hip ratio, glucose, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, trigylcerides, total cholesterol, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, cortisol, and instruments that measured sleep, depression, psychosocial stress and mindfulness were obtained. Immediately following eight weeks of health education classes or an MBSR course, psychosocial assessment and weight were repeated. Participants then participated together in an eight week program of a pedometer-based exercise program and lowered calorie DASH diet. Measurements of adherence to diet and exercise, changes in heart health-related physiological measures, and associated weight loss outcomes were assessed in both groups again immediately post study at 16 weeks.There was a 95% combined completion rate for the program. Upon completion of the program women in the control arm had lost from Baseline to Week 16, an average of 2.77 pounds. Women in the intervention arm had lost from Baseline to Week 16, an average of 2.61 pounds. This means that on average, the women in the control arm lost .16 pounds more than women in the intervention arm. A spline linear mixed model was constructed to test the hypothesis that mindfulness based stress reduction would improve adherence and result in greater changes in weight, BMI, depressive symptoms, anxiety, perceived psychosocial stress, sleep quality, and mindfulness at 16 weeks.In terms of satisfaction, 95% completion rate reflected success. The outcome of the hypothesis testing based on spline linear mixed model for weight, BMI and psychosocial variables revealed there were not statistically significant differences between arms at 16 Weeks. However, both groups had improvement on all of the variables tested. There was a reduction from Baseline to Week 16 on weight, BMI, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and improvements in sleep quality and mindfulness. The main difference between the two groups was the pattern of change in these variables over time. The women in the MBSR arm experienced a linear decline which suggested an improvement in perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and symptoms of anxiety that started while enrolled in the MBSR course. Sleep quality and mindfulness improved during this time period as well. The women in the control group had a similar linear decline in all measures from Week 8 to Week 16 (not from Baseline to Week 8), during the time period in the study when a focus on healthy eating and exercise began. Women in both arms commented that they had started changing the way they ate, how they dealt with stress and that they paid more attention to exercise as an outcome of being enrolled in this study.This program was shown to be feasible, but several recommendations are made for future research. The program could be tested combining simultaneous engagement in mindfulness (or health education) and the diet and exercise portion for an eight-week program. Follow-up could be more intensive in the ensuing weeks after program termination. In the future, weekly individual or small group interaction about diet and exercise that is woven into the health education or mindfulness may have greater impact and relevance in aid of adopting healthy lifestyle behaviors and weight management. Clearly further research is needed. The program was safe and feasible and may be implemented in practice with diet and exercise program combined with health education and stress management. However, until the content and protocol processes are refined with data to support their efficacy, it is recommended that the outcomes are closely evaluated. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Background and objective. An expected 40 million women will reach menopause in the next decade. Approximately 65%-75% of these women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS). An estimated 85% will report one or more symptom such as hot flashes, mood disturbances or sleep disruption. Approximately 40% of women seek medical attention for relief of menopausal symptoms posing a high economic burden on women and the health care system.To date menopausal symptom management research has focused on single symptoms. However, a majority of women report multiple symptoms varying in severity from mild to severe. The purpose of these analyses was to argue that a paradigm shift from the study of single symptoms to clusters of symptoms during the menopausal transition is important and timely.Methods and results. A subset of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study participants who were in late reproductive stage, early or late menopausal transition stages, or early postmenopause and provided self-reported data on symptoms experienced between 1990 and 2005 were subjected to principal components analysis and latent class analysis in two separate secondary data analyses.Principal components analysis demonstrated that the factor structure of menopausal symptoms vary across the menopausal transition stages and that the symptom factor structure of the preceding stage is the best indicator of how symptoms will cluster in the stage immediately following.Latent class analysis identified four subgroups of women as having low severity scores, high severity scores and subgroups reporting high on some symptoms while reporting low on others. Only 13% of women reported all high severity symptoms (except for hot flashes, which was moderate) while 65% reported low severity on all symptoms (except for joint aches, which was moderate). A clear delineation between subgroups based on individual characteristics was not fully elucidated.Discussion. The current focus for the study of menopausal symptom management continues to be on single symptoms; however, women experience symptoms in clusters, therefore a holistic appraisal of the symptom experience requires consideration of all symptoms versus isolated symptoms.

AB  - The maca species Lepidium meyenii grows all over several South American countries, but, to date, only maca from Peru has been significantly researched and shown to have therapeutic benefit. This has resulted in many botanists referring to maca that grows in Peru as Lepidium pemvianum in order to specify the exact origin. Some botanists, in fact, believe L peruviamm to be a different species than L meyenii. While there will continue to be dissension on maca's correct botanical nomenclature, the most important point to clarify is that the origin of the maca referred to in this article is Peru and, due to this fact, will be referred to as Lperuvianum.Maca's high nutritional value makes it a Peruvian dietary staple. Traditionally, the herb is best known as an adaptogenic plant, ie, a plant that modulates the body's response by supporting it in dealing with physiological, biochemical, and psychological Stressors. Traditional healing methods include using the herb to benefit the endocrine and reproductive systems by addressing such disorders as chronic fatigue, anemia, and infertility and to aid in enhanced stamina and hormonal balance. Maca research shows benefit in the production of sex hormones, enhanced sex drive, stimulation of body metabolism, control of body weight, and increased energy, stress reduction, antidepressant activity, and memory improvement.It has been suggested that maca's therapeutic actions rely on plant sterols stimulating the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal, and ovarian glands and, therefore, also affecting the thyroid and pineal glands and, thus, improving sleep, mood, fertility, energy, and hot flashes. As such, this herb has been found clinically useful in perimenopausal and menopausal women.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore fatigue and related factors among perimenopausal women. This was a cross-sectional, correlation study that employed structured questionnaires. Data was collected by purposeful sampling between December 2007 and January 2008 at gynecological clinics located in Taipei City. Eighty-five women between 42 and 58 years of age were recruited. Results showed that: (1) Perimenopausal women had scores concentrated in the range of 'slightly' to 'moderately' fatigued. Sleep, personal life and health were most influenced by fatigue; (2) Women who were 'taking hormones', 'taking plant hormones', 'taking medicine for a long period of time' or 'employed' were at a higher risk of greater fatigue; (3) Perimenopausal disturbance showed a significantly positive correlation with fatigue. Perimenopausal disturbance registered at a mild to moderate level, while psychological disturbance ranked as the most severe type of perimenopausal disturbance; (4) Predictive variables of fatigue included 'perimenopausal disturbance' and 'employed', which together explained 70% of fatigue variance. The current study suggests that we should conduct fatigue assessments for women suffering perimanopausal symptoms on a routine basis. In addition, we should provide fatigue care for women taking long-term medicine or who are currently employed.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Many studies have shown a U-shape association between sleep duration and mortality, but epidemiological evidence linking cardiovascular diseases with habitual sleep patterns is limited and mixed.Methods: We conducted a prospective study on 93 175 older women (aged 50 to 79 years) in the Women's Health Initiative Observational study cohort to examine the risk of ischemic stroke in relation to self-reported sleep duration. Cox models were used to investigate the putative associations, adjusting for multiple sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, depression, snoring, sleepiness symptoms, and other cardiovascular disease-related clinical characteristics.Results: At baseline, 8.3% of subjects had reported their sleep duration as <or=5 hours per night and 4.6% reported long duration of sleep (>or=9 hours/night). After an average of 7.5 years of follow-up, 1166 cases of ischemic stroke had occurred. Multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% CI for ischemic stroke (using a sleep time of 7 hours/night as the reference) were 1.14 (0.97, 1.33), 1.24 (1.04, 1.47), and 1.70 (1.32, 2.21) for women reporting <or=6, 8, and >or=9 hours of sleep. A modestly stronger association with sleep duration <or=6 hours per night (RR, 1.22; 1.03, 1.44) was noted among women without prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline. Our analyses also reveal that the adverse effect of long sleep is likely independent of the increased risk for ischemic stroke associated with frequent snoring and sleepiness (RR, 1.31; 1.00, 1.72).Conclusions: Habitual sleep patterns are important neurobehavioral determinants of risk for ischemic stroke in postmenopausal women. The underlying neurobiology and mechanistic mediators for the putative adverse effect of long sleep (>or=9 hours/night) need further elucidation.

AB  - Patterns of eating, exercise, sleep, and health were investigated across 180 menstrual cycles of 89 women who engaged in sex with a male (n = 45; cycles = 85), a female (n = 21; cycles = 37), or abstained from sex (n = 33; cycles = 58) from January 2005 to December 2007 (10 contributed to 2 groups). Cycles were divided into 5 phases based on their luteinizing hormone surges. Daily questionnaires and saliva for IgA and cortisol analyses were obtained. Women indicated that they ate more (p < .008) and did not sleep as well (p = .02) during their luteal and premenstrual phases. Participants were less likely to experience food cravings and did not satisfy their cravings when they were ovulatory (p < .001). Additionally, a greater proportion of lesbians skipped breakfast (p = .01) and exercised less than heterosexuals (p = .05). Sexually active women had lower cortisol and IgA levels than abstinent women (p = .02). Our study discovered, and confirmed, systematic differences in eating, sleeping, and health patterns across women's menstrual cycles.

AB  - Objective: To further understand state development of preterm infants throughout hospitalization and the effects of selected infant characteristics on state development. Design: Secondary data analysis of a 2-group, experimental design study. Setting: Two nurseries in a Northwest medical center. Participants: Ninety-seven hospitalized, medically stable, preterm infants. Fifty-one subjects were females. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-five real-time video recordings of infants performed during 4 hour interfeeding intervals. Sleep-wake states were coded at 15 second intervals. Results: Active sleep was the dominant state across postmenstrual ages. Although not statistically significant, preterm infants showed developmental changes in state organization with increased quiet sleep, drowsy, and awake, decreased active sleep, and more defined and less diffuse states over age. A significant gender effect was found, with males having less active sleep ( p=.012), more drowsy ( p=.03), more awake ( p=.043), less defined ( p=.002), and more diffuse ( p=.001) states compared with females. Conclusion: The predominance of active sleep during the preterm period reflects level of brain maturation. The results emphasize individual variations in state organization influenced by endogenous and environmental factors. Gender differences are potential sources of individual variation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial of the effect of acupuncture in decreasing hot flashes in peri- and postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Fifty-six women ages 44 to 55 with no menses in the past 3 months and at least four hot flashes per day were recruited from two clinical centers and randomized to one of three treatment groups: usual care (n = 19), sham acupuncture (n = 18), or Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture (n = 19). Acupuncture treatments were scheduled twice weekly for 8 consecutive weeks. The sham acupuncture group received shallow needling in nontherapeutic sites. The Traditional Chinese Medicine acupuncture group received one of four treatments based on a Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis. Usual care participants were instructed to not initiate any new treatments for hot flashes during the study. Daily diaries were used to track frequency and severity of hot flashes. The mean daily index score was based on the number of mild, moderate, and severe hot flashes. Follow-up analyses were adjusted for baseline values, clinical center, age, and body mass index. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in mean frequency of hot flashes between weeks 1 and 8 across all groups (P = 0.01), although the differences between the three study groups were not significant. However, the two acupuncture groups showed a significantly greater decrease than the usual care group (P < 0.05), but did not differ from each other. Results followed a similar pattern for the hot flash index score. There were no significant effects for changes in hot flash interference, sleep, mood, health-related quality of life, or psychological well-being. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest either that there is a strong placebo effect or that both traditional and sham acupuncture significantly reduce hot flash frequency.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) in premenopausal years has adverse implications for skeletal health and quality of life.Design: This was a cross-sectional study of infertile, albeit healthy, mid-reproductive-age women (younger than 42 y) attending an academic infertility practice.Results: Eighty-nine women with varying causes of infertility were prospectively enrolled. Serum (cycle d 1-3) was collected for markers of ovarian reserve, bone metabolism, testosterone, and free androgen index. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed and categorized as low if the Z score was less than -1.0). Infertile women with DOR (n = 28) demonstrated significantly higher serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels (P < 0.001), lower müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) levels (P < 0.001), smaller ovarian dimensions (P < 0.05), lower testosterone levels (P = 0.035), lower free androgen index (P = 0.019), and enhanced bone metabolism (P = 0.003); although the prevalence of low BMD was higher in women with DOR who were younger than 41, this relationship was not of statistical significance (P = 0.106). Women younger than 41 years of age with DOR were significantly more likely to manifest disturbed sleep (P = 0.049) and acknowledge dissatisfaction with sexual intimacy (P = 0.004) compared with those with infertility and normal ovarian reserve. After adjustment for potential confounders, a diagnosis of DOR was significantly associated with low BMD, increased bone turnover, sexual dissatisfaction, and disturbed sleep.Conclusions: Our data suggest that DOR unmasked in the context of infertility evaluation has adverse implications for a woman's well-being that extend well beyond the thus far appreciated reproductive concerns. A decline in ovarian hormones, specifically estrogen and testosterone, concomitant with DOR may be hypothesized as a mechanism that can explain the observed multisystem ramifications of DOR including increased bone turnover, low BMD, sexual distress, and disturbed sleep.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the effects of low-dose transdermal hormone therapy (HT) on systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (BP) evaluated by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in hypertensive postmenopausal women.Methods: The study was conducted on 24 hypertensive postmenopausal women aged, on average, 54 years and under treatment with enalapril maleate (10-20 mg/day) combined or not with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day). Thirteen women used a transdermal adhesive containing estradiol and norethisterone (25 and 125 [mu]g active substance/day, respectively) and 11 did not receive HT. ABPM, lipid profile, and climacteric symptoms were evaluated before and 3 and 6 months after treatment.Results: After 3 and 6 months of follow-up, there was a statistically significant reduction of the Blatt-Kupperman menopausal index in the treated group (19.6+/-8.3 vs. 9.6+/-5.9 vs. 9.7+/-7.0; P=0.01). No significant difference in any of the ABPM variables (areas under the systolic and diastolic curves, mean SBP and DBP, SBP and DBP loads and wakefulness-sleep variation) or in the lipid profile was observed between or within groups at the three time points studied.Conclusion: Low-dose transdermal HT administered for 6 months was effective in improving climacteric symptoms and did not change BP values or circadian pattern in postmenopausal women with mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension taking antihypertensive medications.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To relate reproductive hormones (and the preceding 7-year rates of their change) to objectively and subjectively assessed sleep measures, independent of age, vasomotor symptom frequency, depressive symptoms, and body size. DESIGN: A cross-sectional sleep substudy nested in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal study of the menopausal transition. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: 365 Caucasian, African American, and Chinese women. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep duration, continuity, and architecture were measured during two nights of in-home polysomnography (PSG) studies. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, sleep diaries for medication, vasomotor symptoms, lifestyle information and questionnaires for depressive symptoms. Blood collected annually in the years prior to sleep study was assayed for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and total testosterone (T). More rapid rate of FSH change was significantly associated with higher delta sleep percent, longer total sleep time (TST), but less favorable self-reported sleep quality (PSQI). Baseline E2 was modestly and negatively associated with sleep quality. Women in the lowest total testosterone quartile at baseline had more wake time after sleep onset (WASO) than women in the highest quartile. Lower E2/T ratio, an index reflecting the increasing androgenic environment with the menopause transition, was associated with less WASO. CONCLUSIONS: More rapid rate of FSH change was associated with longer sleep duration but poor sleep quality. Women with higher T or who were closer to the completion of the transition process (as indexed by a lower E2/T) had less sleep discontinuity (less WASO).

AB  - A woman's sleep is impacted by biology (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause), sleep disorders (that may manifest differently than in men), and role in the home and workplace. A Women and Sleep Workshop, sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation, in March 2007 reviewed these topics. It was concluded that understanding the relationship between sleep and gender will result in a scientifically based approach to women's sleep problems.

AB  - Sleep disorders affect women differently than they affect men and may have different manifestations and prevalences. With regard to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately 1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population. This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life, highly effective treatment is available.

AB  - Objective: To test whether black cohosh (BC) exhibits an action on the central endogenous opioid system in postmenopausal women.Design: This was a mechanistic study conducted in the same individuals of luteinizing hormone pulsatility with a saline/naloxone challenge (n = 6) and positron emission tomography with [C]carfentanil, a selective micro-opioid receptor radioligand (n = 5), before and after 12 weeks of unblinded treatment with a popular BC daily supplement.Results: BC treatment for 12 weeks at a standard dose (Remifemin, 40 mg/day) had no effect on spontaneous luteinizing hormone pulsatility or estrogen concentrations. With naloxone blockade, there was an unexpected suppression of mean luteinizing hormone pulse frequency (saline vs naloxone = 9.0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/16 h; P = 0.056), especially during sleep when the mean interpulse interval was prolonged by approximately 90 minutes (saline night interpulse interval = 103 +/- 9 min vs naloxone night interpulse interval = 191 +/- 31 min, P = 0.03). There were significant increases in mu-opioid receptor binding potential in the posterior and subgenual cingulate, temporal and orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and nucleus accumbens ranging from 10% to 61% across brain regions involved in emotional and cognitive function. In contrast, binding potential reductions of lesser magnitude were observed in regions known to be involved in the placebo response (anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortex).Conclusions: Using two different challenge paradigms for the examination of central opioid function, a neuropharmacologic action of BC treatment was demonstrated in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: Most menopausal women report vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats). However, not all women with vasomotor symptoms, including frequent symptoms, are bothered by them. The primary aim was to identify correlates of vasomotor symptom bother beyond symptom frequency.Design: The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation participants reporting vasomotor symptoms at annual visit 7 comprised the sample (N = 1,042). Assessments included hot flash and night sweats frequency (number per week) and bother (1, not at all- 4, very much). Negative affect (index of depressive symptoms, anxiety, perceived stress, negative mood), symptom sensitivity, sleep problems, and vasomotor symptom duration (number of years) were examined cross-sectionally in relation to bother in ordinal logistic regression models with symptom frequency and covariates. Hot flashes and night sweats were considered separately.Results: In multivariable models controlling for hot flash frequency, negative affect (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08-1.51), symptom sensitivity (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.37), sleep problems (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.04-1.85), poorer health (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.03-1.48), duration of hot flashes (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06-1.23), younger age (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89-0.99), and African American race (vs white, OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.12-2.26) were associated with hot flash bother. After controlling for night sweats frequency and covariates, sleep problems (OR = 1.84, 95% CI:1.33-2.55) and night sweats duration (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20) were associated with night sweats bother.Conclusions: Beyond frequency, factors associated with bothersome hot flashes include mood, symptom sensitivity, symptom duration, sleep problems, age, and race. Correlates of bothersome night sweats include sleep problems and symptom duration. In addition to reducing frequency, interventions for vasomotor symptoms might consider addressing modifiable factors related to symptom bother.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease risk rises sharply with menopause, likely due to the coincident increase in insulin resistance and related atherogenic changes that together comprise the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome, a cluster of metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities strongly implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. A growing body of research suggests that traditional mind-body practices such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong may offer safe and cost-effective strategies for reducing insulin resistance syndrome-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease in older populations, including postmenopausal women. Current evidence suggests that these practices may reduce insulin resistance and related physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease; improve mood, well-being, and sleep; decrease sympathetic activation; and enhance cardiovagal function. However, additional rigorous studies are needed to confirm existing findings and to examine long-term effects on cardiovascular health.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare heart rate variability (HRV) in low-risk, pre-term infants to one infant diagnosed with intraventricular hemorrhate (IVH).Method: A case study design was used to compare HRV of one subject diagnosed with IVH to a convenience sample of 38 low-risk, pre-term infants at 30 and 31 post-menstrual weeks of age. Heart periods were recorded for 300-s with the infant in an active sleep state. Heart rate variability was quantified by spectral analysis. A confidence interval comparison of the total spectral components (0.02-0.20 Hz), high-frequency components (0.20-2.0 Hz), and the low-frequency componenents (0.02-0.20 Hz) was conducted.Findings: At 30 wees' post-menstrual age, 10 days following diagnosis, with a grad-III IVH, the low frequency components were above the 90th percentile range, and the total and high frequency components were at or below the 25th percentile range of the confidence intervals for the low-risk, pre-term infants.Discussion: The neurobehavioral organization of pre-term infants is limited due to prematurity and the cumulative effect of medical complications (such as IVH). This study has implications for the use of HRV in the identification of infants diagnosed with IVH.

AB  - This descriptive study examined the perceptions of a group of breast cancer survivors about the causes of their hot flashes. Thirty-nine participants readily offered 1,008 individual responses. A content analysis revealed four prominent categories (stress, pain, medication related, and lack of sleep) as well as others (e.g., food related, heat related). In the context of concerns about biomedical approaches to hot flash treatment (specifically hormone therapy [HT]), inconsistent data regarding nonhormonal treatment options, and the many psychosocial factors identified as related to the hot flash experience, the benefits of identifying and addressing women's perceptions in developing effective treatment plans are discussed.

AB  - Research indicates that desvenlafaxine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may serve as possible treatment for moderate to severe hot flashes.In a national survey of menopausal women, hot flashes (70%) led the top four reasons for seeking medical attention, followed by night sweats (68%), mood disturbances (50%), and sleep disturbances (49%).Science is eyeing various options for managing vasomotor symptoms associated with peri/postmenopause. Such studied methods include paced respiration, use of isoflavones or phytoestrogens, and antidepressants.

AB  - Objective: Severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common distressing disorder in women that manifests during the premenstrual (late-luteal) phase of the ovulatory menstrual cycle. There is some evidence that altered autonomic function may be an important component of PMS, but few studies have used heart rate variability (HRV) as a sensitive marker of autonomic activity in severe PMS, and findings are conflicting.Methods: We investigated HRV during sleep, a state that is relatively free of external disruptions, in 9 women with severe PMS and 12 controls.Results: The normal-to-normal (NN) RR interval was shorter during the sleep period in women with PMS than in controls in both the follicular and the late-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. The standard deviation of all NN intervals, a measure of total variability in the interbeat interval, was lower during the sleep period in the late-luteal phase than in the follicular phase in women with PMS. The square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals, a measure reflecting high-frequency (HF) activity, showed a similar pattern. HF power, a marker of parasympathetic activity, was lower during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and REM sleep in the late-luteal phase than in the follicular phase in women with severe PMS. Controls had a shorter NN interval, but similar HRV measures, in the late-luteal phase compared with the follicular phase.Conclusion: These results suggest that women with severe PMS have decreased parasympathetic activity during sleep in association with their premenstrual symptoms in the late-luteal phase compared with the follicular phase when they are symptom-free.

AB  - Objective: To study the effects of postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) on nocturnal nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV).Design: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 71 healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women received either transdermal estradiol or placebo for 3 months. After a washout period of 1 month, the treatments were reversed. Sleep studies were performed after both treatment periods. One steady-state epoch per night of the awake state, stage 2 (light) non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, stage 3-4 (deep) non-REM sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep was extracted. From the electrocardiogram, nonlinear HRV was analyzed as the fractal scaling exponents [alpha]1 and [alpha]2, approximate entropy (ApEn), and the Poincare plot variability coefficients SD1 and SD2. These were correlated to ET use in both different sleep stages and averaged across all sleep stages.Results: During ET, the nocturnal ApEn decreased from 0.80 +/- 0.01 to 0.74 +/- 0.02 (P < 0.05), the most marked reduction occurring during slow-wave sleep (from 0.77 +/- 0.05 to 0.63 +/- 0.06, P < 0.05). In addition, SD2 decreased in slow-wave sleep and REM sleep during ET (P < 0.05 for both). In light non-REM sleep, [alpha]1 slightly increased during ET (P < 0.05).Conclusions: ET has a slightly but distinctively attenuating effect on some nocturnal nonlinear measures of HRV, especially on complexity of heart rate dynamics. This implies that ET may have potentially deleterious effects on cardiovascular health during sleep.

AB  - Study Objectives: Examine age-adjusted odds and racial/ethnic differences in self-reported difficulties falling and staying asleep and early morning awakening in midlife women to determine whether difficulty sleeping increased with progression through the menopausal transition.Design: Longitudinal analysis.Setting: Community-based.Participants: 3,045 Caucasian, African American, Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic women, aged 42-52 years and pre- or early peri-menopausal at baseline, participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).Interventions: None.Measurements and Results: Self-reported number of nights of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and early morning awakening during the previous 2 weeks were obtained at baseline and 7 annual assessments. Random effects logistic regression was used to model associations between each of the 3 sleep measures and the menopausal transition, defined by bleeding patterns, vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and estradiol (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep increased through the menopausal transition, but decreased for early morning awakening from late perimenopause to postmenopause. Naturally and surgically postmenopausal women using hormones, compared with those who were not, generally had lower ORs for disturbed sleep. More frequent VMS were associated with higher ORs of each sleep difficulty. Decreasing E2 levels were associated with higher ORs of trouble falling and staying asleep, and increasing FSH levels were associated with higher ORs of trouble staying asleep. Racial/ethnic differences were found for staying asleep and early morning awakening.Conclusions: Progression through the menopausal transition as indicated by 3 menopausal characteristics -- symptoms, bleeding-defined stages, and endogenous hormone levels -- is associated with self-reported sleep disturbances.

AB  - Study objectives: To determine associations between menopausal status, reproductive hormone levels, menopausal symptoms, and poor sleep quality.Design: The present study examines subjective sleep quality over an 8-year period in participants in an ongoing longitudinal study of ovarian aging in a randomly identified cohort of African American and Caucasian women.Participants: The Penn Ovarian Aging Study, a population-based cohort of 436 women from Philadelphia County who were 35 to 47 years of age and had regular menstrual cycles at enrollment.Interventions: N/A.Measurements and results: The primary outcome measure was the Sleep Quality factor score, derived from the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire, which was adapted for this population and collected at each assessment period over the 8-year follow-up. Associations between menopausal status, reproductive hormone levels, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, age, and race were examined in multivariable linear mixed regression models for repeated measures. Menopausal status was not significantly associated with sleep quality (P = 0.12). In the adjusted model, independent predictors of sleep quality were hot flashes (P < 0.0001), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale scores (P < 0.0001) and levels of the reproductive hormone inhibin B (P = 0.05).Conclusions: Sleep quality was predicted by hormone levels and symptoms that occur in the menopausal transition but did not worsen with advancing menopausal status alone. Lower inhibin B levels, hot flashes, and symptoms of depression were all strong and independent predictors of difficulty sleeping. Race was not a significant contributor to sleep quality. Together, the findings demonstrate that women who experience other perimenopausal symptoms are likely to experience sleep problems during the menopausal transition.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a pollen-based herbal medicinal product, Femal(R) (Sea-Band Ltd, Leicestershire, UK), on premenstrual sleep disturbances (PSD) in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). METHODS: Femal, 160 mg twice-daily, was given for four menstrual cycles to 50 women, and placebo to 51 women. PSD were evaluated on a visual analogue scale prior to and after the four cycles. The effect on overall PMS symptoms was assessed with the Steiner premenstrual tension syndrome (PMTS) self-rating questionnaire. The results were analysed statistically based on intention to treat. RESULTS: Femal treatment resulted in a significant reduction in PSD (P<0.05) whereas placebo had no significant effect (P>0.05). In a subgroup analysis of women with irritability as their main PMS symptom cluster, the reduction of PSD was even more pronounced (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in overall degree of PMS symptom reduction between Femal and placebo when all participating women were evaluated (P>0.05). However, in women with irritability as their main PMS symptom cluster, Femal treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the Steiner score (P<0.05). The frequency of adverse events was not significantly different in women on Femal compared to women on placebo (P>0.05). No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: Femal treatment reduced PSD to a significant degree, particularly in women with irritability as their main PMS symptom. Femal treatment also reduced overall PMS symptoms in women with irritability (but not dysphoria) as their main PMS symptom. The safety of Femal and its efficacy in PSD and other symptoms in women with irritability as the main symptom cluster makes this herbal medicinal product a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal for women with PMS.

AB  - Nocturia is a very common problem in women. Nocturnal voiding episode is associated with health status in women. To know the factors associated with nocturnal voiding is important for health care providers. However, the available literature on this topic is sparse. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the relationship between sleep pattern, fluid intake volume after dinner, medical history, medications, age, years after menopause and nocturnal voiding episodes per night within the last week. We conducted a cross-sectional face-to-face questionnaire interview of 179 women who were participating in a health screening program at a family doctor practice. The results showed that the mean age of the participants was 48 ± 12.70 years (range 28-81) and among them, 144 (81%) reported nocturnal voiding >/= 1/night, 65 (36.5%) reported it >/= 2/night and 24 (13.5%) reported it >/= 3/night. Using multivariate logistic models, the significant independent correlates of having >/= 1 nocturnal voids (vs. 0) was poor sleep (OR =6.06), of having > 2 nocturnal voids (vs. </= 2) were poor sleep and menopause (OR = 3.57 and 3.00, respectively), and of having >/= 3 nocturnal voids (vs. < 3) were the fluid volume drunk after dinner > 500cc vs </= 250cc (OR = 6.00) and leg edema (OR = 4.32). The findings of this study should help health care providers to understand the factors associated with nocturnal voiding in women, allow the provision of appropriate intervention and allow implementation of professional nursing.

AB  - Background. Although it is widely acknowledged women experience symptoms during their transition from reproductive to postreproductive stage, there is inconsistency as to the prevalence of symptoms as well as their severity ratings. Aim and objectives. The purpose of this study was to describe symptom perception and severity in mid-life women volunteering for an intervention study for menopause symptom management. Design. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to provide data on presenting symptoms in a sample of women negotiating the menopausal transition. Methods. A community-based sample of Caucasian women aged 43–55 years was recruited from national nursing media, local media and a variety of local community sources. A screening questionnaire was administered to determine qualification for study entry based upon symptom severity scores from the questionnaire. This report includes results from the screening questionnaire. Results. One hundred and sixty-five women were screened to obtain 110 qualified participants with mean age of 49·3 SD 3·04 years who were 4·7 SD 7 months past their last menstrual period. Sleep difficulties, forgetfulness and irritability were perceived by the highest number of women while sleep difficulties, night sweats, irritability and forgetfulness were rated the most severe. Conclusions. Findings from this study expand understanding of the menopause symptom experience, because few reports include symptom severity reports. All aspects of the symptom experience are necessary to develop appropriate interventions and to evaluate them. Relevance to clinical practice. Providing education about menopause symptoms is central to nursing practice of mid-life women. Therefore, nurses must keep abreast of current knowledge to prepare women for their transition to postreproductive phase or to reassure women who are surprised to find hot flashes are not the only symptoms encountered.

AB  - Menopause is the time of life when menstrual cycles cease, and is caused by reduced secretion of the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Although menopause is a normal event for women, individual experiences vary, and some women seek medical advice for the management of symptoms. Many symptoms have been attributed to menopause, but only vasomotor dysfunction and vaginal dryness are consistently associated with this time of life in epidemiological studies. Other common symptoms such as mood changes, sleep disturbances, urinary incontinence, cognitive changes, somatic complaints, sexual dysfunction, and reduced quality of life may be secondary to other symptoms, or related to other causes. Trials of therapies for vasomotor dysfunction have shown improvements with oestrogen, gabapentin, paroxetine, and clonidine, but little or no benefit with other agents; adverse effects of these treatments must also be considered. Many questions about menopausal transition and its effects on health have not been adequately addressed.

AB  - Objective: To study the types and frequency of problems related to menstruation in adolescent girls and the effect of these problems on daily routine.Methods: Girls in the age group 13-19 years who had had menarche for at least one year at the time of study. 198 adolescent girls have been studied. Data was collected by personal interviews on a pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire. The questions covered menstrual problems, regularity of menses in last three cycles of menstruation and the effect of these problems on the daily routine. Analysis was done using SPSS version 12. Percentages were calculated for drawing inferences.Results: More than a third (35.9%) of the study subjects were in the age group 13-15 years followed by 17-19 years, 15-17 years respectively. Mean age of study participants was calculated to be 16.2 years. Dysmenorrhea (67.2%) was the commonest problem and (63.1%) had one or the other symptoms of Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). Other related problems were present in 55.1% of study subjects. Daily routine of 60% girls was affected due to prolonged bed rest, missed social activities/commitments, disturbed sleep and decreased appetite. 17.24% had to miss a class and 25% had to abstain from work. Mothers and friends were the most common source of information on the issue.Conclusion: Screen adolescent girls for menstruation related problems and provide them with counseling services and relevant information on possible treatment options. Besides, there is a need to emphasize on designing menstrual health programmes for adolescents.

AB  - Sex hormones have a pronounced effect on arginine vasopressin (AVP), and therefore on the diurnal water homeostasis. Low and high levels of plasma-estradiol as seen in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle may therefore alter the diurnal regulation of urine production. Furthermore the structural resemblance of oxytocin to vasopressin has led to speculations about the possible antidiuretic properties of oxytocin under normal physiological conditions. To elucidate the influence of high and low p-estradiol on the regulation of the diurnal urine production, 15 normal menstruating women (21-33 y) underwent two circadian in-patient investigations, both situated in follicular phase.~Background~Background~Admitting the participants solely in the follicular phase resulted in high and low plasma-estradiol whereas plasma-progesterone was similar. Urine and blood samples were taken at predetermined time points to determine plasma AVP, plasma oxytocin, plasma aldosterone, plasma natriuretic peptide (ANP), urinary solute excretions, and urinary excretions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) and aquaporin-2 (AQP-2). Blood pressure was measured every hour.~Methods~Methods~Plasma AVP, plasma aldosterone and plasma ANP were unaffected by the different levels of estradiol. All had marked circadian variations whereas oxytocin did not display any circadian rhythm. High estradiol resulted in lower p-osmolality and p-sodium reflecting the downward resetting of the osmoreceptors. Oxytocin did not correlate with either diuresis or urine osmolality. The diurnal urine production was similar in the two groups as were urine osmolality, excretion of PGE-2 and AQP-2. AQP-2 does not have a circadian rhythm and is not significantly correlated to either AVP or oxytocin under normal physiological conditions.~Results~Results~High and low level of estradiol has no influence on the circadian rhythm of AVP or the subsequent urine production. High p-estradiol resets the osmoreceptors for AVP release. Furthermore it appears that oxytocin under normal physiological conditions do not contribute to the overall antidiuretic effect.~Conclusion~Conclusions

AB  - Depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance and chronic illness are seldom studied together. Depression is higher in women and insomnia is a common sleep problem for women. Both are nurse-managed symptoms. This dissertation first proposes a theoretical nursing perspective of insomnia guided by four theoretical perspectives. The concepts from these perspectives were incorporated into a proposed model focused on mechanisms of insomnia and insomnia symptom experience.The research involved a community-based sample of 347 healthy, ethnically diverse, premenopausal women between 40--50 years of age. The purpose was to describe patterns of depressive symptoms across time as a function of fixed demographic factors and time-varying biological and social factors, and describe the relationship between depressive symptoms and physical illness. The women with hypertension provided a group with a chronic physical illness.Longitudinal data included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies---Depression (CES-D) scale, investigator-designed questionnaires about sociodemographics, medical history, and health problems, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, social support subscale of the Interpersonal Relationships Inventory, and the health perception item from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form. Biometric measures included: follicle stimulating hormone assays, blood pressure, and height and weight for calculating body mass index (BMI). Group comparisons used t-tests, ANOVA, chi square, and Mann-Whitney U.Negative binomial regression was used for analysis of CES-D due to its skewed distribution in this sample. A significant model of predictors of CES-D scores was identified. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was 30% at study initiation and 26% at 30 months. Predictors of high CES-D scores were poor sleep quality, presence of chronic illness at 30 months, high BMI, and the interaction of time and poor sleep quality. Time, having a partner, positive social support and the interaction of time with low BMI predicted low CES-D scores.A higher proportion of African American women scored >=16 on the CES-D. Number of health conditions, presence of chronic illness, and hypertension were significantly higher for women scoring >=16 on CES-D compared to women scoring <16. Chronic illness was reported by 30.8% African Americans compared to 26.4% European Americans and 15.8% Latinas. Research and clinical implications were identified.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the effect of nursing caregiving on infant sleep-wake states by gender in preterm infants. DESIGN: Descriptive measures at 34 weeks postmenstrual age and at discharge. SAMPLE: Twenty-two hospitalized preterm infants. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: Infant state and caregiving episodes were coded in 15-second intervals from video recordings of approximately three hours duration. Time plots of state and caregiving were analyzed visually to summarize spontaneous state changes and state change associated with caregiving. RESULTS: Sleep and wake state distribution did not differ statistically by gender; however, the rate of state change in male infants was twice that of females (p=.012) at discharge. At discharge, male infants received approximately twice as many care episodes as females. At discharge, the rate of state change in response to caregiving in male infants was four times that of female infants (p=.026). Males exhibited a greater percentage of caregiving episodes related to state change than did females at discharge (p=.018). Findings suggest further exploration of possible gender differences in state regulation and state change in response to caregiving.

AB  - Background: Recent research has established correlations between stress, anxiety, insomnia and excess body weight and these correlations have significant implications for health. This study measured the effects of a proprietary blend of extracts of Magnolia officinalis and Phellodendron amurense (Relora®) on anxiety, stress and sleep in healthy premenopausal women. Methods: This randomized, parallel, placebo controlled clinical study was conducted with healthy, overweight (BMI 25 to 34.9), premenopausal female adults, between the ages of 20 and 50 years, who typically eat more in response to stressful situations and scores above the national mean for women on self-reporting anxiety. The intervention was Relora (250 mg capsules) or identical placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks. Anxiety as measured by the Spielberger STATE-TRAIT questionnaires, salivary amylase and cortisol levels, Likert Scales/Visual Analog Scores for sleep quality and latency, appetite, and clinical markers of safety. The study was conducted by Miami Research Associates, a clinical research organization in Miami, FL. Results: The intent-to-treat population consisted of 40 subjects with 26 participants completing the study. There were no significant adverse events. Relora was effective, in comparison to placebo, in reducing temporary, transitory anxiety as measured by the Spielberger STATE anxiety questionnaire. It was not effective in reducing long-standing feelings of anxiety or depression as measured using the Spielberger TRAIT questionnaire. Other assessments conducted in this study including salivary cortisol and amylase levels, appetite, body morphology and sleep quality/latency were not significantly changed by Relora in comparison to placebo. Conclusion: This pilot study indicates that Relora may offer some relief for premenopausal women experiencing mild transitory anxiety. There were no safety concerns or significant adverse events observed in this study.

AB  - Current evidence shows that sleep-wake disturbances are a persistent problem in women surviving breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to refine the knowledge regarding the incidence, prevalence, and predictive factors of sleep-wake disturbances in breast cancer survivors (BCS) compared to age-matched women without breast cancer (WWBC).The cross-sectional, convenience-sample consisted of secondary data from BCS and WWBC who were recruited by two parent quality of life studies. Subjects were matched within +/- 5 years of age. The sample consisted of 246 BCS and 246 WWBC who were a mean age of 48 years old (SD=8.50), Caucasian (70%), employed (69%), married or partnered (76%), postmenopausal (59%), with a college education (56%), and with at least one concurrent medical problem (95%).Results showed that BCS had more prevalent sleep-wake disturbances (65%) compared to WWBC (55%). The poorest sleepers were BCS, with hot flashes, poor physical functioning, depressive symptoms, and with moderate or high levels of distress related to a life event. BCS had higher PSQI scores indicating poorer sleep quality and higher sleep disturbances compared to WWBC. Predictors of the severity of poor sleep quality and sleep disturbances were BCS, with a higher number of co-morbidities, hot flashes, lower levels of physical functioning, higher depressive symptoms, and greater impact of a life event. Disease and treatment related factors did not predict poor sleep or sleep quality in BCS.Sleep disturbances are a problem in long-term BCS. Knowledge of contributing factors provides useful information during clinical evaluations and treatment of BCS reporting poor sleep. Additional research is needed to determine the impact of poor sleep on quality of life and develop/test effective interventions for long-term BCS.

AB  - Overall well-being, sleep and exercise patterns were investigated in women between the ages of 18 and 36 years with natural hormone profiles (n = 12), and women using oral contraceptives (n = 12) or Depo-Provera (n = 12) from January 18, 2005 to December 7, 2005. Daily questionnaires on the above variables were obtained across 3 menstrual cycles (108 cycles). Women using hormonal contraception reported more overall negative well-being than women with natural hormone profiles (p = .038). Positive well-being at mid-cycle was positively correlated with increased sleep by the natural hormone (p < .05) and oral contraception groups (p < .05) but not by the Depo-Provera group. Women with natural hormone profiles walked more when they reported decreased well-being. Our findings indicate that the use of Depo-Provera interferes with the natural relations between sleep, cycle phase and well-being.

AB  - Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), commonly called hot flashes or flushes (HFs) and night sweats, are the menopausal symptoms for which women seek treatment during menopause most often. VMS are a form of temperature dysfunction that occurs due to changes in gonadal hormones. Normally, core body temperature (CBT) remains within a specific range, oscillating with daily circadian rhythms. Physiological processes that conserve and dissipate heat are responsible for maintaining CBT, and tight regulation is important for maintenance of optimal internal organ function. Disruption of this tightly controlled temperature circuit results in exaggerated heat-loss responses and presents as VMS. The mechanistic role related to changes in gonadal hormones associated with VMS is not understood. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and other menopausal symptoms. Estrogens are known potent neuromodulators of numerous neuronal circuits throughout the central nervous system. Changing estrogen levels during menopause may impact multiple components involved in maintaining temperature homeostasis. Understanding the pathways and mechanisms involved in temperature regulation, probable causes of thermoregulatory dysfunction, and 'brain adaptation' will guide drug discovery efforts. This review considers the processes and pathways involved in normal temperature regulation and the impact of fluctuating and declining hormones that result in VMS during the menopausal transition.

AB  - Objective: This review examines the available data on the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for treating the commonly missed climacteric symptoms of menopause. Discussion: Although some women may pass through the menopausal transition phase with few or no symptoms, the majority experience one or more symptoms serious enough to be disruptive to their lives. The most common are vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flushes and night sweats), but they are not the only climacteric symptoms that can negatively affect quality of life. The 'missed symptoms' of menopause - symptoms with high prevalence and an impact on quality of life that nonetheless receive less attention than do VMS - include mood changes, sleep disturbances and somatic complaints. These symptoms are reported by approximately half of menopausal women, with numbers varying by region and ethnic background. As with VMS, the effects of declining oestrogen levels on serotonin/noradrenaline pathways could play a role in their development. Conclusions: Results from pilot studies of several SSRIs and SNRIs suggest that they may improve menopausal mood and sleep symptoms, but few studies have demonstrated significant improvement compared with placebo. One SNRI (venlafaxine) improved menopausal mood symptoms and two SSRIs (citalopram and paroxetine) improved sleep, each in a single placebo-controlled trial of women with VMS. Additional placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine whether SSRIs or SNRIs are effective treatment options for women who cannot or choose not to use hormone therapy.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Assessment of relationships between polysomnographic sleep, sex hormones, and core body temperature in postmenopausal women. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten women aged 57 to 71 years, at least 5 years past menopause. SETTING: Laboratory of Human Chronobiology at Weill Cornell Medical College. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Lower estradiol (E2) and higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were significantly correlated with indices of poor sleep quality. Relationships between LH and polysomnographic variables were more robust than those for E2. Significant increases from basal LH levels (i.e., LH pulses) occurred more frequently after sleep onset than prior to sleep onset, and 30 of 32 of these LH pulses occurred prior to long awakenings from sleep. In addition, higher body core temperature prior to and during sleep was significantly correlated with poorer sleep efficiency and higher LH levels. CONCLUSIONS: Most investigations of relationships between sleep, sex hormones, and body temperature have focused on perimenopausal women, menopausal phenomena such as hot flashes, the role of declining estrogen, and treatment with exogenous estrogen. The current results suggest that altered levels of both sex steroids and gonadotropins may contribute to sleep disturbance in older women and confirm the results of previous studies indicating that higher body core temperature is associated with poorer sleep quality, even in women without vasomotor symptoms. The findings also raise the possibility of alternate treatment avenues for menopause- and age-related sleep disturbance that focus on altering LH levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of seizure occurrence with candidate seizure precipitants in a prospective diary study, and to determine the relationship of precipitants to seizure self-prediction. METHODS: Eligible subjects were 18 or older, had localization-related epilepsy, at least one seizure within 12 months, and were able to maintain a daily diary. Information collected included the occurrence, time and characteristics of all seizures, hours of sleep, medication compliance, stress, anxiety, alcohol use, menstruation, and seizure self-prediction. Each night, subjects reported their estimate of the likelihood of a seizure the next day (self-prediction). Logit-normal models with a random subject-specific intercept were used to estimate an OR for the association of precipitants with seizure occurrence. RESULTS: Seventy-one subjects returned 15,179 complete diary days. For each hour of increased sleep on the preceding night, the relative odds of a seizure the following day decreased (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82, 0.99). One-unit increments of stress and anxiety (on a 10-point scale) were associated with an increased risk of seizure the following day (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01, 1.12 and OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.02, 1.12). With self-prediction included in the model, self-prediction (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.8, 7.2) and hours of sleep for the night prior to the seizure (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82, 0.99) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Lack of sleep and higher self-reported stress and anxiety levels were associated with seizure occurrence. In a model that included self-prediction, less sleep, and self-prediction had significant effects, whereas stress and anxiety did not. The psychological and biologic mechanisms which link stress and anxiety to self-prediction of seizures requires further exploration. Ultimately, seizure prediction based on precipitants, premonitory features, and self-prediction may provide a foundation for preemptive treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To monitor preterm infants in a cot and a car seat and compare an observed car seat trial with polysomnography (PSG). DESIGN: Non-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Regional neonatal unit. PATIENTS: Preterm infants before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Nap PSG respiratory and sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. RESULTS: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. CONCLUSIONS: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Menopause Symptoms Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, an eight-item questionnaire with a 4-week recall period, was developed to assess women's satisfaction with treatment for symptoms associated with menopause. We describe the development and initial testing of the scale. DESIGN: Following standard instrument-development procedures, focus groups were conducted with menopausal women experiencing hot flushes to generate potential constructs. Multiple items were drafted to address each construct. An iterative process of cognitive testing, item revision, and item reduction was followed to identify the most appropriate items and optimal response scales. The psychometric validation of the questionnaire used data collected through a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study including 543 postmenopausal women. Psychometric analyses were conducted to explore potential item reduction and to address questionnaire scaling and scoring. Internal consistency reliability, construct validity, and discriminant validity of the new scale were also examined. RESULTS: The questionnaire includes items addressing the control of daytime and nighttime hot flushes; effects of treatment on sleep, mood, libido, and cognition; medication tolerability; and overall satisfaction. Correlation analyses indicated that the items are related to each other without being overly redundant and that the item set is best described using a one-factor model. The subsequent scale score demonstrated sound internal consistency reliability, strong construct validity, and good discriminant validity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the development and initial validation are favorable. It is expected that the questionnaire will prove to be a worthwhile tool for assessing women's satisfaction with treatment for menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Menopause is a natural process that occurs in women's lives as part of normal aging. Many women go through the menopausal transition with few or no symptoms, while some have significant or even disabling symptoms. The purpose of this paper is to describe the menopausal symptom experience of 135 urban methadone-maintained midlife women between the ages of 40 and 55 years. A cross-sectional survey comprising sample characteristic questions and a 14-item menopause symptom checklist was administered. Ninety-six percent reported one or more symptoms with a mean of 6.2 symptoms. Symptom reporting was found to be relatively high, with more than half of the sample reporting hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, joint pains, and fatigue in the two weeks preceding the survey. However, the psychological symptoms (irritability and depression) were the two most common symptoms in this sample. This study documents a relatively heavy burden of symptoms in an aging cohort of methadone-maintained women. The physical and psychological impact of aging and, in particular, the experience of menopause in these women is rarely studied and poorly understood. This gap in critical knowledge is further complicated by the remarkable similarity of many symptoms associated with menopause and opiate withdrawal. Aging, drug-related health problems, and poor access to health care further complicate the picture and underscore the importance of better integration of health care with social work intervention.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Women with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) commonly report sleep disturbances, but the few studies using conventional polysomnographic measures have produced conflicting results. We investigated sleep quality and sleep composition using conventional and quantitative electroencephalographic analyses in women with severe PMS, as compared with that of controls. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Women (aged 18-40 years) were screened to ensure that their PMS symptoms were severe and that they had ovulatory menstrual cycles. Nine women with PMS or PMDD and 12 asymptomatic control subjects then had laboratory-based polysomnographic recordings at 2 phases of the menstrual cycle: follicular phase and late luteal (premenstrual) phase. RESULTS: Women with severe PMS reported a significantly poorer subjective sleep quality during the late luteal phase (P = 0.02), but there was no evidence of disturbed sleep based on the polysomnogram specific to premenstrual symptom expression: both groups of women had increased wakefulness after sleep onset (P = 0.02) and increased sigma power (P < 0.01), especially in the 14-to 15-Hz band during non-rapid eye movement sleep, in the late luteal phase compared with the follicular phase. There were, however, some group differences in electroencephalographic measures regardless of menstrual phase, including decreased delta incidence (P = 0.02) and increased theta incidence and amplitude (P < 0.05) in women with PMS, suggesting the possibility of sleep electroencephalogram trait markers in women with PMS. CONCLUSION: Perceived poor quality sleep is a characteristic of severe PMS, but sleep composition based on polysomnographic measures and quantitative electroencephalographic analysis does not differ in association with premenstrual symptom expression in the late luteal phase.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of hormone therapy (HT) on cognition and subjective quality of life (QoL) in recently postmenopausal women with cognitive complaints. METHODS: Cognitive Complaints in Early Menopause Trial (COGENT) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, pilot study of 180 healthy postmenopausal women aged 45 to 55 years, randomly assigned to receive either placebo or conjugated equine estrogen 0.625 mg/medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg for 4 months. Outcome measures included memory, subjective cognition, QoL, sexuality, and sleep, which were assessed at baseline and month 4. RESULTS: The study was terminated before the expected final sample size of 275 due to a decrease in enrollment coinciding with the publication of findings from the Women's Health Initiative. There were no differences between groups on any cognitive or QoL measures, except for an increase in sexual interest and thoughts with HT. Modest negative effects on short- and long-term verbal memory approached significance (p < 0.10). Women with baseline vasomotor symptoms (VMS) showed a decrease in VMS and an improvement in general QoL, but no cognitive benefit vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS: With the power to detect an effect size of >or=0.45, this study suggests potential modest negative effects on verbal memory that are consistent with previous hormone therapy trials in older women.

AB  - The purposes of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine 30 mg/daily for 12 weeks to reduce hot flushes (HF) in women with previous breast cancer and to assess the influence of the same treatment on sleep quality and other menopausal symptoms. A prospective pilot trial was conducted in 40 breast cancer patients with at least seven HF per day. A HF diary was completed daily; sleep quality and other menopausal symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the SF-36 Health Survey. Treatment was never started by 13 out of 40 patients (32.5%) and was interrupted by 7 out of 27 patients (25%) due to of the occurrence of side effects (mostly somnolence). In the remaining 20 patients who completed the three months treatment period, there was a 55.6% (p < 0.05) reduction in HF frequency and 61.9% (p < 0.05) reduction in HF score as compared to baseline. A significant reduction in the MRS score (32.8%; p < 0.05) was observed. Mirtazapine appears to be effective in reducing HF in breast cancer survivors. The more frequent side effect was somnolence. A sizeable compiliance problem has been observed due to the reluctance to take antidepressant drugs and to side effects.

AB  - Urinary incontinence (UI) is the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine; it may bring about several hygiene and social problems. The purpose of this study was to characterize urinary symptoms and to correlate them with the quality of life of 34 women with UI, describing their social-economic, gynecological and obstetric profile. Participants - mean age 55 years old, 76.4% in post-menopause - had their gynecological and obstetric history examined and were interviewed using the King's Health Questionnaire (duly translated into Portuguese and validated). More than 3/4 (79%) of the women reported stress UI affected their lives and 44% complained of urge-incontinence. Most women considered negative the impact of UI on their health. Participants reported it little affected the quality of daily life activities, as well as their physical and social life. When considering the interference of symptoms on their lives, a strong correlation was found between enuresis and poor sleep/energy (r=0,65; p=0,0001) and between urge and emotional disturbances (r=0,67; p=0,0001).

AB  - The health consequences of obesity include increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea, cancer, osteoarthritis, and mental health problems. Postmenopausal women have reached an age when the incidence of chronic health conditions becomes more prevalent. In addition to physical disease risks, a lifetime of ridicule and disrespect may seriously and adversely affect general and health-related quality of life. Thus, obese postmenopausal women stand at a crossroads between living the remainder of their lives in essentially good health or facing the likely onset of chronic diseases that might have been prevented. This article reviews the effects of obesity that have particular relevance for postmenopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To identify the decision-making needs of women about the use of natural health products (NHP) at menopause and to develop a decision aid responsive to their needs. Design: A qualitative study using focus groups, key informant interviews and group consultation. Content analysis was guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. Methods: Six focus groups with menopausal women aged 45 to 64 (n = 40) and key informant interviews (n = 15; physicians, nurses, women' s advocacy group, NHP stores owners, pharmacists, policy makers) were conducted in two Canadian cities. Two groups of menopausal women (n = 11) were consulted to obtain feedback on the acceptability of the new patient decision aid. Results: The most common difficult decisions identified by women were: whether or not to take NHP; which NHP to choose; and whether or not to take anything for menopausal symptoms. In addition, key informants identified the challenge of choosing between hormone therapy and NHP for menopausal symptoms. The main sources of difficulty in making these decisions were the following: (1) inadequate knowledge and unrealistic expectations associated with NHP; (2) closed mindedness of physicians to discussion about NHP; (3) conflicting opinions of others; (4) inadequate resources to support NHP decision-making (e.g., information, finances, time); and (5) menopausal symptoms interfering with decision-making (e.g., lack of sleep due to hot flashes). To facilitate decision making, participants suggested the need for information about available choices, tighter regulation of NHP by the government, and access to health professionals conversant in NHP and medical options. The patient decision aid was developed according to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards and based on women' s identified needs. Women described the aid as easy to understand and useful for considering the decisions about NHP. Conclusions: Middle-age women reported difficulty when facing decisions about the use of NHP. Many sources of difficulty could be addressed in the patient decision aid. Subsequent studies should evaluate the effect of this decision aid on the decision-making process of women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sources of sleep complaints in peri- and postmenopausal women reporting disturbed sleep. DESIGN: A total of 102 women, ages 44 to 56 years, who reported disturbed sleep were recruited through newspaper advertisements. They were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales. Complete polysomnography was performed in a controlled laboratory setting. Results were analyzed by multiple regression. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of the women had apnea, restless legs, or both. The best predictors of objective sleep quality (laboratory sleep efficiency) were apneas, periodic limb movements, and arousals (R=0.44, P<0.0001). The best predictors of subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score) were the Hamilton anxiety score and the number of hot flashes in the first half of the night (R=0.19, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Primary sleep disorders (apnea and restless legs syndrome) are common in this population. Amelioration of hot flashes may reduce some complaints of poor sleep but will not necessarily alleviate underlying primary sleep disorders. Because these can result in significant morbidity and mortality, they require careful attention in peri- and postmenopausal women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With increasing life expectancy, menopause is an increasingly important aspect of women's health. Although research suggests that age at menopause varies in different ethnic groups, data on age at menopause among Iranian women are limited. We recorded the age at natural menopause among women in a population-based study in Yazd, Islamic Republic of Iran, in 2006. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study estimates age at natural menopause among a sample of 346 menopausal women through cluster sampling and according to their age and the onset of menopause (12 months of consecutive menstrual cessation). RESULTS: We found that the mean (SD) age at menopause was 47.39 (5.089) years (95% CI: 46.85-47.92) and the median age was 48 years. The Iranian women demonstrated a moderate to high frequency of reporting four symptoms in vasomotor, vaginal, sleep-related, emotional, and somatic categories. Physical factors (height, weight, body mass index, handedness) and sociodemographic factors (educational level, income) were not significantly related to early mean age at menopause. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of age at menopause for Iranian center women, which is similar to the overall estimates previously reported for Iranian populations. Different factors influence age at natural menopause; however, there has not been a study in which this factor has been confirmed as a significant factor.

AB  - Objective: This 52-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, multicenter study evaluated the overall effectiveness (as measured by treatment discontinuation rates) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients early in the course of psychotic illness.Method: Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day), quetiapine (100-800 mg/day), or risperidone (0.5-4 mg/day) administered in twice-daily doses. Statistical analyses tested for noninferiority in all-cause treatment discontinuation rates up to 52 weeks (primary outcome measure) based on a prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%.Results: A total of 400 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (N=133), quetiapine (N=134), or risperidone (N=133). The mean modal prescribed daily doses were 11.7 mg for olanzapine, 506 mg for quetiapine, and 2.4 mg for risperidone. At week 52, all-cause treatment discontinuation rates were 68.4%, 70.9%, and 71.4% for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, respectively. Reductions in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were similar for the three treatment groups, but reductions in PANSS positive subscale scores were greater in the olanzapine group (at 12 weeks and at 52 weeks or withdrawal from study) and the risperidone group (at 12 weeks). The most common elicited adverse events for olanzapine were drowsiness (53%), weight gain (51%), and insomnia (38%); for quetiapine, drowsiness (58%), increased sleep hours (42%), and weight gain (40%); and for risperidone, drowsiness (50%), menstrual irregularities in women (47%), and weight gain (41%).Conclusions: Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone demonstrated comparable effectiveness in early-psychosis patients, as indicated by similar rates of all-cause treatment discontinuation.

AB  - During the postmenopausal period, many women report a number of difficulties in getting adequate sleep. This symptom, named insomnia, may intensify preexisting neuropsychic symptoms (such as irritability, anxiety, depression, and concentration and memory loss). Several hormones, such as the growth and cell recovery hormones, are released during the sleeping period. Nowadays, chronobiology explains that many functions of living organisms are influenced by the alternation between wakefulness and sleep. 'Normal', 'natural' and 'good' sleep pattern, as accepted today, is influenced by cultural and historical beliefs, apart from biological factors supported by scientific findings. Some authors associate reduced sleep time during menopause mainly with endocrinological changes, and only secondarily to psychological factors. As the aging process takes place, sleep patterns tend to return to normal in the post menopausal period. However, there are few studies about the factors that interfere with irregular sleep pattern found in the postmenopausal period and their possible consequences on the quality of life of these women.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the association of depression, sleep disturbance, and menopausal symptoms with diminished libido.Study Design: Data from a 2001-2002 baseline survey of 341 peri- and postmenopausal women, aged 45-55 years, participating in a randomized trial, was analyzed. Eligibility included at least 2 hot flashes and/or night sweats per day and no hormone therapy for at least the prior 3 months. The survey evaluated sexual function, depression, sleep, and vasomotor symptoms. We examined the association between these factors, using multivariate regression models.Results: Of 341 women, 64% had diminished libido, 18% had moderate to severe depression, and 43% had poor sleep quality. Women averaged 4.6 hot flashes and 1.9 night sweats per day. Depressive symptoms (P = .003), poor sleep (P = .02), and night sweats (P = .04) were significantly associated with diminished libido.Conclusion: Factors associated with diminished libido in midlife are complex but include depression, disturbed sleep, and night sweats, all common symptoms of the menopausal transition and early menopause.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hot flashes, depressed mood, sleep, cognitive and sexual symptoms correlate with urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrone (E(1)G), and testosterone (T) and with each other during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause (PM). METHODS: Forty-one women who transitioned from middle or late transition stage to PM rated symptoms and provided monthly urine specimens as part of a longitudinal study of the menopausal transition. RESULTS: Correlations between endocrine levels and symptom severity ratings over time revealed that hot flash severity was significantly and positively related to FSH and negatively to E1 G. Vaginal dryness was positively correlated with FSH and negatively correlated with T. Decreased sexual desire was correlated negatively with E(1)G levels. Forgetfulness was positively correlated with FSH; difficulty concentrating was negatively correlated with T. Severity of sleep symptoms and depressed mood were not correlated with E(1)G, FSH, or T. Correlations among the symptoms revealed that severity of hot flashes was associated with sleep disruption and forgetfulness. Depressed mood was correlated with sleep disruption, difficulty concentrating, and decreased sexual desire but not with hot flashes or vaginal dryness. Awakening during the night was correlated with decreased sexual desire and vaginal dryness, as well as hot flashes. Forgetfulness was associated with hot flashes and difficulty concentrating, whereas difficulty concentrating was associated with depressed mood and early awakening. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms many women experience during the menopausal transition and early PM are related to different endocrine levels (FSH, E(1)G, and T).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) was developed to assess disease-specific quality of life (QoL) in adults with ITP. It is a 44-item questionnaire that includes scales for physical health (symptoms, fatigue/sleep, bother, and activity), emotional health (psychological and fear), overall QoL, social activity, women's reproductive health, and work. A previous study reported preliminary evidence of its reliability and validity. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to ascertain the responsiveness (ability to detect a clinically important treatment effect), reliability, and validity of the ITP-PAQ and to corroborate the earlier findings. The women's reproductive health scale was evaluated for psychometric evidence of the existence of separate menstrual symptoms and fertility subscales. METHODS: The ITP-PAQ was evaluated in the context of an ongoing open-label extension study assessing the tolerability and durability of increases in the platelet count with AMG 531 (a thrombopoiesis peptibody that increases platelet production by targeting the thrombopoietin receptor) administered by subcutaneous injection once weekly in adult patients with ITP It was self-administered at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. The responsiveness of the questionnaire was evaluated by calculating and comparing the change scores of patients who showed clinical improvement-categorized as platelet responders (those with a platelet count > or =50 x 10(9) cells/L and a doubling of baseline values at week 24) and durable platelet responders (those with a platelet count > or =50 x 10(9) cells/L and a doubling of baseline values on > or =6 occasions during weeks 17-24)-with the change scores of patients wh did not show clinical improvement. The reliability (internal consistency and test-retest) and validity (convergent, discriminant, and known groups) of the questionnaire were also evaluated. Validity was examined in terms of correlations between the ITP-PAQ and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), a generic measure of health-related QoL. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the ITP-PAQ. Most of the scales were found capable of detecting clinically important treatment effects, with the scales for symptoms, fatigue/sleep, bother, and activity being particularly responsive. All scales were found to have internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha, 0.700-0.950), with the exceptions of the menstrual symptoms subscale (0.988 and 0.959 at weeks 12 and 24, respectively) and the work scale (0.691 at week 24). Test-retest reliability was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.725-0.867), with the exceptions of the scales for symptoms (0.677) and women's reproductive health (0.592) and the fertility subscale (0.171). Construct validity was supported by correlations between specific ITP-PAQ and SF-36 scales, with the exceptions of the menstrual symptoms and fertility subscales. Discriminant validity was reported for the symptoms, fatigue/sleep, bother, and activity scales. Durable platelet responders had significantly better scores than nonresponders on the symptoms (P = 0.022), bother (P = 0.008), psychological (P = 0.033), and overall QoL scales (P = 0.032). Compared with those who had undergone splenectomy, patients without splenectomy had significantly higher scores on the women's reproductive health scale (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis indicate that the ITP-PAQ has acceptable responsiveness, reliability, and validity. Further study of the minimal clinically important difference in ITP-PAQ scale scores is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many middle-aged women experience decreases in their sleep quality during the menopausal transition. Physical activity has been shown to improve sleep, but few randomized, controlled trials investigating such effects in this population exist.In 164 previously low-active middle-aged women (mean age = 49.9, SD = 3.6), using a 4-month randomized, controlled trial, we examined structured exercise in the form of walking or yoga to determine the effects on perceived sleep quality. DESIGN: Participants completed body composition and fitness assessments and a battery of psychological measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, at the beginning and end of a 4-month randomized, controlled exercise trial with three arms: walking, yoga, and control. RESULTS: A series of mixed-model repeated-measures univariate analyses of covariance did not reveal any statistically significant intervention effects for total sleep quality or any individual sleep-quality domain. The pattern of effect sizes indicated that the walking group tended to experience small improvements in five of the seven assessed sleep-quality domains. Residual changes in menopausal symptoms and depression were associated with residual changes in total sleep quality. However, after controlling for the effects of physical activity, only menopausal symptoms contributed a unique amount of variance in residual change in total sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 4-month moderate-intensity walking and low-intensity yoga programs were ineffective in yielding statistically significant improvements in sleep quality. Exercise interventions of longer durations or greater intensity may be needed for such improvements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate if diurnal cortisol variation is associated with nocturnal blood pressure (BP) dipping. METHODS: In this study, 302 healthy adults (51% female; average age 31 years) underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP assessment with BP measured randomly approximately every 20 minutes during waking hours and every hour during sleep. Salivary cortisol was obtained at five time points. Cortisol and BP have natural diurnal variations and disruptions in these diurnal variations are related to pathological conditions, such as greater risk for cardiovascular disease. A lack of a drop in cortisol from day to night and a lack of a drop in BP from waking to sleeping have both been associated with negative outcomes. It is not known, however, if diurnal variations in cortisol and BP are related, or if changes in cortisol from day to night influence BP dipping. RESULTS: Diurnal cortisol variation was a significant predictor of BP dipping. Controlling for gender, body mass index, age, phase of menstrual cycle, sleep quality, morning cortisol, and daytime measures of the relevant cardiovascular assessments did not significantly affect the results. Cortisol variation was found to have a stronger relationship with BP dipping than any of the covariates measured. CONCLUSION: Decreased diurnal variation in cortisol is associated with decreased diurnal variation in BP. Future studies could benefit from examining how these two variables interact in predicting disease outcomes.

AB  - Nocturia may be attributable to nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal urine overproduction), a diminished nocturnal bladder capacity or a combination of the two conditions.A disorder of the vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) system with very low or undetectable levels of vasopressin at night, affecting some elderly people, may cause an increase in the nocturnal urine output, which in the most extreme cases accounts for 85% of the 24-hour diuresis. The increased urine output can be treated with desmopressin orally at bedtime, generally using low doses. Self-imposed fluid restrictions before bedtime are not effective in reducing the nocturnal urine output in this condition.Nocturia is also more prevalent in association with a reduced bladder capacity. Antimuscarinic drugs are used in attempts to depress involuntary bladder contractions. Decreased nocturnal voided volumes in men and consequent increased nocturia may suggest difficulty in emptying the bladder or detrusor overactivity. alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor antagonists and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are often used in men with symptoms indicative of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and one of their effects is reduction of nocturia.In women, estrogen deficiency, a common consequence of the menopausal transition, causes atrophic changes within the urogenital tract. Consequently, such women are more disposed to having urogenital symptoms, among them nocturia.This review emphasises the importance of correctly diagnosing and treating nocturia in elderly patients. This will improve patients' sleep and, in turn, reduce their risk of fall injuries and the associated detrimental consequences, thereby improving patients' health and quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Researchers have discovered that blood pressure (BP) varies in a diurnal manner throughout a 24-hour period, being higher during the day and lower at night. Most people have a dipping BP pattern characterized by a nighttime BP that is 10-20% lower than their daytime BP. Individuals who experience a less than 10% reduction in nighttime BP are described as having a nondipping BP pattern. Although controversial, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that a nondipping BP pattern is associated with a greater risk of target organ damage among individuals with essential hypertension. AIM: To review the literature on the most common factors associated with nondipping BP patterns among individuals with essential hypertension. METHODS: CINAHL (1982-March 2006), PubMed (1950-March 2006) and Cochrane Library (1966-March 2006) databases were searched using the keywords: dipper, dipping, nondipper, nondipping, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ABPM, hypertension, essential hypertension, high blood pressure, blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure, nighttime blood pressure, diurnal blood pressure, and blood pressure patterns. Published studies, abstracts, dissertations as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed. Studies were included if they involved subjects with only treated or untreated essential hypertension or those with samples of both nomotensive and treated or untreated essential hypertensive individuals. Additionally, studies needed to evaluate 24-hour, daytime and nighttime BP patterns. RESULTS: There is some evidence to suggest advanced age, African-American ethnicity, female sex, postmenopausal status, sodium sensitivity, sleep apnea, sleep quality, anger, hostility, depression, stress, social support, and socioeconomic status have an association with nondipping BP patterns. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the potential factors associated with an altered nighttime BP pattern is of importance because it can help identify persons at risk for nondipping BP patterns and potential target organ damage. Furthermore, knowledge of these factors associated with a nondipping BP profile will lay the foundation for interventions to prevent/treat alterations in nighttime BP patterns.

AB  - Purpose: This article reviews the pathophysiology of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause and current management options. Data sources: Current scientific literature. Conclusions: In most menopausal women, loss of ovarian function results in VMS, including hot flashes, night sweats, and mood and sleep disturbances. Hormone therapy (HT) has been the mainstay of VMS treatment for many years, but safety concerns raised by publication of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) results have dramatically reduced the use of this treatment. Since the WHI published its findings, attention has focused on other novel treatments for menopausal symptoms, including low-dose oral or transdermal HT and agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and clonidine. Many women also use complementary and alternative medications to manage VMS, but little evidence from controlled clinical trials supports their efficacy. Implications for practice: The increasing number of alternative treatments for VMS requires improvement in patient–provider communication about treatment risks and benefits, individualization of treatment to meet patient needs and attitudes, and careful follow-up to ensure adherence to potentially effective therapy. Nurse practitioners play a leading role in patient evaluation, discussions, and management to help women achieve control over bothersome VMS that dramatically impact their quality of life.

AB  - The present paper outlines the neurophysiological and neurohumeral effects of acupuncture with reference to pain modification, and systemic enhancement of mood, well-being, sleep and quality of life in the specific area of women's health. The author seeks to integrate Western evidence-based acupuncture research with the richness of the underlying philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine in order to enhance patient care and clinical management of the more complicated case presentations within physiotherapy. The paper attempts to reinforce suggested protocols, both within myofascial pain management and systemic dysfunction, with appropriate research, in order to support clinical reasoning and 'best practice' encompassing a variety of conditions ranging from the more peripheral, superficial gynaecological infections to systemic dysfunction, whilst retaining the scope of physiotherapeutic practice.

AB  - Objective: To examine how menopausal symptoms and estrogen therapy (ET)-induced symptom relief affect cognition in early menopause.Design: There were two components. Part 1 was a cross-sectional study of 37 healthy, recently postmenopausal women with diverse menopausal symptoms. Women were categorized as having low (n = 20) or high symptoms (n = 17) based on a validated symptom questionnaire. Women completed mood and sleep questionnaires and underwent cognitive testing, which included verbal memory, visual memory, emotional memory, and verbal fluency. Thirty-two of these women went on to part 2 of the study. Fourteen were randomly assigned to receive ET and 18 to receive placebo for 8 weeks. Before treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks, women completed the same measures as in part 1 of the study.Results: High symptom women had more negative mood (P = 0.01) and lower quality sleep (P < 0.001) than low symptom women. Despite suffering from more menopausal symptoms, worse mood, and poorer sleep, women in the high symptom group performed the same on cognitive testing as women in the low symptom group. Women receiving ET had greater improvements in menopausal symptoms and sleep compared with those receiving the placebo (P <= 0.05). ET did not improve mood compared with placebo. Women receiving ET did not have any improvement in cognitive performance compared with those receiving the placebo.Conclusions: Menopausal symptoms do not impair cognition. ET does not improve cognition despite alleviating symptoms and improving sleep in recently naturally menopausal women with diverse menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To determine the association between ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and hot flash experience.Design: The participants in the study were 154 women (mean age=46 years, range=18-65 years), who were evaluated as part of a cross-sectional study on ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and diurnal BP patterns. Participants could be either normotensive or mildly hypertensive. Participants wore an ambulatory BP monitor for 24 hours and recorded their awake and sleep times. Hot flashes were assessed using an everyday complaint questionnaire that embeds symptoms associated with menopause into a list of everyday complaints.Results: Thirty-three percent of participants reported having had hot flashes during the 2 weeks before they completed the questionnaire. Compared with women who did not report hot flashes, mean awake and sleep systolic BP values were significantly higher (P<0.004 and P=0.007, respectively) in women who reported having had hot flashes. Hot flashes continued to independently predict average awake and sleep systolic BP (both P=0.03) after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and menopausal status. Hot flashes were not associated with diastolic BP or nocturnal dipping of BP.Conclusions: Hot flashes are associated with increased awake and sleep systolic BP independent of menopausal status. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which hot flashes are associated with BP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The decline in concentrations of gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a range of physiologic and psychologic changes that may impact a woman's health and quality of life significantly. Most notable among these are vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and mood and sleep disturbances. STUDY DESIGN: This article reviews the physiologic condition underlying menopausal vasomotor symptoms and centrally active, nonhormonal therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for their treatment. RESULTS: Despite the emergence of a range of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms, a need still exists for safe and effective therapeutic options that directly target the underlying thermoregulatory mechanisms for women who want treatment but prefer to avoid hormone therapy or for whom hormone therapy is contraindicated. CONCLUSION: The availability of centrally active therapies for menopausal vasomotor symptoms with risks and benefits clearly defined by results from well-designed clinical trials has the potential to allay safety concerns that are associated with the treatment of these common symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality-of-life outcomes and sexual functioning among premenopausal women who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) versus ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy. METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of premenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease in the Medicine or Surgery and the Total or Supracervical Hysterectomy randomized trials. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed at the patients' requests or to treat intraoperative ovarian pathology. Health-related quality-of-life outcomes and sexual functioning were assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36, Sexual Problems Scales, and several other measures at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after hysterectomy. RESULTS: Mean age at hysterectomy was higher for the 49 women who underwent BSO compared with the 112 women with ovarian conservation (45 versus 40, P<.001). At 6 months, the BSO group demonstrated less improvement than women with ovarian conservation on scales for body image (2 versus 14, P=.01), sleep problems (4 versus 16, P<.01), and the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (4 versus 10, P=.03). There were no differences in any measure of sexual functioning between the groups. Hot flushes, urinary incontinence, and pelvic pain were similar in both groups. At 2-year follow-up, all measures of health-related quality-of-life and sexual functioning appeared similar by BSO status. CONCLUSION: Women who underwent BSO had less improvement in some aspects of health-related quality of life within the first 6 months following hysterectomy compared to women with ovarian conservation. However, these differences were not apparent 2 years after surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

AB  - Are complementary and alternative therapies effective for menopausal symptoms?METHODSData sources: Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library (to March 2005), AMED, MANTIS, reference lists, experts, and websites.Study selection and assessment: randomised, placebo controlled trials and meta-analyses that evaluated alternative therapies (categorised by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women (including those with breast cancer). 70 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the selection criteria: 48 assessed biologically based therapies (including 31 of phytoestrogens), 9 assessed mind-body therapies, 1 assessed manipulative therapy, 2 assessed energy therapies, and 10 assessed whole medical systems. Methodological quality of most RCTs was fair or poor.Outcomes: improvement in menopausal symptoms (eg, hot Hashes, sleep disturbance, vaginal dryness, urinary frequency or incontinence, depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction), quality of life, and cognitive function.MAIN RESULTSA few RCTs showed more improvement with treatment than with placebo for hot flashes, other menopausal symptoms, and cognitive functioning (table), but the evidence was inconsistent.CONCLUSIONThere is insufficient good quality evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Problem. State development is the indicator of infants' brain maturation. The developmental change in state organization of preterm infants and the influences of biological and environmental factors over time is still unclear.Purpose. To better understand the state developmental process of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Specifically, state organization development over age, and the effects of selected infant characteristics and state diurnal rhythm were examined. The interaction of state organization and the infant's neurodevelopment at discharge was also explored.Methods. Explorative design using secondary data from 285 videotape observations of 97 medically stable preterm infants. The selected infant characteristic consisted of gestational age (GA), postmenstrual age (PMA) and postnatal age (PNA) at observation, birthweight (BW), and gender. State organization was categorized by quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), drowsy, and awake. Additionally, maturity of states, diffuse and defined states was observed. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS) was used to measure the infant's neurodevelopment prior to discharge.Results. Active sleep was the dominate state over PMA. Although not statistically significant, preterm infants showed developmental changes in state organization with increased QS, drowsy, and awake, decreased AS, and more defined and less diffuse states over age. Drowsy was an important transitional state between AS and awake. Birthweight was significantly negatively correlated with AS and positively correlated with awake. Gestational age, PMA and PNA at observation, and BW had only minor effects on state organization. However, there was significant gender effect, indicating less AS, more drowsy, more awake, less defined, and more diffuse states in male infants compared with females. No diurnal effect on state organization was noted. There were no significant correlations between GA, PNA and PMA at observation, BW, and gender, and range of states on the BNBAS. However, older preterm infants had less regulation of states on the BNBAS.Conclusions. Preterm infants of all GA were able to competently handle the interactions of endogenous and environmental influences in terms of state organization. Additional research is needed to understand the level of influences and further describe the state development in these infants.

AB  - Some women experience symptoms during the menopause transition that cause distress. Due to the heterogeneity of experiences, distress has been difficult to measure. Researchers have examined risk factors such as personality traits, stress, coping, lifecourse, and hormonal sensitivities to explain distress during menopause. The purpose of this narrative analysis study was to explore the experiences of distress for women during the menopause transition, and to examine the experiences of aging.A postmodern feminist framework allowed for individual experiences of distress to unfold within the stories and to view how women adopt positions in prevailing discourses. Narrative analysis methodology facilitated the understanding of individually defined distress and how it reflected shared meanings embedded in Western society.Fifteen women were interviewed in person using open interview techniques and were digitally voice recorded. Interviews were transcribed verbatim to examine use of language such as utterances, tone of voice, and pauses. Data were re-transcribed after the identification of narratives and poetic structures. Themes were analyzed within and across interviews. Coding was conducted to aid in the noting of themes.The women described hot flashes, night sweats, menstrual changes, decreased libido, vaginal dryness, sleep disruption, and others within the context of their lives. The women demonstrated ways of adopting social discourses on menopause and aging that aided or dampened positions of power. Themes identified were of silence, shame, and stigma related to aging and menopause. Some women experienced social withdrawal and alienation. Narratives of chaos, restitution, and quest were analyzed. Loss of control was experienced to be most distressful for some of the women.It is a historical time with many babyboomers reaching the age of menopause and studies cautioning against the liberal use of hormone therapy. Nurses need to understand the contextual meaning embedded in the women's experiences. Alternative models to provide care and reduce alienation, such as group care, is worthy of research. Women need to be advised in how the adoption of social discourse may influence experiences of distress. Further exploration of the meaning of control in women's lives needs to be conducted.

AB  - Body temperature is a complex, non-linear data point, subject to many sources of internal and external variation. While these sources of variation significantly complicate interpretation of temperature data, disregarding knowledge in favor of oversimplifying complex issues would represent a significant departure from practicing evidence-based medicine. Part 1 of this review outlines the historical work of Wunderlich on temperature and the origins of the concept that a healthy normal temperature is 98.6 degrees F (37.0 degrees C). Wunderlich's findings and methodology are reviewed and his results are contrasted with findings from modern clinical thermometry. Endogenous sources of temperature variability, including variations caused by site of measurement, circadian, menstrual, and annual biological rhythms, fitness, and aging are discussed. Part 2 will review the effects of exogenous masking agents - external factors in the environment, diet, or lifestyle that can influence body temperature, as well as temperature findings in disease states.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of skeletal pain in postmenopausal women before the onset of raloxifene treatment and the further course of pain during treatment in a naturalistic setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective, uncontrolled, multicentre, 6-month, observational study in Germany. Clinical, diagnostic and pain data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months of raloxifene treatment from 3299 female outpatients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Physicians assessed the presence or absence of back pain, joint pain and diffuse bone pain at each visit, perceived sleep quality and the use of analgesics. Patients assessed intensity and frequency of pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and a 5-point scale (from 'rarely' to 'permanently'), respectively. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had mean (SD) age 67.6 (9.3) years, 89.4% were reported to have reduced bone mineral density, 39.8% had pre-existing fractures and 93.4% had skeletal pain (physician assessment): 85.1% had back pain, 41.8% joint pain and 32.5% diffuse bone pain. Median pain intensity on VAS was 66.0 mm. After 6 months of raloxifene treatment, the frequency and intensity of pain and use of analgesics for skeletal pain decreased consistently by approximately 50%. Pain frequency decreased in 58.2% and increased in 2.3% of patients. The median decrease in pain intensity from baseline to 6 months was 27.0 mm (46%). Patients' subjective quality of sleep improved: the proportion of patients who were reported to sleep well increased from 21.3% at baseline to 46.7% at 6 months. The decrease in relative pain frequency was greatest with diffuse pain (67.6%) followed by joint pain (36.9%) and back pain (32.5%). CONCLUSION: Raloxifene treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was associated with a marked reduction of skeletal pain and analgesic consumption and an improvement in subjective sleep quality.

AB  - Menopause is a period during which significant hormonal changes are noted in the female organism. Although the age of menopause ranges between 35 and 55, the average age is 51.5 in the western world. This means that a third of a woman's life is postmenopausal. There are many marked changes in the female organism due to menopause that affect many organs and accompany physiological changes. Some of the more frequent signs are hot flashes, sleep disorders and depression.The decreased estrogen level leads to a sequence of events that accelerate skin aging, decrease its elasticity and increase its dryness. Other unwanted changes in the oral mucosa and the hair are also reported. Estrogen's protection of the skin against aging decreases greatly with menopause, adding hormonal aging signs to those of chronological and environmental aging. The aged appearance of the skin therefore becomes more prominent with menopause. Skin aging is a process starting with thinning of the skin, followed by the skin becoming damaged more easily and ending with wrinkling and an increased number of deeper wrinkles.There are also changes in the female sex organs due to decreased estrogen. These are decreased breast glandular tissue, smaller uterus, regressing endometrium, shorter and narrower vagina, atrophy of the vaginal epithelium and external genital organs, decreased pubic hair and thinning of the urinary system epithelium. Atrophic vulvovaginitis, vulvodynia and lichen sclerosis can accompany these vulvar and vaginal changes in menopause.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate recent evidence regarding gender differences in sleep. RECENT FINDINGS: Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy.

AB  - Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) involves multiple sensory, somatic, and cognitive symptoms that are bound to affect or be affected by physical and mental health status and behavioral components of daily life. Methods: From a telephone survey of 442 women with and 205 women without FMS as volunteers, data were compared on (1) general health status, (2) reproductive and sleep-related diagnoses, and (3) lifestyle health behaviors. Results: All multiple or logistics regression analyses for group differences were controlled for age, body mass index (BMI), race, employment status, marital status, having a college degree, low household income, and having ever been diagnosed with depression, with a Bonferroni p value correction for multiple indicators. Accordingly, FMS negatively impacted both perceived physical and mental health status, although relatively more so for physical (p < 0.017). Women with FMS were more likely to have had reproductive health or sleep-related diagnoses, including premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, breast cysts, bladder cystitis, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, and abnormal leg movements ( p < 0.0125). They were calculated to use less than half as many calories per week as control women (689 +/- 1293 vs. 1499 +/- 1584 kcal/week, p < 0.05) and had more sleep pattern difficulties ( p < 0.0125), more negative changes in sexual function (greater odds for 5 of 10 indicators at p < 0.005), and lower alcohol use (odds ratio = 0.39, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with FMS deserve careful assessment for reproductive conditions and sleep-related functional disorders. Besides more research into mechanisms underlying symptoms, intervention testing specifically to alleviate sleep problems, low physical activity levels, and sexual dysfunction should be paramount.

AB  - Infants requiring neonatal intensive care are often placed prone during their acute illness. After hospital discharge the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supine sleep position to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Little is known about nursing knowledge and practice regarding best sleep positions for infants as they transition from neonatal intensive care to home.ObjectiveTo explore and describe neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses' knowledge and practice in the NICU, and to determine the content of parent instruction regarding infant sleep position at discharge.Study DesignThis survey was conducted in 2 phases. In Phase I, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 157 neonatal nurses currently practicing in Level III and IV NICUs in the state of New York. After content analysis of responses and item revisions, a panel of experts reviewed questionnaire items. Phase II involved completion of the final questionnaire by 95 NICU nurses in 4 additional hospitals. The combined results of Phase I and II are reported.ResultsOf 514 questionnaires distributed, 252 (49%) were completed and analyzed. During NICU hospitalization, nurse respondents identified prone position as the best general sleep position for preterm infants (65%) followed by either prone or side-lying (12%). The nurses' assessment of the infants' readiness for supine sleep position at the time of NICU discharge varied. Most nurses responded that preterm infants were ready to sleep supine anytime (29%), close to discharge (13%), when maintaining their body temperature in an open crib (25%), between 34 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) (15%), after 37 weeks PMA (13%), and when the infant's respiratory status was stable (6%). Typical sleep positions chosen for full-term infants in the NICU were supine (40%), side or supine (30%), all positions (18%), side (8%), prone or side (3%), and prone (1%). Frequently cited reasons to place full-term infants to sleep prone were: reflux (45%), upper airway anomalies (40%), respiratory distress (29%), inconsolability (29%), and to promote development (17%). At NICU discharge, 52% of nurses instructed parents to place their infants in the supine position for sleep. The most common nonsupine sleep positions recommended by nurses at discharge were either supine or side (38%), and exclusive side positioning (9%).ConclusionsNearly 95% of respondents identified a nonsupine sleep position as optimal for hospitalized preterm infants. Further, only 52% of neonatal nurses routinely provide discharge instructions that promote supine sleep positions at home. This study suggests that nursing self-reports of discharge teaching practices are inconsistent, and in some cases in direct conflict with the national 'Back to Sleep' recommendations, which emphasize that the supine position is the safest position for healthy full-term and preterm infants after hospital discharge.

AB  - Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on the 'biological clock'. Technological solutions to the biological clock, specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess 'ovarian reserve', or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical designation of 'diminished ovarian reserve' has come to imply that a woman has 'old eggs'. This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of menopause. In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The 'eleventh-hour mom' narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the 'miracle mom' narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs, but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful 'diminished ovarian reserve' in varying ways that connect with cultural, social, structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they reproduced the socio-biological project of the biological clock, but rooted this social project in the metaphor of 'old eggs' rather than menopause.

AB  - Purpose: Surprisingly little is known about the causes and implications of night sweats. This study was designed to clarify further the associations between night sweats and sleep-related symptoms.Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional study of consecutive adult patients seen in 10 primary care physicians' offices. Data were collected and transmitted by a personal digital assistant. Information included demographic variables; height, weight, and blood pressure; occurrence of a variety of sleep-related symptoms; and occurrence and severity of night sweats, day sweats, and hot flashes in the past month. For women, information about menstrual status was also obtained.Results: Thirty-four percent of the 363 patients interviewed reported night sweats, one half of whom reported saturating their bedclothes. In the multivariate model, night sweats were associated with daytime tiredness (OR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12-3.53), waking up with a bitter taste in the mouth (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.19-3.18), legs jerking during sleep (OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.05-3.00), and awakening with pain in the night (OR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.16-2.99).Conclusions: Night sweats are associated with several sleep symptoms. Both night sweats and sleep disturbances are commonly experienced by adult primary care patients. When their patients report night sweats, clinicians should consider asking about sleep quality and sleep-related symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To examine the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram (ESCIT) compared to estrogen and progestogen therapy (EPT) for the treatment of symptomatic peri- and postmenopausal women. DESIGN:: Forty women (aged 40-60 years) with depressive disorders and menopause-related symptoms were randomly assigned to an 8-week open trial with ESCIT (flexible dose, 10-20 mg/day; fixed dose, 10 mg/day for the first 4 weeks) or estrogen plus progestogen therapy (ethinyl estradiol 5 mug/day plus norethindrone acetate 1 mg/day). Primary outcome measures included Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Greene Climacteric Scale at week 8. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions as well as sleep and quality of life assessments. RESULTS:: Thirty-two women (16 on EPT, 16 on ESCIT) were included in the analyses. Full remission of depression (score of <10 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) was observed in 75% (12/16) of subjects treated with ESCIT, compared to 25% (4/16) treated with EPT (P = 0.01, Fisher's exact tests). Remission of menopause-related symptoms (>50% decrease in Greene Climacteric Scale scores) was noted in 56% (9/16) of women treated with ESCIT compared to 31.2% (5/16) on EPT (P = 0.03, Pearson's chi tests). Improvement in sleep, hot flashes, and quality of life was observed with both treatments. CONCLUSIONS:: ESCIT is more efficacious than EPT for the treatment of depression and has a positive impact on other menopause-related symptoms. ESCIT may constitute a treatment option for symptomatic menopausal women who are unable or unwilling to use hormone therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is associated with a number of medical and psychiatric disorders, including chronic pain and clinical depression. Until recently, it was assumed that effective treatment of the underlying medical condition would also correct the sleep disturbance. However, some evidence indicates that treatment of secondary or comorbid insomnia should be considered separately from, and perhaps in addition to, optimizing treatment of the primary condition. METHODS: This article reviews the extant literature to examine the impact of secondary and comorbid insomnia on the patient, and on healthcare economics, in the primary care setting, and discusses current diagnostic and treatment approaches. A MEDLINE search was performed for literature published from 1980 to 2005, and retrieved randomized, controlled clinical trials and key review articles for the conditions most often accompanied by secondary insomnia: depression, chronic pain, and menopause/perimenopause. The search terms included those for commonly used pharmacologic treatments and behavioral therapy. RESULTS: Due to the paucity of clinical trial data in secondary insomnia patients, physicians have had to rely on evidence derived from primary insomnia trials. These data indicate that hypnotic medications are effective in treating sleep onset insomnia. However, few of these agents are effective against the most commonly occurring insomnia symptom - poor sleep maintenance - and many are associated with problematic residual sedation. Nevertheless, the cost of not treating these insomnia symptoms is often greater than the treatment inadequacies. Physicians should thus consider treating what they perceive as secondary insomnia with one of the available forms of therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients experiencing sleep problems associated with a potential medical or psychiatric primary condition would likely benefit from increased physician awareness of secondary insomnia and the subsequent increased attention to diagnosing and treating this prevalent condition. Recommendations for managing secondary or comorbid insomnia in the primary care setting are discussed.

AB  - This article reports the findings of a population-based study in New Zealand that investigated comparative well-being, comorbidity, and the impact of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) on activities. Chronic pelvic pain was defined as lower abdominal pain that is associated with neither the menstrual cycle nor sexual activity. A postal questionnaire was administered to a random sample resulting in a study group of 1,160. The negative impact of CPP on women's general well-being is significant. They were more likely than women without CPP to have other long-standing illnesses, other unspecified conditions involving pain or fatigue, and sleep patterns were more seriously disturbed. Pain restricted their activities. Comparisons with the limited data available from other studies are made.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To determine whether hot flashes produce sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women. DESIGN:: This study was performed in a university medical center laboratory with 18 postmenopausal women with hot flashes, six with no hot flashes, and 12 cycling women, all healthy and medication free. Polysomnography, skin and rectal temperatures, and skin conductance to detect hot flashes were recorded for four nights. Nights 2, 3, and 4 were run at 30 degrees C, 23 degrees C, and 18 degrees C in randomized order. RESULTS:: During the first half of the night, the women with hot flashes had significantly more arousals and awakenings than the other two groups and the 18 degrees C ambient temperature significantly reduced the number of hot flashes, from 2.2 +/- 0.4 to 1.5 +/- 0.4. These effects did not occur in the second half of the night. In the first half of the night, most hot flashes preceded arousals and awakenings. In the second half, this pattern was reversed. CONCLUSIONS:: In the second half of the night, rapid eye movement sleep suppresses hot flashes and associated arousals and awakenings. This may explain previous discrepancies between self-reported and laboratory-reported data in postmenopausal women with hot flashes.

AB  - Because hysteroscopic endometrial resection and ablation for menorrhagia require a high level of skill to perform effectively and safely, a variety of global ablation devices have been designed for use by those having limited experience with hysteroscopy. They include ablation using a thermal balloon, microwaves, or diffused laser energy; cryoablation; and instillation of hot saline. The present investigators carried out a prospective, randomized trial comparing thermal balloon ablation with the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), an intrauterine device that releases 20 [mu]g levonorgestrel every 24 hours over 5 years. Forty women 25 to 50 years of age with self-described heavy menstrual bleeding were assigned to the LNG-IUS and 39 others to thermal balloon ablation. Menstrual blood loss was estimated using a pictorial bleeding assessment chart after 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months.Menstrual blood loss was significantly reduced in both treatment groups, but at 12 and 24 months, bleeding scores were significantly lower in women treated with the LNG-IUS. There was a similar trend in rates of amenorrhea, which, however, was significant only at 24 months. Days of heavy bleeding were significantly reduced in both groups at 3 months. Fewer women had disturbed sleep and more felt able to leave home. More than 80% of women in both groups felt that their treatment had succeeded, and similar numbers of women in the 2 treatment groups would recommend their treatment to a friend. No serious complications were encountered. Self-rated quality of life increased significantly for women in both groups at 3, 12, and 24 months.These findings fail to show that either the LNG-IUS or thermal balloon ablation is superior to the other approach as a means of safely reducing blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. For this reason, individual preference should form the basis of choosing between these methods.

AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the changes in reports of fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms and serum cortisol, melatonin, serotonin, and bilirubin during adjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast cancer and to determine whether any correlations exist between the symptom parameters and biomarkers. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal, correlational, repeated-measures pilot study. SETTING: Large southwestern, university-based, National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. SAMPLE: 22 subjects (11 women with stage II breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and 11 cancer-free women who were matched by age, ethnicity, and menopausal status). METHODS: Questionnaires (fatigue, sleep, depressive symptoms), wrist sleep actigraphy, and laboratory analysis of serum samples. All subjects (i.e., women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and a comparison group of cancer-free women who were matched by age, ethnicity, and menopausal status) were admitted to a general clinical research center for two nights during cycles 1 and 4 for data collection. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Biomarkers (serum cortisol, melatonin, serotonin, and bilirubin), fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms. FINDINGS: Mean fatigue scores of the subjects with cancer were significantly higher than the healthy comparison group. Subjects with cancer had a significantly lower mean actual sleep time compared to the comparison group at cycle 1. No significant difference was found between the groups at cycle 4. Depression scores also differed significantly between the cancer group and comparison group. Select biomarkers changed over time and were associated with subjective parameters of fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms are more prevalent in women with cancer than a cancer-free comparison group. Biomarkers changed over time and provide a possible explanatory mechanism for the three related symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Data help to explain a mechanism that may underlie fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms and provide a theoretical framework from which to establish evidence-based interventions for symptom management.

AB  - Self-report data suggest that sleep hot flashes among menopausal women are associated with sleep problems and in turn impaired psychological functioning. However, few studies have examined these relations with physiologic hot flash measures. A total of 41 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with daily hot flashes underwent nighttime sternal skin conductance monitoring to quantify hot flashes. Participants completed sleep diaries; the Sleep-Wake Experience List (van Diest, 1990); and depression, anxiety, and daily stress measures. Participants experienced a median of 2 physiologically monitored and 1 reported sleep hot flash nightly. Although sleep complaints were significantly and positively associated with psychological functioning, neither sleep complaints nor psychological functioning was significantly related to frequency of physiologically monitored sleep hot flashes. Conversely, results indicate an association between reported sleep hot flashes and acute sleep problems. The frequency of physiologically monitored sleep hot flashes, as opposed to reported sleep hot flashes, may be independent of problems with sleep and mood among menopausal women.

AB  - Background and Purpose: This guideline provides an overview of the evidence on various established and potential stroke risk factors and provides recommendations for the reduction of stroke risk.Methods: Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of each writer's previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews (covering the time period since the last review published in 2001 up to January 2005), reference to previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate recommendations based on standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had numerous opportunities to comment in writing on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. The guideline underwent extensive peer review before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.Results: Schemes for assessing a person's risk of a first stroke were evaluated. Risk factors or risk markers for a first stroke were classified according to their potential for modification (nonmodifiable, modifiable, or potentially modifiable) and strength of evidence (well documented or less well documented). Nonmodifiable risk factors include age, sex, low birth weight, race/ethnicity, and genetic factors. Well-documented and modifiable risk factors include hypertension, exposure to cigarette smoke, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and certain other cardiac conditions, dyslipidemia, carotid artery stenosis, sickle cell disease, postmenopausal hormone therapy, poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity and body fat distribution. Less well-documented or potentially modifiable risk factors include the metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, oral contraceptive use, sleep-disordered breathing, migraine headache, hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated lipoprotein(a), elevated lipoprotein-associated phospholipase, hypercoagulability, inflammation, and infection. Data on the use of aspirin for primary stroke prevention are reviewed.Conclusions: Extensive evidence is available identifying a variety of specific factors that increase the risk of a first stroke and providing strategies for reducing that risk.

AB  - Late preterm infants (34-37 weeks postmenstrual age at birth) are intermediate between less mature preterm infants and infants born at 38 weeks or more in regard to autonomic brain stem maturation. Ventilatory responses to CO(2) in preterm infants born at 33 to 36 week are significantly higher than in infants born at 29 to 32 weeks both at 3 to 4 and 10 to 14 days postnatal age, but do not differ from full-term reference levels. The ventilatory response to hypoxia in preterm infants is biphasic; initial transient hyperventilation is followed by a return to baseline and then a decrease below baseline. In infants born at 32 to 37 weeks, parasympathetic maturation appears significantly less than in full-term infants based on diminished increases in high frequency heart rate variability in quiet sleep, suggesting that late preterm infants are still more susceptible to bradycardia than full-term infants. Both the presence and severity of apnea of prematurity progressively decrease the higher the postmenstrual age. Late preterm infants, however, are still at risk, with prevalence rates as high as 10% compared with about 60% in infants born at <1500 g. The incidence of apparent life-threatening events is more common in preterm infants (8-10%) than full-term infants (1% or less). In the Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation studies, the frequency of conventional and extreme events in near term infants is intermediate between preterm infants <34 weeks at birth and full-term infants. The relative risk for at least one extreme event in late preterm infants is increased (5.6 and 7.6, respectively, P < 0.008) compared with full-term infants and remains higher until 43 weeks postmenstrual age. The rate for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in preterm infants born at 33 to 36 weeks is 1.37/1000 live births compared with 0.69 in infants born full term. Affected late preterm infants die at a older mean postmenstrual age compared with less mature infants (48 and 46 weeks, respectively), but die at a younger postmenstrual age than full-term infants (53 weeks, P < 0.05).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache. BACKGROUND: Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders. METHODS: Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P = .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P = .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64% vs. 80%, P = .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P = .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P = .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P = .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P = .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P = .003), life enjoyment (P = .001), mood (P = .02), and overall quality of life (P = .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P = .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P = .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P = .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P = .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P = .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P = .08) in the migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs.

AB  - The decline in gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a wide range of physiological and psychological changes with the potential to significantly impact a woman's health and quality of life. Most notable among these are menopausal vasomotor symptoms, hot flushes and night sweats, along with mood and sleep disturbances. Given the biological and social significance of menopause, it is remarkable that the language used to describe this event and its associated symptoms is inconsistent. This review traces the history of Western medical writing about menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms and considers how terminology has contributed to the current confusion regarding symptoms and symptom reporting. Although hormone therapy is the only treatment for menopausal symptoms currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, other forms of therapy are under evaluation. Agreement about the definition of menopause and its associated symptoms is critically important for the design and evaluation of new therapies and for the optimal treatment of women during this important phase of their lives.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cortisol levels change prospectively during the menopausal transition (MT); whether these changes are associated with changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and estrone glucuronide [E1G]), stressors, or menopause symptoms; and whether women who experienced a rise in cortisol levels during the transition had behavioral practices, stressors, vasomotor symptoms, or mood or sleep disturbances that affected hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. DESIGN: One hundred sixty-nine women in the middle or late MT or early postmenopause stages provided monthly urine specimens for cortisol, FSH, and E1G, and rated symptoms and stress levels as part of a longitudinal study of the MT. Of these women, 91 completed a transition to the next MT stage: from early to middle (n = 30), middle to late (n = 39), or late to postmenopause (n = 22) and were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. RESULTS: Cortisol increased from 7 to 12 months before the late MT stage to 7 to 12 months after onset of the late MT stage. There were no differences before and after the middle MT stage or the final menstrual period. Women with increased cortisol (>10 ng/mg creatinine) during the late MT stage had more severe vasomotor symptoms than those without changes, but did not differ in terms of age, body mass index, levels of FSH or E1G, health practices, exercise, mood, sleep, cognition, or stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: Cortisol levels rise with age, but have not been linked to stages of the MT. Increased cortisol levels during the late MT stage, when menstrual irregularities are greatest, suggests increases in adrenal androgens and intraabdominal fat with menopause, and may influence risk of cardiovascular disease, vasomotor symptoms, mood, cognition, and bone loss.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The confluence of sleep/wake cycle and circadian rhythm changes that accompany pubertal development and the social and emotional developmental tasks of adolescence may create a period of substantial risk for development of insomnia. Although poor sleep affects cognitive performance and is associated with poor emotional and physical health, epidemiologic studies among adolescents have been limited. In this first epidemiologic study of insomnia defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria in a US sample of adolescents, we estimated lifetime prevalence of insomnia, examined chronicity and onset, and explored the role of pubertal development. METHODS: Data come from a random sample of 1014 adolescents who were 13 to 16 years of age, selected from households in a 400000-member health maintenance organization encompassing metropolitan Detroit. Response rate was 71.2%. The main outcome measured was DSM-IV-defined insomnia. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of insomnia was 10.7%. A total of 88% of adolescents with a history of insomnia reported current insomnia. The median age of onset of insomnia was 11. Of those with insomnia, 52.8% had a comorbid psychiatric disorder. In exploratory analyses of insomnia and pubertal development, onset of menses was associated with a 2.75-fold increased risk for insomnia. There was no difference in risk for insomnia among girls before menses onset relative to boys, but a difference emerged after menses onset. In contrast, maturational development was not associated with insomnia in boys. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia seems to be common and chronic among adolescents. The often found gender difference in risk for insomnia seems to emerge in association with onset of menses.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Adult male mice exposed to long-term intermittent hypoxia (LTIH), modeling sleep apnea oxygenation patterns, develop nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-dependent residual hypersomnolence and oxidative injury in select brain regions, including wake-active regions. Premenopausal females are less susceptible to selective oxidative brain injuries. We sought to determine whether female mice exposed to LTIH would confer resistance to LTIH-induced wake impairments and oxidative injuries. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Young adult male and female C57BI/6J mice were studied in a university laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: Mice were randomly assigned to either LTIH or sham LTIH for 8 weeks. Total (24-h) wake time and mean sleep latency were measured under 2 conditions: rested and following 6 hours of enforced wakefulness. NADPH oxidase activation, carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation assays were also performed to assess sex differences in oxidative responses to LTIH. RESULTS: In contrast with the significant LTIH-induced wake impairments observed in male mice, females following LTIH showed normal wake times and sleep latencies. Female mice revealed less baseline carbonylation and less carbonylation following LTIH but showed robust NADPH oxidase activation and lipid peroxidation. In contrast with the female relative resistance to LTIH sleepiness, female mice showed more-pronounced sleepiness and delta response after enforced wakefulness. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a robust oxidative response to LTIH, age-matched female mice may be protected, at least temporarily, from LTIH wake impairments by lower basal carbonylation. In contrast, females show greater wake impairments after sleep deprivation. We hypothesize sex differences in polysomnographic predictors of sleepiness and residual sleepiness in humans with sleep apnea.

AB  - Since the original clarification of the obstructive nature of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in 1965, much has been learned about the disorder. It is a condition with a high prevalence with obesity as a major risk factor. It aggregates in families, a relationship that is not simply explained by obesity. Premenopausal women are relatively protected from the disorder because OSA is uncommon in this group. Its prevalence in women rises after menopause. Although OSA is a risk factor for excessive sleepiness, there is developing evidence that it is also a risk factor for hypertension, acute cardiovascular events, and insulin resistance. The first line of therapy is nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Data as to the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure in severe OSA have come from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with the endpoints being sleepiness, quality of life, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Data are currently less convincing for treatment outcomes in mild to moderate OSA, and new clinical trials to assess outcomes in this group are underway. Thus, even though this field only began toward the end of the first century of the American Thoracic Society, substantial progress has been made, and OSA has increasingly emerged as a major public health concern.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol on postmenopausal symptoms and side effects in a cohort of largely asymptomatic postmenopausal women aged 60 to 80 years. DESIGN: This secondary analysis used data from the UltraLow-dose Transdermal estRogen Assessment trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in postmenopausal women to determine the skeletal effects and safety of ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol. Four hundred seventeen postmenopausal women, aged 60 to 80 years, were randomly assigned to receive either unopposed transdermal estradiol at 0.014 mg/d (n = 208) or placebo (n = 209). Participants were queried at each clinic visit about postmenopausal symptoms and side effects purported to be associated with estrogen therapy using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: At baseline, 16% of women reported hot flashes, 32% reported vaginal dryness, and 35% reported trouble sleeping. Women who received ultralow-dose estradiol were no more likely to report improvement of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or sleep difficulties than those who received placebo. Treatment with ultralow-dose estradiol did not cause breast tenderness, uterine bleeding, or other symptoms often attributed to estrogen, but vaginal discharge was more common in women who received estradiol compared with those who received placebo. CONCLUSION: In this population of older, largely asymptomatic women, ultralow-dose transdermal estradiol did not improve postmenopausal symptoms and did not cause side effects other than vaginal discharge. Further study is needed to determine whether this dose of transdermal estradiol is effective in treating symptoms of postmenopause in younger, more symptomatic women.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (1) postmenopausal women have a higher apnea threshold than premenopausal women and men and (2) hormone replacement therapy would decrease the apnea threshold in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Protocol #1: Analysis of a prospectively collected database of 55 subjects who had undergone an apnea-threshold protocol. Protocol #2: Intervention study: apnea threshold compared in 6 postmenopausal women before and after 30 days of replacement therapy with progestin and estrogen. SETTING: Research sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65 years without evidence of sleep-disordered breathing. INTERVENTIONS: Hypocapnia was induced via nasal mechanical ventilation for 3 minutes during stable non-rapid eye movement sleep. Cessation of mechanical ventilation resulted in hypocapnic central apnea or hypopnea, depending upon the magnitude of the hypocapnia. The change in endtidal CO2 at the apnea threshold was defined as the change in end-tidal CO2 associated with the apnea closest to the last hypopnea. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The change in the end-tidal CO2 at the apnea threshold was highest in the premenopausal women (4.6+/-0.6 mm Hg), with no difference between the postmenopausal women (3.1+/-0.5 mm Hg) and men (3.4+/-0.7 mm Hg). Determinants of the change in endtidal CO2 at the apnea threshold included sex and menopause status. Hormone replacement therapy increased the change in end-tidal CO2 at the apnea threshold from 2.9+/-0.4 mm Hg to 4.8+/-0.4 mm Hg (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that estrogens and progestins positively influence the apnea threshold and control of breathing during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is more common in men than in women. However, menopause increases the risk for development of OSA. Administration of estrogen and progesterone to postmenopausal women with OSA decreases apnea and hypopnea during sleep. OBJECTIVE: Because beneficial changes can be observed soon after administration of a short course of hormones, we hypothesized that suppression of these hormones would rapidly result in the development of SDB. METHODS: Production of sex hormones was suppressed with daily administration of leuprolide acetate (LA), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, for 5 weeks in women who were participating in a study on pharmacologically induced menopause and physiology. The subjects underwent polysomnographic evaluation at baseline and after 5 weeks of LA administration. RESULTS: In the 12 healthy women aged 18 to 34 years who participated in the study, sleep architecture and respiration were normal at baseline. After LA administration, the subjects stopped their menses, and their plasma concentrations of l7beta-estradiol (preadministration, mean [SD] 33.9 [9.0] pg/mL; post administration, 10.2 [3.4] pg/mL) and progesterone (preadministration, 0.48 [0.05] ng/mL; post administration, 0.40 [0.06] ng/mL) reached menopausal levels. Sex hormone deficiency was associated with climacteric vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and sweating. Sleep latencies and architecture did not change significantly with LA administration. The participants subjectively noticed some increased snoring that was not confirmed by polysomnogram. Specifically, there was no change in arousal index and no evidence for sleep fragmentation to suggest the presence of increased upper-airway resistance during sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index, 0.07 (0.02) to 0.22 (0.11) events per hour of sleep, did not change with sex hormone deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sex hormone deficiency in young women resulted in climacteric symptoms and cessation of menses, and was not associated with sleep fragmentation or clinically significant SDB.

When delta activity was normalized for the activity in rapid eye movement sleep, women had lower delta activity than men. Growth hormone secretion was estimated by deconvolution. The prolactin profile was quantified by a best-fit curve. In both sexes, growth hormone was released both before and after sleep onset. In men, there was no relationship between presleep growth hormone release and subsequent sleep quality and postsleep growth hormone release correlated with delta activity. In women, presleep growth hormone release appeared to inhibit both postsleep growth hormone release and sleep consolidation. Prolactin release was related to rapid eye movement sleep and was lower in men than in women. Women with poor sleep maintenance had a lower prolactin acrophase.Conclusions:Major sex differences in the nocturnal profiles of growth hormone and prolactin and their relationship to sleep electroencephalogram variables are present in healthy older adults. Our analyses suggest that lower sleep-onset release of growth hormone in women as compared with men could be related to lower levels of delta activity. Improvements in the homeostatic control of sleep could have hormonal benefits in older adults.

AB  - Study Objectives:To examine sex effects on sleep stages and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power in older adults.Design:Sleep was polygraphically recorded for 2 consecutive nights, and blood was sampled during the last 24 hours.Setting:The University of Chicago Clinical Research Center.Participants:Two groups of healthy nonobese older subjects: 10 men (59 +/- 2 years), and 10 postmenopausal women (63 +/- 2 years).Interventions:N/A.Measurements and Results:A spectral analysis of the EEG was performed in the delta and alpha bands. There were no sex differences in sleep stages. Blood sampling resulted in reductions of total sleep time, sleep maintenance, slow-wave sleep, and absolute delta activity that were all larger in women than in men. In absolute values, delta and alpha activities in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were higher in women than in men, but, for delta activity, the sex differences were larger in REM than in NREM sleep. In women, but not in men, absolute delta activity in REM was decreased during blood sampling and was strongly correlated with absolute delta activity in NREM. Delta activity in REM did not dissipate across the night in either group. When normalized for the activity in REM sleep, the sex difference in delta activity in NREM sleep was reversed, with lower activity in women.Conclusions:Sex differences in sleep EEG variables are present in older adults. When normalized, delta activity in older women is lower than in older men, which may be more consistent with sex differences in subjective complaints, in fragility of sleep in the presence of environmental disturbances, and in the relationship to growth-hormone release.

AB  - Insomnia is a common and significant healthcare problem, and affects a large percentage of women seen by general practitioners, obstetrician-gynecologists and mental health professionals. Specific risk factors for insomnia may be gender-related, including higher prevalence rates of depression and anxiety among women, environmental and social factors, as well as reproductive-related factors (e.g., peri-menstrual difficulties and menopause-related symptoms). Sleep problems interfere significantly with daytime functioning and overall well-being, and may lead to serious clinical consequences. Treatment options include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines, nonprescription sleep aids, and non-pharmacologic interventions such as sleep hygiene measures. This article reviews the existing literature on the prevalence, clinical characteristics of insomnia in women, and highlights some of the treatment options available. Healthcare providers should be aware of the variety of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options for treatment of insomnia and, in particular, be able to weigh their efficacy against the risks of side effects and next-day sedation.

AB  - Study Objective:To examine (1) sleep architecture of infants at varied risk for sudden infant death syndrome, (2) delays or advances in preterm infants at term postmenstrual age, (3) whether ventilatory support and gestational age alter sleep, (4) whether steroids alter sleep, (5) confounding influences of sex, small for gestational age, and maternal smoking.Design:Overnight polysomnography. Dependent variables: Percentage of active sleep, quiet sleep, indeterminate, and awake time per total recording time; mean and longest duration of state epochs; number of episodes = 10 minutes; and sleep efficiency.Setting:Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME).Participants:Two hundred one preterm and 198 term infants between 33 and 58 weeks postmenstrual age during polysomnography. Fifty-one term infants with an apparent life-threatening event without known etiology (apnea of infancy), 59 subsequent siblings of babies who died of sudden infant death syndrome, and 88 healthy term infants.Results:Tracings of infants with apnea of infancy and healthy term infants were similar. Subsequent siblings of babies who died of sudden infant death syndrome spent less time in quiet sleep. Preterm infants (= 37 weeks postmenstrual age) exhibited immature architecture compared with infants of term postmenstrual age. The latter exhibited similar sleep except that they had a lower percentage of quiet sleep and longer mean indeterminate and longest indeterminate episodes. Preterm infants with the youngest gestational age lagged behind older preterm infants. Neither sex nor use of steroids affected sleep. Assisted ventilation was associated with a delay in maturation, small-for-gestational age status with increased active sleep, and smoking with increased awake time.Conclusion:With few exceptions, asymptomatic premature infants do not exhibit significant delays in sleep architecture compared with term infants at comparable postmenstrual age. The preterm infant with an early gestational age and morbidity exhibited delayed sleep architecture.

AB  - Disrupted sleep is the most common form of sleep deprivation in travellers, shift workers, athletes the night before important competitions and among parents of infants. The influence of partial sleep loss on muscle strength might differ according to the time of testing on the following day. This study was therefore designed to assess the interaction between the effects of partial sleep loss and time of day on muscle strength in females. Eight sedentary eumenorrheic females (mean ± SD; age 30 ± 6 years, height 1.62 ± 0.06 m and body mass 67 ± 5.0 kg) took part in the study, in a counterbalanced design. Measurements of muscle strength were carried out at 06:00 and 18:00 hours after the one control night (no sleep loss) and the one night of partial sleep loss, during menses. Muscle strength measures included isokinetic (at 1.05, 3.14 rad s -1 ; 90° range of motion) and isometric peak torque (at 60° of knee flexion) of knee extensors and flexors (dominant leg). In addition, isometric force of knee extensors with super-imposed electrical twitches (50 Hz, 250 V, 200 [mu]s pulse width) was measured using the same procedure in order to control for motivation. Rectal temperature was measured during the 30 min before muscle strength measurements. Partial sleep loss consisted of allowing 2.5 h sleep (between 03:00 and 05:30 h), whilst in the control condition (no sleep loss) subjects retired between 22:30 and 23:30 h, rising at 05:30 hours. All measurements were conducted at just one phase of the menstrual cycle (menses) to prevent any masking effect due to different phases of the menstrual cycle. In both conditions (with and without partial sleep loss) a diurnal variation was observed in peak torque of knee flexors at 1.05 ( F 1,7 = 5.5, p

AB  - Clinical observations show that migraine attacks have a seasonal, menstrual and circadian timing, suggesting a role of chronobiological mechanisms and their alterations in the disease, but little experimental data exists about this issue. The aim of this study was to estimate sleep quality chronotypes and the possible circadian timing of attacks in migraneurs. One hundred patients suffering from migraine without aura according to the IHS criteria (2004), and 30 controls were enrolled. Morning and evening type subjects were more represented in migraine patients than in controls and showed a tendency towards worse sleep quality and higher disability. Forty-two percent of migraineurs presented more than 75% of their attacks at night. Morning and evening types rather than intermediate and differences between real and preferred times may represent stressors that can worsen the disease. A preferential timing for occurrence of migraine attacks during the night and early morning hours was documented.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain data on sleep quality in women attending menopause clinics in Italy. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the sleep quality of postmenopausal women attending a network of first-level outpatient menopause clinics in Italy for general counseling about menopause or treatment of its symptoms. Eligible for the study were women observed consecutively during the study period with natural or spontaneous menopause.All participating centers enrolled women into the study who had never used hormone therapy (HT) (group 1, 819 women), current users of transdermal estrogens with or without progestins (group 2, 819 women), and current users of oral estrogens with or without progestins (group 3, 790 women). The women were asked about their quality of sleep using the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, their quality of life using the Short Form-12 questionnaire, and the intensity of hot flushes using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Women in groups 2 and 3 tended to report difficulties in sleeping less often than those in group 1. For example, never users of HT more frequently reported sleeping poorly and needed more time to sleep or had problems falling asleep; these differences were significant (P < 0.05). Otherwise, no difference emerged from the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire between women in groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives support to the suggestion that HT improves the quality of sleep. The effect was similar in women taking oral or transdermal therapy with or without progestins.

AB  - Research has supported the applicability and efficacy of light therapy in the treatment of nonseasonal depression. The investigators examined the effects of light therapy on sleep, core temperature, depressed mood, and perception of fatigue and energy in a sample of pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women diagnosed with nonseasonal, nonbipolar depression. Women were randomly assigned to either light therapy (n = 16) or placebo (n = 13) for a 28-day period. Pre and post measures of sleep and core temperature were collected. In addition, measures of depressed mood, fatigue, and energy were collected throughout the study period. Significant changes in depression and energy were found in the treatment group, but not in the placebo group. There was a significant reduction in the temperature mesor and less wake time during the first third of the sleep period in the treatment group but not in the placebo group. Light therapy yielded significant improvement in depression when compared with placebo intervention and core temperature mesor returned to normal. There was no significant phase shift, perhaps due in part to the absence of any baseline circadian phase disturbances. Relationships between temperature, sleep, depressed mood, fatigue, and energy variables offer potential directions for future research and clinical intervention.

AB  - The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1) the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

AB  - Objective. To determine patterns of behavioral factors in potential users of the Menopausal Women's Health Program in the Molino de la Vega Basic Health Area in Huelva.Method. A descriptive study was performed in 60 women (aged between 40 and 60 years old) in the Basic Health Area. The women were administered a questionnaire consisting of 146 questions, grouped into five dimensions, with prior validation by an expert panel and pilot study. Statistical analysis: absolute frequencies and percentages, application of the test of independence, analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls test.Results. a) Dietary behavior: 65% of the women drank milk two or more times per day; 90% showed moderate fiber intake; meat was eaten several times per week by 83%, pork by 55%, egg by 78%, blue fish by 75%, and slow-release carbohydrates by 76%. A total of 86.7% used olive oil. b) Physical activity: 40% reported taking physical activity rarely or never. c) Sleep patterns: 78.3% reported frequent waking. d) Psychosocial behavior: 66% of the women went out with their partners or friends only occasionally or never; 64.5% never initiated sexual relations. e) Other behavior: 83.3% had never smoked, 18.4% frequently took hypnotics, 25% took tranquilizers, and 48.3% took pain killers.Conclusions. Educational intervention was required in most of the dimensions. The least healthy behavior patterns were found in the dimensions of physical activity and psychosocial aspects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have found increased breast cancer risk among female cabin crew. This has been suggested to reflect lifestyle factors (for example, age at first birth), other confounding factors (for example, age at menarche), or occupational factors such as exposure to cosmic radiation and circadian rhythm alterations due to repeated jet lag. AIMS: To assess the contribution of occupational versus lifestyle and other factors to breast cancer risk among cabin attendants in Finland. METHODS: A standardised self-administered questionnaire on demographic, occupational, and lifestyle factors was given to 1041 cabin attendants. A total of 27 breast cancer cases and 517 non-cases completed the questionnaire. Breast cancer diagnoses were confirmed through the Finnish Cancer Registry. Exposure to cosmic radiation was estimated based on self-reported flight history and timetables. A conditional logistic regression model was used for analysis. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, family history of breast cancer (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.00 to 7.08) was the strongest determinant of breast cancer. Of occupational exposures, sleep rhythm disruptions (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 0.70 to 4.27) were positively related and disruption of menstrual cycles (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.26 to 1.96) negatively related to breast cancer. However, both associations were statistically non-significant. Cumulative radiation dose (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.19) showed no effect on breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that breast cancer risk among Finnish cabin attendants is related to well established risk factors of breast cancer, such as family history of breast cancer. There was no clear evidence that the three occupational factors studied affected breast cancer risk among Finnish flight attendants.

AB  - More than 1.7 million American women are expected to reach menopause each year. Recent Canadian statistics show that a 50-year-old woman can now expect to live until her mid-80s, which implies living at least one-third of her life after menopause. The menopausal transition is typically marked by intense hormonal fluctuations, accompanied by vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flashes, night sweats), sleeps disturbance, and changes in sexual function, as well as increased risk for osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline. More importantly, recent studies have demonstrated a significant association between menopausal transition and a higher risk for developing depression. In the post-Women's Health Initiative Study era, physicians and patients are questioning the safety and efficacy of long-term hormone therapy use. This article reviews the current literature on the benefits and risks of using hormone therapy for the treatment of menopause-related mood disturbances and alternate strategies currently available for the management of menopause-related problems, including antidepressants, complementary and alternative medicine, and selective estrogen receptor modulators.

AB  - Sleep, a basic physiological need of all humans, appears to be both integrative and restorative. However, studies have reported that 33-51% of women show a dramatic increase in sleep disturbance in the mid-life years, a time when they enter menopause. The purposes of this study were to (1) explore the prevalence of poor sleep quality in menopausal women; (2) identify the relationship between sleep quality of menopausal women and its related factors; (3) predict the possible explanations of how the related variables affect sleep quality of menopausal women; and (4) provide recommendations for future strategies that aim to improve sleep quality of menopausal women. A cross-sectional, correlation coefficient design was used. Purposive sampling was employed to recruit 197 menopause women from a small town in central Taiwan. T-test, one-way ANOVA, and multiple regression were used for data analysis. The results were as follows: (1) overall, the total score for sleep quality was 5.55 +/- 3.47; 57.9% of subjects were identified as good sleepers and 42.1% as poor sleepers; (2) there were significant differences in quality of sleep related to occupational situation, history of chronic disease, menopausal status, number of chronic diseases, and number of menopausal symptoms (t = - 3.49, - 3.37, p < .01; F = 3.62, p < .05, F = 4.95, 5.35, p < .01); (3) depression and aging were strongly related to quality of sleep (r = .57; .22, p < .01); (4) 36% of variance in quality of sleep can be explained by depression and aging.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of combination estrogen/androgen therapy on muscle mass, strength and endurance, serum hormone and lipid profiles, and quality of life measures in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study at a tertiary care medical center. Fifty postmenopausal women were randomized to a 12-week course of (1) dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) 50 mg daily, (2) conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg daily, (3) DHEA 50 mg+CEE 0.625 mg daily, or (4) placebo. Main outcome measures of lower extremity muscle (calf) mass, functional muscle parameters, serum hormone and lipid levels, and quality of life (QOL) were obtained at baseline and after treatment. Statistical analysis compared percent change from baseline values and treatment differences among outcomes. RESULTS: Significant increases in mean DHEA, DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), testosterone, and androstenedione levels were noted with DHEA alone or combined DHEA/CEE treatments when compared with placebo. Compared with no hormone therapy, none of the supplemental hormone groups caused significant changes in muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle endurance, feelings of well-being, sleep, or sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Androgen replacement therapy, with DHEA, to menopausal women increases serum androgen levels without any appreciable effect on muscle cross-sectional area, muscle strength, muscle function, or improvement in health-related QOL.

AB  - The purpose of this randomized clinical trial study was to determine the effectiveness of a 24-week, home-based, moderate-intensity, walking intervention in improving symptoms (vasomotor, uro-genital/sexual, sleep, psychological, cognitive, physical) experienced by midlife women. One hundred and seventy-three Caucasian and African American women aged 45 to 65 who were not on hormone therapy, had no major signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease, and were sedentary in their leisure activity were randomly assigned to the moderate-intensity walking group or the nonexercise control group. The exercise prescription was walking at a frequency of 4 times a week for a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. The symptom impact inventory included the frequency, intensity, and bothersomeness of 33 symptoms collected at baseline and 24 weeks. Adherence was measured with a heart rate monitor and exercise log. Average adherence to frequency of walking was 71.6% of the expected walks. After 24 weeks, there were no differences between the walking and control group on change in symptoms. However, multiple regression revealed that frequency of adherence to walking along with change in physical symptoms and menopausal status were significant predictors of change in sleep symptoms. While walking did not improve most symptoms experienced by midlife women, frequency of walking may improve sleep.

AB  - Objective: To delineate the role of hormone levels, menopause status, exogenous hormone use, and personal characteristics in the changing prevalence and impact of menopause symptoms.Design: Annual longitudinal data were from Michigan Bone Health Study enrollees aged 24 to 44 years at baseline and followed up for a 10-year period beginning in 1992. In self-administered interviews, women reported the presence of and degree of bother (values from 1 = low to 8 = high) for symptoms related to sexuality, vasomotor, sleep/fatigue, negative mood, hair/skin, and urinary problems. Annually, collected sera samples were analyzed for estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone concentrations.Results: Increasing age consistently predicted the development and bother of the measured symptoms. Transition to postmenopause and higher levels of follicle-stimulating hormone were significantly predictive only of the sexuality and vasomotor constructs, whereas higher estradiol levels were protective against increasing frequency and bother from sexuality and vasomotor constructs. Problems with sleeping, and secondarily, vasomotor symptoms, were the most bothersome constructs. Higher body mass index and current smoking behavior were highly related to increased bother with many symptom constructs, but especially vasomotor symptoms. Exogenous hormone use was associated with more bother from all symptom constructs.Conclusions: Sexuality and vasomotor symptom constructs seem to be more related to menopause than other constructs. The frequency of other constructs in the pre-menopause and their very strong association with increasing age suggest caution in attributing these factors directly to neuroendocrine events of the menopause transition. The strong associations between smoking and body size with symptoms, particularly vasomotor symptoms, suggest that interventions directed at these personal characteristics might be effective in dampening their impact.

AB  - Knowledge from traditional neuroanatomical techniques coupled with more recent advances in functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics have led to a better understanding of how structure relates to function of many biological rhythms. In this article we review the current state of knowledge of the functional neuroanatomy of sleep-wake and circadian rhythms and selected infradian rhythms (eg, menstrual and seasonal). We anticipate that progress in our understanding of the molecular biology of sleep and circadian rhythms will lead to the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for improved health and quality of life, and for maintaining performance levels during adverse conditions.

AB  - Study Objective: Female hormones, specifically progesterone, that peak in the luteal phase may play a significant role in protecting premenopausal women from sleep-disordered breathing. The influence of female hormones on upper airway resistance during sleep was investigated during the follicular and luteal phases of normal menstrual cycles.Setting: Hospital-based sleep laboratory.Design and Participants: Healthy women with verified ovulatory cycles and without sleep complaints were recruited into the study. Sleep and upper airway resistance data (mean +/- SD) were collected on 2 nights from 11 women (21-49 years of age [28 +/- 9 years], body mass index of 22.8 +/- 3.6 kg/m[2]), once during the follicular phase (day 6-11) and once in the luteal phase (day 19-23) in random order.Measurements and Results: Nasal resistance, standardized to a flow rate of 0.3 L/second, measured using posterior active rhinomanometry immediately prior to the sleep study, did not differ between the 2 phases. The respiratory disturbance index tended to be higher in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase and was above 5 per hour for 3 women in the follicular phase. Upper airway resistance, controlled for flow rate and body position, was calculated for 50 random breaths during wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2, slow-wave, and rapid eye movement sleep. During wake and stage 2 sleep, upper airway resistance was significantly higher in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase, as was the overall upper airway resistance combined for wake and across all sleep stages. Combining data from the 2 nights, compared to wake, upper airway resistance increased in stage 2, slow-wave, and rapid eye movement sleep.Conclusions: Within the menstrual cycle, upper airway resistance is lower in the luteal compared with the follicular phase.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that energy and cognitive and physical complaints such as fatigue, disrupted sleep, concentration problems, and pain are more problematic than clinical depression during the climacteric and may contribute to depressed mood. Central nervous system pathways that mediate mood, cognition, and energy are influenced by fluctuations of circulating estrogen during perimenopause. Symptoms are also influenced by other factors, including psychosocial and environmental stresses and supports. Health care for women from perimenopause to postmenopause should include an accurate assessment of energy and cognitive, physical, and emotional symptoms. Multidisciplinary approaches that combine prevention, symptom management, and health promotion are most effective for women. A mind/body program for perimenopause and menopause is presented as an example of a comprehensive treatment approach for assessment and management of perimenopause and menopause. This 10-week group program combined information, self-education, relaxation training, group support, lifestyle modification, and psychological coping skills.

AB  - Vasomotor symptoms are the most common medical complaint of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Frequent vasomotor symptoms can be disabling, affecting a woman's social life, psychological health, sense of well-being and ability to work. Women with hot flushes are more likely to experience disturbed sleep, depressive symptoms and significant reductions in quality of life as compared to asymptomatic women. Despite the prevalence and impact of these symptoms, the pathophysiology of hot flushes is unclear; however, estrogen withdrawal clearly plays an important role. It is postulated that declining estrogen concentrations may lead to changes in brain neurotransmitters and instability in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. The most effective therapy for relieving vasomotor symptoms and reducing their impact on quality of life is hormone therapy. Other options for women who decline hormone therapy include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and related agents. Most herbal therapies that have been evaluated in placebo-controlled trials have shown no clinically significant benefit.

AB  - Objective: To study the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in postmenopausal women and to evaluate whether hormone therapy (HT) has a modifying effect on coping.Design: Twenty-six postmenopausal women, aged 58 to 72 years (mean 64 years), volunteered for the study (HT users, n = 16; nonusers, n = 10). They spent four consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. The cognitive tests were performed three times: after the baseline night, after one night of sleep deprivation, and after the rebound night. The cognitive measures included visual episodic memory, visuomotor performance, verbal attention, and shared attention.Results: The practice effect typically occurring in cognitive tests was blunted during sleep deprivation, which indicated deterioration of performance. At rebound, performance improved in visual episodic memory (immediate recall P < 0.01; delayed recall P < 0.05), visuomotor performance (P < 0.001), verbal attention (P < 0.0001), and shared attention (P < 0.05). HT users performed better than nonusers in the visual episodic memory test (P < 0.05) and in one of three subtests of shared attention (cancellation P = 0.040). Otherwise hormone therapy did not influence the results.Conclusions: In postmenopausal women, sleep deprivation impaired visual functions and attention. However, this effect was not prolonged because after one rebound night the performance was improved, compared with baseline. Hormone therapy did not modify the cognitive performance during sleep deprivation.

Common treatments for menopausal symptoms are considered to be contraindicated in women with breast cancer.This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study of long-term breast cancer survivors; a subset of a study that responded to a mailed survey targeting long-term cancer survivors treated at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.In 291 breast cancer patients information was available that included items that commonly relate to menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, painful sexual intercourse, inability to concentrate, fatigue and sleep disturbances.Ninety per cent were Caucasian American and the mean time since diagnosis was 16 ± 8 years. All patients had been treated with surgery, (60%) with radiotherapy, (68%) with chemotherapy and (37%) with hormonal therapy. Forty-six per cent of the breast cancer survivors indicated that having breast cancer affected their overall health. Self-reported health effects were more common in those survivors who had received a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A menopausal quality of life score was determined using the items about hot flushes, ability to concentrate, painful sexual intercourse, fatigue, unhappiness and sleep disturbances.This study reminds us that breast cancer and menopause are independent issues. Quality of life parameters need to be rigidly defined and time sensitive. There are complex interactions between quality of life indicators and specific physiologic consequences of treatment. However, menopausal signs and symptoms may not be different for the breast cancer survivor and they should not be confused with the quality of life/psychosocial issues of the cancer survivor.Menopause is not a disease process but a normal developmental stage for women. It is important for nurses not only to understand the client needs of the menopausal woman, but also to be able to differentiate between quality of life issues related to menopause and to cancer treatment in order to provide holistic nursing care.

AB  - Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian ( approximately 24-hour), circamensual ( approximately monthly), and circannual ( approximately yearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche, reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs. evening) of drug use.

AB  - It is widely believed that hot flashes arouse and waken women from sleep, possibly leading to fatigue and impaired performance. In this prospective survey, healthy women 46 to 51 years of age were sent a questionnaire and interviewed to rule out those having sleep disorders or physical or mental illness and those using drugs. The electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, and chin electromyogram were recorded during 3 consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory. Hot flashes were measured by the sternal skin conductance technique. Performance was assessed using a divided attention task, the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. The Profile of Mood States also was administered.The 11 premenopausal cycling women in the study were significantly younger than the 8 postmenopausal women who lacked symptoms. They had significantly higher estradiol levels than did the 12 postmenopausal women who were symptomatic. Symptomatic women had an average of 5.2 hot flashes per night, whereas none occurred in the other 2 groups. Hot flashes occurred during stage 2 sleep in 40% of cases and during the waking state in 34%. No sleep variables distinguished significantly between the 3 groups. More than half (55%) of awakenings that occurred within 2 minutes of a hot flash took place before the flash, 40% afterward, and 5% simultaneously. There were no significant differences between the 3 groups in self-reported fatigue. There also were no significant group differences in any of the performance measures.These findings fail to support the idea that hot flashes disturb sleep in postmenopausal women. Past reports of sleep disturbance at the time of menopause may reflect sleep disorders that, in the present study, were screened out.

AB  - The Chinese are deeply influenced by traditional Chinese culture. Chinese herbal use is a common practice to enhance reproductive health. 'Good' menstrual health facilitates fertility and sets a positive stage for pregnancy during the childbearing years. Many Chinese Americans use traditional Chinese health practices, but they are less likely to disclose these practices. Although the upward trend of herbal use is more prevalent among women and ethnic minorities, little data are available about herbal use in these populations.The overall aim of this dissertation was to examine the influences of health promoting behaviors and the perimenstrual symptom experience on Chinese herbal use among childbearing-age Chinese American women from the theoretical perspectives of Chinese culture, women's health, and health promotion. This cross-sectional, descriptive study included 103 Chinese American women, 21 to 40 years, responding to self-administered questionnaires. Follow-up data were collected prospectively on a subset of the women regarding their perimenstrual symptoms during menstruation.Over 90% of women reported past use of Chinese herbs; 22% were current herbal users; and 70% had consumed Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms, with 55% to 95% of them experiencing relief. Current herbal users were significantly less acculturated. The primary reason for using Chinese herbs was enhanced sense of well-being. A majority of herbal users did not inform their Western health provider of their herbal use. Being less acculturated and engaging in nutrition-related health promoting behaviors were statistically significant determinants of Chinese herbal use.Most women experienced minimal severity of perimenstrual symptoms. Abdominal bloating, fatigue, and breast soreness were the most prevalent and severe symptoms reported retrospectively and prospectively. Uterine cramps were more prevalent during the menstrual period only. Although there were no statistically significant perimenstrual symptom differences between herbal and non-herbal users, women who reported a higher severity of sleep disturbance and emotional related perimenstrual symptoms were more likely to use Chinese herbs.Congruent with Chinese culture, which values health promotion, a majority of the women were relatively healthy and engaged routinely in health promoting behaviors. One such health promoting practice was the use of Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms.

AB  - Objective: Nonhormonal treatment of postmenopausal symptoms is a subject of great interest today. The results of studies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are promising, but long-term results do not exist. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram and fluoxetine in the treatment of physical and psychological menopausal symptoms and their effects on psychosocial and sexual well being in symptomatic postmenopausal women.Design: One hundred fifty healthy women suffering from menopausal symptoms were recruited to this placebo-controlled double-blind study with a follow-up period of 9 months. They were randomized into three groups receiving placebo, fluoxetine, or citalopram. The initial dose was 10 mg of both fluoxetine and citalopram, and it was increased to 20 mg at 1 month and to 30 mg at the 6-month visit. The main outcome measures were hot flushes and Kupperman index. The RAND-36 Quality of Life questionnaire, Beck's Depression Scale, and the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire were used at every control visit.Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in respect to number of hot flushes, Kupperman index, or Beck's Depression Scale, although there was a tendency in all these parameters in favor of SSRIs versus placebo. Insomnia improved significantly in the citalopram group versus placebo. Discontinuation rates at nine months were 40% in the placebo group, 34% in the fluoxetine group and 34% in the citalopram group.Conclusions: Compared with placebo, citalopram and fluoxetine have little effect on hot flushes and cannot therefore be recommended for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, if vasomotor symptoms are the main complaint. Whether the improvement of insomnia by means of citalopram affects the quality of sleep needs further investigation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the psychometric properties of a menopause symptom rating scale developed on nondisabled women in a sample of women polio survivors with physical disabilities.Design: The 25-item Menopause Symptom List (MSL) was administered to 190 women between ages 40 and 65 not taking hormone or estrogen therapy. Factor analysis, bivariate correlation, and analysis of variance were performed to determine the scale's underlying structure, construct validity, and association with menopausal status.Results: Factor analysis revealed four factors: (1) psychological, (2) somatic-sensory, (3) somatic-sleep, and (4) vasomotor. Factors 1 and 3 were associated with postpolio sequelae, self-rated health, positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, and perceived stress. Factor 2 was associated with postpolio sequelae, basic activities of daily living, self-rated health, negative affect, life satisfaction, and perceived stress. Factor 4 was associated with postpolio sequelae, self-rated health, negative affect, and perceived stress. Comparison by menopause status found Factors 1 and 3 significantly differed between groups (F(2,181) = 6.68 and 4.17, respectively; P = 0.02). Contrary to expectations, vasomotor factor severity was not distinguished by menopause status.Conclusions: Menopause symptom scales standardized on nondisabled women should be used cautiously with women with physical disabilities. Associations between construct validity measures and menopause symptomatology suggest a complex relationship between physical disability and menopause.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of the five-item Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS) by comparing women taking hormone therapy (HT) versus those taking a placebo and by comparing women known to differ in vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: The WHIIRS was included in two phase III randomized trials intended to evaluate the efficacy of a combination estradiol plus and norethindrone acetate transdermal delivery system in reducing vasomotor symptoms. In all, 850 healthy postmenopausal women participated in these studies. Both trials were double-blind, one was placebo-controlled and the other was positive-controlled. The former trial admitted women with > or =8 hot flashes/day and lasted 12 weeks with data collected on the WHIIRS at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The other trial had no entry criteria pertaining to hot flashes and lasted 52 weeks with WHIIRS data collected at baseline, 12, 24, and 52 weeks. RESULTS: The WHIIRS was sensitive to the effect of HT on sleep disturbance over time. The WHIIRS also detected differences in self-reported sleep disturbance between women with mild vasomotor symptoms compared with those with moderate to severe symptoms. As expected, the study using a positive control revealed that sleep improved over time (p <.0001). Also as predicted, the study using a placebo control found that sleep disturbance in the treatment groups improved at a faster rate than in the control groups (p = .035). CONCLUSION: The construct validity of the WHIIRS was supported because it was successfully used to detect self-reported sleep disturbance differences in women taking HT versus those taking a placebo as well as in groups known to differ in severity of their vasomotor symptoms.

AB  - Sleep is an essential component of good health. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women often have periods of insomnia that affect physiological and psychological well-being. The purpose of this article is to examine selected relevant literature pertaining to the pathophysiology of sleeplessness in women in their perimenopausal and postmenopausal years, current therapies for insomnia, and present a protocol for evaluation and treatment of insomnia for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Among the most common causes of insomnia in this group of women are hot flashes, anxiety, caffeine, smoking, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, obesity, periodic limb movements, and low estrogen levels. Effective therapies include treatment of underlying causes, good sleep habits, relaxation techniques, and, if indicated, medications.

AB  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guide-lines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: To review recent investigations examining the effects of neuroendocrine changes in obstructive sleep apnea.Recent Findings: Gonadal hormones have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. Recently, exogenous testosterone has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea, whereas hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women may be protective in obstructive sleep apnea. Effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with nasal continuous positive airway pressure has been associated with improved insulin sensitivity and testicular function in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.Summary: It is important to consider the potential development of sleep apnea in any patient who has an endocrine disorder or is receiving certain hormonal therapies. Effective assessment and management of obstructive sleep apnea with nasal continuous positive airway pressure may lead to a reduction in insulin resistance and hypertension as well as other markers of vascular risk in patients with metabolic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although most adults in the United States obtain less sleep than they need, women report more sleep deprivation throughout their lifetime than do men. The prevalence of self-reported sleep difficulty increases as women make the transition from the premenopausal to the postmenopausal period. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of zolpidem as a treatment for insomnia in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. METHODS: Women who were perimenopausal or postmenopausal for >or=6 months, who had developed insomnia in conjunction with menopausal symptoms, and who had difficulty maintaining sleep or had nonrestorative sleep for >or=6 months were eligible for this 4-week, multicenter study. Sleep maintenance difficulty had to occur an average of >or=3 nights per week and had to be accompanied by >or=2 nocturnal hot flashes, hot flushes, or night sweats. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of 2 treatment groups--zolpidem 10 mg or placebo. Capsules were provided in weekly blister cards, and patients were instructed to take 1 capsule each night at bedtime. Patients recorded estimates of their sleep quality and quantity and daytime functioning on daily morning and evening questionnaires, and made weekly global assessments of sleep. RESULTS: The study included 141 women (mean age +/- SD, 50.8 +/- 4.5 years; age range, 39-60 years). Increases in reported total sleep time were significantly greater in the zolpidem group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01) for each treatment week. Wake time after sleep onset and number of awakenings decreased significantly in the zolpidem group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). Each week, approximately twice as many patients in the zolpidem group as in the placebo group reported improved sleep (P < 0.001 for each week). The improvement in sleep-related difficulty with daytime functioning was significantly greater in the zolpidem group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). The effects of zolpidem did not diminish with the duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Zolpidem 10 mg/d was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of menopause-related insomnia in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

AB  - In this study, 63 women with a history of at least 4 years of abnormal bleeding who had failed treatment with cyclic medroxyprogesterone were randomized to treatment with expanded medical treatment or hysterectomy. The recommended medical regimen was 21 days of low-dose oral contraceptive followed by 5 days of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor starting on day 1 of the menstrual cycle. Some patients received continuous oral contraceptives, alternative progestogens, oral or intramuscular, or cyclic estrogen-progestin, accordingly. The type and route of hysterectomy were selected by the surgeon.At enrollment, each patient underwent evaluation for sociodemographic, clinical, and health-related quality-of-life variables. Four weeks after surgery or the start of expanded medical therapy, reassessment was made by telephone interview. In addition, patients were seen in the clinic every 6 months for 2 years, and further telephone interviews were conducted at 3, 9, 15, and 21 months after enrollment. Measures for quality-of-life variables were made using modifications of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), including MOS SF-36, the Mental Component Summary (MCS), and the Physical Component Summary (PCS).At enrollment, most participants reported symptoms of pelvic pain and pressure and had fibroids on pelvic examination. Their mean MCS and PCS scores were 45 and 42, respectively (compared to U.S. norms of 49 and 51); the mean body mass index was 32. Of 31 women randomized to hysterectomy, 10 had an abdominal and 18 had a vaginal procedure. Most of the 32 participants randomized to expanded medical treatment received hormonal treatment with or without prostaglandin inhibitor (29 of 32, 91%). Three others were treated with prostaglandin inhibitor only.After 4 weeks of follow up, the PCS scores of women who had undergone hysterectomy were lower than at baseline, whereas women receiving medical treatment showed some improvement. However, the MCS score of women in the hysterectomy group improved relative to baseline and were higher than those for women in the medical group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.03 for differences, respectively).After 6 months of follow up, the PCS scores of those who had hysterectomy had improved and were significantly higher than those in the medicine group (8 vs. 2; P = 0.04). Compared with those receiving expanded medical treatment, the hysterectomy group also reported greater sexual desire (P = 0.01), less interference with sex (P = 0.003), less health distress (P = 0.009), fewer sleep problems (P = 0.03), greater overall health (P = 0.006), and greater satisfaction with health (P = 0.01).Fourteen women (43%) in the medicine group requested hysterectomy in the first year of follow up, and, within 2 years, an additional 3 crossed over from medical treatment to hysterectomy. After surgery, these women reported improvements similar to those who had initial hysterectomy. Women who continued with expanded medical treatment did not improve significantly in their MCS score.After 2 years of follow up, women who had hysterectomy continued to report improvement in all outcome measures. The secondary symptoms of women receiving medical treatment also improved. At 2 years, the only difference in symptoms was that women in the hysterectomy group continued to report a significantly greater increase in sexual desire than women in the medical group.

AB  - Objective: To study the relationship between current menopause status, occurrence of menopause transition during cancer treatment, and prevalence and severity of possible menopause-related symptoms.Design: Data from the Cancer and Menopause Study (CAMS), a tumor-registry-based cohort of breast cancer survivors (BCS) diagnosed before age 50, were used. Using a standardized symptom checklist, women reported whether they were not at all, slightly, moderately, quite, or extremely bothered in the past 4 weeks by hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, breast sensitivity, joint pains, frequent mood changes, restless sleep, weight gain, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating. Current menopause status (by standard categories based on menstruation) and whether a persistent menopause transition occurred during cancer treatment were the main exposures. Linear (symptom severity as continuous outcome) and logistic (symptom present vs absent) regression models were adjusted for age, ethnicity, current smoking, alcohol use, chemotherapy, tamoxifen, body mass index, and depression scores.Results: Mean age of the participants was 50 years. The prevalence of symptoms was high. Hot flashes occurred in 17%, 51%, and 71% of pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal BCS, respectively. Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and pain with intercourse were more severe in postmenopausal compared with perimenopausal BCS. Having had a transition during breast cancer treatment was associated with worse hot flash severity, independent of current menopause status.Conclusions: Menopause-related symptoms are common in BCS. Effective treatment options are needed. Having a treatment-related transition confers a persistent effect on hot flash severity. Clinicians should include this information when counseling women on potential outcomes of their cancer therapy.

AB  - Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 micro T above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 micro T during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 micro T during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.

AB  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

AB  - Is there an association between depression and the transition to menopause?METHODS:Design: Longitudinal prospective cohort study.Follow up period: Four years.Setting: Philadelphia County, USA; timeframe not statedPeople: 436 initially premenopausal women (218 white, 218 African American mean age at endpoint 44.6 years, range 38-52 years) with 22-35 day menstrual cycles, an intact uterus and of least one ovary. Exclusions: psychotropic or hormonal medication, pregnancy, breastfeeding, compromised ovarian function, or substance abuse. Risk factors: Data were collected during six assessments, approximately every 8 months. Trained researchers collected blood samples for hormone assays (obtained between days 2 and 6 of consecutive menstrual cycles); administered a structured interview to assess general health status and behaviour, and the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Major depressive disorder was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria. At each interview, menopausal status was determined. Outcomes: Depressive symptoms (CES-D a cut off score of >/=16 defined high depressive symptoms); MDD; menopausal status determined with the Staging System for Reproductive Aging in Women (premenopausal: regular 22-35 day menstrual cycle; early menopause: change in cycle length by more than a week for two cycles; late menopause: absence of menstruation for 3-11 months; postmenopausal: absence of menstruation for more than 12 months); predictor variables (including hot flashes, sleep pattern, employment status, history of depression, PMS severity).MAIN RESULTS:Data are presented for 76% of the original sample (332 women). 21% of women had a history of depression at baseline. At 4 years, 3% were postmenopausal, 3% in late menopause, 21% in early menopause, and 73% remained premenopausal. Depressive symptoms were more likely during early and late transition to menopause than pre or post menopause. History of depression, severe PMS, and poor sleep increased likelihood of depression in menopausal women (see http://www.ebmentalhealth.com/supplemental for table).CONCLUSIONS:Depression significantly increases in women as they reach menopause but decreases once menopause is complete.

AB  - Background: Napping patterns and relationships among naps, circadian rhythms, and nocturnal sleep were evaluated in postmenopausal women. Naps and nocturnal sleep were compared between depressed women and healthy volunteers.Methods: The study included 436 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 81 years. Psychiatric interviews were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Each participant wore a wrist-activity monitor and kept a daily sleep log at home for 1 week. The major urinary melatonin metabolite (6-sulfatoxymelatonin [aMT6s]) was measured for two 24-hour periods at home.Results: There was no significant difference in naps and nocturnal sleep patterns between depressed participants (n = 30) and those with no history of mental disorder (n = 222). Three peaks occurred in the timing of napping: approximately 1 hour before bedtime, 8 to 9 hours after wake-up time, and 2 hours after waking, in descending order of magnitude. Significant inverse correlations were observed between evening nap duration and both wake-up time and aMT6s acrophase. The onset time of aMT6s excretion was advanced by 32 minutes in evening nappers.Conclusions: Evening napping, a characteristic of these postmenopausal women, may be related to an advance of circadian rhythms in this age group. Relationships between evening napping and earlier wake-up time may be a common manifestation of advanced circadian rhythms or may be a homeostatic effect.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Parathyroid hormone is anabolic to bone but when secreted in excess it is catabolic. It is important, therefore, to understand the mechanisms that determine the normal circadian rhythm of parathyroid hormone secretion and whether the cellular response to it will be anabolic or catabolic. This may lead to new strategies for the treatment of osteoporosis and the low turnover bone disease of some dialysis patients.Recent Findings: The parathyroid plays a central role in normal mineral and bone homeostasis by acting on its receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R). In fact there is more than one receptor - the PTH2 receptor and a putative carboxy-terminal PTH receptor. The latter, in particular, may be particularly relevant to our understanding of the role of parathyroid hormone and its use in pharmacology. Parathyroid hormone in excess destroys bone, as in most patients with chronic renal failure, and when it is lacking this may result in low turnover bone disease. At a more subtle level, patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis may have a blunting of the normal circadian rhythm of parathyroid hormone, with its peak at night and nadir in the morning. Insights as to what determines whether parathyroid hormone will be anabolic or catabolic to bone are reviewed.Summary: Attempting to correct the circadian rhythm in osteoporotic patients by calcilytic drugs or perhaps physiological equivalents may have a role in the future in treating osteoporosis. In the meantime, the administration of recombinant parathyroid hormone is an effective agent in the management of osteoporosis.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the factors that influence therapeutic decisions at menopause, particularly those related to the burden of menopause symptoms, in a population of women living in Massachusetts, as part of the multisite DAMES (Decisions At Menopause Study).Design: A survey using face-to-face interviews with a randomly selected sample of 293 women aged 45 to 55 who are members of the Fallon Community Health Plan in Central Massachusetts. The instrument combined closed- and open-ended questions and elicited information about a number of health topics, including the symptoms experienced by respondents over the preceding month and the decisions they made regarding therapies.Results: Symptom reporting was found to be relatively high, with more than half of the sample reporting hot flashes, sleep disturbances, joint pains, and headaches in the month preceding the survey; one third to one half of the women reported palpitations, night sweats, fatigue, and numbness. The highest frequency of symptoms occurred during perimenopause. Nearly four fifths of the women consulted a healthcare provider, and one fifth used hormone therapy. More than half of the respondents said menopause is a difficult phase, and about half found decisionmaking about it to be difficult.Conclusions: This study documents a relatively heavy burden of symptoms in a relatively healthy population and provides an update on earlier studies in Massachusetts.

AB  - PURPOSES/OBJECTIves: To compare sleep quality and disturbance, fatigue, and depressive symptoms between breast cancer survivors and healthy women experiencing hot flashes and to examine relationships among sleep and remaining variables (fatigue, depressive symptoms, and frequency of hot flashes). DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative pilot study. SETTING: University-based outpatient setting. SAMPLE: 15 breast cancer survivors and 15 healthy women matched on age, race, and menopausal status. All women had untreated hot flashes (no hormone replacement therapy or other hot flash treatments). METHODS: Questionnaires (sleep quality and disturbance, fatigue, and depression); two ambulatory, 24-hour sternal skin conductance monitoring sessions (hot flash frequency); and medical records review. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Sleep quality and disturbance, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and objective hot flash frequency. FINDINGS: The majority of participants evidenced poor sleep quality and high sleep disturbance (73% of breast cancer survivors and 67% of healthy women above a cutoff score of 5). Sleep duration was significantly shorter for breast cancer survivors in contrast to healthy women. Nighttime flashes were experienced by 67% of breast cancer survivors and 37% of healthy women. No group differences were found in fatigue, depressive symptoms, or objective hot flash frequency. Global sleep scores were significantly positively correlated with fatigue and depression but not with hot flash frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that sleep disturbance is common in menopausal breast cancer survivors and healthy women, is not necessarily related to hot flashes, and may stem from a multifactorial etiology. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Menopausal breast cancer survivors who present with any one of these symptoms should be screened for all symptoms both during and after treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) alone and in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor on mood, cognition, and neuroendocrine parameters in peri- and postmenopausal women. METHODS: We measured neuroendocrine variations in peri- and postmenopausal depressed patients (DP) and postmenopausal normal control (NC) women (45 to 72 years old) before and after treatment with HRT alone and HRT combined with antidepressant medication. All subjects were without significant medical illness and off psychoactive or other medication that would interfere with neuroendocrine measures. RESULTS: Menopausal DP women reported greater severity of hot flashes, were less likely to be 'morning' types, and had relatively good neuropsychological function compared with NC. DP and NC had comparable levels of reproductive hormones, with the exception of elevated prolactin levels, which increased, as did thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, in response to estradiol treatment. DP had poor sleep quality as measured both by subjective ratings and objective polysomnographic measures compared with NC. In DP estradiol did not enhance the effect of antidepressant alone on mood ratings. CONCLUSION: These findings may differ from other reports in the literature as a function of diagnoses of major depressive episode, randomized controlled trials, or dose and preparation of HRT. Further work is needed on the differential effect of treatment regimens in these disturbances that are evident primarily in baseline neuroendocrine function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To distinguish aging from menopause effects on sleep architecture, we studied an episode of disturbed hospital sleep in asymptomatic midlife women during the follicular phase of an ovulatory cycle and three control groups differing by age or menopause status. METHODS: Fifty-one studies were conducted in four groups of volunteers: young cycling (YC, 20-30 years, n = 14), older cycling (OC, 40-50 years, n = 15), ovariectomized receiving estrogen therapy (OVX, 40-50 years, n = 12), and spontaneously postmenopausal (PM, 40-50 years, n = 10). Subjects were admitted to the University Hospital General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) for a first-night sleep study conducted during a 24-hour, frequent blood sampling protocol. RESULTS: Despite similar estrogen concentrations in the YC (28 +/- 4 pg/ml) and OC (34 +/- 6 pg/ml) groups, OC women had reduced sleep efficiency (79% +/- 2%) vs. YC (87% +/- 3%; p = 0.009). In the OVX and PM groups where estrogen concentrations were markedly different, sleep efficiency was also reduced vs. the YC group (OVX vs. YC, 79% +/- 3% vs. 87% +/- 3%, p = 0.05; PM vs. YC, 75% +/- 3% vs. 87% +/- 3%, p = 0.007). Wake time was longer in the three older groups (103 +/- 10 minutes, 101 +/- 12 minutes, 123 +/- 12 minutes for OC, OVX, PM, respectively) vs. YC (63 +/- 13 minutes, p < 0.05). The number of stage shifts was positively associated with advancing age (rho = 0.3, p < 0.03) but not with estrogen concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Aging-related sleep deficits in response to an experimental stressor occur in midlife women prior to menopause.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many hospitalized premature infants are exposed to continuous dim lighting rather than to cycled lighting. However, we do not know whether dim lighting or low-intensity cycled lighting is more conducive to the development of rest-activity patterns that are in phase with the solar light-dark cycle. Thus, we examined the effects of nursery lighting conditions on the development of activity patterns in premature infants. METHODS: Premature infants who were born at <32 weeks' postmenstrual age and were medically stable in neonatal intensive care unit rooms were randomly assigned between 32 and 34 weeks' postmenstrual age to either continuous dim lighting (<25 lux; duration 24 days; control group; n = 29) or cycled lighting (239 +/- 29 lux, 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM; <25 lux, 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM; duration: 25 days; experimental group; n = 33). Activity was continuously monitored from enrollment until approximately 1 month after discharge from the hospital. Weight and head circumference were also assessed up to 6 months after discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: Over the first 10 days at home, distinct day-night differences in activity were not seen in control subjects (D day-night: N 1.07 +/- 0.02), but experimental group infants were more active during the day than at night (day-night: 1.25 +/- 0.03). It was not until 21 to 30 days after discharge that day-night activity ratios in control infants matched those seen in experimental group infants shortly after discharge, yet even at this age, experimental group infants (day-night: 2.13 +/- 0.19) were considerably more active during the day than at night as compared with control subjects (day-night: 1.43 +/- 0.09). CONCLUSION: Exposure of premature infants to low-intensity cycled lighting in the hospital nursery induces distinct patterns of rest-activity that are apparent within 1 week after discharge. In comparison, the appearance of distinct patterns of rest and activity are delayed in infants who are exposed to continuous dim lighting in the hospital. These observations show that day-night rhythms in activity patterns can be detected shortly after discharge to home in premature infants and that the circadian clock of developing infants is entrained by cycled lighting.

AB  - Context: Although a quarter of US women undergo elective hysterectomy before menopause, controlled trials that evaluate the benefits and harms are lacking.Objective: To compare the effect of hysterectomy vs expanded medical treatment on health-related quality of life.Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial (August 1997-December 2000) of 63 premenopausal women, aged 30 to 50 years, with abnormal uterine bleeding for a median of 4 years who were dissatisfied with medical treatments, including medroxyprogesterone acetate. The participants, who were patients at gynecology clinics and affiliated practices of 4 US academic medical centers, were followed up for 2 years.Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to undergo hysterectomy or expanded medical treatment with estrogen and/or progesterone and/or a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. The hysterectomy route and medical regimen were determined by the participating gynecologist.Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was mental health measured by the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Secondary outcomes included physical health measured by the Physical Component Summary (PCS), symptom resolution and satisfaction, body image, and sexual functioning, as well as other aspects of mental health and general health perceptions.Results: At 6 months, women in the hysterectomy group had greater improvement in MCS scores than women in the medicine group (8 vs 2, P =.04). They also had greater improvement in symptom resolution (75 vs 29, P<.001), symptom satisfaction (44 vs 7, P<.001), interference with sex (41 vs 22, P =.003), sexual desire (21 vs 3, P =.01), health distress (33 vs 13, P =.009), sleep problems (13 vs 1, P =.03), overall health (12 vs 2, P =.006), and satisfaction with health (31 vs 14, P =.01). By the end of the study, 17 (53%) of the women in the medicine group had requested and received hysterectomy, and these women reported improvements in quality-of-life outcomes during the 2 years that were similar to those reported by women randomized to the hysterectomy group. Women who continued medical treatment also reported some improvements (P<.001 for within-group change in many outcomes), with the result that most differences between randomized groups at the end of the study were no longer statistically significant in the intention-to-treat analysis.Conclusions: Among women with abnormal uterine bleeding and dissatisfaction with medroxyprogesterone, hysterectomy was superior to expanded medical treatment for improving health-related quality-of-life after 6 months. With longer follow-up, half the women randomized to medicine elected to undergo hysterectomy, with similar and lasting quality-of-life improvements; those who continued medical treatment also reported some improvements.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to find how self-reported sleep (measured by the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire) in postmenopausal women having hot flash activity was related to objective sleep (actigraphy), psychological and somatic symptoms [Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ)], and cognitive test performance (computerized tests). A secondary aim was to find if self-reported sleep showed expected correlations with hyperarousal (Hyperarousal Scale).Design: Drug trial baseline data from 88 healthy, postmenopausal women were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for confounder variables and test whether differences in self-reported sleep measures were systematically associated with differences in objective sleep, WHQ symptom measures, or cognitive test performance scores.Results: Increased self-report scores for low sleep quality were associated with an increased risk of WHQ symptoms and reduced cognitive test performance. Self-reported sleep measures showed little correlation with their analogous objective measures. Self-reported low sleep quality proved most closely associated with the WHQ symptoms of tiredness, clumsiness, and difficulty concentrating. Women whose self-reported sleep-onset latency times were longer than the median overestimated their objective sleep onset time by 30 min, whereas the other women underestimated theirs by 15 min (P < 0.0001). Women whose self-reported total sleep was longer or shorter than the median, respectively, underestimated objective sleep times by 9 and 71 min (P < 0.0001). High hyperarousal scores were associated with underestimations of objective sleep.Conclusion: Self-reports of lower sleep quality were associated with increased WHQ psychological and somatic symptom measures and decreased cognitive test performance more than with differences in objective sleep. Self-reported trouble sleeping may signal problems independent from objectively low sleep quality, such as subjective distress or diminished cognitive function.

AB  - Many midlife women obtain inadequate sleep, and sleep problems are common during the menopause transition. This article reviews the research literature on sleep and sleep disorders during menopause. Few studies have included subjective and objective measures of sleep quality or studied women during different menopause stages. Potential mechanisms associated with the emergence of insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing during menopause are discussed along with effects of estrogen and progesterone on sleep. It is argued that sleep quality is an important determinant of health status and quality of life for women during and beyond menopause. Copyright © 2004 by Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - When health questions or concerns arise, nurses are often the first care providers contacted by women with spinal cord injuries (SCIs). This highlights the importance of nurses' understanding of specific health issues such as the perimenopause transition, along with understanding the symptoms and changes that women with SCI may experience throughout the conversion into menopause. Women aged 35 to 55 years old, with an SCI of any level or degree of completeness, no history of salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy, and who receive care at a SCI model system in the mountain states, were mailed a questionnaire regarding symptoms associated with perimenopause, self-rated severity scores of various symptoms, and different options for treatment of the symptoms related to perimenopause. The 230 (62%) women who responded reported the following symptoms associated with perimenopause: menstrual cycle changes (60%), sleep disturbance (43%), night sweats (40%), hot flashes (39%), and decreased sex drive (38%). Subjective severity of these symptoms varied, but no significant differences were noted between women with tetraplegia and paraplegia, whether neurologically complete or incomplete. Perimenopause presents a unique challenge for women with SCI because the symptoms may mimic or mask other conditions associated with SCI, such as autonomic dysreflexia, infections, impaired temperature regulation, and spinal cord cysts. Care providers, and women with SCI, should carefully monitor their symptoms during perimenopause and the treatment plan should reflect a joint decision between the woman and her provider.

AB  - May A, Leone M. Update on cluster headache. Curr Opin Neurol. 2003;16:333-340. Purpose of Review: Although cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests an involvement of central areas such as the hypothalamus. This review covers the past 3 years, which have seen remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of circadian headache syndromes and have brought exciting news. Recent Findings: As more cluster headache patients are seen by headache specialists, new forms of this well-defined primary headache syndrome are being identified. In addition, we discuss recent findings with regard to abnormalities in the secretion of hormones, genetic influences, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the use of newer substances as preventive therapy in cluster headache. Summary: We have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. In recent reports, the use of deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has enabled intractable chronic cluster headache patients to be successfully operated upon. Further research in this field is urgently needed and the recent possibility of combining deep brain stimulation with positron emission tomography will certainly help to unravel the brain circuitry implicated in stimulation-produced analgesia. The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further the development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder. Comments: Is there a role for melatonin or 'natural light' stimulation to control circadian rhythms and prevent the seasonal onset and peaks of acute cluster headache activity? DSM The melatonin story so far is mixed. Melatonin 10 mg was effective preventively in 5 of 10 patients (compared to no placebo response) for episodic cluster headache (ECH) in one study (Leone M, D'Amico D, Moschiano F, Fraschini F, Bussone G. Melatonin versus placebo in the prophylaxis of cluster headache: a double-blind pilot study with parallel groups. Cephalalgia. 1996;16:494-496). A case report of 2 patients with chronic cluster headache (CCH) who responded to melatonin 9 mg preventively was published in 2001 (Peres MF, Rozen TD. Melatonin in the preventive treatment of chronic cluster headache. Cephalalgia. 2001;21:993-994). A small randomized pilot trial from the Montreal Neurologic Institute was published in 2002 of 9 patients, 6 with CCH, 3 with ECH (Pringshem T, Magnoux E, Dobson CF, Hamel E, Aube M. Melatonin as adjunctive therapy in the prophylaxis of cluster headache: a pilot study. Headache. 2002;42:787-792). Patients were crossed over, with the patients with CCH receiving a month of melatonin 2 mg controlled release, then a month of placebo, and the patients with ECH receiving a month of placebo, then a month of melatonin. Patients continued their regular prophylaxis and acute treatments, and no treatment effect from the melatonin was demonstrated in any primary or secondary end point. Therefore, with these small numbers, we do not even have properly powered studies with which to make a clinical therapeutic decision. As far as light therapy is concerned, Dr. Lee Kudrow attempted it for patients with CH in the early 1990s, after noting increased frequency of the onset of ECH periods at the time shifts of daylight savings in the spring and fall. While he thought light therapy showed promise, the technical problems of doing the research finally caused him to abandon the project. SJT McGeeney BE. Topiramate in the treatment of cluster headache. Curr Pain Headache Rep. 2003;7:135-138. Cluster headache is a well-characterized, strictly unilateral headache with cranial autonomic features and can be classified as episodic or chronic. Cluster attacks reliably are short-lived, often have a clockwise regularity, and can occur daily for weeks or months during an active cluster period. Pharmacologic treatment for this disorder can be divided into abortive and prophylactic agents. Prophylactic agents aim to quickly induce and maintain a remission. Short-term prophylaxis may be attained with the use of steroids, ergotamine, or methysergide, but these agents are not as suitable for continuous use. Verapamil and lithium commonly are used for longer periods and other agents, such as melatonin and baclofen, also are considered useful. There has been increased interest in the use of anticonvulsants for pain syndromes such as primary headache disorders. This includes topiramate use for cluster prophylaxis; a number of open-label studies have had encouraging results. This article provides an overview of topiramate and the open-label studies of this agent in the prevention of cluster headache. Comments: Dr. Brian McGeeney of Boston University Medical School summarizes beautifully in this article what is published on topiramate for cluster headache, and the proponents of its use are impressive: Drs. Steve Wheeler, Miguel Lainez, and Julio Pascual have all described effectiveness in open-label studies, and my partners and I at The New England Center for Headache believe that we have seen responders as well. But, I can hear Profs. Jes Olesen and Rigmar Jensen on my shoulders admonishing us on the need for randomized clinical trials. SJT Torelli P, Manzoni GC. Clinical observations on familial cluster headache. Neurol Sci. 2003;24:61-64. Cluster headache (CH) has traditionally been considered a sporadic disease. Recently, an Italian study pointed out a risk of developing CH in the affected patients' first-degree relatives that was increased 39-fold compared with the general population. The aims of this study were to investigate any possible differences in mean age at onset, clinical features and lifestyle between familial and non-familial CH cases. Among all CH patients referred to the Parma Headache Centre (n = 691), we considered those who reported at least a first-degree relative with a probable diagnosis of CH in their family histories (n = 30). CH diagnosis in the relatives was confirmed for 19 of the 30 patients. Each one of the 19 'familial cases' was matched by sex and age at the first visit (within 2 years) to two CH patients who did not report any family history for CH. The male : female ratio was 1.4 : 1 in the familial cases. Mean age at onset was significantly lower in women with familial CH than in those with non-familial CH. The study did not show any significant differences in symptoms between the two CH groups, such as pain location, accompanying symptoms, duration and frequency of attacks, and active periods. Our study seems to suggest that genetic factors play a role in the female gender, affecting age at onset of headache without modifying the clinical features. Comments: The suggested sex difference in genetic predisposition is intriguing. Does this suggest a mitochondrial DNA inheritance through the maternal lineage? Did the female age at onset coincide with premenopausal hormonal changes? DSM Leone M, Franzini A, Broggi G, Bussone G. Hypothalamic deep brain stimulation for intractable chronic cluster headache: a 3-year follow-up. Neurol Sci. 2003;24(suppl 2):S143-S145. Cluster headache is the most severe among primary headaches. Positron emission tomography and functional MRI studies have demonstrated that the ipsilateral posterior hypothalamus is activated during cluster headache attacks and is structurally asymmetric in these patients thus indicating that cluster headache may originate at that level. These hypothalamic abnormalities in cluster headache led to the suggestion that deep brain stimulation of ipsilateral posterior inferior hypothalamus might produce clinical improvement in otherwise treatment refractory chronic cluster headache patients. In a patient with severe intractable chronic cluster headache, hypothalamic electrical stimulation produced complete and long-term pain relief with no relevant side effects. So far other operations have been performed and the results are encouraging in terms of both pain relief and safety. The efficacy of hypothalamic electrical stimulation provides some hints into cluster headache pathophysiology. Comments: This important article raises the possibility of long-term implantable therapy for this serious debilitating condition. Might an equivalent to the cardiac pacemaker be developed, which is linked to changes in chronobiological changes to pre-empt attacks of episodic cluster? DSM The opportunity to implant these stimulators occurred because of the pioneering work of Drs. Arne May and Peter Goadsby in imaging the 'cluster generator' (May A, Bahra A, Buchel C, Frackowiak RS, Goadsby PJ. PET and MRA findings in cluster headache and MRA in experimental pain. Neurology. 2000; 55:1328-1335). The proven clinical effectiveness of the implanted stimulators confirms the findings of the imaging studies. SJT

AB  - Menopause is associated with physiological and psychological changes that influence sexuality. During menopause, the primary biological change is a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogen deficiency initially accounts for altered bleeding and diminished vaginal lubrication. Continual estrogen loss often leads to numerous signs and symptoms, including changes in the vascular and urogenital systems. Alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive functioning are common as well. These changes may contribute to lower self-esteem, poorer self-image, and diminished sexual responsiveness and sexual desire. Other important nonhormonal factors that affect sexuality are health status and current medications, changes in or dissatisfaction with the partner relationship, social status, and cultural attitudes toward older women. The problems in sexual functioning related to estrogen deficiency can be treated with hormone therapy that includes estrogens alone and estrogens combined with androgens. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers also may be useful in ameliorating postmenopausal sexual complaints. This article reviews the literature on the impact of menopausal estrogen loss on sexuality and on the effect of hormone therapy on sexual function during menopause.

AB  - Women experience somatic, mood, energy, and libido changes during menopause. Testosterone replacement therapy is being prescribed in conjunction with estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for these symptoms. Little is known about women's perceptions of the benefits and risks of testosterone, so an Internet survey was conducted to elicit women's perceptions of the effects on mood, energy, sexuality, and somatic symptoms. A sample of 61 women primarily from the United States and Canada participated in the survey; one woman from Germany and one from Sweden also took part in the survey. Participants reported significantly improved sexuality and improved mood and vigor, with a decline in fatigue. Of the 7 somatic complaints assessed, improvements were noted in 5 (sleep disturbances, hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and appetite). A prospective clinical trial is needed to confirm these results.

AB  - In a randomized, 2-group clinical study, acupuncture was used for the relief of menopausal hot flushes, sleep disturbances, and mood changes. The experimental acupuncture treatment consisted of specific acupuncture body points related to menopausal symptoms. The comparison acupuncture treatment consisted of a treatment designated as a general tonic specifically designed to benefit the flow of Ch'i (energy). Results from the experimental acupuncture treatment group showed a decrease in mean monthly hot flush severity for site-specific acupuncture. The comparison acupuncture treatment group had no significant change in severity from baseline over the treatment phase. Sleep disturbances in the experimental acupuncture treatment group declined over the study. Mood changes in both the experimental acupuncture treatment group and the comparison acupuncture treatment group showed a significant difference between the baseline and the third month of the study. Acupuncture using menopausal-specific sites holds promise for nonhormonal relief of hot flushes and sleep disturbances.

AB  - In this case-control study, the authors aimed to examine whether use of an electric bedding device increased breast cancer risk in African-American women. Cases were 304 African-American patients diagnosed with breast cancer during 1995-1998 who were aged 20-64 years and lived in one of three Tennessee counties. Controls were 305 African-American women without breast cancer who were selected through random digit dialing and frequency-matched to cases by age and county. Information on the use of an electric blanket or heated water bed and other risk factors was collected through telephone interviews. Breast cancer risk associated with use of an electric bedding device increased with the number of years of use, the number of seasons of use, and the length of time of use during sleep. When women who used an electric bedding device for more than 6 months per year (and therefore were more likely to have used a heated water bed, which generates lower magnetic fields) were excluded, the corresponding dose-response relations were more striking. Similar trends in dose response were shown in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women and for both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors. The use of electric bedding devices may increase breast cancer risk in African-American women aged 20-64 years. Such an association might not vary substantially by menopausal status or estrogen receptor status.

AB  - Combined hormone use has been linked with significant health risks in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other clinical trials, but it is not clear whether and how estrogen/progestin therapy affects the health-related quality of life. Previous trials have given inconsistent results, although there is evidence that hormone therapy does provide short-term relief from vasomotor symptoms. The WHI randomly assigned 16,608 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age, who had an intact uterus, to hormone therapy or placebo. Active treatment included 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate. All women were followed up for 12 months, and a subset of 1511 were seen at 3 years. Quality-of-life and functional status were measured using the RAND 36-item Health Survey. In addition, participants were assessed for depression, disturbed sleep, sexual function, cognitive functioning, and menopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy had small but statistically significant positive effects on physical functioning, bodily pain, and disturbed sleep. A majority of women, however, exhibited little or no change in these parameters. The modal response to the RAND-36 health transition item was 'about the same.' There was little difference in the distribution of responses between the hormone therapy and placebo groups. Analyzing women who had moderate-tosevere vasomotor symptoms at baseline, 77% of those given hormone therapy, and 52% of the placebo group had less severe hot flushes after 1 year. Improvement in night sweats was reported by 71% and 53% of women, respectively. A subgroup of these women, 50 to 54 years of age, reported less disturbed sleep in conjunction with hormone therapy. The women followed for 3 years, who had 12-month findings similar to those in the study population as a whole, showed no significant differences at longer-term follow up. Combined hormone therapy had no clinically meaningful effect on health-related quality of life in this population of postmenopausal women. Those effects that were observed were small and apparently limited to the first 12 months of treatment. The investigators believe that the limited benefit conferred on some women by combined hormone therapy is not worth the increased risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer.

AB  - More than 1 million women are expected to reach menopause each year, many of whom will experience hot flushes and other neuropsychological symptoms that may diminish their quality of life. Hot flushes are the core symptoms that reflect the brain's response to the changing hormonal milieu of the menopause transition, particularly to the rapidly fluctuating and falling levels of estradiol. The physical symptoms of hot flushes and the associated changes in sleep, mood, and cognition will lead many women to seek medical care. It is critical to understand the interrelationship of hot flushes and other neuropsychological symptoms of the menopause transition so that treatment priorities can be established. For example, if sleep disruption explains most daytime neuropsychological problems in women with hot flushes, treating insomnia should be considered a priority. Alternatively, mood, cognition, and quality of life may be disturbed independent of sleep problems. In such a situation, each symptom should be evaluated separately from any assessment of sleep. As recent data from the WHI establish the risks of long-term HRT use, concern about using HRT, even as a short-term intervention, has increased substantially. Although HRT remains the first-line treatment for hot flushes, the WHI findings have drawn attention to nonhormonal treatments of hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms. Growing evidence to support the efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants and other psychoactive medications in the treatment for hot flushes suggests that nonhormonal interventions will prove important alternatives to HRT. As further evidence of the benefits of psychoactive medications for menopausal symptoms is established, the choice between using hormonal and nonhormonal therapies for management of menopausal symptoms will continue to evolve.Copyright © 2003 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To further our understanding of the relation between mood and menopause, the authors examined 1) the association between persistent mood symptoms and menopausal status and 2) factors that increase a woman's vulnerability to an overall dysphoric mood during the early perimenopausal period. The sample consisted of an ethnically diverse community cohort of 3,302 pre- and early perimenopausal women aged 42-52 years who were participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, an ongoing US multisite longitudinal study of menopause and aging. At study entry (1995-1997), women reported information on recent menstrual regularity and premenstrual symptoms, as well as on sociodemographic, symptom, health, sleep, psychosocial, and lifestyle variables. Rates of persistent mood symptoms were higher among early perimenopausal women (14.9%-18.4%) than among premenopausal women (8%-12%). In analyses adjusting for major covariates and confounders, early perimenopausal women had higher odds of irritability, nervousness, and frequent mood changes but not of feeling 'blue.' The effect of being early perimenopausal on overall dysphoric mood was greatest among women with an educational level of less than high school graduation. These findings suggest that persistent mood symptoms and overall dysphoric mood are associated with the early perimenopause, particularly among women with lower educational attainment.

AB  - The menopause is associated with a relatively abrupt decline in the ovarian production of estrogen that results in a state of estrogen deficiency. This estrogen deficiency state is associated with an accelerated expression of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, urogenital atrophy, dermal aging, an increased expression of colorectal cancer, an alteration in the expression of breast cancer that results in more malignant forms of the disease, and the loss of neurons from the brain that is associated with a more rapid decline in cognitive function, balance, and an earlier expression of Alzheimer's disease. Macular degeneration and cataract formation may be additional consequences of the estrogen deficiency state. Thus the estrogen deficiency state may be characterized as a state of accelerated aging. The abrupt transition from the reproductive state of multiple estrogen-dependent neural systems within the brain may affect their function as manifested by the typical menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, mood changes, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment. This transition may trigger a cascade of events that contributes to the acceleration of brain aging and the expression of neurodegenerative processes as Alzheimer's disease. This article discusses the use of estrogen to prevent these age-related changes.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a very prevalent disorder particularly amongst middle-aged, obese men, although its existence in women as well as in lean individuals is increasingly recognized. Despite the early recognition of the strong association between OSA and obesity, and OSA and cardiovascular problems, sleep apnoea has been treated as a 'local abnormality' of the respiratory track rather than as a 'systemic illness'. In 1997, we first reported that the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) were elevated in patients with disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and proposed that these cytokines were mediators of daytime sleepiness. Also, we reported a positive correlation between IL-6 or TNF alpha plasma levels and the body mass index (BMI). In subsequent studies, we showed that IL-6, TNF alpha, leptin and insulin levels were elevated in sleep apnoea independently of obesity and that visceral fat, was the primary parameter linked with sleep apnoea. The association of OSA with insulin resistance and diabetes type 2 has been confirmed since then in several epidemiological and clinical studies. Furthermore, our findings that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, a condition associated with hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance) were much more likely than controls to have sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and daytime sleepiness support the pathogenetic role of insulin resistance in OSA. Other findings that support the view that sleep apnoea and sleepiness may be manifestations of a serious metabolic disorder, namely the Metabolic or Visceral Obesity Syndrome, include: obesity without sleep apnoea is associated with daytime sleepiness; PCOS and diabetes type 2 are independently associated with EDS after controlling for SDB, obesity and age; and increased prevalence of sleep apnoea in postmenopausal women, with hormonal replacement therapy associated with a significantly reduced risk for OSA. In conclusion, accumulating evidence provides support to our model of the bi-directional, feedforward, pernicious association between sleep apnoea, sleepiness, inflammation and insulin resistance, all promoting atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - : ObjectiveTo evaluate the prevalence of different types of nocturnal breathing abnormalities in postmenopausal women and the effect of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on nocturnal breathing.: MethodsA prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was completed by 62 of 71 recruited healthy women. The first 3-month treatment period with either estrogen or placebo was followed by placebo washout for a month and then by a second treatment period with crossover to either estrogen or placebo. On a night after each treatment period, sleep was monitored with polysomnography, and breathing was assessed with a static-charge-sensitive bed and oximeter. For the respiratory variables, a sample size of 48 subjects was sufficient to give statistical power of 85% with a significance level of P < .05.: ResultsThe occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea in all women was low (1.6%), but partial upper airway obstruction, manifesting as an increased respiratory resistance pattern, was more common (17.7%). Estrogen replacement therapy decreased the occurrence (P = .047) and frequency (P = .049) of sleep apnea but had no effect on partial upper airway obstruction or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation.: ConclusionPartial upper airway obstruction is the most prevalent form of sleep-disordered breathing, occurring ten times more frequently than sleep apnea in postmenopausal women. Unopposed estrogen replacement therapy has only a minor effect on sleep apnea and has no effect on partial airway obstruction.

AB  - Background: Dysmenorrhea produces painful abdominal cramps that can disrupt the personal lives and productivity of women.Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy, including onset and duration of pain relief, peak effect, and total effect, and tolerability of ibuprofen arginate with those of conventional ibuprofen in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea.Methods: Patients were administered a single dose of ibuprofen arginate (200 or 400 mg), conventional ibuprofen (200 or 400 mg), or placebo during each of 5 menstrual cycles in a single-center, double-blind, randomized, double-dummy, 5-cycle, crossover study. Patients recorded their pain intensity and pain relief at regularly scheduled intervals (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours) after taking the study medication, and all study observations were recorded in a patient diary. Pain intensity was rated using the following 4-point categoric rating scale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. Pain relief was rated on a 5-point scale as 0 = none, 1 = a little, 2 = some, 3 = a lot, and 4 = complete relief. Tolerability of ibuprofen arginate was based on a comparison of the incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events in each of the treatment groups.Results: One hundred four patients entered the study. Of these, 81.7% were white; the mean (SD) age was 27.5 (5.0) years. A total of 65.4% of patients reported moderate pain from dysmenorrhea, and the remaining 34.6% reported severe pain; 20.2% of patients did not complete the study. The median time to achieve meaningful pain relief was ~30 minutes faster with ibuprofen arginate 400 mg than with either dose of conventional ibuprofen. Tolerability was similar across all treatments.Conclusions: In this study population of patients experiencing acute pain as a result of primary dysmenorrhea, ibuprofen arginate was associated with effective, tolerable analgesia and a more rapid onset of action than conventional ibuprofen. The faster onset of analgesia may have a role in clinical practice in treating women with dysmenorrhea. A faster onset of action may be important to women whose personal relationships, productivity, or ability to sleep is being adversely affected by pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of a morning/evening menopause formula (morning capsule contains panax ginseng, black cohosh, soy, and green tea extracts; evening capsule contains black cohosh, soy, kava, hops, and valerian extracts) for relieving menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and sleep disturbance. METHODS: Healthy postmenopausal women, between 45 and 65 years of age, were asked to take the menopause formula orally, one capsule of the morning formula every morning and one capsule of the evening formula every evening for 2 months. The Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to determine the efficacy. RESULTS: Morning/evening menopause formula significantly reduced the number of hot flashes. The reduction in the number of hot flashes was observed as early as at the end of the second week. At the end of the second week, the number of hot flashes was reduced by 47%. The morning/evening menopause formula also significantly reduced the GCS total and subscale scores. At the end of the eighth week, the vasomotor, anxiety, and depression scores of GCS were reduced by 50%, 56%, and 32%, respectively. Furthermore, the morning/evening menopause formula significantly reduced global PSQI score and scores in five components (sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction) by 18%-46%. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the morning/evening menopausal formula is safe and effective for relieving menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and sleep disturbance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the baseline health-related quality of life (HRQL) of 301 postmenopausal women with heart disease enrolled in the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) trial. METHODS: The primary measure of HRQL was the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (MOS SF-36). The SF-36 was augmented with secondary assessments, including measures of depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, urinary incontinence, sleep disturbance, and physical symptoms. Multiple regression analyses were used to test hypotheses regarding the contribution of positive (social support) and negative (social strain) aspects of social relations after accounting for other correlates of HRQL and heart disease. RESULTS: Results indicate that social support was positively associated with better functioning for all measured outcomes (all p < 0.05) except symptom frequency and severity. Social strain was negatively associated with HRQL functioning (all p < 0.05) except overall physical functioning, sleep disturbance, and urinary incontinence. In addition, several comorbid conditions were negatively associated with HRQL outcomes. In particular, chest pain was significantly associated with worse functioning on all HRQL outcomes except urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that both clinical status variables (particularly chest pain) and the psychosocial context (represented by dimensions of relationship quality) influenced HRQL in this cohort. Thus, interventions that combine medical treatments with psychosocially based interventions may be most effective for women at risk for impaired HRQL.

AB  - Extracts of the fruits of chaste tree (Vitex agnus castus = AC) are widely used to treat premenstrual symptoms. Double-blind placebo-controlled studies indicate that one of the most common premenstrual symptoms, i.e. premenstrual mastodynia (mastalgia) is beneficially influenced by an AC extract. In addition, numerous less rigidly controlled studies indicate that AC extracts have also beneficial effects on other psychic and somatic symptoms of the PMS. Premenstrual mastodynia is most likely due to a latent hyperprolactinemia, i.e. patients release more than physiologic amounts of prolactin in response to stressful situations and during deep sleep phases which appear to stimulate the mammary gland. Premenstrually this unphysiological prolactin release is so high that the serum prolactin levels often approach heights which are misinterpreted as prolactinomas. Since AC extracts were shown to have beneficial effects on premenstrual mastodynia serum prolactin levels in such patients were also studied in one double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. Serum prolactin levels were indeed reduced in the patients treated with the extract. The search for the prolactin-suppressive principle(s) yielded a number of compounds with dopaminergic properties: they bound to recombinant DA2-receptor protein and suppressed prolactin release from cultivated lactotrophs as well as in animal experiments. The search for the chemical identity of the dopaminergic compounds resulted in isolation of a number of diterpenes of which some clerodadienols were most important for the prolactin-suppressive effects. They were almost identical in their prolactin-suppressive properties than dopamine itself. Hence, it is concluded that dopaminergic compounds present in Vitex agnus castus are clinically the important compounds which improve premenstrual mastodynia and possibly also other symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome.

AB  - Objective: To compare age-adjusted and ethnic differences in prevalences of sleep difficulty at various stages of the menopausal transition and to determine the relative contribution of other factors, including vasomotor symptoms, sociodemographics, and psychological and physical health factors, to self-reported sleep difficulty in middle-aged women.Design: A community-based survey of women's health and menopausal symptoms was conducted between November 1995 and October 1997 at each of the seven US sites participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. A multiethnic sample of 12,603 Caucasian, African American, Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic women aged 40 to 55 years was categorized into six groups: premenopausal, early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, naturally postmenopausal, surgically postmenopausal, and postmenopausal receiving hormone replacement therapy. The women were asked whether they had experienced difficulty sleeping in the past 2 weeks.Results: Difficulty sleeping was reported by 38%. Age-adjusted rates were highest in the late perimenopausal (45.4%) and surgically postmenopausal (47.6%) groups. Among ethnic groups, rates ranged from 28% in Japanese women to 40% in Caucasian women. In the multivariate analysis, menopausal status was significantly associated with difficulty sleeping. Ethnicity, vasomotor and psychological symptoms, self-perceived health and health behaviors, arthritis, and education also were significantly associated with difficulty sleeping.Conclusions: These results suggest that stage of the menopausal transition, independent of other potential explanatory factors, is associated with self-reported sleep difficulty. Older age per se was not significantly associated with difficulty sleeping.

AB  - The rise in the prevalence and severity of pediatric obesity has been accompanied by higher rates of the known correlates of obesity as well as the emergence of new or newly identifiable health conditions. These include the classic cardiovascular risk factors, type 2 diabetes, menstrual abnormalities, sleep-disordered breathing, and psychosocial effects. Although stigmatization of obese children is convincingly documented, the evidence regarding the psychological consequences of child and adolescent obesity is more equivocal. Identification of the full range of health consequences linked to obesity in the pediatric population may help direct resources to its primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.

AB  - A cross sectional survey design was used to examine the relationships among life event stress, role and job strain, and sleep in middle-aged female (RNs) shift-workers. Subjects were 'recruited from a regional rural Midwestern hospital. Correlation and multiple regression techniques were used to examine relationships. A supplemental analysis examined group differences for 'good' and 'poor' sleepers. The conceptual model for this research study was derived using Neuman's (1995), and Neuman & Fawcett (2002) Systems Model, and Monk's (2000) Shift Work Coping Model. According to Neuman, stress has the ability to cause system imbalances when the flexible and normal lines of defense are penetrated. The lines of defense may be influenced by beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions, and may be strengthened by education, or other health promotion activities. According to Monk, there are three main factors that influence one's ability to cope with shift-work. The factors include circadian, domestic, and sleep influences. Common stressors (life event stress, role and job strain, perimenopausal symptoms, and shift-work) have the ability to individually and/or collectively penetrate the lines of defense, resulting in system imbalance (poor quality of sleep). One's beliefs about sleep, as well as one's knowledge and awareness of sleep hygiene may have the ability to strengthen the lines of defense by influencing sleep hygiene practices. The use of sleep hygiene practices may protect or prevent 'poor' quality of sleep. Over a hundred (N = 102) RNs participated in the study. The women were predominantly white (960, N = 100), and their mean age was 52.7 (SD = 7.4). Life event stress, role strain, job strain and perimenopausal symptoms were all predictive for decreased quality of sleep. Job strain was predictive of using fewer sleep hygiene practices that are conducive to sleep. Almost three fourths (74%) of the RNs, in this study, were categorized as 'poor' sleepers. Given the complexity of health care, the aging RN workforce, and patient safety issues; RNs who experience 'poor' sleep may be compromising their level of performance. Lower performance levels have been linked to lengthened reaction time, and decreases in memory, attention and judgment. In practice, individual RNs as well as supervisors and managers need to understand the relationships between life stress, role and job strain, and sleep hygiene knowledge and practices on sleep quality. Research focused on quality of sleep, RN performance, and patient safety are priorities in today's complex health care system.

AB  - Naturally fluctuating hormones (menstrual cycle, through pregnancy or menopausal transition) are not related to marked sleep disturbances in women. It is likely, however, that subsets of women will display a central nervous system vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations so that sleep disturbances manifest as a part of a complex of discomforting symptoms. Sleep is impacted directly through the circadian system or brain sleep regulation or through the development of concurrent functional changes and symptoms. Women are susceptible to sleep-related disorders that are also common in men, such as primary insomnia and SBD although the contributing factors and manifestations may not be the same.

AB  - This statement summarizes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for use of hormone replacement therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and updates the 1996 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. The complete information on which this statement is based, including evidence tables and references, is available through the USPSTF Web site (http://www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov) and through the National Guideline Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov) The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and the following outcomes: cardiovascular disease, including CHD and stroke; osteoporosis and fractures; thromboembolism; dementia and cognitive function; breast, colon, ovarian, and endometrial cancer; and cholecystitis. The USPSTF also reviewed evidence of the effects of hormone replacement therapy on phytoestrogens and osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The use of hormone replacement therapy for relieving active symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, urogenital symptoms, and mood and sleep disturbances, among others, is outside the scope of these USPSTF recommendations, and literature on this topic was not reviewed. Sources for estimates of benefits and harms cited in this Recommendation statement are described in the summary of the evidence available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

AB  - Hot flashes affect about three fourths of postmenopausal women and are one of the most common health problems in this demographic group. Dysfunction of central thermoregulatory centers caused by changes in estrogen levels at the time of menopause has long been postulated to be the cause of hot flashes. Treatment should begin with a careful patient history, with specific attention to the frequency and severity of hot flashes and their effect on the individual's function. For mild symptoms that do not interfere with sleep or daily function, behavioral changes in conjunction with vitamin E (800 IU/d) use is a reasonable initial approach. For more severe symptoms, the next step is to determine whether there is a contraindication or a personal reservation to estrogen replacement therapy. For women who are able and willing to use estrogen, it will successfully relieve symptoms by about 80% to 90%. In patients with a history of breast or uterine cancer, treatment with the progestational agent megesterol acetate appears to be a safe alternative that also decreases hot flashes by approximately 80%. For women unwilling or unable to use hormone therapy, one of the newer antidepressant agents can be prescribed. Venlafaxine decreases hot flashes by about 60%. Gabapentin is another drug that appears promising as therapy for women unable or unwilling to use estrogen, and the results of ongoing trials to determine its efficacy are eagerly awaited. The use of clonidine, methyldopa, and belladonna should be discouraged because of their modest efficacy and adverse effects.

AB  - Flight attendants (FAs) may be at risk of adverse reproductive outcomes. We investigated the feasibility of biomonitoring studies in this mobile workforce. Forty-five female FAs and 26 female teachers (referents) collected daily urine and saliva samples for one menstrual cycle, provided daily diary data for approximately three months, and wore a wrist monitor to measure sleep disruption. A transport system enabled FAs to store samples while traveling. Overall, participation rates were low (37%) but of those recruited, over 90% of FAs and teachers completed the biomonitoring cycle. Data collection and sample integrity were not diminished by travel. Study methods resulted in good compliance and high quality data. It is possible to conduct studies of menstrual cycle function, sleep disruption, and circadian rhythm disruption in a mobile workforce potentially exposed to reproductive hazards.

AB  - The use of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy (ERT/HRT) in preventing disease in menopausal women has been well documented. Less attention has been paid to the menopausal symptoms that can impair the quality of life of menopausal women, such as hot flushes, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, and alterations in mood. Researchers have used a variety of methods to investigate these concerns. Decreases in ovarian hormones that occur with menopause have been implicated in these symptoms. Ovarian hormones affect the central nervous system and urogenital tissues directly via receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. Changes in the symptoms of menopause consequential to estrogen therapy reflect the effect of this therapy on these tissues. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of ERT/HRT in the treatment of symptoms affecting quality of life is growing and supports the use of ERT/HRT during menopause. Because the most dramatic hormonal changes associated with menopause are related to estrogen and because estrogen is usually coadministered with a progestogen in patients with an intact uterus, this review is focused primarily on ERT/HRT. Because androgen therapy may also improve quality of life by enhancing perimenopausal and postmenopausal sexual desire, function, and general well-being, a brief discussion of androgen supplementation of ERT/HRT is also included. The ideal doses and combinations of hormones must be determined on an individual basis, taking into consideration benefits, risks, and interactions of the different hormone therapies.

AB  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms (p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep (p < 0.01) when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.

AB  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

AB  - The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the prevalence and course of fatigue in patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and to examine factors relating to fatigue. Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy. High and fluctuating prevalence rates of fatigue have been found not only during but also after adjuvant chemotherapy. The intensity of fatigue seems to be stable throughout the treatment cycles, despite the common perception that more chemotherapy treatments lead to greater fatigue. The first two days after a chemotherapy treatment seem to be the worst period.The influence of factors such as pain, impaired quality of sleep, and depression are be highly consistent across several studies, although it is often not clear whether it is the symptoms that cause the fatigue or vice versa. The outcomes of the studies indicate that several symptoms are interrelated in a network of symptoms. Factors such as changes in weight, menopausal symptoms, coping, social support, and biochemical changes have been mentioned in the literature as potentially contributing to fatigue. Results have been conflicting and need further study.

AB  - Objective: To describe self-reported prevalence of the use of alternative therapies for menopause symptoms and subject characteristics associated with their use.Methods: A telephone survey of 886 women aged 45-65 years (87.2% response rate) was conducted at Group Health Cooperative in Washington state. Women were asked about eight alternative therapies and their use for menopause symptoms.Results: The proportion of women who used each therapy was 76.1% for any therapy, 43.1% for stress management, 37.0% for over-the-counter alternative remedies, 31.6% for chiropractic, 29.5% for massage therapy, 22.9% for dietary soy, 10.4% for acupuncture, 9.4% for naturopath or homeopath, and 4.6% for herbalists. The proportion of women who used it to manage menopause symptoms was 22.1% for any therapy, 9.1% for stress management, 13.1% for over-the-counter alternative remedies, 0.9% for chiropractic, 2.6% for massage therapy, 7.4% for dietary soy, 0.6% for acupuncture, 2.0% for naturopath or homeopath, and 1.2% for herbalists. Among women who used these therapies, 89-100% found them to be somewhat or very helpful. A history of breast cancer was associated with a six-fold increase in use of dietary soy for menopause symptoms (odds ratio 6.23, 95% confidence limits 2.54, 15.28). Current users of hormone replacement therapy were half as likely to use alternative remedies or providers (odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence limits 0.29, 0.77) as were never users. Sleep disturbances were associated with a four-fold increase in the use of body work, a three-fold increase in the use of stress management, and more than doubled the use of dietary soy products to manage menopause symptoms.Conclusion: The use of alternative therapies for menopause symptoms is common, and women who use them generally find them to be beneficial. Physicians should routinely ascertain perimenopausal women's use of alternative therapies.

AB  - Population-based epidemiologic studies have uncovered the high prevalence and wide severity spectrum of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, and have consistently found that even mild obstructive sleep apnea is associated with significant morbidity. Evidence from methodologically strong cohort studies indicates that undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, with or without symptoms, is independently associated with increased likelihood of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and diminished quality of life. Strategies to decrease the high prevalence and associated morbidity of obstructive sleep apnea are critically needed. The reduction or elimination of risk factors through public health initiatives with clinical support holds promise. Potentially modifiable risk factors considered in this review include overweight and obesity, alcohol, smoking, nasal congestion, and estrogen depletion in menopause. Data suggest that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with all these factors, but at present the only intervention strategy supported with adequate evidence is weight loss. A focus on weight control is especially important given the expanding epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States. Primary care providers will be central to clinical approaches for addressing the burden and the development of cost-effective case-finding strategies and feasible treatment for mild obstructive sleep apnea warrants high priority.

AB  - Background: Current treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) appear to offer, at best, a 25% to 50% reduction in symptoms, and many of these treatments have substantial side effects. Femal, an herbal remedy containing a pollen extract, a pollen and pistil extract, and Royal Jelly, has been used in Scandinavia for the treatment of PMS for >4 years.Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Femal on the symptoms of PMS.Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of the effects of Femal in women with PMS. The symptoms of PMS were evaluated using well-established questionnaires and daily body weight measurement.Results: Thirty-two women (mean age, 39.4 years; range, 27-50 years) with regular menstrual cycles of 24 to 34 days entered the trial. Three women dropped out of the study, leaving 29 for final evaluation. Two months of active treatment lowered overall symptom indices significantly and lowered 6 of 9 individual symptom scores by 27% to 57%. Evidence for a slow onset of action and protracted effect was provided by the finding that all symptom indices studied declined significantly (by 48%-88%) in the group that received placebo before Femal (P < 0.01). In contrast, the group that received Femal before placebo showed no significant differences between Femal and placebo, except in sleep quality (P < 0.04). Premenstrual weight gain was reduced 50% by active treatment compared with placebo. There were no reported unwanted or adverse effects during Femal treatment.Conclusion: The findings suggest that the herbal therapy Femal provided substantial symptomatic relief of PMS to the women in this study, with minimal risk of unwanted or adverse effects.

AB  - Objective: Two prospective multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of three once-a-week continuous combined 17beta-estradiol/levonorgestrel (E2/LNG) transdermal systems (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mg/day LNG) for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms and prevention of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia in healthy, postmenopausal women.Design: In study 1, performed in 293 hysterectomized and nonhysterectomized women with moderate to severe hot flushes, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.030 and 0.040 mg/day LNG) was compared with placebo for three 28-day treatment cycles. The frequency and severity of hot flushes were recorded daily. In study 2, performed in 845 women with intact uteri, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mg/day LNG) was compared with transdermal E2 0.045 mg/day monotherapy for thirteen 28-day treatment cycles. Women with endometrial tissue sufficient for evaluation underwent endometrial biopsy assessment at the end of cycle 13. Bleeding patterns were assessed throughout the study, and the Women's Health Questionnaire was used to assess well-being.Results: In study 1, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.030 and 0.040 mg/day LNG) significantly decreased the number and severity of hot flushes when compared with placebo. Symptom relief was seen as early as 2 weeks posttreatment. Similarly, in study 2, all three doses of transdermal E2/LNG and E2 controlled hot flushes with no differences between groups. In study 2, no women receiving transdermal E2/LNG developed endometrial hyperplasia compared with 19 (12.8%) who received transdermal E2 0.045 mg/day (p < 0.001 for each dose). Significant improvements from baseline in scores on the Women's Health Questionnaire for vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, sexual function, cognitive difficulties, and total score were noted at all or most time points with both transdermal E2/LNG and E2. Application-site reactions, vaginal hemorrhage, and breast pain were the most common adverse events reported with transdermal E2/LNG. The proportion of women with amenorrhea increased over time in all treatment groups in study 2.Conclusions: All three doses of this once-a-week combined E2/LNG transdermal system rapidly and effectively control vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women while protecting against endometrial hyperplasia. Amelioration of vasomotor symptoms also is accompanied by improvements in aspects of subjective well-being. Once-a-week transdermal E2/LNG, therefore, offers an effective and convenient formulation, the dosing of which can be individualized according to the needs of each patient.

AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To compare the hot flash symptom experience and related outcomes between breast cancer survivors and healthy women. DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional, comparative study. SETTING: Southeastern university medical center. SAMPLE: 69 of 207 breast cancer survivors contacted via a tumor registry and 63 age-matched healthy female volunteers. Survivors were a mean of 57 years and a mean of 39 months postdiagnosis. METHODS: Mailed survey included a demographic, disease, and treatment information form; a gynecologic history form; a two-day, prospective, hot flash diary; a detailed hot flash questionnaire; mood and affect scales; and the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Hot flashes, mood, affect, interference with daily activities, and overall quality of life. FINDINGS: Breast cancer survivors had hot flashes that were significantly more frequent, severe, distressing, and of greater duration. Breast cancer survivors were less likely to be using hormone replacement and more likely to have tried nonhormonal prescription interventions in the past, but reported significantly less effectiveness from hot flash treatments. Breast cancer survivors with severe hot flashes reported significantly greater mood disturbance; higher negative affect; more interference with daily activities, including sleep, concentration, and sexuality; and poorer overall quality of life in comparison to breast cancer survivors with no hot flashes to mild hot flashes. Hot flash quality and triggers were not significantly different between groups. No clear temporal pattern of hot flashes emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Hot flashes are a significant problem for breast cancer survivors, even for those who are naturally postmenopausal (i.e., did not undergo menopause as a result of surgery or the effects of chemotherapy). Hot flashes remained fairly stable over time and did not diminish in frequency, severity, or associated distress. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The findings guide the assessment of the uniqueness of the problem of hot flashes experienced by breast cancer survivors and help define outcomes to address in clinical practice or include in future hot flash intervention research.

AB  - In the past, amputation was the standard method of treatment for patients with sarcomas in the extremity but limb-sparing procedures now are much more frequent. A computerized questionnaire automatically adjusted for gender, age, diagnosis, site, and treatment was sent to 2200 patients with high-grade sarcomas who had been treated during the past 25 years. Using the data, it was possible to study and compare the response from 66 patients who had an amputation and 342 patients with a limb-sparing procedure for a lower extremity neoplasm. More males had an amputation, but no differences were observed in the ages of the two groups. The outcomes for the two groups were similar. Patients who had limb-sparing procedures did not have a significant improvement in the ability to ambulate, climb stairs, drive a car, or be employed. More of the patients with amputations required walking aids and participated in sports activities at almost the same rate as the patients who had limb-sparing procedures. Patients who had amputations had no more anxiety, drug-dependence, depression, sleep problems, or limitation of sexual performance than patients who retained their limbs. The patients with amputations had more children and fewer menstrual problems; however, they were far less satisfied with their status at early ages than at later periods in their lives.

AB  - The pineal gland is an enigma within the central nervous system that appears to exert tremendous control over the homeostatic mechanisms of the body. In the animal kingdom, the pineal gland and the hormone it produces, melatonin, regulate circadian rhythms, sleep-wake cycles, thermal and immunologic systems, and reproductive capability. Human research has demonstrated that the pineal gland also plays a role in sleep disturbances, menstrual and reproductive irregularities, psychological and behavioral disorders, and may even serve as a tumor inhibitory gland. Although research is still in the early stages, it is apparent that the pineal gland and melatonin have widespread effects and optimal functioning of the pineal gland is essential to our well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether dim illumination in the evening is a factor in sleep disturbances of aging, depression, and circadian phase advance. DESIGN: One-week continuous recordings were made to record illumination exposure and to infer 24-hour sleep patterns from wrist activity. SETTING: Recordings took place during normal home and community activities. PARTICIPANTS: Complete data of 154 postmenopausal women, mean age 66.7, were selected from a larger study of participants in the Women's Health Initiative. MEASUREMENTS: Illumination in lux was averaged for 4 hours before bedtime and over 24 hours. Mood was measured using a brief eight-item screen. RESULTS: Illumination in the 4 hours before bedtime was quite dim: median 24 lux. Nevertheless, evening light exposure was not significantly related to sleep amount (in bed or out of bed) sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake within sleep, or mood. In contrast, the overall amount of light throughout the 24 hours was negatively correlated with sleep latency, wake within sleep, and depressed mood. CONCLUSIONS: Low evening lighting does not appear to be a crucial factor in sleep and mood disturbances of aging, but overall lighting may contribute to these disturbances.

AB  - A multicentric, open, prospective, observational and no-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Spain with 190 postmenopausal women receiving a soy preparation rich in isoflavones (PHYTO SOYA , capsules containing 17.5 mg isoflavones). The main object of the present study was to investigate its efficacy in alleviating the symptomatology derived from the lack of estrogen, mainly hot flushes, but also other symptoms such as sleep disorder, anxiety, depression, vaginal dryness, loss of libido and bone pain. Each patient received 35 mg isoflavones per day in two doses. During the four months' treatment, a statistically significant decrease in the number of hot flushes with PHYTO SOYA was experienced by 80.82% women; only 5,48% patients did not improve with the treatment. The average reduction was 47.8%, which is equivalent to 4 hot flushes. All the other studied parameters also showed a statistically significant decrease. No severe side-effects were reported and tolerance was excellent. Treatment with PHYTO SOYA resulted in a significant improvement of the symptomatology that accompanies the lack of estrogen during menopause.

AB  - QUESTION: In children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is once daily extended release methylphenidate (MPH) as effective as 3 times daily dosing?DesignRandomised (unclear allocation concealment*), blinded (patients/parents and outcome assessors)*, placebo controlled crossover trial with 7 days of follow up for each treatment condition.SettingState University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.Patients70 children between 6 and 12 years of age (mean age 9y 89% boys) with ADHD receiving a stable dose of MPH for >/= 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included contraindication to stimulant medication, any condition that would interfere with participation in laboratory classroom assessment, receiving any other medication for ADHD, and having reached menarche. 2 children were discontinued from the study.InterventionCrossover comparison of placebo, immediate release (IR) MPH 3 times a day (tid), and Concerta, a once daily MPH formulation taken in the morning. Each child's dose concentration was based on that child's MPH dosing before the study. 3 dosing concentrations of medication were used: 5 mg IR MPH tid/ 18 mg Concerta once a day; 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta once a day; and 15 mg IR MPH tid/54 mg Concerta once a day. Children received each medication condition for 7 days. Parents received behavioural parent training and teachers were taught to establish a school home daily report card.Main outcome measuresChange in ADHD symptoms, social behaviour and academic performance in both naturalistic (home and school) and laboratory environments (on Saturday); and side effects.Main resultsOn all measures in all settings, both drug conditions were statistically different from placebo (p < 0.001 for all measures) with little difference between drug conditions. In the natural setting, effect sizes (magnitude of the drug effects relative to placebo) on ADHD symptoms were 2.0, on oppositional defiant disorder symptoms 1.3, and on peer relation problems 1.4. Both medications improved behaviour as measured by teacher ratings and individualised target behaviours. These effects continued on into the evening as measured by parent ratings. In the laboratory setting Concerta was equivalent to IR MPH and both were statistically different from placebo. Effect sizes for both active drugs ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 on measures of rule violation frequency, negative behaviour frequency, observed disruptive behaviours, and individualised target behaviours. Side effects on children's sleep and appetite were similar for the 2 drug conditions.ConclusionOnce a day Concerta methylphenidate was equivalent to 3 times daily methylphenidatc in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.*See glossary.

AB  - This study used an ex post facto, cross-sectional methodology to compare subjective sleep quality, perimenopausal symptoms, and psychological dream type in depressed and non-depressed perimenopausal women. In addition, this study explored the written dream reports of perimenopausal women to discover the subjective reality of women experiencing perimenopause. The theoretical basis for this study was synthesized from Jung's Theory of Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, Cann and Donderi's conceptualization of the role of dreams in adaptation, and the scientific literature on sleep, sleep quality, perimenopausal depression, and perimenopausal symptoms. The sample consisted of 64 perimenopausal women who were recruited using a community snowball technique. Data were collected using the Centers for Epidemiologic Depression Scale (CES-D), Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale (VAS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Archetypality Scoring Scales, a Written Dream Report Form, and a Participant Information Form. Fisher's Exact Probability Test and t-tests for independent samples were used to determine the variance between perimenopausal women based on their depression status. No statistically significant differences in sleep disturbance, sleep effectiveness, sleep supplementation, and sleepiness were found between depressed and non-depressed perimenopausal women. Statistically significant differences in the reported experience of hot flashes, dizziness, dyspareunia, feeling of a full bladder after urinating, irregular menstrual periods, mood changes, irritability, panic attacks, poor concentration, poor memory, loss of self confidence, difficulty in making decisions, joint pain, and stiffness between depressed and non-depressed perimenopausal women were found at the p < .05 level of significance. These finding suggests that the presence of depression does not potentiate perceived sleep quality in perimenopausal women and that sleep disturbances may not be a reliable predictor of depression in perimenopausal women. Written dream reports were inductively analyzed using a synthesis technique for grounded theory analysis. Themes that emerged from the written dream reports were: being trapped, paying attention to myself, confronting fear/danger, finding unexpected help, saving myself, and recognizing a new me. This study supports the need for additional studies on the subjective sleep quality of perimenopausal women. Additionally, perimenopausal symptoms should be explored to determine if they are a precursor to the development of perimenopausal depression.

Results: Less than 27% of the sample reported sleeping 8 hours or more. Many women reported that at least once a week they awoke several times at night (61%), fell asleep during quiet activities (52%), or reported other symptoms suggestive of insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. More frequent insomnia problems were reported among women who reported nocturnal sleep longer than the mode of 7 hours, as well as among women who reported very short sleep. Age, ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, employment, marital status, diet, and season explained remarkably little of the variance in sleep duration or insomnia complaints; however, black women reported sleeping 0.45 hours on average less than whites, with the other minorities being intermediate between these groups. Conclusions: The results suggest that simple abbreviation of sleep and demographic factors may be less important in the sleep complaints of postmenopausal women than other possible factors. Cognitive-behavioral processes, depression, and obesity with apnea may be among the causes. Copyright © 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the association between psychologic distress and natural menopause in a community sample of African American, White, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese women participating in a national women's health study. METHODS: A cohort of 16,065 women aged 40 to 55 years provided information on menstrual regularity in the previous year, psychosocial factors, health, and somatic-psychologic symptoms. Psychologic distress was defined as feeling tense, depressed, and irritable in the previous 2 weeks. RESULTS: Rates of psychologic distress were highest in early perimenopause (28.9%) and lowest in premenopause (20.9%) and postmenopause (22%). In comparison with premenopausal women, early perimenopausal women were at a greater risk of distress, with and without adjustment for vasomotor and sleep symptoms and covariates. Odds of distress were significantly higher for Whites than for the other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Psychologic distress is associated with irregular menses in midlife. It is important to determine whether distress is linked to alterations in hormone levels and to what extent a mood-hormone relationship may be influenced by socioeconomic and cultural factors.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of perceived poor sleep in women aged 35-49 years and to correlate sleep quality with levels of gonadal steroids and predictors of poor sleep.Methods: A cohort of 218 black and 218 white women aged 35-47 years at enrollment (aged 37-49 at final follow-up) with regular menstrual cycles was identified through random digit dialing for a longitudinal study of ovarian aging correlates. Data obtained at four assessment periods, including enrollment, over a 2-year interval were collected between days 1 and 6 (mean = 3.9) of the menstrual cycle. The primary outcome measure was subjects' rating of sleep quality at each assessment period. Associations of sleep quality with hormone levels (estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and other clinical, behavioral, and demographic variables were examined in bivariable and multivariable analyses.Results: Approximately 17% of subjects reported poor sleep at each assessment period. Significant independent associations with poor sleep included greater incidence of hot flashes (odds ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08, 2.12, P =.02), higher anxiety levels (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.00, 1.06, P =.04), higher depression levels (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02, 1.07, P <.001), greater caffeine consumption (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04, 1.49, P =.02), and lower estradiol levels in women aged 45-49 (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.34, 0.84, P =.006), after adjustment for current use of sleep medications.Conclusion: Both hormonal and behavioral factors were associated with sleep quality. Estradiol levels are an important factor in poor sleep reported by women in the 45-49 age group. Further evaluation of estrogen treatment for poor sleep of women 45 years and older is warranted.

AB  - Study Objectives: To compare the prevalence and severity of sleep apnea between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to determine whether these differences are affected by the body mass index (BMI) and neck circumference.Design: Cross-sectional study utilizing a sleep clinic patient database.Setting: University hospital.Patients: A total of 1,315 women, classified into premenopausal and postmenopausal groups based on age (< 45 years and > 55 years, respectively).Measurements: Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, and neck circumference. Sleep measurements included full nocturnal polysomnography. Sleep apnea was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 10/h.Results: There were 797 premenopausal and 518 postmenopausal women. The latter group was more obese (mean +/- SE BMI, 32.2 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2) vs 30.2 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2); p < 0.0001) and had larger neck circumference (37.1 +/- 0.2 cm vs 35.8 +/- 0.2 cm; p < 0.0001). The prevalence of sleep apnea was greater in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women (47% vs 21%; chi(2) < 0.0001). There were proportionately more postmenopausal than premenopausal women in all ranges of apnea severity (AHI, 10 to 30/h, 30 to 50/h, and > 50/h). Postmenopausal women had a significantly higher mean AHI compared to premenopausal women (17.0 +/- 0.9/h vs 8.7 +/- 0.6/h; p < 0.0001); this significant difference persisted even after adjusting for BMI and neck circumference.Conclusion: There may be functional, rather than anatomic, differences in the upper airway between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, which may account for the observed differences in apnea prevalence and severity.

AB  - Objective.-We conducted the present study to determine whether there are headache precipitating and aggravating factors that differentiate migraine from tension-type headache and headache precipitating and aggravating factors that differentiate tension-type headache from migraine. Methods.-We interviewed 38 patients with migraine and 17 patients with tension-type headache (diagnosed using International Headache Society criteria) by telephone, using a questionnaire. The questionnaire inquired about the following precipitating and aggravating headache factors: (1) physical activity, (2) straining, (3) bending over, (4) stress/tension, (5) coughing/sneezing, (6) fatigue, (7) reading, (8) driving, (9) lack of sleep, (10) specific foods/drinks, (11) alcohol, (12) not eating on time, (13) smoke, (14) smell, (15) light, (16) noise, (17) menstruation, and (18) weather. Results.-The most common precipitating factors acknowledged by both groups of patients were stress/tension, not eating on time, fatigue, and lack of sleep. Weather, smell, smoke, and light were the precipitating factors that differentiated migraine from tension-type headache. Excluding those factors that are part of the International Headache Society migraine diagnosis, the aggravating factors were straining, bending over, and smell. We found no precipitating or aggravating factors differentiating tension-type headache from migraine. Conclusion.-Apparently there are precipitating and aggravating factors differentiating migraine from tension-type headache but not vice versa. It is interesting that three of the migraine-specific precipitating factors (ie, weather, smell, and smoke) involve the nose/sinus system, suggesting a greater significance of this system in headache than is generally considered.

AB  - Objective: Similar to the circadian rhythm of core body temperature, hot flashes have been found to exhibit a circadian rhythm in healthy, naturally postmenopausal women, with a peak in frequency at 18:25 h. However, to date, no studies have evaluated whether this same pattern is found among breast cancer survivors reporting hot flashes.Design: Daily hot flash frequencies were measured among 21 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors using validated 24-h sternal skin conductance monitoring.Results: Hot flashes were noted in all women, ranging in frequency from 1 to 30 per 24-h period. A majority of the sample (86%) experienced > or = 1 nighttime hot flash, with 48% exhibiting > or = 3 but < or = 7 nighttime hot flashes. For the total sample, a modest circadian rhythm was noted with a peak in hot flash frequency occurring at 16:10 h. However, significant variability was observed across individual women, and, as a whole, breast cancer survivors demonstrated distorted to obliterated rhythms.Conclusions: Data suggest that hot flashes in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors do not follow the same circadian pattern as previously seen in healthy, naturally postmenopausal women. Findings have implications for (1) understanding the potential for sleep disturbances and fatigue in breast cancer survivors experiencing hot flashes, and (2) future research examining circadian rhythms of core body temperature and hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on tamoxifen side effects on the female genital tract and psychosexual function in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.Data Sources: We used the English-language literature in MEDLINE and reference lists from selected articles. Search terms included: "tamoxifen and estrogen receptor," "transcription activation," "premenopause," "postmenopause," "vaginal epithelium," "uterus," "endometrial hyperplasia," "polyps," "endometrial cancer," "sonography," "sonohysterography," "hysteroscopy," "myometrium," "myoma," "sarcoma," "endometriosis," "ovarian cysts," "hot flushes," "concentration problems," "sleep disturbance," "vaginal dryness," "sexual function," "libido," "dyspareunia," and "quality of life." No study-type restrictions were imposed.Methods Of Study Selection: With respect to clinical studies we included case cohort studies, observational studies; if no trials were available on a subject, case reports published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. For the discussion on endometrial surveillance of tamoxifen users, letters and editorials published in peer-reviewed journals also were used. Subjects of interest were mechanism of action of tamoxifen, tamoxifen and the vaginal epithelium, endometrium, mesenchymal tumors of the uterus, ovaries, sexual function, and vasomotor instability.Tabulation, Integration, and Results: Eligible studies were analyzed to determine their usefulness in this review. Data from trials that evaluated tamoxifen side effects on specific genital tissues were combined, with special interest in differentiation of side effects in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Weighted estimates of severity and extent of side effects were usually not possible because of lack of randomized trials. Only the risk of endometrial cancer in relation to tamoxifen treatment could be estimated.Conclusion: The gynecologic side effects of tamoxifen are diverse and reflect the complexity of its mechanism of action, with agonistic and antagonistic effects on various tissues, depending on the ambient estradiol concentration and hence menopausal status of the patient. The most frequently reported side effect was hot flushes, and the most worrisome gynecologic side effect was a two- to three-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Despite its side effects, the benefits of tamoxifen in controlling breast cancer or prevention of its relapse are still without debate.

They were randomized into two treatment groups: (1) estrogen (Premarin 0.625 mg) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera 5 mg) (n = 11) or (2) estrogen (Premarin 0.625 mg) and oral micronized progesterone (Prometrium 200 mg) (n = 10). Postmenopausal women were recorded for two consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory at baseline and again after 6 months of treatment in a randomized trial. The women also had to fill out evening and morning sleep and vigilance questionnaires for 7 days before baseline recordings and for 23 days before month 6 recordings.Results: Sleep efficiency was found to be significantly improved in the micronized progesterone group. It increased by 8% (p = 0.014) with no such increase observed in the medroxyprogesterone acetate group. Time spent awake after sleep onset was also significantly improved in the micronized progesterone group but not in the medroxyprogesterone acetate group. On the other hand, menopausal symptoms and subjective measures of sleep (questionnaires) improved in both groups after treatment.Conclusion: This study suggests that medroxyprogesterone acetate and micronized progesterone are both effective for treating menopausal symptoms but that the latter might better improve the quality of sleep in postmenopausal women taking estrogen.

AB  - Since 1995, many women have sought my help for symptoms related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It was clear, through clinical and personal experience, that it was usual for symptoms to vary in severity and type, from woman to woman, month to month, and that lifestyle adjustments, complementary therapies and some drugs had positive effects.Premenstrual syndromes (PMSs) are a group of menstrually-related, chronic, cyclical disorders manifested by emotional and physical symptoms in the second part of the menstrual cycle, which subside after the beginning of the menstrual period.Many doctors do not believe there is such condition as PMS and, consequently, fail to recognize and treat it. Of 482 women who called the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (NAPS) helpline last year, 42% said that their GPs were unsympathetic or did not seem to know much about PMS.

AB  - We investigated the relationship of pessimistic attributional style (specifically, stable attributions for negative events) and socioeconomic status (SES) to cardiovascular and catecholamine profiles in a biracial sample of 37 postmenopausal women (aged 39-64 years) not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Blood pressure (BP) variation in response to the demands of daily life was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring on a typical workday. Subjects were classified into groups by stable pessimistic attributions (high vs. low pessimism) and by SES (high vs. low). Significant SES x pessimism interactions were found. Low SES/high pessimism women demonstrated higher systolic BP (SBP) during the day, evening, and sleep periods of 24-hour ambulatory monitoring compared with the other three groups. A greater proportion of this group was in the hypertensive range (> or = 140/90 mm Hg) compared with the other groups (57% vs. 8%-29%). Low SES/high pessimism women also reported reduced available social support compared with the other three groups.

AB  - Objective: To prospectively evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on seizure activity in a postmenopausal woman with epilepsy.Background: Postmenopausal women are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis secondary to a lack of estrogen's protective effects. As a result, women without known contraindications often take HRT to counteract this risk. Postmenopausal women with epilepsy are at a greater risk for osteoporosis because of the negative effects that certain antiepileptic drugs have on bone density. Clinical studies and experience have shown that hormonal variances across a woman's lifetime play a significant role in seizure activity, but the effects of HRT in postmenopausal women with epilepsy are unknown.Case Summary: We report the case of a 51-year-old postmenopausal white woman with epilepsy who presented with frequent vasomotor flushing. To determine individual effects of HRT on seizure activity, therapy was initiated in two three-month phases, with monthly evaluation. A weekly transdermal patch of estradiol 0.1 mg/d was initiated for the first three months. During the second three months, the regimen was expanded to include oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg once daily. Antiepileptic medications and their dosages remained constant. HRT was associated with a decreased incidence of seizures, cessation of vasomotor flushing, improved sleep, and a positive impact on the lipid profile.Conclusions: This case report describing the prospective addition of HRT in a postmenopausal woman with epilepsy suggests that HRT can be initiated in certain women to achieve therapeutic benefits without adversely affecting seizure activity.

AB  - Study Objectives: To define the metabolic profile relevant to vascular risks in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the role of leptin resistance in this risk profile.Design: Case control study.Setting: Sleep Laboratory, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, China.Methods: Thirty OSA subjects were matched with 30 non-OSA subjects for body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and menopausal status. Neck, waist, and hip girth, skinfold thickness, and fasting serum levels of lipids, glucose, insulin, and leptin were compared between these two groups.Results: Compared with control subjects with a similar BMI but without OSA, the OSA group had a significantly more adverse vascular risk factor profile, including dyslipidemia, higher diastolic BP, insulin resistance, and greater adiposity reflected by skinfold thickness. OSA subjects also had higher circulating leptin levels (9.18+/-4.24 ng/mL vs 6.54+/-3.81 ng/mL, mean +/- SD, p = 0.001). Serum leptin levels correlated positively with BMI, skinfold thickness, serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, insulin/glucose ratio, apnea-hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation time; multiple stepwise regression analysis identified skinfold thickness, waist/hip ratio, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and diastolic BP as independent correlates, while only serum insulin and diastolic BP were independent correlates in OSA subjects. After treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure for 6 months, there was a significant decrease in circulating leptin (p = 0.01) and triglyceride levels (p = 0.02) without change in other parameters.Conclusion: Despite controlling for BMI, OSA subjects showed distinct profiles with clustering of vascular risk factors. Hyperleptinemia was present in the OSA subjects, but it can be normalized by treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, suggesting that increased leptin resistance was not the cause of OSA or its associated vascular risks.

AB  - The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed agents for treating depressive disorders in the United States. Differences between the individual SSRIs may guide the choice of a particular agent. These differences include pharmacokinetic profiles, side effects, relative doses, FDA-approved indications, and cost. This article discusses the role of these differences in the selection of a particular agent. Since the SSRIs inhibit neuronal serotonin reuptake and have minimal effects on sites affected by other antidepressants, the SSRIs have a different pharmacodynamic and tolerability profile from other antidepressants. The SSRls are effective in treating many disorders, including major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, bulimia, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and perhaps migraine headaches. Common adverse reactions of the SSRIs include central nervous system activation, insomnia, sedation, and gastrointestinal upset. Altered sleep patterns and sexual dysfunction due to SSRIs may adversely impact patients' quality of life. Potentially serious drug interactions may occur when SSRIs are given concomitantly with other agents. Including warfarin, meperidine, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The SSRIs provide clinicians with an effective alternative to older antidepressants.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effects of raloxifene, estrogen, and placebo on quality of life in healthy, asymptomatic, postmenopausal women.Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, 12-month study, 398 women were assigned randomly to one of four groups: raloxifene HCl, 60 (n = 97) or 150 mg/day (n = 100); conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg/day (n = 96); or placebo (n = 105). The Women's Health Questionnaire, a validated quality-of-life instrument for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was administered at baseline and 3-month intervals.Results: Overall, quality of life from baseline to end point was preserved equally in all treatment groups. Six domains (depressed mood, somatic symptoms, memory/concentration, sexual behavior, sleep problems, and perceived attractiveness) were unchanged in all groups. Three domains (menstrual symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and anxiety/fears) were statistically significantly different among groups. Mean scores for menstrual symptoms significantly worsened and vasomotor symptoms significantly improved from baseline to end point in the estrogen group. Mean scores for vasomotor symptoms did not worsen at any point in the raloxifene 60 mg/day group. Mean anxiety/fears scores improved significantly during raloxifene 60 mg/day administration throughout treatment (P <.05), irrespective of previous hormone replacement therapy, baseline estradiol (E2) levels, or years postmenopause.Conclusion: Most quality-of-life domains were not affected by treatment with estrogen or raloxifene. Estrogen provided relief from vasomotor symptoms but caused menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene 60 mg/day improved anxiety levels in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Clinical trials have shown nefazodone to be effective in treating depression. More studies are needed to confirm nefazodone's efficacy in treating anxiety, premenstrual syndrome, chronic pain conditions, and sleep disturbances. Before initiation of treatment, clinicians need to know the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and drug interactions of nefazodone. Nefazodone may be an attractive alternative medication for patients who develop adverse effects to other available antidepressants.

AB  - Hot flashes are among the most commonly reported symptoms among women who have completed treatment for breast cancer. Relatively little is known, however, about hot flashes among women while they are undergoing breast cancer treatment. The present study investigated the prevalence and severity of hot flashes of women during chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast cancer. We also sought to identify the medical, demographic, and treatment correlates of hot flashes during treatment and to document the impact of hot flashes on quality of life. Seventy postmenopausal women with breast cancer completed a self-report questionnaire packet during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Forty percent (n = 28) reported hot flashes during the week prior to assessment. Of the 28 women endorsing hot flashes, 25% (n = 7) rated them as severe, 39% (n = 11) rated them as moderate, and 36% (n = 10) rated them as mild. Women with hot flashes were significantly (p < 0.05) younger and reported significantly (p < 0.001) more fatigue, poorer sleep quality, and poorer physical health compared to women without hot flashes. Multivariate analyses revealed that, even after controlling for relevant medical, demographic, and treatment variables, the prevalence of hot flashes significantly (p < 0.05) predicted poorer sleep quality, more fatigue, and worse physical health. The results indicate that hot flashes are experienced by a sizable percentage of postmenopausal breast cancer patients as they undergo treatment. Hot flashes during cancer treatment appear to have a negative impact upon patient quality of life that may be due, in part, to fatigue and interference with sleep. Future research should seek to evaluate interventions to relieve hot flashes during breast cancer treatment as a means of improving patient quality of life.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between measures of Americanization (the adoption of American life-style and culture) and physiological measures of stress in Filipino-American immigrants.Methods: Ambulatory blood pressure monitors and timed urine collections were used to evaluate blood pressure and urinary catecholamine excretion across the work, home, and sleep daily settings among 31 healthy, premenopausal, immigrant Filipino-American women employed as nurses or nurse's aides. Migration history and life-style were evaluated from questionnaire responses. Reported job strain, decision latitude, and psychological demand were obtained from the Job Content Questionnaire.Results: Immigrants who had lived longer in the United States had elevated norepinephrine levels in the work and home settings (p < .05), higher diastolic blood pressure during sleep (p < .01), and lower dips in blood pressure during sleep (p < .05). Job strain measures were not related to blood pressure, catecholamine excretion rates, or residence time in the United States.Conclusions: The results suggest that indicators of stress increase as a function of time since immigration, although this result is not explained by self-reports of identification with Filipino or American life-style or by measures of job strain.

AB  - Sleep problems (i.e., insomnia) affect midlife women as they approach and pass through menopause at rates higher than at most other stages of life. The purpose of this article is to critically review what is known about insomnia (perceived poor sleep) and physiologically assessed sleep, as well as sleep-related disordered breathing (SDB), in women according to menopausal status and the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) hormones. Self-report evidence that sleep difficulties are related to the hormonal changes of menopause is mixed. Data from studies in which sleep was physiologically measured reveal that sleep problems appear corequisite with hot flashes and sweats. Results are difficult to compare across studies because of varying methodologies in how sleep quality and patterns were assessed and how age cohorts and menopausal status were defined. The risk of SDB increases with age, although women are less susceptible at any age than men. As with men, snoring, obesity, and high blood pressure are clear risk factors. Some women may be underdiagnosed for SDB, as they have somewhat different symptom manifestations than men. Usually, frank apnea is not as evident. Primary care clinicians should be mindful of the potential for SDB in women who are obese, have high blood pressure, are cognizant of snoring, and report morning headaches and excessive daytime sleepiness. Improved care will result from consistently incorporating sleep insomnia assessments into practice as a basis for referring to sleep centers as necessary or prescribing sleep-enhancing behavioral and pharmacological treatments.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the occurrence of fatigue in a large sample of breast cancer survivors relative to general population norms and to identify demographic, medical, and psychosocial characteristics of fatigued survivors.Patients and Methods: Breast cancer survivors in two large metropolitan areas completed standardized questionnaires as part of a survey study, including the RAND 36-item Health Survey, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Checklist, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, and demographic and treatment-related measures.Results: On average, the level of fatigue reported by the breast cancer survivors surveyed (N = 1,957) was comparable to that of age-matched women in the general population, although the breast cancer survivors were somewhat more fatigued than a more demographically similar reference group. Approximately one third of the breast cancer survivors assessed reported more severe fatigue, which was associated with significantly higher levels of depression, pain, and sleep disturbance. In addition, fatigued women were more bothered by menopausal symptoms and were somewhat more likely to have received chemotherapy (with or without radiation therapy) than nonfatigued women. In multivariate analyses, depression and pain emerged as the strongest predictors of fatigue.Conclusion: Although the majority of breast cancer survivors in this large and diverse sample did not experience heightened levels of fatigue relative to women in the general population, there was a subgroup of survivors who did report more severe and persistent fatigue. We identified characteristics of these women that may be helpful in elucidating the mechanisms underlying fatigue in this population, as well as directing intervention efforts.

AB  - Objective: To describe changes in women's sleep patterns from prepregnancy to postpartum.Methods: Polysomnography was done in women's homes for 2 consecutive nights. Forty-five women were studied during the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles, and 33 conceived and were studied during each trimester of pregnancy. Twenty-nine were studied at 1 and 3 months postpartum.Results: Compared with prepregnant sleep characteristics, significant changes in sleep patterns were evident by 11-12 weeks' gestation, with a significant increase in total sleep time but less deep sleep and more awakening during sleep. By the third month postpartum, there was improvement in sleep characteristics; however, sleep efficiency remained significantly lower than baseline prepregnancy values.Conclusion: Sleep disturbance was greatest during the first postpartum month, particularly for first-time mothers.

AB  - Mandatory preparticipation examinations (PPE) are labor intensive, offer little routine health maintenance and are poor predictors of future injury or illness. Our objective was to develop a new PPE for the Stanford University varsity athletes that improved both quality of primary and preventive care and physician time efficiency. This PPE is based on the annual submission, by each athlete, of a comprehensive medical history questionnaire that is then summarized in a two-page report for the examining physician. The questionnaire was developed through a search of MEDLINE from 1966 to 1997, review of PPE from 11 other institutions, and discussion with two experts from each of seven main content areas: medical and musculoskeletal history, eating, menstrual and sleep disorders, stress and health risk behaviors. Content validity was assessed by 10 sports medicine physicians and four epidemiologists. It was then programmed for the World Wide Web (http:// www.stanford.edu/dept/sportsmed/). The questionnaire demonstrated a 97 +/- 2% sensitivity in detecting positive responses requiring physician attention. Sixteen physicians administered the 1997/98 PPE; using the summary reports, 15 found improvement in their ability to provide overall medical care including health issues beyond clearance; 13 noted a decrease in time needed for each athlete exam. Over 90% of athletes who used the web site found it 'easy' or 'moderately easy' to access and complete. Initial assessment of this new PPE format shows good athlete compliance, improved exam efficiency and a strong increase in subjective physician satisfaction with the quality of screening and medical care provided. The data indicate a need for improvement of routine health maintenance in this population. The database offers opportunities to study trends, risk factors, and results of interventions.

AB  - Many women experience symptoms of premenstrual irritability, reactivity of mood, anxiety, and change in appetite and sleep. Whereas some women experience these symptoms exclusively during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, others may have premenstrual complaints but actually suffer from mood and anxiety symptoms across the entire menstrual cycle. We sought to determine the extent to which women who seek treatment for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) actually suffer from symptoms of sufficient severity and duration to meet formal criteria for mood or anxiety disorders. Two hundred six women who responded to advertisements for a treatment study of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and who were screened by telephone for study eligibility were included in the current investigation. A telephone questionnaire keyed to the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID-I/P) was used to screen for the presence of current mood and anxiety disorders. Approximately 39% (n = 80) of respondents met criteria for mood or anxiety disorders or both. Mood disorders were noted almost twice as commonly as anxiety disorders. The high prevalence of mood disorders in the sample underscores the need for clinicians to be aware of the overlap between reported PMS symptoms and underlying depressive disorder. Given that early identification and treatment of mood disorder can increase the likelihood of recovery and lower risk for recurrent illness, clinicians should have a low threshold for ruling out mood and anxiety disorders in women with complaints of premenstrual symptoms.

AB  - Objective: The incidence of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) in women increases after menopause. Progestins alone do not alleviate SAS in menopausal women. However, progestins may require concomitant estrogen administration and estrogen alone may stimulate breathing during sleep. To test these hypotheses, we studied the effects of estrogen alone and estrogen combined with progestin on SAS in menopausal women, using a prospective, cross-over, inception cohort study.Design: In this pilot study, five women who developed SAS after menopause underwent 2 nights of polysomnography to obtain a baseline, then returned for polysomnography after 3-4 weeks of taking micronized 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and after 10-12 days of taking E2 combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (E2 + P). Sleep stages were scored according to Rechtshaffen and Kales, frequency and length of apneas were recorded for each subject each night, and the data were analyzed by Student's t test.Results: E2 and E2 + P both reduced the Respiratory Distress Index. E2 also raised the lowest oxygen desaturation associated with apneic episodes. Total minutes of rapid eye movement sleep increased, and the number of waking episodes decreased when the women were taking E2 and E2 + P, as previously reported.Conclusions: Within 1 month after initiating E2 or E2 + P, SAS was reduced in all patients. The Respiratory Distress Index decreased by 25%, and the addition of progestin brought the SAS reduction to 50% in this pilot study. A randomized study in a large group of patients is justified by the findings of this study. Because SAS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and fatal accidents, the amelioration of SAS by sex steroid hormones could have significant implications for the health of menopausal women.

AB  - Objective: To assess the feasibility and psychometric properties of a lightweight, automated, ambulatory sternal skin conductance monitor to measure frequency of hot flashes (HFs) among breast cancer survivors (BCSs).Design: A total of 19 postmenopausal BCSs and 5 premenopausal healthy comparison women participated by wearing the monitor for 24 h during their normal daily activities, including sleep. HFs were assessed using subjective (diaries, event markers) and objective (skin conductance) methods.Results: Problems with subjective reporting of HFs were reported by 35% of BCSs. Technological problems and discomfort related to wearing the monitor were minimal. A total of 243 HFs were recorded using the skin conductance monitor by 17 BCSs and 5 premenopausal women (BCS group M = 13.4; range, 1-30). Subjective reporting of HFs was associated with a 31-33% false-positive rate. Skin conductance monitoring during waking hours was associated with a 30% false-negative rate.Conclusions: The monitor is a feasible method for objectively assessing HFs in BCSs. Data support continued use of sternal skin conductance as an objective measure of HF frequency. This technology should prove useful as an objective measure of HFs in future intervention research aimed at alleviating the symptom and improving quality of life among BCSs.

AB  - 'Andropause', like menopause, has received significant attention in recent years. It results in a variety of symptoms experienced by the elderly. Many of these symptoms are nonspecific and vague. For this reason, many authors have questioned the value of androgen replacement in this population. Also in dispute is the normal cutoff level for testosterone beyond which therapy should be initiated, and whether to measure free or total testosterone. Testosterone levels decline with age, with the lowest level seen in men older than 70 years. This age-related decline in testosterone levels is both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testes) in origin. With aging, there is also a loss of circadian rhythm of testosterone secretion and a rise in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Total testosterone level is the best screening test for patients with suspected hypogonadism. If the total testosterone concentration is low, free testosterone levels should be obtained. Prostate cancer remains an absolute contraindication to androgen therapy. Testosterone replacement results in an improvement in muscle strength and bone mineral density. Similar effects are observed on the haematopoietic system. Data on cognition and lipoprotein profiles are conflicting. Androgen therapy can result in polycythemia and sleep apnoea. These adverse effects can be deleterious in men with compromised cardiac reserve. We recommend that elderly men with symptoms of hypogonadism and a total testosterone level <300 ng/dl should be started on testosterone replacement. This review discusses the pros and cons of testosterone replacement in hypogonadal elderly men and attempts to answer some of the unanswered questions. Furthermore, emphasis is made on the regular follow-up of these patients to prevent the development of therapy-related complications.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of climacteric vasomotor symptoms on sleep quality measured by self-report and polysomnography in postmenopausal women.Methods: Seventy-one healthy postmenopausal women were recruited, of whom 63 completed the study. Each subject recorded climacteric symptoms and subjective sleep quality for 14 days. Sleep quality was evaluated objectively by all-night polysomnography using the static charge-sensitive bed.Results: During polysomnography, a high frequency of climacteric vasomotor symptoms was not associated with changes in sleep latency, percentage of sleep stages, number of arousals, sleep efficiency, or total sleep time. However, a high frequency of climacteric vasomotor symptoms (range 0-8.9, r = .60, P < .001), somatic symptoms (range 0-5.0, r = .25-.44, P < .05), and mental symptoms (range 0-5.0, r = .41-.51, P < .001) was related to impaired subjective sleep quality. In stepwise regression analysis, 32% of the impairment in subjective sleep quality was explained by vasomotor symptoms (P < .001), 14% by palpitations (P < .001), and 4% by mood instability (P = .029). High body mass index predicted impaired objective sleep quality, such as prolonged latencies to stage-2 sleep (r = .27, P = .031) and slow-wave sleep (r = .51, P = .003) and decreased oxygen saturations (r = -.54, P < .001). Older women had decreased sleep efficiency (r = -.27, P = .030) and lower oxygen saturations (r = -.36, P = .004). Serum estradiol level had only a minor effect on objective sleep quality.Conclusion: Impaired subjective sleep quality associated with climacteric vasomotor symptoms did not manifest as abnormalities in polysomnographic sleep recordings. Body mass index and age appeared to have the strongest effect on objective sleep quality.

AB  - Women experience depression twice as often as men. The diagnostic criteria for depression are the same for both sexes, but women with depression more frequently experience guilt, anxiety, increased appetite and sleep, weight gain and comorbid eating disorders. Women may achieve higher plasma concentrations of antidepressants and thus may require lower dosages of these medications. Depending on the patient's age, the potential effects of antidepressants on a fetus or neonate may need to be considered. Research indicates no increased teratogenic risk from in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants. SSRIs are effective in treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder and many comorbid conditions associated with depression in women. Psychotherapy may be used alone in women with mild to moderate depression, or it may be used adjunctively with antidepressant drug therapy. Women who have severe depression accompanied by active suicidal thoughts or plans should usually be managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the perimenopausal symptom experience of Filipino American midlife women with particular emphasis upon estrogen-related menopause symptoms (day sweats, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness). DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey was used to generate symptom experience data for 165 Filipina Americans between the ages of 35 and 56 who self-identified as Filipina American and were English-language proficient. The community-based sample completed questionnaires composed of sample characteristic questions and a 51-item menstrual symptom checklist with menopause-related symptoms embedded in it. RESULTS: Sample characteristics and symptom experience were compared among age groups of 35 to 39 (n = 39), 40 to 44 (n = 40), 45 to 49 (n = 37), and 50 to 56 (n = 49) and by perimenopausal phase, defined as premenopausal (n = 85), transitional (n = 33), and menopausal/postmenopausal (n = 47). The most reported individual symptoms were 'felt energetic' (86.1%) and 'well-being' (83.6%). Estrogen-related menopause symptoms were reported as 'vaginal dryness' (39.4%), 'hot flashes' (37.6%), 'day sweats' (27.9%), and 'night sweats' (24.2%) by the total sample. Distress associated with estrogen-related menopause symptoms was reported by 17% (n = 28) of all women. Subjects' chi 2 tests indicated that 50-to-56-year-old women were more likely to report fatigue/sleep symptoms, physical symptoms, and estrogen-related menopause symptoms than all other age groups. When compared by perimenopausal phase, transitional women were more likely to report moderate or extreme severity for day sweats. Premenopausal women were more likely to report minimal or mild severity and women in the perimenopausal transition were more likely to report moderate or extreme severity on estrogen-related menopause symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Filipino American midlife women appear to consider the perimenopausal transition in a positive light and experience little distress associated with estrogen-related menopause symptoms experienced. Findings from this study suggest that Filipina Americans view perimenopausal symptoms as part of a normal life stage that does not warrant concern.

AB  - Objectives: Obstructive apnoeas during sleep are associated with marked cyclical blood pressure fluctuations in men with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Haemodynamic responses to OSA in women are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate haemodynamics during apnoeic events in women with OSA and to assess the influence of the menstrual cycle on these responses.Design and Methods: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring was performed in 13 women with OSA during follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Change in blood pressure (deltaBP) from pre- to post-apnoea termination was measured for each apnoeic cycle.Results: Only 10 of 13 subjects ovulated. In women who ovulated, pressor responses to apnoea termination occurred in both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but substantially increased during the luteal phase of ovulatory cycles [NREM change in mean arterial pressure (deltaMAP) 12 +/- 3 mmHg during the follicular phase and 20 +/- 3 mmHg during the luteal phase, P < 0.001; REM deltaMAP 11 +/- 3 mmHg during the follicular phase and 23 +/- 3 mmHg during the luteal phase, P < 0.001]. Sleep apnoea severity did not change during the cycle in NREM sleep, but was reduced in REM during the luteal phase. Changes in pressor responses were absent in non-ovulating subjects.Conclusions: Obstructive apnoeas in women were associated with marked blood pressure changes, similar to those previously reported in men. While respiratory events improved slightly in the luteal phase, blood pressure responses to these events increased by approximately 100%. Thus, the menstrual cycle has discordant effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of OSA in women.

AB  - Question: What are women's experiences of the menopausal transition and how do they interpret and respond to the changes they experience. Design: Grounded theory. Setting: USA. Patients: 61 women who were experiencing menopausal transition (menstrual bleeding changes, hot flashes, and change in feelings and emotions). Age range was 41-54 years and most were white, middle class, college educated, and employed outside the home. Methods: Women were interviewed by telephone (23-110 min each with most lasting 40-45 min) and asked to describe changes they were experiencing, how they felt about the changes, and ways in which the changes affected their lives. Changes could be related to bleeding, hot flashes, feelings and emotions, sleep, appearance, energy level, weight, appetite, digestion, sexual feelings, etc. Data were analysed, processes were identified, and a theory was developed. Main findings: The basic core variable (social process) was described as keeping up appearances. Appearance encompassed all aspects of presentation of the self and perceptions of being a certain type of person. Women attempted to keep up appearances by concealing changes and by maintaining a sense of control in relation to physical and emotional changes. Women hid changes by keeping silent, keeping to themselves, detaching themselves, masking feelings or behaviours, avoiding discussions, diverting inquiries, and ignoring, minimising, or dismissing the effects of changes. The unpredictability of the changes left women feeling as though they had no control over what was happening to them. Thev wanted control to avoid embarrassment and to be able to function with minimal disruption. The control was maintained through management strategies (increased self monitoring and self care, monitoring the environment and interactions with others, and making adjustments). Women felt vigilant and anxious in situations that could potentially disclose their menopause status, and confident and secure when threat of disclosure was absent. Women sought help or felt frustrated in situations of potential social exposure and silent and detached when the threat of exposure was absent. Women's feelings about, and responses to, changes varied over time and according to the characteristics of the change. If they felt the changes were normal and not disruptive, they felt secure and undisturbed. If they felt the changes were unexplained or disruptive, they became vigilant and used strategies to find out what was happening and how to minimise the disruption. With no control and high threat of social disclosure, women sought professional help. Conclusions: When women experienced the menopausal transition they sought to regain control of the physical and emotional changes to keep up appearances. They gained control by concealing changes and developing multiple management strategies. [Original article accession number: 1999005844 (research, tables/charts)]

AB  - HEALTH WATCH is a longitudinal prospective study of healthy aging. This study began in 1970. It characterizes the biochemical, hematological, immunological, and physiological data of 2200 healthy men and women between the ages of 20 and 80. Well-being, stress, and sleep data are obtained annually as a self-administered HEALTH WATCH questionnaire. A subset of women from the HEALTH WATCH cohort who were actively followed in the 1970s and had perimenopausal years available was selected. This subset allows observation of the normal female aging related to the significant marker, cessation of menses. Critical selection criterion included a natural menopause and the absence of hormonal intervention. Computer selection identified 19 subjects. Three sets of matched, age-defined controls were selected. This study investigates changes of data from healthy women related to menopause status. Changes unique to perimenopause status include sleep, sex difficulties, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorous, and thyroxine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe perceived levels of fatigue and energy before, during, and after pregnancy in a group of healthy women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies; and to examine relationships between their perception of fatigue and energy, parity, and physiologic indicators of sleep disturbances, thyroid function, and iron deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 24 primiparous and 1 8 multiparous women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in fatigue and energy over time. Measures were obtained at follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle before pregnancy, at each trimester, and at 1 and 3 months after delivery. RESULTS: Younger age and lower prepregnancy levels of iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin explained 1st trimester fatigue. Less total sleep was related to fatigue in the 3rd trimester. Postpartum fatigue was related to reduced amounts of sleep and low levels of ferritin and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of premenstrual (luteal) fatigue, progesterone levels were unrelated to fatigue. Neither paid employment nor family variables influenced perception of fatigue. Nurses working with childbearing populations should counsel women about significant 1st trimester fatigue so they can prepare their work and home environments in an attempt to achieve adequate rest.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles selected from computerized databases; reference texts and lay publications on women's health and menopause. DATA SYNTHESIS: In healthy mid-life women, the years preceding and immediately following menopause are characterized by hormonal changes that result in altered menstrual bleeding patterns that progress to cessation of menses. These physiologic changes may be associated with hot flashes; changes in the vaginal epithelium; and mood, cognitive, and sleep alterations that are described as early menopausal symptoms. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer suppresses ovarian function resulting in a wide variability of menstrual patterns, hormonal changes, and symptom experiences among treated premenopausal women. The natural perimenopausal transition informs our understanding of women who experience chemotherapy-induced premature menopause. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Knowledge of the underlying physiology and symptom experience of natural and drug-induced menopause provides a foundation for oncology nurses. This foundation is essential to assessment and clinical decision making in the care of women with breast cancer.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the psychological and physiological variables that differentiate persons reporting masticatory muscle pain (MMP) from normal controls (NC). This study examined the characteristics of 35 MMP patients in comparison to 35 age-, sex-, and weight-matched NCs. All subjects completed a series of standardized questionnaires prior to undergoing a laboratory evaluation consisting of a psychosocial stressor and pressure pain stimulation at multiple body sites. During the evaluation, subjects' emotional and physiological responses (heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, skin temperature, and muscle activity) were monitored. Results indicated that persons with MMP reported greater fatigue, disturbed sleep, depression, anxiety, menstrual symptoms, and less self-deception (P's < 0.05) than matched controls. At rest, MMPs had lower end tidal carbon dioxide levels (P < 0.04) and lower diastolic blood pressures than the NCs (P < 0.02). During laboratory challenge, both groups responded to the standard stressor with significant physiological activity and emotional responding consistent with an acute stress response (P < 0.01), but there were no differences between the MMPs and NCs. Muscle pain patients reported lower pressure pain thresholds than did NCs at the right/left masseter and right temporalis sites (P's < 0.05); there were no differences in pressure pain thresholds between MMPs and NCs for the left temporalis (P < 0.07) and right/left middle finger sites (P's > 0.93). These results are discussed in terms of the psychological and physiological processes that may account for the development of muscle pain in the masticatory system.

AB  - Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on sleep complaints by postmenopausal women and to assess the predictive factors involved.Study Design: Sixty-three postmenopausal women entered a 7-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study consisting of two 3-month treatments with estrogen and placebo with a 1-month washout period between. Eight Visual Analogic Scale statements about different sleep complaints, the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, scoring of climacteric symptoms, The Beck Depression Inventory, and serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone level controls were the main outcome measures.Results: Estrogen replacement therapy improved sleep quality, facilitated falling asleep, and decreased nocturnal restlessness and awakenings (p < 0.001). The subjects were less tired in the mornings and in the daytime (p < 0.001) when taking estrogen replacement therapy. Estrogen-induced sleep improvement was associated with alleviation of vasomotor symptoms (r range 0.27 to 0.55), alleviation of somatic symptoms (palpitations and muscular pain, r range 0.26 to 0.36), and alleviation of mood symptoms (r range 0.28 to 0.37) on estrogen replacement therapy. The severity of initial insomnia predicted only one estrogen-induced sleep improvement effect: the more the subjects experienced insomnia, the better the estrogen replacement therapy facilitated falling asleep (r = 0.26, p = 0.040). Estrogen-induced sleep improvement was also reported by the 15 climacterically asymptomatic subjects. In these subjects initial insomnia scores strongly predicted estrogen-induced sleep improvement (r range 0.50 to 0.75).Conclusions: Estrogen replacement therapy significantly diminished sleep complaints among postmenopausal women. Alleviation of climacteric symptoms was the most important predictive factor for the beneficial effect of estrogen replacement therapy on sleep complaints. The use of estrogen replacement therapy in women without self-reported climacteric symptoms could also be considered because women do not always recognize their climacteric symptoms or they ignore them.

AB  - PURPOSE: To survey the prevalence and severity of premenstrual symptoms and compare premenstrual symptom clusters of younger (13-15-year-old) and older (16-18-year-old) adolescents, based on both chronological and gynecological age. METHODS: Physical, emotional, and behavioral premenstrual symptoms were assessed by self-report using the Premenstrual Assessment Form (PAF), in a sample of 75 adolescents. Analyses were performed to determine differences in premenstrual symptom clusters in younger and older adolescents. RESULTS: The participants had a mean age of 14.8; 96% identified themselves as Caucasian, 3% as African-American, and 1% as Asian. All participants reported at least one premenstrual symptom of minimal severity. Many reported symptoms that they considered moderate (88%), severe (73%), or extreme (56%). The symptoms most commonly reported were food cravings, breast swelling, abdominal discomfort, mood swings, stressed feeling, and dissatisfaction with appearance. Other symptoms, such as missing time at school, becoming violent with people or things, and 'thinking of what it would be like to do something to self' (such as crash the car), wishing to go to sleep and not wake up, or having thoughts of death or suicide, were less frequently reported. The younger teens (13-15 years old) had significantly less intense symptoms than the older teens (16-18 years old). CONCLUSIONS: Premenstrual symptoms reported as being moderate or greater in severity were found to be quite prevalent (88%) in this sample of adolescents. Specifically those adolescents at 41 months postmenarche or greater reported specifically more intense premenstrual symptoms. In addition, a subset of adolescents expressed that they experienced aberrant behavior and passive suicidal ideations as premenstrual symptoms.

AB  - Purpose: Clinical reports suggest that many breast cancer patients experience persistent fatigue as a long-term side effect of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. To investigate this issue further, we examined the characteristics and correlates of fatigue in women who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and in a comparison group of women with no history of cancer. Patients and Methods: Participants were 61 women with breast cancer who had completed chemotherapy an average of 471 days previously and 59 women with no history of cancer. All participants completed standardized self-report measures of fatigue, sleep quality, menopausal symptoms, and coping and were administered a structured clinical interview to identify current and past psychiatric disorder. Results: Compared with women with no history of cancer, former adjuvant chemotherapy patients reported more severe fatigue (P < .01) and worse quality of life because of fatigue (P < .05). More severe fatigue among patients was significantly (P < .05) related to poorer sleep quality, more menopausal symptoms, greater use of catastrophizing as a coping strategy, and current presence of a psychiatric disorder. Conclusion: These findings support the view that many breast cancer patients experienced heightened fatigue after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Results yield a profile of women who are at increased risk for heightened fatigue after chemotherapy and suggest ways to intervene clinically to prevent or reduce fatigue in this patient population.

AB  - In primary care and gynecologic settings, midwives will manage the care of women during the perimenopause transition as well as throughout the postmenopausal period. As such, they will need to understand the issues that are at the heart of the debate regarding menopause and aging. This article reviews the endocrinology of menopause, the history of menopause treatment in this century, and the various physical, psychological, and role changes that accompany the developmental processes of menopause. Bleeding pattern changes, hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and genital, skin, and weight changes are discussed. Sexuality, breast, cardiovascular, skeletal, as well as hormone therapy issues are examined. The basics of the midlife health office visit are included.

AB  - The noninflammatory, diffuse pain syndrome recognized as fibromyalgia primarily affects women between puberty and menopause. Symptoms, in addition to musculoskeletal pain and tender points, can include fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, and depression. A precipitating event such as abrupt cessation of exercise, physical injury, or prior debilitating illness can often be identified. Aerobic exercise is usually protective, but sporadic training patterns or other precipitants can place even welltrained athletes at risk. Patients need to know that they can alter the course of this syndrome. Treatment should include attempts to reverse the precipitating event, plus education, aerobic exercise, correction of any sleep disturbance, analgesia, and physical therapy.

AB  - Studies of estrogen effects on growth hormone (GH) and its pulsatile release in postmenopausal women have typically utilized estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) of relatively short duration (days to weeks). The purpose of this study was to compare GH measures from healthy postmenopausal women who were on oral ERT for 3 years or more (n = 24; mean ERT duration = 16.1 years) with women not on ERT (NERT; n = 40). Blood samples were drawn remotely every 20 min for 24 h and then analyzed for mean 24-h GH, mean GH during sleep, and mean 24-h insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). GH peak analyses were also performed. Mean 24-h GH and GH during sleep were significantly higher and IGF-I was significantly lower in ERT women compared with NERT women. In addition, use of long-term ERT was associated with more GH peaks relative to women not on ERT, but no change in GH peak amplitude or area. GH was not related to age in either group. GH was strongly and negatively correlated with measures of adiposity in NERT women but not in ERT women. In conclusion, long-term oral ERT is associated with increased circulating GH and decreased IGF-I levels, even after many years of treatment.

AB  - Melatonin, the primary hormone of the pineal gland, acts as a powerful 'chronobiotic,' maintaining normal circadian rhythms. In patients with sleep disorders and exogenously-generated desynchrony of circadian rhythms such as occurs in jet lag, oral administration of melatonin can provide the necessary resynchronization of those cycles, at dosages ranging from 0.3 to 8 mg. Synthesis of melatonin from the amino acid tryptophan has been shown to be decreased by exposure to magnetic fields and by the aging process. Melatonin also possesses potent free radical scavenging properties and has been recognized as exerting direct inhibition of cancer growth. Various cancer types have been shown to be responsive to oral melatonin (10 to 50 mg daily), including breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and brain metastases due to solid tumors. Melatonin has also been reported to lower total cholesterol and LDL levels in rats, and abnormally low melatonin levels have been theorized to be a factor in multiple sclerosis, sudden infant death syndrome, coronary heart disease, epilepsy, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. These reports, while preliminary, serve to further illustrate the wide range of potential effects exerted by melatonin.

AB  - A random door knock survey was conducted in five metropolitan postcode areas with a high proportion of low-income households to establish: 1. the health problems experienced by women, 2. the problems with which women would have liked more help, and 3. women's perceptions of how their health care experiences might have been improved. In all, 214 women were interviewed. Across all age groups the most common problems were tiredness, premenstrual syndrome, stress, being overweight and disturbed sleep. Premenstrual syndrome, tiredness and arthritis were the most commonly experienced problems among younger, middle-aged and older women respectively. In general, women were satisfied with the help available to them for their health problems, but one in five would have liked more help to cope with stress, and one in six said they would like help to address the issue of quality of medical care. In relation to health care services, suggestions for improvement included the provision of better health information from doctors and other health care professionals, and more opportunities for counselling and self-help. The project findings will be used to influence the development of local policies and services, and will form the focus for local women's health promotion programs.

AB  - Our purpose in conducting this descriptive study was to assess the health-related concerns and experiences of a sample of employed perimenopausal women in Alexandria, Egypt. In addition, we explored their help-seeking behavior and their perception of symptoms. We interviewed two hundred working women ages 40-60 years, 42% of whom were nurses, using a semistructured interview form as well as Koos's list of symptoms. The commonly mentioned concerns, in order of frequency, were chronic headaches, chronic fatigue, transportation and phone communication problems, financial problems, job dissatisfaction, backaches, hypertension, kidney disease and gall bladder disease, gastritis/indigestion, menstrual disturbances, arthritis, AIDS, and hepatitis B. With respect to the problems experienced by the women in the past 6 months, there was a high self-reported prevalence of headaches, fatigue, transportation and communication problems, backaches, job dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction with health insurance, financial problems, menstrual disturbances, gastritis/indigestion, gall bladder disease, anxiety, disturbed sleep, and hypertension. Women attempted to manage their problems mainly by taking over-the-counter drugs and self-prescribing (75.5%), doing nothing or using traditional remedies (56.5%), and going to a doctor or health insurance office (40%). Symptoms perceived by the majority of the women as not needing medical attention included loss of appetite, persistent backache, bleeding gums, chronic fatigue, persistent headaches, and loss of weight. The influence of education and occupation on women's perceptions and practices is discussed.

AB  - Study Design: The development and construction of a specific instrument for measuring quality of life in adolescents with spine deformities was investigated.Objectives: To assess the validity and reliability of the Quality of Life Profile for Spine Deformities.Summary Of Background Data: An 88-item questionnaire was self-administered to 174 patients ranging in age from 10 to 20 years with spine deformities. Items were rated on a five-point Likert scale. Higher scores means high level of impairment in quality of life. Age, gender, menarche or voice change, salient symptoms in the medical record, ordinary parameters on physical examination, and measurements on standard anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were recorded. The retest was done 10 days after the initial administration in a subsample of 35 patients.Methods: The test-retest reliability was analyzed calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was measured with the Cronbach's alpha method. Factor analysis was used to obtain a reduced number of variables. Construct validity was assessed using the principal components model of factor analysis based on the correlation matrix and using the varimax computer algorithm for orthogonal rotation. Discriminant validity was assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test.Results: The Quality of Life Profile for Spine Deformities contained 21 items and five factors in conceptual terms labeled psychosocial functioning, sleep disturbances, back pain, body image, and back flexibility. The overall questionnaire score showed an internal consistency of 0.88 and a test-retest correlation of 0.91. Patients with structural curves showed significantly higher scores in all dimensions of the Quality of Life Profile for Spine Deformities except for the subscale of body image than patients with postural curves. When patients were grouped according to the symptom of back pain, those with backache had a significantly higher quality of life overalls score and scores in the dimensions of sleep disturbances and pain. Brace-treated patients showed statistically significant differences in the quality of life overall score and scores in the dimensions of psychosocial functioning and back flexibility.Conclusions: The instrument developed for measuring quality of life in patients with spine deformities during the period of bone growth has validity, internal consistency, and high test-retest reliability. The conceptualization of quality of life of the Quality of Life Profile for Spine Deformity includes psychosocial dimensions and pain and function.

AB  - A correlational field survey was used to describe sleep disturbance and explore the relationship of that sleep disturbance to the psychological and menopausal status of 23 mid-life women. Subjects were 40–55 years of age and had self- reported sleep problems. Instruments included the sleep disturbance questionnaire (SDQ), Centre for Epidemiologic Studies depression scale (CES-D), Speilberger state-trait anxiety scale (STA1), a demographic form, 4 cc blood sample for follicle stimulating hormone analysis, and a 7-night sleep diary (‘self report of sleep’, or SRS). Ten of the 23 subjects reported periodic limb movement on the SDQ. Sleep diaries (SRS) revealed a characteristic sleep disturbance among 13 of the 23 subjects, which paralleled in some respects the changes in sleep efficiency observed with advancing age, but was more pronounced and was present at an earlier age. There was no statistically significant relationship between sleep disturbance and menopausal status or symptoms, or anxiety and depression among subjects, as shown by correlational coefficient and chi-square statistical tests. Results suggest that a characteristic sleep disorder accompanied by periodic limb movement may be responsible for sleep disturbance in mid-life women. What remains unclear is whether this sleep disturbance is related to aspects of the perimenopause not addressed in this study or to other aspects of ageing.

AB  - A variety of measures can help prevent migraine headaches. Have your patients keep a headache diary, which can help them identify -- and perhaps avoid -- trigger factors such as stress, hormonal fluctuations, and specific foods (those that are fermented, cured, or marinated; Brie, cheddar, and other ripened cheeses; red wine; and chocolate). When possible, women with migraine should avoid estrogen supplements (eg, oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement), which tend to increase the frequency, severity, duration, and complications of migraine. Any measures that relieve stress will also help: these include avoiding bright lights and glare, too much or too little sleep, missed meals, altitude changes, and specific drugs (eg, nitroglycerin, reserpine, indomethacin, hydralazine).

AB  - This study investigated whether the temporal stress of working at night interferes with nurses’ experience of different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty-four, rotating-shift nurses recorded data on a hand-held computer at the start and end of each day and every 2 hours during their shifts for a period of 28 days. The measures included a sleep diary, self-ratings of mood and symptoms, and two cognitive performance tasks. Using a pooled time series analysis, it was found that some of the self-report measures showed a significant interaction between type of shift worked and menstrual cycle phase. For example, alertness was found to be lower towards the end of the night shift during the premenstrual phase compared to other phase and shift combinations. However, some of the measures showed only main effects of cycle phase or were non-significant. Retrospective measures from a larger sample showed an association between the number of nights worked per year and duration of premenstrual and menstrual problems, and severity of premenstrual problems. The results suggest that nightwork may alter some aspects of nurses’ psychological experience of the menstrual cycle.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the various clinical presentations of sleep-disordered breathing in women.Design: A retrospective case-control study.Setting: A sleep disorders clinic.Patients: 334 women, aged 18 years and older, seen between 1988 and 1993, who were diagnosed with upper airway sleep-disordered breathing. Controls were 60 women with insomnia and 100 men with sleep-disordered breathing.Measurements: Clinical, anatomic, and polygraphic information.Results: The mean lag time (+/- SD) in women between the appearance of symptoms and a positive diagnosis was 9.7 +/- 3.1 years; among participants 30 to 60 years of age, the duration of untreated symptoms differed (P < 0.001) between women and men. Sleep-disordered breathing was blamed for divorce or social isolation by 40% of the case patients. Abnormal maxillomandibular features were noted in 45% of the women with disordered breathing. Dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea (which disappeared after treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure) were reported in 43% of premenopausal women compared with 13% of persons in the control group of women with insomnia. Thirty-eight women (11.4%) with upper airway sleep-disordered breathing had a respiratory disturbance index of less than 5 and were significantly younger, had a smaller neck circumference, and had a lower body mass index than women with a respiratory disturbance index of 5 or more.Conclusion: Physicians should revise their understanding of upper airway sleep-disordered breathing so that they notice women with certain craniofacial features, a low body mass index, a small neck circumference, and a respiratory disturbance index of less than 5. These revisions may enable more rapid diagnosis and treatment of women with sleep-disordered breathing.

AB  - The contribution of body fat distribution to sleep-disordered breathing in women has not been examined in detail (to our knowledge). Fifty women under 65 years of age were diagnosed as having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by all-night polysomnography in a 6-month period. Twenty-five women underwent body fat measurements of skin folds and circumferences. The 12 premenopausal and 13 postmenopausal women did not differ in regard to apnea hypopnea index (AHI), SaO2 nadir, body mass index (BMI), or anthropometric measurements. The AHI for these 25 patients was related to the severity of obesity assessed by triceps and subscapular skin folds, the sum of the skin folds, waist circumference, and BMI. The SaO2 nadir correlated with triceps and subscapular skin folds, the sum of the skin folds, and neck skin fold. Clinical features of this same group of 25 women were then compared with those of 45 men with OSA previously described by our laboratory. The women, despite similar age, had less severe OSA than the men (AHI of 34.4 +/- 5.4 vs 51.1 +/- 4.9, p < 0.05). Despite similar BMIs and waist circumference, the men had evidence of a greater degree of upper body obesity with a larger subscapular skin fold thickness, waist-hip ratio, and neck circumference. In addition, for a given degree of upper-body obesity, men had more severe sleep apnea. These findings may explain, at least in part, the greater severity of OSA in the men.

AB  - Rickets, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, and estrogen-related disorders can induce symptoms ranging from muscular weakness and fatigue to osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, fractures, pseudofractures, and neuropathic arthropathy. Patients can often link the onset of disease with a stressful life event. Processes regulated by the central nervous system -- sleep, appetite, libido, and mood -- tend to be disturbed in patients who have rheumatic disease, suggesting a contributing role for neurobiologic mechanisms. Osteoporosis may result from a number of endocrine disorders, such as acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, and hyperparathyroidism. In addition, primary osteoporosis affects 34% of postmenopausal women.

AB  - Blood pressure variability as it relates to the psychological and behavioral correlates of stress may be an important risk factor in the development of hypertension in women as they assume more diverse roles in both the home and the workplace. The physiological stress response in women differs from that in men and may contribute to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality after menopause. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare the effects of management and shift designation on perceived stress and on blood pressure levels during work, home and sleep in healthy normotensive female registered nurses, (2) to examine the effects of suppressed anger, and anxiety coping styles on average work, home, and sleep blood pressure, and (3) to examine the association among lifestyle, psychological, and behavioral factors and their effects on blood pressure variation throughout the day. The relationship between stress covariates and blood pressure change over the day was examined using a natural experimental design and multivariate techniques. Three sample groups, 24 day shift nurses, 18 night shift nurses, and 21 nurse managers were compared. Blood pressure was measured over one workday with the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor. Perceived stress at work and at home was measured by self-report. Anger expression was assessed using Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale. Trait levels of depression, anxiety, and hostility were assessed using Derogatis's Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Anxiety coping styles were assessed using the Taylor Manifest Anxiety and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scales. The results showed that among women of comparable socioeconomical and educational status, managerial versus staff designation had no significant effect on perceived stress and blood pressure variability. However, anxiety coping styles, specifically defensiveness, significantly effected systolic and diastolic blood pressure at work and at home. Furthermore, being married, having children, and keeping anger in rather than expressing it predicted greater changes in blood pressure between work and home and home and sleep conditions. These data suggest that stress among working women associated with repressed anxiety and suppressed anger coping combined with the responsibilities of managing home and work demands may have a detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system.

AB  - The lower limit of the prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) was estimated among women 40 to 59 years old by a two-stage procedure. In the first stage 2,016 questionnaires were mailed. The response rate was 75.6 percent. Daytime sleepiness was reported by 8.2 percent, habitual snoring by 11.2 percent, and intermittent snoring by 21.7 percent. There were altogether 128 women described with systemic hypertension and these women were more than twice as often habitual snorers. Logistic multiple regression analyses showed almost a threefold increase in the predicted prevalence of hypertension among intermittent and habitual snorers compared with nonsnorers in the age group 40 to 49 years old and a 60 percent increase in the 50- to 59-year-old age group. In the second stage, a group of 97 women highly suspected of SAS were selected because of their habitual snoring and daytime sleepiness. Eventually, 35 of these came for night studies and 14 were found to have SAS. Among the 35 women, 12 were hypertensive and nine of these had SAS. We estimated the lower limit of the prevalence of SAS to be 2.5 percent for women 40 to 59 years old. It is concluded that SAS is a relatively common occurrence among women, especially postmenopausal ones, and it is strongly related to hypertension.

AB  - In a cross-sectional epidemiological study of headache disorders information on precipitating factors, age at onset, influence of menstruation and pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives was collected. The presence of migraine and tension-type headache was ascertained by a clinical interview and examination using the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society. The prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was also analysed in relation to variables of lifestyle: physical activity, smoking, consumption of coffee, alcohol intake and sleep pattern. In both migraine and tension-type headache, the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental tension. Other common precipitants were alcohol, weather changes and menstruation. Disappearance or substantial improvement of the headache during pregnancy was more frequent in migraineurs than in tension-type headache sufferers. The age at onset of both migraine and tension-type headache differs between men and women. Female hormones may be an important factor responsible for the sex difference of headache disorders. The level of physical activity showed no association with migraine, but a significantly higher prevalence of tension-type headache in men with exclusively sedentary activity emerged. Smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption showed no significant associations with the headache disorders. Sleep pattern was significantly associated with migraine and tension-type headache in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, migraine and tension-type headache seem to be different with regard to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors.

AB  - Objective: Because parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone resorption, resistance to its actions might help maintain bone mass. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of estrogen on bone are accomplished in part by decreasing the sensitivity of the skeleton to the resorbing effects of PTH.Study Design: Comparison of response to PTH infusion in untreated and estrogen-treated postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.Intervention: (1-34) human PTH, 0.55 U/(kg.h), was infused intravenously over 20 hours.Setting: The inpatient clinical research unit of a referral hospital.Patients: Women with primary postmenopausal osteoporosis who were untreated (n = 15) or treated with estrogen (n = 17).Main Outcome Measures: Skeletal turnover indices including hydroxyproline, deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, bone Gla protein, and insulin-like growth factor-1.Results: All basal indices were higher in untreated than in estrogen-treated women, but statistical differences were seen only for deoxypyridinoline and pyridinoline. During the 20-hour infusion, hydroxyproline/creatinine increased 0.023 mumol/mumol in untreated women but only 0.010 mumol/mumol in estrogen-treated women (P < 0.05). Corresponding changes for deoxypyridinoline/creatinine were 14.6 mumol/mumol and 3.5 mumol/mumol (P = 0.06). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and pyridinoline increased only in untreated group. A circadian rhythm in circulating bone Gla protein was seen in both groups without clear PTH-induced effects or differences between groups. Alkaline phosphatase levels decreased and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels increased in both groups with no distinction between untreated and estrogen-treated women [corrected].Conclusion: The estrogenized postmenopausal osteoporotic skeleton is less sensitive to the bone resorbing effects of acutely administered PTH. There are no differential effects on bone formation.

AB  - In the United States, over 100,000 women receive chemotherapy for breast cancer each year. This treatment is administered primarily on an outpatient basis, leaving women to manage the experience and side effects on their own. Although incidence and severity of chemotherapy side effects have been researched, less is known about the distress associated with treatment. The purpose of this study was to describe, from a woman's perspective, experience with breast cancer chemotherapy, associated side effects and resultant distress. Twenty women participated in unstructured interviews and completed the Adapted Symptom Distress Scale (ASDS) - Form 2 (Rhodes, Watson & Johnson, 1984). Interviews were analyzed using the grounded theory method (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Women clustered into three groups based on the focus they placed on the chemotherapy experience in their lives: centralized, integrated or segmented. Within each focus group, women adopted either a direct or indirect control style to manage the challenges which arose during the four temporal phases of the course (discovery, setting the course, the long haul and moving on). Often, management strategies used by women in different cluster groups were very similar, however unique distinctions were also identified. Chronbach's alpha for the ASDS ranged from 0.873 to 0.734 for the total symptom experience, total symptom distress, and total symptom occurrence subscales. The most common side effects were changes in appearance, temperature and bowel movements changes and fatigue. The most distressing effects were difficulty sleeping, nausea, fatigue and temperature change. Several of these effects reflect the marked impact of chemotherapy-induced menopause in the relatively young sample (X = 47). Since an estimated 30% of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer are premenopausal, these findings represent an important area which has not yet been researched. Comparisons between quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated several side effects and areas of distress present in the interviews but not measured by the instrument. In addition, design and administration difficulties were found with the ASDS. Suggestions for future research include examination of sleep disturbances, impact of chemotherapy on premenopausal women, culturally diverse populations and better quantitative measures of chemotherapy distress.

AB  - Menopause and the preceding climacteric years are normal aspects of the reproductive life cycle in women. However, the fluctuations and declines in hormone levels are physiologic changes that may have a significant impact on perimenopausal mood changes. These observations are based on both clinical experience with perimenopausal women and recent neuroendocrine research that describes hormone effects on central nervous system neurotransmitters regulating mood, sleep, and behavior. In particular, both estrogen and progesterone have profound effects on the serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and endorphin receptor systems that are involved in mood regulation. This chapter discusses these correlations, describes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment approaches, and recommends directions for needed research.

AB  - Over a million nursing personnel were employed in hospitals in 1985. Registered nurses comprised 60% of this group. They also comprise a major proportion of shift workers in this country. As such, they are a target for the biological, medical and social problems which occur with shift work and which are a result of the disruption of rhythms causing alterations in sleep, fatigue and performance. Little work has been done documenting the effect of shift work on the human menstrual cycle. This cross-section study was conducted in order to examine the menstrual characteristics of nurses who work rotating shifts and fixed shifts in a large hospital. Questionnaire information was obtained from 146 nurses working on in-patient units in the hospital. A subset of these respondents (n = 98) submitted calendar recordings for three successive menstrual periods. These provided a record of menstrual length, menstrual duration, menstrual flow, pain experienced with periods and intermenstrual bleeding. Information was obtained from the hospital on unity acuity and schedules of nurses submitting calendars. These were used to derive a workload indicator for each subject during the study period. In the questionnaire population, shift had no effect on any of the three outcomes of length, duration and flow. Age was found to be associated with menstrual flow (OR = 1.17). Smoking was weakly associated with length and body size with menstrual duration. For the respondents submitting calendar records, ethnicity was a predictor for menstrual length when both oral contraceptive users were included or removed from the analysis. Menstrual lengths decreased in non-whites. Oral contraceptive users were found to have decreased menstrual durations. Age, children 13-17 years of age in the household and smoking were associated with increased flow as measured by the number of pads used on heaviest bleeding days. The severity of dysmenorrhea decreased with age. No effects due to shift were seen in the analysis.

AB  - Among 118 patients with occlusive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), defined as daytime hypersomnolence and an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) greater than ten events/h, 41 women were compared with 77 men. Body mass index, spirometric study, PaO2, PaCO2, and results from nocturnal polysomnography were examined in a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the effects of sex, age group, and a sex-age group interaction. The age groups examined were above and below 42 years, the breakpoint for menopause in the women. Younger persons tended to be more obese and to have a higher AHI. Both sexes had similar pulmonary function, AHI, and nocturnal desaturation, but women experienced significantly fewer completely occluded breathing events and had apneas of shorter mean and maximum duration than men of similar ages. No effect of menopausal status per se was observed. In OSA patients, differences in upper airway occlusion and apnea duration suggest differences between the sexes in upper airway physiology or respiratory control.

AB  - Twenty-seven women referred to a sleep disorders clinic for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) during one year were systematically analyzed after polygraphic monitoring of sleep and cephalometric x-ray examination. Our subjects, one-third of whom were premenopausal, comprised approximately 12 percent of the total OSAS population seen. Women with OSAS were compared with 110 OSAS men and with a group of 16 women without OSAS but referred to orthodontists for mild dental malocclusion. Women with OSAS were massively obese, much more so than their male counterparts. There was no significant difference between pre- and postmenopausal women, with the exception of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), which was lower in the postmenopausal group despite similar morbid obesity (seemingly better tolerated by women with OSAS than by men with the same syndrome) and long mandibular plane-hyoid bone distance. The significantly higher RDI noted in premenopausal women, despite equally massive obesity and upper airway abnormalities, is thought to be related to hormonal status and better arousal response. Chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) seen in a subgroup of women with OSAS did not differentiate this subgroup from the other OSAS patients when oxygen saturation during sleep, frequency of abnormal respiratory events and sleep variables were considered. Massive obesity is the dominant factor for the appearance of OSAS in women.

AB  - Because obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is unusual in premenopausal women, we describe ten women with this syndrome and compare them to 13 postmenopausal women and with 32 men with OSA. Two premenopausal women had structural abnormalities of their pharynx, and the remaining eight were significantly more obese than men with OSA. In these eight patients, there was no relationship between pulse flow resistance and the degree of OSA in contrast to significant relationships in postmenopausal women, and men. Hypercapnia occurred in three premenopausal women, no postmenopausal women and in two men. We conclude that premenopausal women with OSA are more likely than men and postmenopausal women to have structural abnormalities of their upper airway, to be extremely obese, and to be hypercapneic, and that OSA occurs in them independent of their upper airway dimensions.

AB  - Eighteen asymptomatic postmenopausal women volunteered to ingest 2 ml of 100-proof vodka per kg of body weight in orange juice on one night and a placebo on another. Overnight sleep monitoring was performed immediately thereafter. Alcohol ingestion caused reduction in total sleep time from 329 to 281 minutes and a decrease in rapid eye movement sleep. There was no difference from placebo in the number of episodes of apnea or hypopnea, or in the frequency, length, or severity of oxygen desaturation. In contrast to the effects of alcohol ingestion in men, the effects on breathing and oxygenation are minimal during the sleep of women if this amount of alcohol is ingested.

AB  - A 32-year-old women with no evidence of anorexia nervosa lost 20 pounds following a self-imposed diet and developed secondary amenorrhea. On two separate occasions, 24-hour plasma sampling at 20-minute intervals the monitoring of nocturnal sleep revealed a "pubertal" pattern of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, i.e., sleep-related enhancement of LH. After she regained 15 pounds, the "pubertal" pattern reverted to the typical of adults in which there is no significant difference in LH secretion between average sleep and waking values. One month following the last study, normal menses began. These data demonstrate that weight loss or the metabolic factors associated with nutritional changes, in the absence of anorexia nervosa, may be associated with amenorrhea and reversion to the "pubertal" pattern of LH secretion, which can return to normal following weight gain.
