TI  - Pregnant women with gestational hypertension may have a high frequency of sleep
      disordered breathing.
PG  - 1033-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy.
      Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high
      rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography,
      we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension
      compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: In this
      single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational
      hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward.
      Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series
      of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by
      full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as 
      a respiratory disturbance index >/= 5) in the gestational hypertension and
      healthy groups. RESULTS: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and
      singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton
      pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational 
      ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The
      frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the
      healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Women
      with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB
      than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. 
      The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be
      determined.

TI  - Study of wheezing and its risk factors in the first year of life in the Province 
      of Salamanca, Spain. The EISL Study.
PG  - 164-71

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of wheezing and its associated risk
      factors in infants in the first year of life in the province of Salamanca, Spain.
      METHODS: A multicentre, cross-sectional, descriptive epidemiological study was
      designed to evaluate a representative sample of 750 infants in the first year of 
      life, born in the province of Salamanca between 1 June 2008 and 30 September
      2009. The study was based on a previously validated and standardised written
      questionnaire administered among the parents of those children seen for control
      at 12 months of age in any of the Primary Care centres in the province of
      Salamanca. RESULTS: The recorded wheezing rate was 32.3%. Feeding and sleep were 
      seen to be affected in 46.3% and 80.9% of the wheezing children, respectively,
      and parent activity was also altered in 39.3% of the cases. A relationship was
      found between wheezing and nursery attendance (OR: 1.66, 95% confidence interval 
      [1.19-2.31]); weight at birth >3500 g (OR: 1.45 [1.02-2.06]); the presence of
      eczema at this age (OR: 2.72 [1.75-4.24]); exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months 
      (OR: 1.33 [0.98-1.81]); and maternal smoking during the last three months of
      pregnancy (OR: 1.60 [0.96-2.68]). The prevalence of recurrent wheezing (defined
      as three or more episodes) was 11.9%. Significant differences were observed with 
      respect to nursery attendance (OR: 1.71 [1.08-2.72]), the presence of eczema at
      this age (OR: 2.55 [1.48-4.42]), a history of maternal asthma (OR: 2.19
      [1.08-4.44]) and exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months (OR: 1.53 [0.98-2.38]).
      CONCLUSIONS: In the province of Salamanca, one third of the infants studied
      suffered wheezing in the first year of life. Infants exclusively breastfed for
      less than three months; attending a nursery; having suffered eczema; or with an
      asthmatic mother showed significantly more wheezing than the rest. Wheezing
      proved recurrent in 11.9% of the cases.

TI  - Clomipramine concentration and withdrawal symptoms in 10 neonates.
PG  - 295-302
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.04072.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: After in utero exposure to tricyclic antidepressants, neonatal withdrawal
      symptoms have been reported with an estimated incidence between 20 and 50%;
      however, few data are available for clomipramine. This could also be the case for
      neonatal pharmacokinetic clomipramine parameters and so this study was set up.
      METHODS: Babies exposed to clomipramine in utero were included in an
      observational study, approved by the local ethics committee, after written
      informed consent. Withdrawal symptoms were scored at 12, 24 and 48 h after birth 
      using the Finnegan score. Plasma concentrations were determined using an
      in-house-developed, validated liquid chromatography with mass detection (LC-MSMS)
      method at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h after birth. RESULTS: We found that three of 11
      pregnancies were complicated with pre-eclampsia. Ten neonates were observed for
      clomipramine withdrawal symptoms. The observed withdrawal symptoms were too short
      a period of sleep after feeding (6), poor feeding (3), mild to severe tremors
      (6), hyperactive Moro reflex (3) and respiratory rate >60 breaths min(-1).
      Serious withdrawal reactions, such as tachycardia and cyanosis, were seen. We
      calculated a half-life value of 42 +/- 16 h for clomipramine in neonates. Only a 
      weak correlation was found between withdrawal reactions and clomipramine plasma
      concentration or desmethylclomipramine plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: In
      neonates, clomipramine is eliminated with a half-life value of 42 h, compared
      with 20 h in adults. In two of 10 neonates, tachycardia and cyanosis were seen as
      serious withdrawal symptoms after maternal use of clomipramine.

      potential moderators.
PG  - 567-74
LID - 10.1016/j.ntt.2011.07.004 [doi]
AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to examine pathways from prenatal cigarette
      exposure to physiological regulation at 2 months of age. Specifically, we
      explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure
      and infant physiological regulation was moderated by fetal growth, prenatal or
      postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or maternal depressive
      symptomatology during pregnancy. We evaluated whether exposed infants who were
      also exposed to ETS after birth, were small for gestational age (SGA) or had
      mothers with higher depressive symptoms during pregnancy had the highest levels
      of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained
      from 234 (166 exposed and 68 nonexposed) infants during sleep. As expected,
      cigarette-exposed infants had significantly lower RSA than nonexposed infants.
      This association was not moderated by prenatal or postnatal ETS exposure, or
      maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. However, small for
      gestational age status did moderate this association such that nonexposed infants
      who were not small for gestational age had a significantly higher RSA than
      nonexposed small for gestational age infants and exposed infants. These findings 
      provide additional evidence that prenatal cigarette exposure is directly
      associated with dysregulation during infancy.

PG  - 123-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the success rate of adding continuous electronic
      fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) during full night polysomnography (PSG), in
      women with both gestational hypertension (GH) with uncomplicated singleton
      pregnancies. METHOD: As part of a larger study evaluating for the presence of
      sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in women with GH compared to women with
      uncomplicated pregnancies, continuous EFM was added to usual polysomnography.
      RESULTS: Forty-eight EFM studies (26 with GH and 22 with uncomplicated
      pregnancies) were evaluated. EFM studies were categorized by the percentage of
      time that interpretable tracings were obtained: < 25% of the time; 25-50% of the 
      time; or > 50% of the time. We deemed > 50% of the time to be ideal, but under
      the test conditions 25-50% of the time to be acceptable. For women with GH, 71%
      of women had ideal or acceptable overnight EFM tracings compared to 82% for women
      with uncomplicated pregnancies. Of those women who were diagnosed with SDB, 77%
      had an acceptable or ideal EFM tracing. CONCLUSIONS: Adding EFM to conventional
      polysomnography is feasible and safe. It may prove an important adjunct as
      interest in sleep disorders of pregnancy continues to expand.

TI  - Shift work and pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review with meta-analysis of
      currently available epidemiological studies.
PG  - 1429-37
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03066.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Varying work schedules are suspected of increasing risks to pregnant 
      women and to fetal wellbeing. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance
      arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm disruption might impair fetal 
      growth or lead to complications of pregnancy. Two independent meta-analyses (from
      2000 to 2007) reported a small adverse effect of shift work on the risk of
      preterm delivery (PTD). However, these reviews were based on few high-quality
      studies. OBJECTIVES: To provide an updated review of the associations of shift
      work with PTD, low birthweight (LBW), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and
      pre-eclampsia. SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA: We conducted a systematic 
      search of MEDLINE using combinations of keywords and MeSH terms. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: For each relevant paper we abstracted standard details, used to
      summarise design features and rate methodological quality. We calculated pooled
      estimates of relative risk (RR) in random-effect meta-analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      retrieved 23 relevant studies. The pooled estimate of RR for PTD was 1.16 (95% CI
      1.00-1.33, 16 studies), but when five reports of poorer methodological quality
      were excluded, the estimated RR decreased to 1.03 (95% CI 0.93-1.14). We also
      observed increased RRs for LBW (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.74) and for SGA (RR 1.12, 
      95% CI 1.03-1.22), which varied little by study quality. Little evidence was
      found on pre-eclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that overall, any
      risk of PTD, LBW, or SGA arising from shift work in pregnancy is small.

TI  - Circadian aspects of mammalian parturition: a review.
PG  - 62-7
LID - 10.1016/j.mce.2011.06.041 [doi]
AB  - The identification of circadian clocks in endocrine tissues has added
      considerable depth and complexity to our understanding of their physiology. A
      growing body of research reveals circadian clock gene expression in the uterus of
      non-pregnant and pregnant rodents. This review will focus on the mammalian uterus
      and its rhythmicity, particularly as it pertains to the circadian timing of
      parturition. This key event in the reproductive axis shows dramatic
      species-specific differences in its circadian phase. It is proposed here that
      these differences in the phasing of mammalian parturition are likely a function
      of opposite uterine cell responses to humoral cues. The argument will be made
      that melatonin fulfills many of the criteria to serve as a circadian signal in
      the initiation of human parturition, including specific actions on uterine smooth
      muscle cells that are consistent with a role for this hormone in the circadian
      timing of parturition.

AB  - Functional impairment of the adult brain can result from deficits in the ontogeny
      of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Gene defects underlying autism spectrum
      disorders, Rett's syndrome or some forms of epilepsy, but also a diverse set of
      syndromes accompanying perinatal trauma, hormonal imbalances, intake of
      sleep-inducing or mood-improving drugs or, quite common, alcohol intake during
      pregnancy can alter GABA signaling early in life. The search for therapeutically 
      relevant endogenous molecules or exogenous compounds able to alleviate the
      consequences of dysfunction of GABAergic transmission in the embryonic or
      postnatal brain requires a clear understanding of its site- and state-dependent
      development. At the level of single synapses, it is necessary to discriminate
      between presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations, and to define parameters that
      can be regarded as both suitable and accessible for the quantification of
      developmental changes. Here we focus on the performance of GABAergic synapses in 
      two brain structures, the hippocampus and the superior colliculus, describe some 
      novel aspects of neurotrophin effects during the development of GABAergic
      synaptic transmission and examine the applicability of the following rules: (1)
      synaptic transmission starts with GABA, (2) nascent/immature GABAergic synapses
      operate in a ballistic mode (multivesicular release), (3) immature synaptic
      terminals release vesicles with higher probability than mature synapses, (4)
      immature GABAergic synapses are prone to paired pulse and tetanic depression, (5)
      synapse maturation is characterized by an increasing dominance of synchronous
      over asynchronous release, (6) in immature neurons GABA acts as a depolarizing
      transmitter, (7) synapse maturation implies inhibitory postsynaptic current
      shortening due to an increase in alpha1 subunit expression, (8) extrasynaptic
      (tonic) conductances can inhibit the development of synaptic (phasic) GABA
      actions.

TI  - Circadian variation in placental and hepatic clock genes in rat pregnancy.
PG  - 3552-60
LID - 10.1210/en.2011-0081 [doi]
AB  - Clock genes drive circadian rhythms in a range of physiological processes both
      centrally and in peripheral tissues such as the liver. The aims of this study
      were to determine whether the two functionally-distinct zones of the rat placenta
      (junctional and labyrinth) differentially express clock genes and, if so, whether
      these exhibit circadian patterns. Rats were sampled from d 21 of pregnancy (term 
      = d 23) and from diestrus I of the estrous cycle. Adult liver (all animals),
      fetal liver, and placental zones (pregnant animals) were collected at 0800, 1400,
      2000, and 0200 h. Both zones of the rat placenta expressed all seven canonical
      clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2), but there were
      marked zonal differences and, unlike in maternal liver, circadian variation in
      placenta was limited. Similarly, placental expression of Vegf varied with zone
      but not time of day. Pregnancy also led to marked changes in hepatic clock gene
      expression, with peak levels of Per1, Cry1, and Cry2 all reduced, Per3 increased,
      and circadian variation in Clock expression lost. All clock genes were expressed 
      in fetal liver, but there was less circadian variation than in maternal liver.
      Similarly, fetal corticosterone levels remained stable across the day, whereas
      maternal corticosterone showed clear circadian variation. In conclusion, our data
      show that the rat placenta expresses all canonical clock genes in a highly
      zone-specific manner but with relatively little circadian variation. Moreover,
      pregnancy alters the expression and circadian variation of clock genes in
      maternal liver, possibly contributing to maternal physiological adaptations.

      inadequate weight gain during pregnancy: a cohort study.
PG  - 734-40
LID - 10.1111/j.1447-0756.2010.01421.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine the possible risk factors for inadequate gestational weight
      gain. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was carried out in Sri Lanka from 
      May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks'
      gestation and followed up until delivery; the sample size was 710.
      Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were
      gathered on average at the 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. Maternal
      weight was measured at the first antenatal clinic visit and at delivery.
      Inadequate weight gain was defined as weight gain below the Institute of Medicine
      recommendations in 2009. Multiple logistic regression was applied and the results
      were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
      RESULTS: The risk factors for inadequate weight gain were low per-capita monthly 
      income (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03, 2.58), multiparity (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.34, 2.87),
      sleeping <8 h/day during the second, third, or both second and third trimesters
      (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05, 2.46), standing and walking >/=5 h/day during the second
      trimester (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.15), and the newborn being of the male sex (OR
      1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.16), controlling for the effect of body mass index and
      gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain
      were low income, being multiparous, sleep deprivation, physical activity in terms
      of standing and walking, and the male sex of baby.

TI  - Yearning, learning, and conceding: reasons men and women change their
      childbearing intentions.
PG  - 89-123
AB  - People's childbearing intentions change over the course of their reproductive
      lives. These changes have been conceptualized as occurring in response to the
      realization that an individual is unlikely to achieve his or her intended
      fertility, because of constraints such as the "biological clock" or lack of a
      partner. In this article, we find that changes to child-bearing plans are
      influenced by a much wider range of factors than this. People change their plans 
      in response to the wishes of their partners, in response to social norms, as the 
      result of repartnering, and as the result of learning about the costs and
      benefits of parenthood; there are also differences between the factors that
      influence men's and women's decision-making. In a departure from existing studies
      in this area, we use a flexible analytical framework that enables us to analyze
      increases in planned fertility separately from decreases. This allows us to
      uncover several complexities of the decision-making process that would otherwise 
      be hidden, and leads us to conclude that the determinants of increases in planned
      fertility are not simply equal and opposite to the determinants of decreases.

      restriction.
PG  - 738-44
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31822546fd [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, women are at particular risk for sleep deprivation 
      and snoring because of the physiologic and hormonal changes of pregnancy. There
      is limited evidence for the association between sleep patterns in pregnancy and
      adverse birth outcomes. We examined the association of sleep duration and snoring
      in late pregnancy with the risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction.
      METHODS: We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort "Rhea" study in
      Crete, Greece 2007-2009. The analysis included 1091 women with singleton
      pregnancies, providing complete data on sleeping habits at the third trimester of
      gestation and birth outcomes. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customized 
      model, and multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to adjust for
      confounders. RESULTS: Women with severe snoring were at high risk for low birth
      weight (relative risk = 2.6 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.4]), and
      fetal-growth-restricted neonates (2.0 [1.0-3.9]) after adjusting for maternal
      age, education, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI).
      Women with sleep deprivation (</=5 hours sleep) were at high risk for preterm
      births (1.7 [1.1-2.8]), with the highest risk observed for medically indicated
      preterm births (2.4 [1.0-6.4]) after adjusting for maternal age, education,
      parity, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings suggest that women with severe snoring in late pregnancy have a higher
      risk for fetal-growth-restricted neonates; and women with sleep deprivation have 
      a higher risk for preterm births. The mechanisms underlying these associations
      remain unclear.

TI  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: a case report.
PG  - 167-72
LID - 10.1097/ANC.0b013e31821cfe26 [doi]
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a relatively rare,
      life-threatening, and lifelong multisystem disorder characterized by autonomic
      nervous system dysfunction, which mostly manifests as failure to maintain
      ventilatory homeostasis during sleep. Infants with CCHS have inadequate
      sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep and in some cases during
      wakefulness, leading to persistent apnea. This article reports a case of CCHS in 
      a 38-week-gestation infant who presented on day of life 2 with persistent apnea. 
      Diagnosis of primary pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neurologic disease, or injury
      was excluded before the diagnosis of CCHS was made. The diagnosis was confirmed
      by a PHOX2B sequence analysis. A tracheotomy was performed and the infant was
      discharged home on a home ventilator with outpatient follow-up. The clinical
      presentation of CCHS, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies, is reviewed.

TI  - Gestational lead exposure selectively decreases retinal dopamine amacrine cells
      and dopamine content in adult mice.

AB  - Gestational lead exposure (GLE) produces supernormal scotopic electroretinograms 
      (ERG) in children, monkeys and rats, and a novel retinal phenotype characterized 
      by an increased number of rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells in adult mice and 
      rats. Since the loss of dopaminergic amacrine cells (DA ACs) in GLE monkeys and
      rats contributes to supernormal ERGs, the retinal DA system was analyzed in mice 
      following GLE. C57BL/6 female mice were exposed to low (27 ppm), moderate (55
      ppm) or high (109 ppm) lead throughout gestation and until postnatal day 10
      (PN10). Blood [Pb] in control, low-, moderate- and high-dose GLE was </= 1, </=
      10, ~25 and ~40 mug/dL, respectively, on PN10 and by PN30 all were </= 1 mug/dL. 
      At PN60, confocal-stereology studies used vertical sections and wholemounts to
      characterize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the number of DA and other 
      ACs. GLE dose-dependently and selectively decreased the number of
      TH-immunoreactive (IR) DA ACs and their synaptic plexus without affecting
      GABAergic, glycinergic or cholinergic ACs. Immunoblots and confocal revealed
      dose-dependent decreases in retinal TH protein expression and content, although
      monoamine oxidase-A protein and gene expression were unchanged. High-pressure
      liquid chromatography showed that GLE dose-dependently decreased retinal DA
      content, its metabolites and DA utilization/release. The mechanism of DA
      selective vulnerability is unknown. However, a GLE-induced loss/dysfunction of DA
      ACs during development could increase the number of rods and bipolar cells since 
      DA helps regulate neuronal proliferation, whereas during adulthood it could
      produce ERG supernormality as well as altered circadian rhythms, dark/light
      adaptation and spatial contrast sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a gap in the knowledge of longterm outcome of mild to
      moderate prematures compared to the extreme prematures or very low birth weight
      infants. AIM: Determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of 
      emotional and behavioral problems in (pre-)school age children born at 32 to 36
      weeks' gestation. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cohort study in a non-Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatment and social
      economic status (SES) were analyzed. Study tools were the TNO-AZL Preschool
      Quality of Life (TAPQoL) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). SUBJECTS: 362
      children born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation who had a follow-up evaluation
      at 2-5 years of age. OUTCOME MEASURE: Health-related quality of life and the
      occurrence of emotional and behavioral problems. RESULTS: Main characteristics
      (mean+/-SD) were: gestation 34.7+/-1 weeks and birth weight 2360+/-444 g. Most
      families were two-parent middle-class households with parents employed at their
      educational level. Questionnaire response rate was 62.7%. The 12-item TAPQoL
      showed significantly lower scores for stomach and liveliness, while scores for
      behavior, communication and sleep were significantly higher compared to the
      general population. The TAPQoL subscale score for lung problems was significantly
      lower for children who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
      CBCL scores were within the validated normal range although the study-population 
      scored higher on emotionally reactive, somatic complaints and attention problems 
      compared to their full-term peers. CONCLUSION: Children born at 32 to 36 weeks'
      gestational age do not experience an overall lower HR-QoL at 2 to 5 years of age.
      CPAP results in lower HRQoL scores for lung problems. The overall occurrence of
      behavioral and emotional problems does not differ from the general term-born
      pediatric population. Several subitems need further attention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep
      practices in pregnant women are associated with risk of late stillbirth. DESIGN: 
      Prospective population based case-control study. SETTING: Auckland, New Zealand
      PARTICIPANTS: CASES: 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (>/= 28 weeks'
      gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009
      and booked to deliver in Auckland. CONTROLS: 310 women with single ongoing
      pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred.
      Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth 
      sleepiness scale), and sleep position at the time of going to sleep and on waking
      (left side, right side, back, and other). RESULTS: The prevalence of late
      stillbirth in this study was 3.09/1000 births. No relation was found between
      snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who
      slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before
      stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth
      compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back
      sleeping 2.54 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.18), and for right side sleeping 1.74 (0.98 to
      3.01)). The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their
      left was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their
      left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were
      more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who got up more
      frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2.28 (1.40 to 3.71)). Women who regularly slept
      during the day in the previous month were also more likely to experience a late
      stillbirth than those who did not (2.04 (1.26 to 3.27)). CONCLUSIONS: This is the
      first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for
      stillbirth, and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies.

TI  - Coexistance of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis and Dandy Walker malformation in
      newborn.
PG  - 303-7
AB  - Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in neonatal period may cause neurological
      impairment, epilepsy, and lead to stroke. It is caused primarily by coagulopathy 
      of numerous reasons, occasionally perinatal asphyxia, traumatic delivery and
      hyperhomocysteinemia. Dandy-Walker malformation is characterized by agenesis or
      hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle,
      and enlargement of the posterior fossa. Dandy-Walker malformation, variant, and
      mega cisterna magna represent a spectrum of developmental anomalies. Insults to
      developing cerebellar hemispheres and the fourth ventricle are believed to be the
      cause of malformation. Our patient was born from noncomplicated pregnancy,
      noncomplicated nontraumatic vaginal delivery at term, excellent Apgar scores,
      without peculiarities in clinical status. She was brest-fed by the 42nd hour of
      life when she had rightsided seizures during sleep that repeated for five times
      in next 24 hours. Brain Ultrasound (US) revealed clot in left lateral ventricle, 
      slight dilatation of left ventricle, both sided periventricular echodensity,
      ischemia, slight enlargement of forth ventricle and a bit smaller cerebellum.
      There was no visible flow through left transverse, superior sagittal and straight
      sinus. Magnetic Resonance (MRI) confirmed the finding and showed thrombosis of
      left and right transverse venous sinuses and confluence of sinuses.
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed leftsided focal changes. The newborn was
      treated with phenobarbiton for 8 days and had no convulsions during that period. 
      All coagulation parameters, homocistein, lipoproteins (a) and D-dimers were
      normal. There were no mutations on FV R506Q, PT 20210A, MTHFR 677C/T. No
      antiphospholipides were found. Heart US showed no structural anomalies. No other 
      patology or risk factors were present at the time. Before discharge, US showed
      hydrocephalus. Flow in affected sinuses was visible with color Doppler. MRI
      showed recanalization of affected sinuses, also hydrocephalus and presentation of
      Dandy Walker On EEG there was borderline finding. Due to progression of
      hydrocephalus ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed. In age of 1 year EEG was
      slower for age but without focus. Neurological development was normal for age.
      The question is whether this child had intrauterine insult and inception of Dandy
      Walker with further postnatal progress of thrombosis and evolution to full
      picture of Dandy Walker with hydrocephalus OR thrombosis that led to development 
      of hydrocephalus and Dandy Walker malformation in this child were accidental
      coexistance.

TI  - EEG polysomnographic study of maturational differences between twins.
PG  - 271-4
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study is to asses the effects of multiple pregnancies
      on the maturation of the developing brain using the polysomnographic EEG
      recordings. Data from prospectively recorded 10 twin sets, born prematurely (mean
      36 gestational week; range 33 - 38 GW) in the Split University Hospital Center,
      were analysed. We compared sleep architecture parameters in the twins at 37h and 
      44th postmenstrual age (PMA) with parameters that were expected at that PMA. The 
      same parameters were compared within each twin pair using the Man Whitne test. At
      first measurement indeterminate sleep (IS) proportion was greater in the first
      twin than in the second one. The IS sleep proportion was 1.6 fold greater in the 
      first twin (p=0.028), and 1,8 fold less percentage of quite sleep (QS) than the
      second twin (p=0.054). The length of sleep stages among the twins was similar at 
      the second measurement. Measures of sleep architecture were not significantly
      different within the twins in second recording. The results of this study
      obtained on a relatively small number of twins (longer IS and shorter QS in the
      first twin at the 38th week recordings), showed that the maturational differences
      among twins exist in utero and shortly after birth, and then disappear until the 
      end of the first month of the postnatal life.

AB  - Maternal treatment with synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone
      (DEX)significantly reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its effects on
      the fetal brain remain unclear. In this study we evaluated the effects of DEX on 
      EEG activity in preterm fetal sheep. Ewes at 103 days gestation received two
      intramuscular injections of DEX (12 mg, n = 8) or saline vehicle (n = 7) 24 h
      apart. Fetal EEG activity was recorded from 6 h before until 120 h after the
      first injection (DEX-1). DEX-1 was associated with a marked transient rise in
      total EEG power, maximal at 12 h (P < 0.001), with a relative increase in delta
      and reduced theta, alpha and beta activity, resolving by 24 h. Continuous EEG
      records showed a shift to larger but less frequent transient waveforms (P <
      0.001). Unexpectedly, evolving epileptiform activity, consistent with
      electrographic and clinical seizures, developed from 178 +/- 44 min after
      DEX-1.Similar but smaller changes were seen after the second injection. Following
      the injections, total power returned to control values, but the proportion of
      alpha activity progressively increased vs. controls (P < 0.001), with reduced
      interburst interval duration and number (P < 0.001). No histological neural
      injury or microglial activation was seen. In summary, exposure to maternal
      dexamethasone was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity 
      on fetal cortical EEG recordings, followed by sustained changes consistent with
      maturation of fetal sleep architecture. We postulate that these effects may
      contribute to improved neonatal outcomes.

TI  - The validity of DSM symptoms for depression and anxiety disorders during
      pregnancy.
PG  - 546-52
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2011.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and
      anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal 
      period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the
      physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). METHOD: 
      118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a
      telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI 
      diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman
      whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy
      or due to her mood or worries. RESULTS: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria
      for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due
      to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer
      meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted
      in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety 
      disorders appears to be less. LIMITATIONS: An important issue is whether women's 
      attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their
      responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it
      would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional
      probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood,
      such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints.
      CONCLUSION: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom
      criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many 
      of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also
      inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report
      mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced
      erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar 
      finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM
      symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work
      should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately
      understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common in the third trimester of pregnancy. In
      this case-control study, 22.5% of 211 women had RLS. The RLS cases had a history 
      of growing pains (GP) more frequently than controls (P=0.042). A family history
      of GP (P=0.025) and RLS (P=0.018) was more frequent among cases than controls.
      RLS in pregnancy is predicted by family history of RLS and GP, and by childhood
      history of GP.

TI  - Factors influencing breast symptoms in breastfeeding women after cesarean section
      delivery.
PG  - 88-98
LID - 10.1016/S1976-1317(11)60017-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to explore postpartum stress and breast 
      symptoms in postpar-tum breastfeeding of parturient mothers as well as to
      identify the factors influencing the breast symptoms in breastfeeding women after
      cesarean section delivery. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A
      total of 162 breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery were recruited
      from five hospitals in Taiwan. Structured questionnaires were used to collect
      data. RESULTS: The five highest postpartum stress comes from the flabby flesh of 
      maternal belly, the baby getting sick suddenly, interrupted sleep, insufficient
      breast milk, and discomfort due to breast engorgement. The most two common breast
      symptoms in breastfeeding encountered by subjects in this study were breast
      engorgement and breast hardening, whereas the least common one was nipple bloody 
      discharge. Cesarean section women with early suckling on the operating table had 
      more breast symptoms in postpartum breastfeeding; and the higher the postpartum
      stress of them, the more the breast symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding in a
      comfortable condition is a key factor of precipitating breast milk secretion, so 
      early suckling on the operating table may result in discomfort and stress of the 
      woman and interfere with the secretion or production of breast milk.
      Additionally, it is a crucial factor of the success in breastfeeding that the
      nursing personnel can provide women help in maintaining breast milk production
      and secretion, taking care of a baby, and reminding women's families (especially 
      their husbands) of giving their assistance, encouragement and praises to relieve 
      women's postpartum stress.

LID - bmj.d2712 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether reduced sleep is associated with differences in 
      body composition and the risk of becoming overweight in young children. DESIGN:
      Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements. SETTING: Dunedin, New
      Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed
      from age 3 to 7. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and
      fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray
      absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry;
      dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and
      family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during
      pregnancy) measured with questionnaire. RESULTS: After adjustment for multiple
      confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a
      reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced
      risk of being overweight (BMI >/= 85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. 
      Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These
      differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (-0.43, -0.82 
      to -0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (-0.21, -0.41 to
      -0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased 
      risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and 
      multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat
      deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass.

TI  - Sleep disturbances in depressed and nondepressed pregnant women.
PG  - 676-85
LID - 10.1002/da.20828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during
      pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse
      outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and
      nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep
      disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine
      the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, 
      and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased
      depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy.
      METHODS: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20
      weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181)
      groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major
      depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale
      with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks
      gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained. RESULTS: Depressed women 
      had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values</=.05). However, the
      frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks
      gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several
      sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep
      duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher 
      Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression
      Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values</=.05). CONCLUSIONS: At 20 and 30 
      weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to 
      nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of
      depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in
      conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms.

TI  - Baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in
      near-term fetal sheep.

AB  - Late preterm infants, born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation, have significantly 
      higher morbidity than neonates born at full term, which may be partly related to 
      reduced sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex. The present study assessed
      baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA)
      in near-term fetal sheep at 123 +/- 1 days gestation. At this age, although
      fetuses are not fully mature in some respects (term is 147 days), sleep-state
      cycling is established [between high-voltage, low-frequency (HV) and low-voltage,
      high-frequency (LV) sleep], and neural myelination is similar to the term human
      infant. Fetal sheep were instrumented to record blood pressure (BP), HR (n = 15) 
      and RSNA (n = 5). Blood pressure was manipulated using vasoactive drugs,
      phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. In both HV and LV sleep, phenylephrine
      was associated with increased arterial BP and decreased HR. In HV sleep,
      phenylephrine was associated with a fall in RSNA, from 124 +/- 14 to 58 +/- 11%
      (P < 0.05), but no significant change in RSNA in LV sleep. In contrast, the fall 
      in BP after sodium nitroprusside was associated with a significant increase in HR
      during LV but not HV sleep, and there was no significant effect of hypotension on
      RSNA. These data demonstrate that in near-term fetal sheep baroreflex activity is
      only partly active and is highly modulated by sleep state. Critically, there was 
      no RSNA response to marked hypotension; this finding has implications for the
      ability of the late preterm fetus to adapt to low BP.

TI  - Effect of rotating shift work on childbearing and birth weight: a study of women 
      working in a semiconductor manufacturing factory.
PG  - 129-35
LID - 10.1007/s12519-011-0265-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stable circadian rhythm is important for both maternal and fetal
      health. This retrospective analysis of women in a semiconductor factory evaluated
      the effect of shift work exposure on childbearing and birth weight. METHODS:
      Records of 440 female employees (initial mean age: 28.4 years) including 111
      mothers who had 158 live births during the period of observation (1997-2007) were
      reviewed. The data analyzed included maternal age, general health condition,
      highest educational level, life-style and occupational factors, as well as
      newborn gender, birth weight, birth order and gestational age. RESULTS: The
      childbearing rates of female workers on three different work schedules
      (consistent daytime work (CDW), intermittent (i-) or persistent (p-) rotating
      shift works (RSW)) were 32.1%, 20.0% and 25.4%, respectively (P=0.047). After
      controlling for potential confounding factors, childbearing rates among women
      with CDW exceeded those of shift workers (odds ratio (OR), 1.7; 95% confidence
      interval (CI), 1.0-3.0). The birth weights of newborns from mothers on the three 
      work schedules (CDW, i-RSW and p-RSW) were significantly different
      (3271.7+/-395.4, 3251.3+/-460.9, and 2998.5+/-381.2 g, respectively (P<0.01).
      Newborns within the lightest birth weight quintile were significantly more likely
      to be born to mothers with exposure to p-RSW (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-16.8).
      CONCLUSIONS: Rotating shift work exposure was significantly associated with
      decreased childbearing and lighter birth weight in women working in this
      semiconductor manufacturing factory. Work schedules should be carefully planned
      for female employees who are pregnant or preparing for pregnancy. Prenatal
      evaluations for mothers with persistent day-night rotating shift work exposures
      are especially necessary.

TI  - Perinatal mortality in eastern Uganda: a community based prospective cohort
      study.
PG  - e19674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0019674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To achieve a child mortality reduction according to millennium
      development goal 4, it is necessary to considerably reduce neonatal mortality. We
      report stillbirth and early neonatal mortality risks as well as determinants of
      perinatal mortality in Eastern Uganda. METHODS: A community-based prospective
      cohort study was conducted between 2006 and 2008. A total of 835 pregnant women
      were followed up for pregnancy outcome and survival of their children until 7
      days after delivery. Mother's residence, age, parity, bed net use and whether
      delivery took place at home were included in multivariable regression analyses to
      identify risk factors for perinatal death. RESULTS: The stillbirth risk was 19
      per 1,000 pregnancies and the early neonatal death risk 22 per 1,000 live births.
      Overall, the perinatal mortality risk was 41 [95%CI: 27, 54] per 1,000
      pregnancies. Of the deaths, 47% followed complicated deliveries and 24% preterm
      births. Perinatal mortality was 63/1,000 pregnancies among teenage mothers,
      76/1,000 pregnancies among nulliparous women and 61/1,000 pregnancies among women
      delivering at home who, after controlling for potential confounders, had a 3.7
      (95%CI: 1.8, 7.4) times higher perinatal mortality than women who gave birth in a
      health facility. This association was considerably stronger among nulliparous
      women [RR 8.0 (95%CI: 2.9, 21.6)] than among women with a previous live birth [RR
      1.8 (95%CI: 0.7, 4.5)]. All perinatal deaths occurred among women who did not
      sleep under a mosquito net. Women living in urban slums had a higher risk of
      losing their babies than those in rural areas [RR: 2.7 (95%CI: 1.4, 5.3)].
      CONCLUSION: Our findings strengthen arguments for ensuring that pregnant women
      have access to and use adequate delivery facilities and bed nets.

TI  - [Assessment and treatment of cannabis use disorders in primary health care].
PG  - 674-81
AB  - In Finland every fourth young adult (25 to 34 years of age) has experience with
      the use of cannabis and in younger people (15 to 24 years) about 10% have used it
      during the previous year. The majority (about 90%) neither becomes addicted nor
      develops significant psychiatric symptoms, but in some individuals regular
      cannabis-use can cause a variety of problems (health, emotional, behavioural,
      social, legal). If problems have not yet developed or are still minor, patient's 
      cannabis-use may be addressed by brief intervention in a primary care setting.
      Also, treatment of uncomplicated cannabis withdrawal as well as of minor symptoms
      from smoking (bronchitis, sleep disturbances), can be treated in community health
      centres. Children and adolescents, pregnant individuals or those with psychiatric
      symptoms should be treated by services with expertise in addiction medicine.

TI  - Solitary sleeping in young infants is associated with heightened cortisol
      reactivity to a bathing session but not to a vaccination.
PG  - 167-77
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.03.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relation 
      between sleeping arrangements and infant cortisol reactivity to stressors in the 
      first two post-natal months. Co-sleeping, as compared to solitary sleeping, is
      hypothesized to provide more parental external stress regulation by night, thus
      reducing general stress sensitivity. We therefore expected lower cortisol
      reactivity to stress in infants who co-slept more regularly. METHODS:
      Participants were 163 mothers and infants from uncomplicated, singleton
      pregnancies. Mothers completed daily diaries on sleeping arrangements in the
      first 7 weeks of life. Co-sleeping was defined as sleeping in the parents'
      bedroom (i.e. own or parents' bed). Cortisol reactivity was measured twice: to a 
      mild physical stressor (bathing session) at 5 weeks of age and to a mild pain
      stressor (vaccination) at 2 months of age. RESULTS: Infants with a solitary
      sleeping arrangement in their first month of life showed a heightened cortisol
      response to the bathing session at 5 weeks compared to infants that co-slept
      regularly. This effect was not explained by breastfeeding practices, maternal
      caregiving behavior, or infants' night waking and sleep duration. No effects were
      found of co-sleeping on the cortisol response to the vaccination at 2 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that solitary sleeping in the first month of
      life is associated with heightened sensitivity of the HPA-axis to a mild
      stressor, possibly due to less nocturnal parental availability as external stress
      regulator. Whether this effect continues in later life, remains to be
      investigated.

TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors affect neurobehavioral development in the
      human fetus.
PG  - 1961-71
LID - 10.1038/npp.2011.67 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) utilized by pregnant women influence fetal
      neurobehavioral development. In this observational study we investigated
      developmental milestones of fetal behavior during the pregnancy of women with
      psychiatric disorders who took SSRIs throughout gestation (medicated group; n=96)
      or who had discontinued medication early in gestation or before conception
      (unmedicated group; n=37). Healthy unexposed fetuses of women without mental
      disorders comprised the control group (n=130). Ultrasonographic observations of
      fetal behavior were made three times in pregnancy (T1-T3). Effects of SSRIs were 
      studied over a wide range of dosages (low, standard, or high) and for different
      drug types. Fetuses exposed to standard or high SSRI dosages compared with
      control, unmedicated, or low-medicated fetuses showed significantly increased
      motor activity at the beginning (T1) and end of the second trimester (T2). They
      particularly exhibited disrupted emergence of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM;
      quiet) sleep during the third trimester, characterized by continual bodily
      activity and, thus, poor inhibitory motor control during this sleep state near
      term (T3). The SSRI effects on the fetus were dose related, but independent of
      SSRI type. The results demonstrate changes in fetal neurobehavioral development
      associated with standard and high SSRI dosages that are observable throughout
      gestation. A first-choice SSRI type was not apparent. Bodily activity at high
      rate during non-REM sleep in SSRI-exposed fetuses is an abnormal phenomenon, but 
      its significance for postnatal development is unclear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to use objective
      methods to assess the association between maternal smoking and body composition
      in offspring. METHODS: A total of 2508 grade 4 school children were enrolled; all
      underwent lifestyle disease and passive smoking screening. Children were
      classified into four groups according to their urinary cotinine level and
      maternal smoking status during or before pregnancy. Items measured on lifestyle
      disease screening were compared among the four groups. RESULTS: Only degree of
      obesity (DO) and body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with
      maternal smoking during pregnancy. The prevalence of both DO >20% and DO >30%,
      and BMI >22% and BMI >25% was highest in children of mothers who smoked during
      pregnancy. These children had a tendency toward shorter height and increased
      weight although it was not statistically significant. There were no significant
      differences between maternal smoking status and lipid profile among groups.
      Confounders such as food, exercise and sleep were able to be eliminated.
      CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking during pregnancy may be an independent risk factor
      of changing body composition in offspring, that is, shorter height and increased 
      weight.

TI  - Treatment options in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
PG  - 355-70
LID - 10.1007/s11940-011-0131-z [doi]
AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by
      excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an
      integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on
      avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and
      emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first
      choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of 
      up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of
      significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental
      delay. Levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if
      valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of 
      these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient 
      priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and
      lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative
      first-line agent. Lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate
      myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic
      drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated. Drug interactions and the
      patient's gender, age, and comorbidities need to be considered. Levetiracetam,
      lamotrigine, and valproate are suitable adjuncts, with a synergistic effect
      reported from the combination of valproate and lamotrigine. Clonazepam is a
      useful adjunct for myoclonus and can be used in combination with lamotrigine to
      avoid lamotrigine's myoclonic effects. In women of childbearing potential,
      valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to
      control seizures at this stage. Topiramate is a cost-effective alternative
      monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on
      treatment only. Zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment
      of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most
      cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when
      antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and 
      phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore
      contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when 
      these are refractory to other medication. Gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and 
      vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures. (Tiagabine and vigabatrin
      have been reported to induce absence status epilepticus.) Surgical alternatives
      in refractory cases are rarely contemplated but may include vagus nerve
      stimulation and callosotomy. Deep brain stimulation is an experimental technique 
      that may prove useful in managing refractory cases of JME.

TI  - A review of adult mortality due to 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A in
      California.
PG  - e18221
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While children and young adults had the highest attack rates due to
      2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A (2009 H1N1), studies of hospitalized cases noted
      high fatality in older adults. We analyzed California public health surveillance 
      data to better characterize the populations at risk for dying due to 2009 H1N1.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: A case was an adult >/=20 years who died with
      influenza-like symptoms and laboratory results indicative of 2009 H1N1.
      Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records using a
      standardized case report form. From April 3, 2009-August 10, 2010, 541 fatal
      cases >/=20 years with 2009 H1N1 were reported. Influenza fatality rates per
      100,000 population were highest in persons 50-59 years (3.5; annualized rate =
      2.6) and 60-69 years (2.3; annualized rate = 1.7) compared to younger and older
      age groups (0.4-1.9; annualized rates = 0.3-1.4). Of 486 cases hospitalized prior
      to death, 441 (91%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. ICU admission
      rates per 100,000 population were highest in adults 50-59 years (8.6). ICU
      case-fatality ratios among adults ranged from 24-42%, with the highest ratios in 
      persons 70-79 years. A total of 425 (80%) cases had co-morbid conditions
      associated with severe seasonal influenza. The prevalence of most co-morbid
      conditions increased with increasing age, but obesity, pregnancy and obstructive 
      sleep apnea decreased with age. Rapid testing was positive in 97 (35%) of 276
      tested. Of 482 cases with available data, 384 (80%) received antiviral treatment,
      including 49 (15%) of 328 within 48 hours of symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Adults
      aged 50-59 years had the highest fatality due to 2009 H1N1; older adults may have
      been spared due to pre-existing immunity. However, once infected and hospitalized
      in intensive care, case-fatality ratios were high for all adults, especially in
      those over 60 years. Vaccination of adults older than 50 years should be
      encouraged.

PG  - 651-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1276740 [doi]
AB  - We employed accepted, validated symptom-based screening measures to discern
      attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to adverse pregnancy outcomes,
      taking into account potential maternal confounders. Commonly employed OSA
      screening measures (Berlin and Epworth scales) were performed in the second and
      third trimesters; maternal and neonatal outcome data were thereafter obtained.
      The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified
      and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall
      prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) 
      strata (8.9%, 46%; p < 0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently
      performed. Among nonobese (BMI <30) gravidae, frequency of preeclampsia was
      significantly higher among women with OSA (adjusted odds ratio = 6.58, 95%
      confidence interval = 1.04, 38.51; p = 0.035). Among the obese (BMI >/=30)
      gravidae, infant birth weight ratio (or birth weight by gestational age) was
      higher with OSA + screening than OSA - (1.099 versus 1.035; p = 0.04), and this
      association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (p = 
      0.05). OSA prevalence increases significantly among obese gravidae, raising
      concerns for the overall validity of commonly employed screening measures in
      pregnancy. Nevertheless, OSA status continues to exert an independent influence, 
      as obese and nonobese gravidae are at increased risk for a limited number of
      adverse perinatal outcomes in multivariate models.

PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1476-069X-10-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women exposed to traffic pollution have an increased risk of
      negative birth outcomes. We aimed to investigate the size of this risk using a
      prospective cohort of 970 mothers and newborns in Logan, Queensland. METHODS: We 
      examined two measures of traffic: distance to nearest road and number of roads
      around the home. To examine the effect of distance we used the number of roads
      around the home in radii from 50 to 500 metres. We examined three road types:
      freeways, highways and main roads. RESULTS: There were no associations with
      distance to road. A greater number of freeways and main roads around the home
      were associated with a shorter gestation time. There were no negative impacts on 
      birth weight, birth length or head circumference after adjusting for gestation.
      The negative effects on gestation were largely due to main roads within 400
      metres of the home. For every 10 extra main roads within 400 metres of the home, 
      gestation time was reduced by 1.1% (95% CI: -1.7, -0.5; p-value = 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results add weight to the association between exposure to
      traffic and reduced gestation time. This effect may be due to the chemical toxins
      in traffic pollutants, or because of disturbed sleep due to traffic noise.

TI  - Everyday life memory deficits in pregnant women.
PG  - 27-37
LID - 10.1037/a0022844 [doi]
AB  - Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems
      with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous.
      The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between
      findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential
      source(s) of pregnant women's problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24
      nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and
      laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were
      used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of cortisol, depressed
      mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on
      pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective
      pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory.
      Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the
      questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found
      on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for
      one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical
      symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these
      findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with
      memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The
      predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures
      to detect objective deficits in pregnant women's memory.

TI  - Maternal snoring during pregnancy is associated with enhanced fetal
      erythropoiesis--a preliminary study.
PG  - 518-22
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.09.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Snoring is common among pregnant women and early
      reports suggest that it may bear a risk to the fetus. Increased fetal
      erythropoiesis manifested by elevated circulating nucleated red blood cells
      (nRBCs) has been found in complicated pregnancies involving fetal hypoxia. Both
      erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediate elevation of circulating
      nRBCs. The intermittent hypoxia and systemic inflammation elicited by
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) could affect fetal erythropoiesis during
      pregnancy. We hypothesized that maternal snoring will result in increased levels 
      of fetal circulating nRBCs via increased concentrations of EPO, IL-6, or both.
      METHODS: Women of singleton uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were recruited
      during labor and completed a designated questionnaire. Umbilical cord blood was
      collected immediately after birth and analyzed for nRBCs, plasma EPO and plasma
      IL-6 concentrations. Newborn data were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS:
      One hundred and twenty-two women were recruited. Thirty-nine percent of women
      reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Cord blood levels of circulating
      nRBCs, EPO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in habitual snorers compared with
      non-snorers (p = 0.03, 0.005 and 0.01; respectively). No differences in maternal 
      characteristics or newborn crude outcomes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal
      snoring during pregnancy is associated with enhanced fetal erythropoiesis
      manifested by increased cord blood levels of nRBCs, EPO and IL-6. This provides
      preliminary evidence that maternal snoring is associated with subtle alterations 
      in markers of fetal well being.

TI  - Influence of coping strategies on somatic symptoms in pregnant Spanish women:
      differences between women with and without a previous miscarriage.
PG  - 164-70
LID - 10.1016/j.apnr.2011.01.003 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this research was to analyze the relation between coping strategies
      and somatic symptomatology in pregnant Spanish women and the influence of a
      previous miscarriage on these variables. We used a correlational retrospective
      design, which included 207 expectant mothers (44 with a previous miscarriage).
      The instruments included a questionnaire on coping with stress and questions
      about first-trimester symptoms. Regression analysis showed a significant positive
      relationship between sleep disturbances and overt emotional expression coping,
      between tiredness/fatigue and avoidance coping, and between nausea and religious 
      coping. The influence of coping strategies on somatic symptomatology did not
      differ significantly between women who had had or had not had a previous
      miscarriage, although women with a previous miscarriage scored higher on the use 
      of religious coping and positive reappraisal and reported more nausea.

TI  - Antagonism of orexin 1 receptors eliminates motor hyperactivity and improves
      homing response acquisition in juvenile rats exposed to alcohol during early
      postnatal period.
PG  - 324-8
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2011.03.028 [doi]
AB  - Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity,
      disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing
      neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor
      activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat
      model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal 
      AE. Male rat pups received 2.625 g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically
      twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the
      third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were sham-intubated (S group).
      On PD12-14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor
      antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off
      period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17,
      their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of
      tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to
      reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful
      trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p = 0.0009-0.03). In contrast, these 
      measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and either S-SB or S-V
      rats. Motor activity in AE-V rats was significantly higher than in S-V (p =
      0.003), S-SB (p = 0.007) or AE-SB (p = 0.02) rats, with no difference between
      S-SB and AE-SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons
      contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following
      perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of 
      ORX-1 receptors.

TI  - Relationships among depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in perinatal women
      seeking mental health treatment.
PG  - 553-8
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2010.2371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women
      during the perinatal period. Changes in sleep and sleep quality are typical
      throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. However, little is known about
      relationships between insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in perinatal
      women. The objective of the present study is to characterize the burden of
      insomnia symptoms in perinatal women seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment and
      to examine relationships between insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety.
      METHODS: Data from 257 pregnant or postpartum women who sought outpatient
      psychiatric treatment at a university hospital-affiliated clinic were extracted
      from an existing clinical management database. Data included validated
      self-report measures assessing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), mood
      (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and generalized anxiety (Penn
      State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]). RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of women reported
      symptoms of insomnia, 75% reported symptoms of depression, and 61% reported
      symptoms of generalized anxiety. After controlling for PSWQ, the partial
      correlation between EPDS and ISI was 0.15 and 0.37 for pregnant and postpartum
      women, respectively. After controlling for EPDS, the partial correlation between 
      PSWQ and ISI was 0.20 and 0.12 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively.
      Women with clinically significant ISI scores had significantly higher odds for
      reporting symptoms consistent with depression (odds ratio [OR] 7.7) and
      generalized anxiety (OR 2.55) compared to women with lower ISI scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia symptoms affected a significant proportion of the perinatal
      women in this sample. These symptoms are linked to symptoms of depression and
      anxiety in treatment-seeking pregnant and postpartum women. Perinatal women seen 
      in psychiatric treatment settings should be routinely screened for sleep
      problems.

PG  - 713-24
LID - 10.1007/s10995-011-0768-y [doi]
AB  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden
      unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk,
      particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors
      are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship
      between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed
      separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal
      characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged
      2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data 
      for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using
      univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for
      infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction
      terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences.
      Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of 
      Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the
      infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],
      1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common
      independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth
      certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back
      sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal
      depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific
      and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health
      strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

      year postpartum.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-11-165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum weight retention affects many women and increases the risk
      of becoming overweight. The research objective was to study modifiable factors
      contributing to weight change at one year postpartum. METHODS: In this
      prospective cohort, postpartum behavior, such as physical activity, sedentary
      behavior, sleep, and intake of total energy, total fat and saturated fatty acids 
      of 118 Dutch women were assessed in 2003/2004 by self-report at 6 weeks, 6 and 12
      months postpartum. Mean postpartum scores were computed for the behavioral
      measures. In linear regression models it was determined which factors were
      associated with average weight change from before pregnancy to one year
      postpartum. Furthermore, factors associated with substantial postpartum weight
      retention (>/= 5 kg) were also studied in logistic regression models. RESULTS: At
      one year postpartum, the average weight of participants had increased by 0.9 kg
      (SD 4.4). Moreover, 20% of the women retained >/= 5 kg. Women who perceived
      themselves more physically active than others were almost ten times less likely
      to retain >/= 5 kg than women who perceived themselves equally active (OR = 0.11,
      95%CI: 0.02 - 0.66). Exceeding the guideline for saturated fatty acid intake (OR 
      = 3.40, 95%CI: 1.04 - 11.11), total gestational weight gain (OR = 1.14/kg, 95%CI:
      1.01 - 1.27), and not having completed post high school education (OR = 5.13,
      95%CI: 1.66 - 15.90) increased the odds of retaining >/= 5 kg. CONCLUSIONS: Since
      one in five women had substantial weight retention postpartum, effective
      interventions for the prevention of weight retention are much needed. Future
      studies should evaluate whether interventions focusing on the identified
      modifiable postpartum factors are successful in reducing weight retention after
      childbirth.

TI  - Cesarean delivery in the obese parturient: anesthetic considerations.
PG  - 163-79
LID - 10.2217/whe.10.77 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a worldwide health problem and its prevalence is reaching epidemic
      proportions. As obesity does not spare women of childbearing age, obstetric
      anesthesiologists will increasingly be exposed to the challenges of anesthesia in
      this population. The purpose of this article is to give the reader a thorough
      understanding of the anesthetic implications of obesity relating to cesarean
      deliveries. Obesity is associated with hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep 
      apnea and other comorbidities. It increases the risk of cesarean delivery,
      postpartum wound infections and deep venous thromboembolism. Obese parturients
      are prone to anesthetic complications such as aspiration of gastric contents,
      difficult monitoring, positioning, airway management and challenging neuraxial
      techniques. A thorough precesarean delivery preparation should include an
      evaluation by an anesthesiologist for women with a BMI over 40 kg/m(2) and
      institution of an antacid prophylaxis protocol, thromboprophylaxis and antibiotic
      prophylaxis. Regional anesthesia should ideally be used in all obese parturients 
      unless contraindicated. The goals of postpartum care include efficacious
      analgesia, physiotherapy and early mobilization. Monitoring and vigilance in an
      intensive care unit or step-down units should be considered for morbidly obese
      women.

TI  - Neurotransmitters couple brain activity to subventricular zone neurogenesis.
PG  - 1123-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07611.x [doi]
AB  - Adult neurogenesis occurs in two privileged microenvironments, the hippocampal
      subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the
      lateral ventricle. This review focuses on accumulating evidence suggesting that
      the activity of specific brain regions or bodily states influences SVZ cell
      proliferation and neurogenesis. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin
      have been shown to have long-range effects through neuronal projections into the 
      SVZ. Local gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have demonstrated
      effects on SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, but an extra-niche source of these
      neurotransmitters remains to be explored and options will be discussed. There is 
      also accumulating evidence that diseases and bodily states such as Alzheimer's
      disease, seizures, sleep and pregnancy influence SVZ cell proliferation. With
      such complex behavior and environmentally-driven factors that control
      subregion-specific activity, it will become necessary to account for overlapping 
      roles of multiple neurotransmitter systems on neurogenesis when developing cell
      therapies or drug treatments.

TI  - A melodic contour repeatedly experienced by human near-term fetuses elicits a
      profound cardiac reaction one month after birth.
PG  - e17304
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0017304 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human hearing develops progressively during the last trimester of
      gestation. Near-term fetuses can discriminate acoustic features, such as
      frequencies and spectra, and process complex auditory streams. Fetal and neonatal
      studies show that they can remember frequently recurring sounds. However,
      existing data can only show retention intervals up to several days after birth.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that auditory memories can last at
      least six weeks. Experimental fetuses were given precisely controlled exposure to
      a descending piano melody twice daily during the 35(th), 36(th), and 37(th) weeks
      of gestation. Six weeks later we assessed the cardiac responses of 25 exposed
      infants and 25 naive control infants, while in quiet sleep, to the descending
      melody and to an ascending control piano melody. The melodies had precisely
      inverse contours, but similar spectra, identical duration, tempo and rhythm,
      thus, almost identical amplitude envelopes. All infants displayed a significant
      heart rate change. In exposed infants, the descending melody evoked a cardiac
      deceleration that was twice larger than the decelerations elicited by the
      ascending melody and by both melodies in control infants.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, 3-weeks of prenatal exposure to a specific
      melodic contour affects infants 'auditory processing' or perception, i.e.,
      impacts the autonomic nervous system at least six weeks later, when infants are
      1-month old. Our results extend the retention interval over which a prenatally
      acquired memory of a specific sound stream can be observed from 3-4 days to six
      weeks. The long-term memory for the descending melody is interpreted in terms of 
      enduring neurophysiological tuning and its significance for the developmental
      psychobiology of attention and perception, including early speech perception, is 
      discussed.

TI  - Awake and asleep oxygen saturations in infants with chronic neonatal lung
      disease.
PG  - 1087-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02250.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental
      oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate
      withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep,
      based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep,
      which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis 
      that babies have lower saturations while asleep. METHODS: We studied infants with
      CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous 
      real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate and plethysmographic
      waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and 
      video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep. RESULTS:
      Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO2
      values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median
      gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of
      66 (37-130) weeks, for 229 (89-330) min. Mean SpO2 was 97.6% during sleep and
      97.0% awake (p=0.011). CONCLUSION: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation 
      while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during
      sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are
      needed to confirm this finding.

TI  - Factors that influence the childbearing intentions of Canadian men.
PG  - 1202-8
LID - 10.1093/humrep/der007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of men in the childbearing decision process and the factors 
      that influence men's childbearing intentions have been relatively unexplored in
      the literature. This study aimed to describe the factors that strongly influence 
      the childbearing intentions of men and to describe differences in these factors
      according to men's age group. METHODS: A telephone survey (response rate 84%) was
      conducted with 495 men between the ages of 20 and 45 living in an urban setting
      who, at the time of contact, did not have biological children. Men were asked
      about what factors strongly influence their intention to have children.
      Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to determine if
      these factors were significantly associated with age. RESULTS: Of those sampled, 
      86% of men reported that at some point in the future they planned to become a
      parent. The factors that men considered to be most influential in their
      childbearing intentions were: the need to be financially secure, their partner's 
      interest/desire to have children, their partner's suitability to be a parent and 
      their personal interest/desire to have children. Men who were 35-45 years old had
      lower odds of stating that financial security (crude OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18-0.54)
      and partner's interest in having children (crude OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.33-0.99)
      were very influential, but had higher odds of stating that their biological clock
      (crude OR: 4.37, 95% CI: 1.78-10.76) was very influential in their childbearing
      intentions than men in the 20-24 year age group. CONCLUSIONS: The factors that
      influence men's intentions about when to become a parent may change with age.
      Understanding what influences men to have children, and what they understand
      about reproductive health is important for education, program and policy
      development.

TI  - Congenital malaria in newborn twins.
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Malaria during first few months of life may be due to transplacental transfer of 
      parasitized maternal erythrocytes. The most common clinical features of
      congenital malaria are fever, anaemia and splenomegaly. Other signs and symptoms 
      include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, regurgitation, loose stools, and poor
      feeding. A 28 year old woman (G2P1A), with 36 weeks gestation, reported to a
      health facility in Sunyani on 22(nd) February 2009 with history of labour pains, 
      without fever. According to the mother, even though she did not sleep in
      insecticide treated bed net during her pregnancy, she took all the recommended
      drugs of sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine-intermittent preventive treatment for
      malaria. She delivered twins on the same day. The mother and the twins developed 
      fever on the same day. A laboratory investigation on the three of them was
      positive for malaria parasites. The three were successfully treated with quinine.
      Congenital malaria is real and it is therefore recommended that babies born to
      mothers with malaria should be screened for congenital malaria.

TI  - SIDS-related knowledge and infant care practices among Maori mothers.
PG  - 88-96
AB  - AIM: Maori have high SIDS rates and relevant information is needed to craft
      appropriate prevention strategies. The aim of the study was to determine what
      Maori mothers know about SIDS prevention, and to determine their SIDS-related
      child care practices. METHODS: Maori mothers who gave birth in the Counties
      Manukau District Health Board area were surveyed about their SIDS related
      knowledge, and infant care practices and their reasons for using and their
      concerns about these practices. Results were compared with a similar 2005 survey 
      of a largely European sample. RESULTS: Knowledge of Maori mothers about SIDS
      prevention was much lower than for European mothers. More Maori infants slept
      prone and Maori mothers stopped breastfeeding significantly earlier. Although
      co-sleeping rates were similar, bedsharing increased to 65% for some part of the 
      night. In addition, more than half of the Maori mothers had smoked in pregnancy
      and 21% of them were sharing a bed with their infant. Potentially unsafe soft
      objects such as rolled blankets or pillows were used by a third of mothers to
      help maintain the sleep position. CONCLUSIONS: Maori mothers have a poorer
      knowledge of SIDS prevention practices. The high rate of maternal smoking, the
      early cessation of breastfeeding, and co-sleeping where there was smoking in
      pregnancy were also areas of concern. Appropriate health promotion measures need 
      to be developed for the high-risk Maori community.

TI  - Maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy and excessive infant
      crying.
PG  - 309-14
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2011.01.037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of excessive infant crying is largely unknown. We
      hypothesize that excessive infant crying may have an early nutritional origin
      during fetal development. AIMS: This study is the first to explore whether (1)
      maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with
      excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological
      well-being during pregnancy affects these associations. STUDY DESIGN: Women were 
      approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n=8266)
      and to donate a blood sample (n=4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations
      were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a
      postpartum questionnaire (+/-3 months; n=5218). SUBJECTS: Pregnant women living
      in Amsterdam and their newborn child. OUTCOME MEASURES: Excessive infant crying, 
      defined as crying >/=3 h/day on average in the past week. RESULTS: Multiple
      logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622
      (folate) women.Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was
      associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age,
      parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems
      (OR[95%CI]: Q1=3.31[1.48-7.41]; Q2=2.50[1.08-5.77]; Q3=2.59[1.12-6.00];
      Q4=2.77[1.20-6.40]; Q5=reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger
      association among women with high levels of psychological problems during
      pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying. 
      CONCLUSIONS: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in
      excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy
      could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms:
      the methionine-homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep-wake
      rhythm.

AB  - Lead (Pb) exposure alters the temporal organization of several physiological and 
      behavioural processes in which the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
      hypothalamus plays a fundamental role. In this study, we evaluated the effects of
      chronic early Pb exposure (CePbe) on the morphology, cellular density and
      relative optical density (OD) in the cells of the SCN of male rats. Female Wistar
      rats were exposed during gestation and lactation to a Pb solution containing 320 
      ppm of Pb acetate through drinking water. After weaning, the pups were maintained
      with the same drinking water until sacrificed at 90 days of age. Pb levels in the
      blood, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly
      increased in the experimental group. Chronic early Pb exposure induced a
      significant increase in the minor and major axes and somatic area of vasoactive
      intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and vasopressin (VP)-immunoreactive neurons. The
      density of VIP-, VP- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive
      cells showed a significant decrease in the experimental group. OD analysis showed
      a significant increase in VIP neurons of the experimental group. The results
      showed that CePbe induced alterations in the cells of the SCN, as evidenced by
      modifications in soma morphology, cellular density and OD in circadian pacemaker 
      cells. These findings provide a morphological and cellular basis for deficits in 
      circadian rhythms documented in Pb-exposed animals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors as free-text markers for mental ill-health from
      an electronic perinatal record (EMR) system and the association with emergency
      cesarean section (CS) in nulliparous women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a
      population-based study using an EMR system, set in the catchment area of Malmo
      University Hospital in Sweden. Of 10,662 nulliparous women presenting with a
      singleton cephalic baby for vaginal delivery between 2001 and 2006, 6,467 women
      with complete EMRs were selected. A free-text search of markers for mental
      ill-health was carried out, and results were analysed by multivariate logistic
      regression. Eleven markers for mental ill-health were tested with Cohen's kappa
      for agreement and used as exposure variables. Odds ratios (OR) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for emergency CS, and adjusted for
      maternal age, diabetes, epidural anesthesia and gestational weeks <37 and >41 by 
      a multivariate logistic regression model with vaginal delivery as the reference. 
      RESULTS: Three markers identified from the EMR system reached statistically
      significant associations with an increased risk for emergency CS in nulliparous
      women: stress, adjusted OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.34-2.06); sleep, adjusted OR 1.57 (95% 
      CI 1.14-2.16); and worry, adjusted OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.10-1.79). CONCLUSION:
      Free-text words in medical records that indicated stress, sleep disturbances or
      worry predicted increased adjusted OR for emergency CS in first-time mothers.
      Recognizing pregnant women's reporting of their mental health status could have a
      predictive bearing on delivery outcomes.

TI  - The prevalence of snoring in Thai pregnant women.
PG  - S102-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of snoring in Thai, pregnant women.
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was carried out from April 2008 through August
      2008 at the antenatal clinic, HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center 
      Nakorn Nayok province. Two hundred and thirty-eight pregnant women were enrolled.
      All subjects answered the Berlin questionnaire; this include information on age, 
      weight, height, gravid health status, gestational age, witnessed incidences of
      snoring, and symptoms associated with sleep apnea. The description of snoring as 
      frequency, volume, complaints from other people and bouts of sleep apnea were
      recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of snoring in pregnancy was
      35.29%. The snoring volume, recorded as slightly louder than breathing, in this
      group was 91.67%. One-fourth of the cases presented with snoring approximately
      3-4 times a week with complaints of snoring bothering other people. The incidence
      of sleep apnea was found in 5.95% of this group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of
      snoring was found in approximately one-third of the pregnant women screened.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports of sleep disturbance during pregnancy are abundant;
      however, objective measurement of sleep changes has so far produced conflicting
      results. AIMS: To objectively measure sleep architecture and investigate
      subjective sleep quality in the first and third trimester of pregnancy, when
      compared to the nonpregnant state. METHODS: Twenty-seven women in the third
      trimester of pregnancy, 21 women in the first trimester of pregnancy and 24
      nonpregnant control women underwent overnight polysomnography and completed
      questionnaires regarding sleep quality and mood. RESULTS: Women in the third
      trimester of pregnancy had poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, less stage 4
      sleep, more stage 1 sleep and fewer minutes in rapid eye movement sleep when
      compared to the control group. Cortical arousals were seen more often during
      pregnancy, particularly in response to respiratory events and limb movements.
      Sleep during the first trimester was affected to a lesser extent, with more wake 
      time after sleep onset and less stage 4 sleep when compared to the controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sleep during pregnancy is compromised by higher amounts of wake and 
      cortical arousals leading to sleep fragmentation, with greater amounts of light
      sleep and less deep sleep. Mood state did not have an effect on sleep. Given the 
      impact of sleep on well-being, this study increases our understanding of the
      characteristics of sleep during pregnancy, to help recognise when severe sleep
      disruption may warrant referral to a specialist for appropriate diagnosis and
      treatment.

TI  - Epidemiological profile and strategies for diagnosing SIDS in a developing
      country.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological profile, risk factors and best
      strategies for diagnosing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in a developing
      country. METHODS: Population-based, case-control study with children born between
      January 1st, 2001, and December 31st, 2003, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, who
      were allocated into three groups: SIDS cases (33), explained death controls
      (192), and living controls (192). Children in the latter two groups were age- and
      sex-paired with SIDS cases. Families in which an infant had died at home within
      the first year of life were identified, and the information available on death
      certificates and autopsy reports was compared to confirm the diagnosis of SIDS.
      Explained death controls consisted of infants who had died at city hospitals, and
      living controls were selected in the same neighborhood as SIDS cases. All parents
      were interviewed to obtain information on children's health and sleep habits.
      Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors in the study
      population. RESULTS: The incidence of SIDS in the population assessed was
      0.55/1,000 live births. The analysis revealed the following risk factors:
      ethnicity (characterized by self-reported black skin color), prematurity, low
      birth weight, adolescent mother, smoking during pregnancy, and family income of
      less than one minimum wage. Ninety-four percent of SIDS cases were misdiagnosed
      in the death certificate. CONCLUSIONS: Although SIDS was misdiagnosed in official
      death certificates, the epidemiological profile is similar to the literature, as 
      well as risk factors, which could be reduced with preventive campaigns.
      Investigating SIDS in developing countries requires special strategies to avoid
      misdiagnosis.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of farming
      management on the total locomotor activity (TLA) behaviour in dairy cattle. We
      recorded 24h/day TLA in five not pregnant Holstein Friesian cows during parts of 
      the lactation and dry periods, by means of an activity monitoring system
      (Actiwatch mini(R)) for seven days in each period. During mild lactation (period 
      1) animals were milked and fed twice a day. During the dry (period 2) they were
      kept to graze all day. In both periods hay and water were available ad libitum.
      Differences between the photophase and the scotophase were evaluated with a
      Student t-test. One-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine a
      statistical significant effect of time. A trigonometric statistical model was
      used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mean level, amplitude, acrophase
      and robustness of rhythm. Our results showed a circadian rhythm of daily TLA in
      both periods, with different percentages of robustness, and acrophase in the
      middle of the photophase. The different patterns of activity in the two periods
      were attributed to the management practise during milking period. These results
      could be taken in consideration during farming management for the evaluation of
      such systems used in livestock, with respect to production and welfare.

TI  - Effects of body mass index on sleep patterns during pregnancy.
PG  - 125-7
LID - 10.3109/01443615.2010.536861 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to profile sleep patterns during pregnancy
      according to body mass index (BMI) and to correlate labour outcomes with both BMI
      and hours sleep. Data were collected from 200 postpartum women detailing sleep
      characteristics before and during pregnancy. A validated sleep questionnaire was 
      employed, which comprised of questions about sleep apnoea, snoring, subjective
      sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep
      disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. Descriptive
      analyses were used. With advancing gestation, the mean (SD) number of hours sleep
      per night declined: pre-pregnancy 8.1 (SD 1.4); 1st trimester 8.3 (SD 1.8); 2nd
      trimester 7.7 (SD 1.7) and 3rd trimester 6.7 (SD 2.2). In the 18.5-24.9 BMI
      group, there was a marked difference in hours sleep per night from pre-pregnancy 
      to 1st (8.6 h, p = 0.007), 2nd (7.9 h, p = 0.023) and 3rd (6.4 h, p = 0.000)
      trimesters in primiparous women. In the 25-29.9 BMI group, there was a difference
      from pre-pregnancy to 3rd trimester (p = 0.000). These changes were not reflected
      in a clinically significant difference in birth weight or mode of delivery.

AB  - Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are more common in pregnant women compared
      with nonpregnant women. It is likely that physiology of pregnancy predisposes to 
      the development or worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, but some physiologic 
      changes may also be protective against the development of this disease. Clinical 
      presentation may be less predictive of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy
      than in the non-pregnant population; nonetheless, snoring is associated with
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment strategies are similar to the nonpregnant
      population, however, pregnancy-specific scenarios may arise and these subtleties 
      are addressed in this review.

AB  - AIMS: To document the effect of position on oxygen saturation and changes in
      oxygen requirement in convalescent preterm infants. METHODS: Twelve infants born 
      >/=24 and </=32 weeks gestation, extubated and without congenital anomaly were
      studied using nap polysomnography in prone and supine, twice weekly until
      discharge. Mean oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), minimum SpO(2) , mean minimum SpO(2) 
      and time with SpO(2) < 90% were measured in active sleep. RESULTS: Eight male and
      four female infants [median gestation 28 (24-31) weeks and median birthweight
      1059 (715-1840) g] had 39 studies. For 21 of 39 studies, the infant was on
      respiratory support. Four infants had chronic lung disease (CLD). SpO(2) varied
      with postmenstrual age (PMA) (p = 0.003) but not with position (p = 0.36), and
      PMA did not influence the effect of position on SpO(2) (p = 0.19). SpO(2) was
      lower for those with CLD (p < 0.0001) and those on respiratory support (p <
      0.001), but there was no effect of position (p = 0.97 and p = 0.67,
      respectively). From 36 weeks PMA, a change to supine did not increase oxygen
      requirement. CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, PMA and residual respiratory disease
      have greater effects on oxygenation than position. A supine sleep position is not
      disadvantageous for preterm infants at discharge.

      Two randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 7-19
LID - 10.1002/nur.20413 [doi]
AB  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized
      controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new
      parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of
      night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n = 118 and 122) were
      randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was
      assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the
      General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not
      benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample
      1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. 
      Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with 
      few resources.

TI  - Depression during pregnancy: is the developmental impact earlier in boys? A
      prospective case-control study.
PG  - 378-87
LID - 10.4088/JCP.09m05724blu [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Animal studies have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal
      maternal stress on the offspring. The aim of this prospective case-control study 
      was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant 
      characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables.
      METHOD: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for
      depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was
      based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded
      postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2
      and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with
      the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and
      Emotional Assessment, respectively. RESULTS: Despite our use of numerous
      exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression
      highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with
      prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and
      regulation of states NBAS clusters (P = .03 and P = .026, respectively). At 1
      year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on
      generalized anxiety (P = .002), particularly in males (P = .009);
      activity/impulsivity (P = .042); and sleep problems (P = .023) than controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant 
      development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed
      to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a

TI  - Gerardo: asthma and cultural beliefs in a Latino family.
PG  - 75-7
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e318203e087 [doi]
AB  - CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care pediatrician
      with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His frustration with his illness was
      immediately apparent when he said, "I hate having to go to the nurse's office to 
      take my albuterol!" His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused 
      to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When
      questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and
      then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is
      afraid to "poison his body with so many chemicals." She consistently gave her son
      the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was
      unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the
      new doctor is "cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician." Gerardo is
      a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to
      Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his
      mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo's condition. She explained 
      that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many
      toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes
      during pregnancy, she induced her son's asthma. Gerardo presented with his first 
      episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly
      recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the
      hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since.
      Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a
      nonallergenic pillow and bed cover. Gerardo's mother explained that 3 days before
      his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on
      a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother
      reported that he was soaked in water and stated, "He knows that he will get sick 
      with asthma if he gets wet!" She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend's birthday
      party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other
      children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted 
      Gerardo to care for his "weak lungs." She is frustrated now with his regression
      in self-care.

TI  - Maternal psychosocial factors around delivery, and the behavior of 2-year-old
      children.
PG  - 656-661
LID - 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2010.03315.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of the present study were to explore whether maternal 
      psychosocial factors, mental health and work stress around delivery, are related 
      to the behavior of 2-year-old children. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study
      design, pregnant women attending the National Taiwan University Hospital for
      delivery and post-partum care from April 2004 to January 2005 were recruited and 
      their children were observed at 24 months. A total of 186 mother-term-born child 
      dyads completed the measurement. The five-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5)
      self-report data of maternal psychosocial factors were selected from the
      Taiwanese version of the short form 36 (SF-36). The Child Behavior Checklist for 
      age 1(1/2)-5 (CBCL/1(1/2)-5) was completed by the parents when the child was 2
      years old. RESULTS: The mean score of mental health around delivery was 68.11.
      The proportion of mothers with work stress seldom and always was 61.8% and 24.7%,
      respectively. The mean of the total CBCL score, and internalizing, externalizing 
      behavior and sleep problems scores was 45.95, 11.89, 15.59 and 4.23,
      respectively. After adjusting for the potential confounders, maternal work stress
      around delivery was found to have a significant effect on the total CBCL and
      externalizing, attention and aggressive, behavioral problems of 2-year old
      children. Maternal mental health around delivery, however, did not show
      significant effects on child behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Work stress around delivery
      seems to aggravate children's externalizing behavior problems at 2 years old. It 
      is therefore important to improve the psychosocial health and reduce the stress
      of pregnant women.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of parecoxib versus ketorolac combined with morphine
      on patient-controlled analgesia for post-cesarean delivery pain management.
PG  - 174-7
LID - 10.1016/j.aat.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: we compared the clinical efficacy and safety between a new injectable
      cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor, parecoxib, and an old nonselective,
      ketorolac combined with morphine in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for
      management of post-cesarean delivery pain. METHODS: in this randomized,
      open-label study, 66 parturients undergoing cesarean section were divided into
      two groups: In Group P the patients received an initial intravenous bolus of 40mg
      parecoxib as a loading dose post-operatively and then two bolus doses of 20mg
      parecoxib were subsequently given at intervals of 24h. Morphine was basically
      used in PCA manner during the 3-day study course; and in Group K patients
      received an intravenous loading bolus of 30mg ketorolac post-operatively and then
      90mg ketorolac combined with morphine in PCA fashion throughout the study course.
      Efficacy was evaluated by Verbal ranking scale (0-10) for pain intensity, Ramsay 
      sedation score (1-6), profile of mood state (0-3) and quality of sleep (0-3), and
      patient satisfaction (0-4) with the analgesia. Efficacy evaluations and adverse
      effects were recorded every 24h and at 72h after initial loading boluses. The
      duration of hospital stay and total dose of morphine used throughout the study
      were also recorded. RESULTS: there were no significant differences of sedation
      scale, mood state, quality of sleep and satisfaction between two groups, except
      patients of Group P had a lower pain scores than those of the Group K at 24h
      (3.1, range 0-5 vs. 4.3, range 0-8, p = 0.005) and 72h (1.1, range 0-3 vs. 1.9,
      range 0-4, p = 0.005). Moreover, there were also no significant differences in
      the duration of hospital stay, but there was a lower total morphine requirement
      (22% reduction) in Group P in comparison with Group K (43.5 +/- 19.2 vs. 55.5 +/-
      21.5, p = 0.02). Regarding adverse effects, there were no statistical differences
      between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: we noted that parecoxib with PCA morphine can be
      used for post-cesarean delivery analgesia with the same efficacy as ketorolac for
      an opioid-sparing effect.

      physiology and potential for perimenopause.
PG  - 109-20
AB  - Perimenopause, women's normal midlife reproductive transition, is highly
      symptomatic for about 20% of women who are currently inaccurately counseled and
      inappropriately treated with oral contraceptives, menopausal hormone therapy or
      hysterectomy. About 80% of perimenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms
      (VMS), 25% have menorrhagia, and about 10% experience mastalgia. The majority of 
      women describe varying intensities of sleep, -coping or mood difficulties. Women 
      are more symptomatic because common knowledge inaccurately says that estradiol
      (E2) levels are dropping/deficient. Evidence shows that with disturbed
      brain-ovary feedbacks, E2 levels average 26% higher and soar erratically - some
      women describe feeling pregnant! Also, ovulation and progesterone (P4) levels
      become insufficient or absent. The most symptomatic women have higher E2 and
      lower P4 levels. Because P4 and E2 complement/counterbalance each other's tissue 
      effects, oral micronized P4 (OMP4 300 mg at -bedtime) is a physiological therapy 
      for treatment-seeking, symptomatic perimenopausal women. Given cyclically (cycle 
      d 14-27, or 14 on/off) in menstruating midlife women, OMP4 decreases cyclic VMS, 
      improves sleep and premenstrual mastalgia. Menorrhagia is treated with ibuprofen 
      200mg/6h plus OMP4 cycle d 4-28. For insulin resistance, metformin plus cyclic or
      daily OMP4 decreases insulin resistance and weight gain. Non-responsive migraines
      need daily OMP4 plus usual therapies. VMS and insomnia in late perimenopause
      respond to daily OMP4. In summary, OMP4 is a physiology-based therapy that
      improves sleep, treats VMS, does not increase breast proliferation or cancer
      risk, increases bone formation and has beneficial cardiovascular effects. A
      controlled trial is testing OMP4 for perimenopausal VMS - more evidence-based
      data are needed.

TI  - Respiratory events in preterm infants prior to discharge: with and without
      clinically concerning apnoea.
PG  - 867-73
LID - 10.1007/s11325-010-0457-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the characteristics of respiratory events 
      in preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea at or beyond 35 weeks
      postmenstrual age and to compare these findings with a group of preterm infants
      ready for discharge, without clinically concerning apnoea. METHODS: Infants born 
      at <32 weeks of gestation and who underwent nap polysomnography at or beyond 35
      weeks corrected age prior to discharge were included. Cases were preterm infants 
      with clinically concerning apnoea, and control infants were preterm infants
      asymptomatic for apnoea. Infants with upper airway obstruction, congenital
      malformations or apnoea associated with sepsis were excluded. Studies were
      retrospectively reviewed for length, type and frequency of apnoea. The
      relationship between sleep state and changes in oxygen saturation was compared
      between groups. Peri-natal and demographic data were also compared. RESULTS: Data
      were complete for 16 case and 18 control infants. Gestational age was similar at 
      birth and at time of study, but cases had a lower birth weight (p = 0.04) and
      higher weight at study (p = 0.04). There were no group differences in the mean
      duration, type or numbers of apnoea. The duration of the longest apnoea was
      greater in case infants (17.4 s vs. 12.3 s, p = 0.02). Lowest oxygen saturation
      (p < 0.05) and average minimum oxygen saturation (p < 0.05) were lower in case
      infants. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea have
      similar amounts and types of apnoea but lower oxygen saturation after apnoea
      compared with controls. The use of oxygen saturation monitoring is more useful
      than respiratory monitoring alone in recognising these events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the course of
      pregnancy and on fetal development. There are few studies investigating the
      outcome of stress reduction interventions on maternal well-being and obstetric
      outcome. AIMS: this study aims (1) to obtain fetal behavioral states
      (quiet/active sleep, quiet/active wakefulness), (2) to investigate the effects of
      maternal relaxation on fetal behavior as well as on uterine activity, and (3) to 
      investigate maternal physiological and endocrine parameters as potential
      underlying mechanisms for maternal-fetal relaxation-transferral. STUDY DESIGN:
      the behavior of 33 fetuses was analyzed during laboratory relaxation/quiet rest
      (control group, CG) and controlled for baseline fetal behavior. Potential
      associations between relaxation/quiet rest and fetal behavior (fetal heart rate
      (FHR), FHR variation, FHR acceleration, and body movements) and uterine activity 
      were studied, using a computerized cardiotocogram (CTG) system. Maternal heart
      rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and norepinephrine were measured. RESULTS:
      intervention (progressive muscle relaxation, PMR, and guided imagery, GI) showed 
      changes in fetal behavior. The intervention groups had higher long-term variation
      during and after relaxation compared to the CG (p=.039). CG fetuses had more FHR 
      acceleration, especially during and after quiet rest (p=.027). Women in the PMR
      group had significantly more uterine activity than women in the GI group (p=.011)
      and than CG women. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones were 
      not associated with fetal behavior. CONCLUSIONS: this study indicates that the
      fetus might participate in maternal relaxation and suggests that GI is superior
      to PMR. This could especially be true for women who tend to direct their
      attention to body sensations such as abdominal activity.

TI  - Down-regulation of circadian clock gene period 2 in uterine endometrial stromal
      cells of pregnant rats during decidualization.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.3109/07420528.2010.522289 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms are modulated in a variety of peripheral tissues, including in 
      the uterus where endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) undergo proliferation and
      differentiation (decidualization) during gestation. Here the authors focused on
      circadian rhythms in UESCs during implantation and decidualization in rodents. As
      revealed by analyses of cultured UESCs from pregnant Per2 promoter-dLuc
      transgenic rats, Per2 oscillation of approximately 24 h was observed in response 
      to dexamethasone. Per2 oscillation was enhanced in UESCs during implantation,
      whereas they were attenuated during decidualization. In vivo studies showed that 
      PER2 protein in the uteri displayed a peak at zeitberger time 4 (ZT 4) (day 4.50 
      of gestation) and a trough at ZT 12 (day 4.83), indicating its circadian
      rhythmicity. Conversely, no significant circadian rhythm of the PER2 protein was 
      observed during decidualization. Fluorescent immunohistochemical studies also
      supported circadian rhythmicity of the PER2 protein in its intracellular
      distribution. In accordance with Per2 mRNA expression, a circadian rhythm of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) gene expression, having several E-box
      or E-box-like sites at the upstream of the transcription start site, was observed
      during implantation, showing a peak at ZT 0 and a trough at ZT 12. In contrast,
      Vegf mRNA expression displayed no circadian rhythm during decidualization.
      Collectively, the present results prove that Per2 oscillation is down-regulated
      in UESCs during decidualization. It is strongly suggested that cellular
      differentiation in UESCs interferes with circadian clockwork.

      Carolina, 1996-2007.
PG  - 72-82
LID - 10.1007/s10995-010-0718-0 [doi]
AB  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and
      lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants.
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear
      trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648
      mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to
      examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant
      pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction
      in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning
      (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral
      positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white 
      infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit
      recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position
      (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among
      white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87)
      but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being
      placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black
      infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant
      predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings
      suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep
      positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may
      efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in
      sudden infant death syndrome.

TI  - Strategies used by Jordanian women to alleviate heartburn during pregnancy.
PG  - 603-6
LID - 10.1016/j.midw.2010.05.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to explore the strategies used by Jordanian women to manage heartburn 
      during pregnancy. DESIGN: an exploratory descriptive study. PARTICIPANTS AND
      SETTING: 235 Jordanian women from the three regions of Jordan, aged between 18
      and 54 years, who were pregnant at the time of the study or had previously had at
      least one full-term pregnancy. FINDINGS: a number of strategies were used by
      Jordanian women in the sample for the alleviation of heartburn of pregnancy,
      including non-pharmacological strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes,
      pharmacological treatments such as antacids, and the use of home remedies such as
      drinking cold milk, 'baking powder' in liquid form or herbs, eating cucumber,
      lintel seeds, or dry tea leaves. Women aged 40 years and older, who had lower
      income, and were not employed were more likely to use home remedies to manage
      heartburn in pregnancy than the other groups. Overall, women rated their chosen
      strategy as useful. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: heartburn can 
      be very uncomfortable and can affect food intake and appetite, daily routine and 
      even sleep. Heartburn during pregnancy is at risk for being poorly managed given 
      that birth is the cure. As a health-care provider, it is important to prepare
      women and their families to manage heartburn during pregnancy effectively.
      Midwives should encourage women to seek help from care providers when they need
      it, and continue to assess heartburn and the strategies used to manage symptoms
      during pregnancy.

      parturients and non-pregnant women.
PG  - 22-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ijoa.2010.09.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is associated with alteration in sleep patterns and
      quality. We wished to investigate whether pregnant women have a higher likelihood
      of a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant
      women ages 18-45 years (n=4074) presenting for delivery, and non-pregnant women
      ages 18-45 years (n=490) presenting for outpatient surgery provided demographic
      information and completed the Berlin Questionnaire evaluating self-reported
      snoring and daytime sleepiness. For the pregnant patients, the infant's birth
      weight and Apgar scores were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 1439 patients with a 
      positive Berlin Questionnaire, 96 were in the non-pregnant control population
      versus 1343 in the pregnant population (20% vs. 33%, respectively, P<0.001; odds 
      ratio 2.0 [95% CI: 1.6-2.5]). There was a positive correlation between infant
      weight and a positive Berlin Questionnaire. The incidence of preeclampsia was
      greater (odds ratio 3.9) in the pregnant patients with a positive Berlin
      Questionnaire as compared with the parturients with a negative Berlin
      Questionnaire (odds ratio 1.1). CONCLUSION: Parturients are more likely to have a
      positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. This may indicate an
      increased likelihood of sleep disordered breathing.

TI  - The effect of labor on sevoflurane requirements during cesarean delivery.
PG  - 17-21
LID - 10.1016/j.ijoa.2010.08.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Labor results in the release of sensitizing substances such as
      progesterone, prostaglandins, cytokines and cortisol, some of which have been
      observed to participate in sleep regulation. We hypothesized that these
      substances could affect sleep regulation and therefore the amount of volatile
      agent required to provide general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. METHODS: A
      total of 50 patients were enrolled, of whom 25 had uterine activity less than 30 
      Montevideo units (Prelabor group) and 25 had uterine activity greater than 80
      Montevideo units (Labor group). Anesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in
      nitrous oxide with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to sustain
      a constant Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-55. Prolactin, progesterone and
      cortisol levels were evaluated immediately before cesarean delivery. RESULTS:
      End-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane in the Prelabor group were higher than in
      the Labor group with similar Bispectral Index values. No significant differences 
      were found in prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels between the two groups.
      CONCLUSION: Anesthetic requirements for sevoflurane, as measured by Bispectral
      Index, decrease in laboring versus non-laboring parturients undergoing cesarean
      delivery. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol do not appear to be responsible
      for this observation.

AB  - Despite association with lung growth and long-term respiratory morbidity, there
      is a lack of normative lung function data for unsedated infants conforming to
      latest European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society standards. Lung
      function was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter in 342 unsedated, healthy,
      term-born infants at a mean +/- sd age of 5.1 +/- 0.8 weeks during natural sleep 
      according to the latest standards. Tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) and 
      exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) measurements were obtained from 100 regular breaths.
      We aimed for three acceptable measurements for multiple-breath washout and 5-10
      acceptable interruption resistance (R(int)) measurements. Acceptable measurements
      were obtained in </= 285 infants with high variability. Mean values were 7.48
      mL.kg(-)(1) (95% limits of agreement 4.95-10.0 mL.kg(-)(1)) for tidal volume,
      14.3 ppb (2.6-26.1 ppb) for eNO, 23.9 mL.kg(-)(1) (16.0-31.8 mL.kg(-)(1)) for
      functional residual capacity, 6.75 (5.63-7.87) for lung clearance index and 3.78 
      kPa.s.L(-)(1) (1.14-6.42 kPa.s.L(-)(1)) for R(int). In males, TBFVL outcomes were
      associated with anthropometric parameters and in females, with maternal smoking
      during pregnancy, maternal asthma and Caesarean section. This large normative
      data set in unsedated infants offers reference values for future research and
      particularly for studies where sedation may put infants at risk. Furthermore, it 
      highlights the impact of maternal and environmental risk factors on neonatal lung
      function.

AB  - Insomnia, defined as difficulty in falling asleep and/or staying asleep, short
      sleep duration, or poor quality sleep, is a common sleep disorder affecting
      30-40% of adult population. We have conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study to test if anesthesia is therapeutically beneficial in
      patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. We have assessed the efficacy 
      and safety of propofol-induced sleep in these patients. This study comprised of
      103 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia (including 59 non-pregnant,
      non-lactating women; 28-60 years) and the participants were randomized to receive
      either physiological saline (placebo) (n = 39) or 3.0 g/l propofol (n = 64) in a 
      2-h continuous intravenous infusion for five consecutive nights. The Leeds Sleep 
      Evaluation Questionnaire was used for the subjective assessment of sleep, and
      polysomnography was used for the objective measurement of sleep architecture and 
      patterns. The assessments were done prior to and at the end of the 5-day
      treatment and 6 months after treatment period. The adverse effects of the
      treatment were also recorded. A 2-h continuous intravenous infusion of 3.0 g/l
      propofol for five consecutive nights improved the subjective and objective
      assessments of sleep in 64 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia.
      This improvement occurred immediately after the therapy and persisted for 6
      months. No serious adverse events were noticed during the period of drug
      administration or 6 months after the treatment. Propofol therapy is an
      efficacious and safe choice for restoring normal sleep in patients with
      refractory chronic primary insomnia.

TI  - Habitual snoring and asthma comorbidity among pregnant women.
PG  - 91-7
LID - 10.3109/02770903.2010.535882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring and asthma are
      known comorbid conditions in men and non-pregnant women. This comorbidity has not
      been evaluated among pregnant women. We assessed the habitual snoring-asthma
      relationship among pregnant women. METHODS: A cohort of women (N = 1335) were
      interviewed during pregnancy, and we ascertained participants' asthma status and 
      collected information about habitual snoring, before and during pregnancy.
      Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Compared with non-asthmatics, the adjusted
      OR among asthmatics for snoring before pregnancy was 2.13 (95% CI 1.10-4.12). The
      odds of snoring during early pregnancy was 1.79-fold (OR = 1.79; 95% C;
      1.07-3.01). Associations were more pronounced among overweight (>/= 25 kg/m(2))
      asthmatics (OR = 5.39; 95% CI 2.27-12.75). CONCLUSIONS: We report a
      cross-sectional association of habitual snoring and asthma among pregnant women. 
      If confirmed, pregnant asthmatics may benefit from more vigilant screening and
      management of OSA or habitual snoring during pregnancy.

AB  - In veterinary medicine, the characterization of a drug's pharmacokinetic
      properties is generally based upon data that are derived from studies that employ
      small groups of young healthy animals, often of a single breed. In Part I of the 
      series, we focused on the potential influence of disease processes, stress,
      pregnancy and lactation on drug pharmacokinetics. In this Part II of the series, 
      we consider other covariates, such as gender, heritable traits, age, body
      composition, and circadian rhythms. The impact of these factors with respect to
      predicting the relationship between dose and drug exposure characteristics within
      an animal population is illustrated through the use of Monte Carlo simulations.
      Ultimately, an appreciation of these potential influences will improve the
      prediction of situations when dose adjustments may be appropriate.

TI  - Bed sharing among black infants and sudden infant death syndrome: interactions
      with other known risk factors.
PG  - 376-82
LID - 10.1016/j.acap.2010.09.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bed sharing has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS) and may contribute to the racial disparity seen in infant mortality. It is
      unclear how bed sharing interacts with other factors to impact SIDS risk. We
      aimed to measure the effects of bed sharing on risk of SIDS in blacks and to
      determine whether the risk is modified by other characteristics of the sleep
      environment. METHODS: Characteristics of 195 black infants who died of SIDS were 
      compared with matched controls. The moderating influence of known SIDS risk
      factors on the effect of bed sharing on risk of SIDS was examined using logistic 
      regression. RESULTS: Almost half (47.4%) of the study population bed shared
      during the last/reference sleep (58% cases and 37% controls). Bed sharing was
      associated with 2 times greater risk of SIDS compared with not bed sharing. The
      deleterious effect of bed sharing was more pronounced with a soft sleep surface, 
      pillow use, maternal smoking, and younger infant age. However, bed sharing was
      still associated with an increased risk of SIDS, even when the infant was not
      using a pillow or sleeping on a firm surface. The strongest predictors of SIDS
      among bed-sharing infants were soft sleep surface, nonuse of a pacifier, and
      maternal smoking during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Bed sharing is a common practice 
      among black infants. It is associated with a clear and strong increased risk of
      SIDS, which is even greater when combined with other known risk factors for SIDS.
      This practice likely contributes to the excess incidence of SIDS among blacks,
      and culturally competent education methods must be developed to target this
      high-risk group.

TI  - Associations of early pregnancy sleep duration with trimester-specific blood
      pressures and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.
PG  - 1363-71
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual
      sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING:
      Clinic-based study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women.
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical
      records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in
      regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and
      95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and
      preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated.
      Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar 
      among women reporting to be short sleepers (< or = 6 h) vs. women reporting to
      sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy
      were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 
      3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting < or = 6 h 
      and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean
      3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (> or = 10
      h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with
      increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (< 5 h) and long (> or = 10
      h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for
      PE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that
      documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short 
      and long sleep duration.

TI  - Sleep restriction during pregnancy: hypertension and renal abnormalities in young
      offspring rats.
PG  - 1357-62
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Because the maternal environment can affect several
      physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to
      examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and 
      function in young offspring. DESIGN: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided 
      in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th 
      and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females 
      were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h
      daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and
      designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age,
      blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal
      plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number 
      of glomeruli per mm3 were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Offspring from SR 
      had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed
      significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced
      number of glomeruli per mm3 of renal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that
      sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting
      in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

TI  - Perinatal nutrient restriction induces long-lasting alterations in the circadian 
      expression pattern of genes regulating food intake and energy metabolism.
PG  - 990-1000
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2010.223 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence indicate that nutrient restriction during
      perinatal development sensitizes the offspring to the development of obesity,
      insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in adulthood via the programming of
      hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. Given the link between the circadian 
      clock and energy metabolism, and the resetting action of food on the circadian
      clock, in this study, we have investigated whether perinatal undernutrition
      affects the circadian expression rhythms of genes regulating food intake in the
      hypothalamus and energy metabolism in the liver. DESIGN: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley 
      rats were fed ad libitum either a control (20% protein) or a low-protein (8%
      protein) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, pups received a
      standard diet and at 17 and 35 days of age, their daily patterns of gene
      expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR experiments. RESULTS:
      17-day-old pups exposed to perinatal undernutrition exhibited significant
      alterations in the circadian expression profile of the transcripts encoding
      diverse genes regulating food intake, the metabolic enzymes fatty acid synthase
      and glucokinase as well as the clock genes BMAL1 and Period1. These effects
      persisted after weaning, were associated with hyperphagia and mirrored the
      results of the behavioral analysis of feeding. Thus, perinatally undernourished
      rats exhibited an increased hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic peptides
      agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y. Conversely, the mRNA levels of the
      anorexigenic peptides pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine and amphetamine-related
      transcripts were decreased. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that the
      circadian clock undergoes nutritional programming. The programming of the
      circadian clock may contribute to the alterations in feeding and energy
      metabolism associated with malnutrition in early life, which might promote the
      development of metabolic disorders in adulthood.

TI  - Sleep duration, vital exhaustion and perceived stress among pregnant migraineurs 
      and non-migraineurs.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-10-72 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine has been associated with sleep disorders in men and
      non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant
      migraineurs. METHODS: A cohort of 1,334 women was interviewed during early
      pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine
      diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during
      early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during
      early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to
      estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep
      duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived
      stress associated with a history of migraine. RESULTS: Approximately 19.4% of the
      cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the
      study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted
      ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early
      pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The
      corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy
      were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and
      statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive
      daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26).
      Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI
      1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31). Observed 
      associations were more pronounced among overweight migraineurs. CONCLUSIONS:
      These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep
      disorders among migraineurs; and extends the literature to include pregnant
      women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that
      mediate the apparent migraine-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the association of short sleep duration 
      among women in the first year postpartum with inflammation at 3 years postpartum.
      We studied 479 women in Project Viva, a prospective cohort. At 6 months and 1
      year postpartum, women reported the number of hours they slept in a 24-hour
      period, from which we calculated a weighted average of daily sleep. We used
      multivariable median regression analyses to predict the independent effects of
      short sleep duration (</=5 vs >5 h/d) on markers of inflammation, for example,
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein at 3 years postpartum. Women's mean
      (SD) hours of daily sleep in the first year postpartum was 6.7 (0.96) hours.
      After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, pre-pregnancy body
      mass index, excessive gestational weight gain, and gestational age at delivery,
      we found that postpartum sleep </=5 h/d was associated with elevated IL-6 (beta, 
      0.25 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.43) compared with >5 h/d. Although
      postpartum sleep </=5 h/d appeared to also be associated with elevated C-reactive
      protein (beta 0.15 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -0.08 to 0.52), these results 
      did not reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration in the first year
      postpartum is associated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory marker,
      IL-6, at 3 years postpartum.

AB  - AIMS: To perform a large and detailed epidemiologic study on restless legs
      syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in a European country. METHODS: A cross-sectional
      questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was distributed by the medical staff in
      different outpatient waiting rooms (obstetrics and gynecology department of the
      university hospital, obstetrics and gynecology department of a private clinic,
      private midwives, private obstetrician-gynecologists, radiological centers before
      fetal ultrasound examination and general practitioners) in a French town and its 
      surrounding area (200,000 inhabitants): A woman was considered affected if she
      met the International RLS Study Group criteria for RLS diagnosis. RESULTS: 1,022 
      pregnant women living in a French town were included. 24% of women were affected 
      by RLS during their pregnancy. The disease was strongly related to the third
      trimester of pregnancy and had a significant impact on sleep leading to severe
      nocturnal and diurnal consequences with a high consumption of sleep medication.
      CONCLUSIONS: RLS affects one quarter of pregnant women, essentially during the
      third trimester and represents an important public health issue with sleep
      medication intake.

TI  - Nutritional programming in the rat is linked to long-lasting changes in nutrient 
      sensing and energy homeostasis in the hypothalamus.
PG  - e13537
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0013537 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrient deficiency during perinatal development is associated with
      an increased risk to develop obesity, diabetes and hypertension in the adulthood.
      However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental programming of the
      metabolic syndrome remain largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Given 
      the essential role of the hypothalamus in the integration of nutritional,
      endocrine and neuronal cues, here we have analyzed the profile of the
      hypothalamus transcriptome in 180 days-old rats born to dams fed either a control
      (200 g/kg) or a low-protein (80 g/kg) diet through pregnancy and lactation. From 
      a total of 26 209 examined genes, 688 were up-regulated and 309 down-regulated
      (P<0.003) by early protein restriction. Further bioinformatic analysis of the
      data revealed that perinatal protein restriction permanently alters the
      expression of two gene clusters regulating common cellular processes. The first
      one includes several gate keeper genes regulating insulin signaling and nutrient 
      sensing. The second cluster encompasses a functional network of nuclear receptors
      and co-regulators of transcription involved in the detection and use of lipid
      nutrients as fuel which, in addition, link temporal and nutritional cues to
      metabolism through their tight interaction with the circadian clock.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these results indicate that the
      programming of the hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis is a key
      step in the development of obesity associated with malnutrition in early life and
      provide a valuable resource for further investigating the role of the
      hypothalamus in the programming of the metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Maturation-related changes in the pattern of renal sympathetic nerve activity
      from fetal life to adulthood.
PG  - 85-93
LID - 10.1113/expphysiol.2010.055236 [doi]
AB  - Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) has two main properties, the presence of
      co-ordinated bursts of activity, indicative of many nerve fibres firing at a
      similar time, and entrainment of the bursts to the cardiac cycle, due to
      inhibitory input from baroreceptors to a network of cell groups within the CNS.
      Although this patterning is used as a 'gold standard' for the identification of
      successful nerve recordings, the maturation of these basic features of SNA from
      fetal life to adulthood has not been investigated. Using a telemetry-based nerve 
      amplifier, renal SNA (RSNA) was recorded in preterm (99 +/- 1 days gestation;
      term 147 days) and near-term fetal sheep (119 +/- 0 days gestation), without
      anaesthesia or paralysis, and contrasted with RSNA recorded in adult sheep. All
      three age groups showed a classic bursting pattern of RSNA and co-ordination of
      bursts with the cardiac cycle. However, the delay between diastole and the next
      peak in RSNA was longest in preterm fetuses (319 +/- 1 ms), compared with
      near-term fetuses (250 +/- 13 ms), and shortest in the adult sheep (174 +/- 38
      ms). This was independent of the maturational decrease in heart rate. The
      near-term fetuses showed a marked but sleep-state-dependent increase in resting
      RSNA compared with preterm fetuses. Although entrainment with the pressure pulse 
      suggests that the intricate circuitry within the CNS is developed in the preterm 
      fetus, the decrease in the length of the delay suggests continuing maturation of 
      this key feature of RSNA in the last third of gestation and after birth.

TI  - Habitual snoring in school-aged children: environmental and biological
      predictors.
PG  - 144
LID - 10.1186/1465-9921-11-144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, 
      is an important indicator for a number of health problems in children. Compared
      to adults, large epidemiological studies on childhood habitual snoring and
      associated predisposing factors are extremely scarce. The present study aimed to 
      assess the prevalence and associated factors of habitual snoring among Chinese
      school-aged children. METHODS: A random sample of 20,152 children aged 5.08 to
      11.99 years old participated in a cross-sectional survey, which was conducted in 
      eight cities of China. Parent-administrated questionnaires were used to collect
      information on children's snoring frequency and the possible correlates. RESULTS:
      The prevalence of habitual snoring was 12.0% (14.5% for boys vs. 9.5% for girls) 
      in our sampled children. Following factors were associated with an increased risk
      for habitual snoring: lower family income (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.46),
      lower father's education (OR = 1.38 and 1.14 for middle school or under and high 
      school of educational level, respectively), breastfeeding duration < 6 months (OR
      = 1.17), pregnancy maternal smoking (OR = 1.51), obesity (OR = 1.50), overweight 
      (OR = 1.35), several respiratory problems associated with atopy and infection,
      such as chronic/allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.94), asthma (OR = 1.43), adenotonsillar
      hypertrophy (OR = 2.17), and chronic otitis media (OR = 1.31), and family history
      of habitual snoring (OR = 1.70). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of habitual snoring
      in Chinese children was similar to that observed in other countries. The
      potential predisposing factors covered socioeconomic characteristics,
      environmental exposures, chronic health problems, and family susceptibility.
      Compared to socioeconomic status and family susceptibility, environmental
      exposures and chronic health problems had greater impact, indicating childhood
      habitual snoring could be partly prevented by health promotion and environmental 
      intervention.

TI  - The DSM IV diagnoses of melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy.
PG  - 43-8
LID - 10.1007/s00737-010-0187-x [doi]
AB  - Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological
      psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for 
      the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these
      subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical
      Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM
      IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and
      non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed.
      Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non
      specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the
      cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in 
      pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non
      specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and
      melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during
      pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and
      sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and
      atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific
      definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis 
      for these findings warrant further research.

TI  - An update on idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
PG  - e56-68
AB  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology
      often encountered in neurologic practice. It produces nonlocalizing symptoms and 
      signs of raised intracranial pressure and, when left untreated, can result in
      severe irreversible visual loss. It most commonly occurs in obese women of
      childbearing age, but it can also occur in children, men, nonobese adults, and
      older adults. Although it is frequently associated with obesity, it can be
      associated with other conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea and transverse 
      cerebral venous sinus stenoses. Recent identification of subgroups at high risk
      for irreversible visual loss, including black patients, men, and patients with
      fulminant forms of IIH, help guide the optimal management and follow-up. Ongoing 
      studies of venous anatomy and physiology in IIH patients, as well as a recently
      begun randomized clinical treatment trial, should provide further insight into
      this common yet poorly understood syndrome.

TI  - [Comparison of dinoprostone (ovules and gel) to achieve cervical ripening in
      patients with term pregnancy that occurs with premature membranes rupture].
PG  - 110-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature rupture of membranes is a normal occurrence of labor and
      can occur before or after the onset of contractions. The clinical factors
      associated with premature rupture of membranes include: low socioeconomic status,
      low body mass index, prior preterm pregnancies, smoking, sexually transmitted
      infections and urinary tract, conization, cervical cerclage and amniocentesis.
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prolonged release of the vaginal insert of PGE2 is
      superior to dinoprostone gel to achieve cervical ripening in patients with term
      pregnancy that occur with premature rupture of membranes. MATERIAL AND METHOD:
      Randomized clinical trial in the surgical unit of play in a period of 6 months,
      with an estimated sample of 50 patients was randomized by block table. After
      assessment confirming rupture of membranes, Bishop Score and meeting inclusion
      criteria, group A was applied PGE2 intracervical gel 0.5 mg with a maximum of 3
      doses, every 6 hours. Group B was administered at vaginal insert of PGE2 single
      dose for 24 hours, the patient was left to sleep 30 minutes cardio
      toco-monitoring chart for at least 2 hours after application. RESULTS: The
      average time to maturity was 310.59 minutes with a standard deviation of 198.7
      and concluded that there was no significant difference between the onset of
      uterine activity and the onset of labor among the prolonged release dinoprostone 
      and alternatives such as the gel cervical for cervical ripening. CONCLUSIONS:
      Either this is a good choice to ripen the cervix in patients with term pregnancy 
      and premature rupture of membranes.

TI  - Dynamics of sleep-wake cyclicity across the fetal period in sheep (Ovis aries).
PG  - 89-95
LID - 10.1002/dev.20495 [doi]
AB  - All adult mammals examined thus far exhibit sleep bout durations that follow an
      exponential distribution and wake bout durations that follow a power-law
      distribution. In altricial rodents such as rats and mice, exponential
      distributions of sleep bouts are found soon after birth, but the power-law
      distribution of wake bouts does not emerge until the third postnatal week. Also, 
      both sleep and bouts consolidate across the early postnatal period. It is not
      known whether similar developmental processes occur in precocial species during
      the prenatal period. Here we characterize sleep-wake development in a precocial
      species, the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), from 114 to 148 days gestational age
      (DGA). Sleep and wake bout durations exhibited exponential distributions
      throughout the fetal period with some evidence of an emerging
      exponential-to-power-law transition for wake bouts toward the end of gestation.
      Both sleep and wake bouts consolidated in an orderly fashion across development
      and there was little evidence of circadian variation, even in the oldest
      subjects. These results indicate that similar patterns of sleep-wake organization
      are found prenatally in a precocial species as are found postnatally in altricial
      species. Data from more species are needed to fully realize the benefits of a
      developmental comparative approach for understanding the forces that have shaped 
      the ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian sleep.

AB  - The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually
      during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat, this period lasts
      from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th day of postnatal
      development. The circadian system of fetuses and newborn pups is entrained mostly
      by nonphotic maternal cues during prenatal and early postnatal development. The
      aim of the present study was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a 
      restricted feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN
      of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an entraining
      cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were entrained to an external 
      light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under conditions when the external timing signal
      was lacking, i.e., under constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad
      libitum and the experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during 
      their resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene
      expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of 1-day-old pups.
      The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept under LD cycle did not
      notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of pups. 
      The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression did not exhibit circadian
      rhythms in pups born to mothers maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due
      to desynchrony among the pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats
      kept under LL restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in
      the SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock is
      dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN. However, under
      conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking, such as LL, regular food
      intake of the mothers may also play an important role in synchronization of the
      fetal SCN clock during prenatal ontogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the variation of protein excretion in short-interval
      day-and-night collections in hospitalized preeclamptic patients on continuous bed
      rest. METHODS: We prospectively studied 50 patients admitted to the hospital with
      the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Urine volumes in 2-, 4-, 12-, and 24-h durations
      were recorded. Protein concentrations in different volumes of urine were
      measured. Paired t-test was used to compare the volumes, concentrations, and the 
      total amounts of protein in these samples of different durations. RESULTS: There 
      was no significant difference in the volume of urine and the concentration of
      proteinuria in the day when compared to night (12-h samples) (p > 0.05). The
      total amount of protein excreted was comparable for the two durations of samples.
      For shorter-duration collections (4- and 2-h), the difference in proteinuria
      between day and night samples remained blunted. CONCLUSION: This study concludes 
      that there is blunting of variation in protein excretion as observed in
      short-interval urine collections at different times of the day in hypertensive
      pregnant patients on continuous bed rest.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing and pregnancy: potential mechanisms and evidence for
      maternal and fetal morbidity.
PG  - 574-82
LID - 10.1097/MCP.0b013e32833f0d55 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews current data on pathophysiologic
      mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy may cause harm,
      and explores biological pathways for associated adverse maternal and fetal
      outcomes, especially pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating data indicate that snoring and sleep apnea during
      pregnancy are likely to increase the risk for gestational hypertension and
      preeclampsia. Several new studies have observed that sleep-disordered breathing
      and short sleep duration also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, similar 
      to observations in the general population. There are varying levels of emerging
      evidence for potential mechanisms, including oxidative stress, increased
      sympathetic activity and inflammation, adipokine levels and insulin resistance,
      linking sleep-disordered breathing events during pregnancy to adverse outcomes.
      SUMMARY: Sleep-disordered breathing and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes such as
      preeclampsia and gestational diabetes share a number of mechanistic pathways, and
      growing data in pregnant women indicate that snoring and sleep apnea increase the
      risk of these and other complications for both the mother and the fetus.
      Nevertheless, direct evidence of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which
      sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy exerts negative effects remains
      sparse.

TI  - Does early mismatched nutrition predispose to hypertension and atherosclerosis,
      in male mice?
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0012656 [doi]
LID - e12656 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A link between early mismatched nutritional environment and
      development of components of the metabolic syndrome later in life has been shown 
      in epidemiological and animal data. The aim of this study was to investigate
      whether an early mismatched nutrition produced by catch-up growth after fetal
      protein restriction could induce the appearance of hypertension and/or
      atherosclerosis in adult male mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Wild-type
      C57BL6/J or LDLr-/- dams were fed a low protein (LP) or a control (C) diet during
      gestation. Catch-up growth was induced in LP offspring by feeding dams with a
      control diet and by culling the litter to 4 pups against 8 in controls. At
      weaning, male mice were fed either standard chow or an obesogenic diet (OB),
      leading to 4 experimental groups. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were
      assessed in conscious unrestrained wild-type mice by telemetry. Atherosclerosis
      plaque area was measured in aortic root sections of LDLr-/- mice. We found that: 
      (1) postnatal OB diet increased significantly BP (P<0.0001) and HR (P<0.008) in
      3-month old OB-C and OB-LP offspring, respectively; (2) that maternal LP diet
      induced a significant higher BP (P<0.009) and HR (P<0.004) and (3) an altered
      circadian rhythm in addition to higher plasma corticosterone concentration in 9
      months-old LP offspring; (4) that, although LP offspring showed higher plasma
      total cholesterol than control offspring, atherosclerosis assessed in aortic
      roots of 6-mo old mice featured increased plaque area due to OB feeding but not
      due to early mismatched nutrition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results
      indicate a long-term effect of early mismatched nutrition on the appearance of
      hypertension independently of obesity, while no effect on atherosclerosis was
      noticed at this age.

AB  - Bariatric surgery is intended for subjects with BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2) or >/= 35
      kg/m(2) with comorbidities. In any case, the indication can only be envisaged in 
      patients who have had access to specialized medical care, and agree with a
      prolonged medical follow-up. After 60 years old, physiological age and
      comorbidities need to be highly considered. In genetic obesity and
      craniopharyngioma, surgery is exceptional. Main contraindications consist in
      severe disorders in feeding behaviour, non-stabilized psychiatric disorders,
      alcoholism, drug addiction, inability to participate in prolonged medical
      follow-up. Surgical process includes many important stages: preparation and
      information by a multidisciplinary team (identify contraindication, give optimal 
      information, look for and treat comorbidities [as sleep apneoas syndrome,
      diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease], assess nutritional and psychological status
      and feeding behaviour); the decision of intervention during a concerted analysis 
      by a multidisciplinary team; follow-up (for life) led to screen for nutritional
      deficiencies and surgical complications, to reinforce diet and physical activity 
      counselling, to adapt to new situations (as pregnancy), and advise psychological 
      care if necessary.

PG  - 513-23
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.08.057 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change as female mammals transition 
      from one reproductive state to another. The mechanisms responsible for this
      plasticity are poorly understood. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
      hypothalamus contains the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals, and a large
      portion of its efferent projections terminate in the ventral subparaventricular
      zone (vSPZ), which also plays important roles in rhythm regulation. To determine 
      whether these regions might mediate changes in overt rhythms during early
      pregnancy, we first compared rhythms in Fos and Per2 protein expression in the
      SCN and vSPZ of diestrous and early pregnant rats maintained in a 12:12-h
      light/dark (LD) cycle. No differences in the Fos rhythm were seen in the SCN
      core, but in the SCN shell, elevated Fos expression was maintained throughout the
      light phase in pregnant, but not diestrous, rats. In the vSPZ, the Fos rhythm was
      bimodal in diestrous rats, but this rhythm was lost in pregnant rats. Peak Per2
      expression was phase-advanced by 4 h in the SCN of pregnant rats, and some
      differences in Per2 expression were found in the vSPZ as well. To determine
      whether differences in Fos expression were due to altered responsivity to light, 
      we next characterized light-induced Fos expression in the SCN and vSPZ of
      pregnant and diestrous rats in the mid-subjective day and night. We found that
      the SCN core of the two groups responded in the same way at each time of day,
      whereas the rhythm of Fos responsivity in the SCN shell and vSPZ differed between
      diestrous and pregnant rats. These results indicate that the SCN and vSPZ are
      functionally re-organized during early pregnancy, particularly in how they
      respond to the photic environment. These changes may contribute to changes in
      overt behavioral and physiological rhythms that occur at this time.

      offspring did not show circadian rhythms of MDH (N = 62) and LDH (N = 63)
      activities (cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher). They presented a 44.7% decrease in
      open-arm entries and a 67.9% decrease in time (plus-maze test, N = 15, P < 0.001,
      Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test), an increase in mounting (94.4%),
      intromission (94.5%) and ejaculation (56.6%) latencies (N = 12, P < 0.01,
      Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test) and lower numbers of these events
      (61, 59 and 73%, respectively; P < 0.01, N = 12) compared to controls. The
      offspring of the LL+Mel group presented MDH and LDH circadian rhythms (P < 0.05, 
      N = 50, cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher), anxiety-like and sexual behaviors similar 
      to control. These findings supported the importance of the melatonin signal and
      provide evidence for the protective effects of hormones on maternal programming
      during gestation. This protective action of melatonin is probably related to its 
      entrainment capacity, favoring internal coupling of the fetal multioscillatory
      system.

AB  - The modern living standard has imposed upon society a situation of chronic sleep 
      deprivation. This chronic loss of sleep affects women more than it does men. As a
      result, the postponement of pregnancy has become a common choice due to the
      priority given to social and domestic activities. For women, pregnancy represents
      a condition of intense physical and physiological changes that subject the
      pregnant woman to a number of potentially stressful situations, ultimately
      interfering with their quality of sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation, along with
      the changes imposed on women through pregnancy, can lead to several harmful
      consequences for the pregnant woman and the child, and can potentially undermine 
      the mother-infant relationship. This article discusses circumstances under which 
      sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality during pregnancy could result in damage 
      to the mother-infant relationship, specifically through maternal fatigue,
      postpartum depression and changes in pregnancy-related hormonal secretions and
      activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study examines the role of psychosocial-behavioral
      variables as predictors of elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) at
      14-20 weeks of gestation. METHOD: One hundred and twenty women were enrolled into
      the study. Blood samples were collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed
      for CRH. Participants completed questionnaires that included the Perceived Stress
      Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, the
      Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety (PAS) Scale, the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire,
      the Life Orientation Test, the Brief COPE scale, and questions regarding
      violence/abuse, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns. RESULTS: Pregnant
      women with high CRH levels (15 pcg/ml and above) perceived their income to be
      inadequate, slept more hours at night, stood more hours during the day, and used 
      the coping styles of disengagement or religion but not humor. Logistic regression
      identified three predictors for high CRH (accounting for 42.2% of the variance): 
      perceived inadequacy of income and the use of ''religion'' and ''disengagement'' 
      to cope with stress. CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first known to identify
      coping style and perceived income inadequacy as predictors of high CRH. Women
      with perceived inadequacy of income had almost three times the odds for high CRH.
      Women who used religion or disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7
      times the odds for high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are
      associated with preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include
      maternal coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future
      investigations of CRH levels and PTB.

TI  - Maternal sleep and depressive symptoms: links with infant Negative Affectivity.
PG  - 605-12
LID - 10.1016/j.infbeh.2010.07.012 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and
      disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher 
      Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this
      study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the
      efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The
      present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic 
      follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal
      sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior
      Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R). Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal
      depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling
      Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the 
      IBQ-R Sadness scale. Our findings support previous findings of significant links 
      between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her
      infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with
      perceived sadness of the infant.

AB  - AIMS: To determine risk factors for miscarriage. METHODS: A case control study
      was carried out at the gynaecological wards and antenatal clinics of the De Soysa
      Maternity Hospital in Sri Lanka. A case was defined as that of mothers with a
      confirmed diagnosis of partial or full expulsion of the fetus during the first 28
      weeks of gestation. Controls comprised ante-natal clinic attendees whose period
      of gestation was <28 weeks and carrying a viable fetus. Two hundred and thirty
      cases and 504 controls were selected. A pre-tested interviewer-administered
      questionnaire and modified life events inventory were used to gather data.
      Multivariate logistic regression was applied separately for first and second
      trimester miscarriages and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and as 
      95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Sleeping < or =8 h/day (OR:3.80, 95% 
      CI:1.01-14.3) was found to be a risk factor for first trimester miscarriage
      controlling for the effect of period of gestation. Sleeping < or =8 h/day
      (OR:2.04, 95% CI:1.24-3.37), standing < or =3 h/day (OR:1.83, 95% CI:1.08-3.10), 
      exposure to cooking smoke (OR:3.83, 95% CI:1.50-9.90) and physical trauma during 
      the pregnancy (OR:43.2, 95% CI:4.55-411.4) were found to be risk factors for
      second trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sleep deprivation, a sedentary lifestyle, exposure to cooking smoke 
      and physical trauma during pregnancy were risk factors for miscarriage. Most of
      the risk factors are therefore modifiable.

PG  - 568-78
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2010.00845.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Psychotic disorders have a high rate of relapse in the postpartum
      period for reasons that are unclear, but may be related to changes in sleep
      patterns that occur during pregnancy and after birth. Understanding of the
      influence of sleep on postpartum psychosis presentation is limited. The aim of
      the current study was to investigate changes in sleep/wake activity during
      pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with a history of psychosis.
      METHODS: Women with a history of bipolar disorder and/or postpartum psychosis
      (HxW) were recruited (n = 23) together with a control population (CtW) (n = 15). 
      Data on demographic and psychosocial factors, mental health status, and
      sleep/wake activity were collected at seven timepoints-the last week of each
      trimester of pregnancy and four times during the postpartum (weeks 1, 4, and 8,
      and at month 6). Longitudinal data were analysed using an HLM version 6
      repeated-measures multilevel model. RESULTS: No significant differences were
      noted in sleep/wake activity between HxW and CtW. None of the HxW who were taking
      a mood stabilizer during their pregnancy, including at delivery, relapsed during 
      the study. Of those taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or no medication, 
      3 relapsed within the first six months and 2 within the first two months. HxW
      were more likely to report a poor partner relationship than CtW. CONCLUSION:
      Results suggest that during the perinatal period, there is no difference in
      sleep/wake activity in women with a history of a psychotic disorder. Use of mood 
      stabilizer during pregnancy and at delivery appears important in preventing
      psychotic relapse in the postpartum.

TI  - Changes in sleep quality, but not hormones predict time to postpartum depression 
      recurrence.
PG  - 378-84
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2010.07.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased
      inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major
      depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones
      during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and
      their association with PPMD recurrence. METHODS: Participants were pregnant women
      (N=56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current
      pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were
      collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and 
      cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by
      two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores>/=15
      and clinician interview. RESULTS: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence,
      poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence
      (p<.05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point
      increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by
      approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and
      IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (chi(2)=0.98, p=.32). CONCLUSIONS: Poor
      sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for
      recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu 
      were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which
      poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are
      involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.

TI  - [Measurement of the passive compliance of the total respiratory system in newborn
      after respiratory insufficiency for risk assessment of respiratory disorders
      during the first 6 month of life].
PG  - 350-4
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the relationships between postnatal passive respiratory
      compliance (Crs) and development of respiratory disorders during the first 6
      month of life in preterm and full-term infants after respiratory insufficiency.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether other relevant neonatal
      factors, like degree of prematurity, birth weigh, ventilatory conditions, sepsis,
      and respiratory disease severity affected this relationship. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The passive respiratory compliance was measured by the single occlusion 
      technique in 73 preterm infants after respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 19
      full-term infants after congenital pneumonia and 33 healthy full-term infants.
      Respiratory function measurements were performed by single occlusion technique,
      during natural sleep, after acute phase of illness, before discharge from
      neonatal department. RESULTS: Crs was significantly lower in premature newborns <
      36 weeks gestation after RDS (p = 0.0002) and in term newborns who have suffered 
      from a congenital pneumonia (p = 0.0411), than in healthy full-term newborn
      infants. Premature infants who have undergone sepsis have significantly decreased
      Crs in relationship with those who did not have this complication (p = 0.0334).
      Preterm newborns who have suffered pneumonia during treatment of RDS have
      significantly frequent respiratory problems during the first 6 month of age (p = 
      0.043). Full-term infants after congenital pneumonia have more but not
      significantly frequent respiratory problems than healthy term newborns (p =
      0.055) in this period. Decreased neonatal Crs wasn't significantly related to
      respiratory disorders in age of 6 month of life. CONCLUSION: Prematurity under 36
      week of gestational age, low birth weight and suffering from sepsis in premature 
      infants significantly decreased Crs in newborn. Decreased neonatal Crs in
      premature and full term infants after respiratory insufficiency wasn't
      significantly related to respiratory disorders during first 6 month of life. This
      study has showed significantly increase of respiratory problems in this period in
      preterm infants who have suffered from pneumonia during neonatal period.

TI  - Tackling obesity in adult primary care.
PG  - 31-2, 34, 3
AB  - Obesity is a growing problem. In England in 2008, 66% of men and 57% of women had
      a BMI >25 kg/m2; within this 24% of men and 25% of women were obese with a BMI
      >30 kg/m2. Obesity is a major contributing cause of disease. The relative risk
      (RR) of diabetes in overweight men is 2.40 and in obese men 6.74 compared with
      men with a BMI in the normal range. The respective RR values in women are 3.92
      and 12.41. There is a 40% increased risk of death from CVD for every 5 kg/m2
      increase in BMI above 25 kg/m2. Obesity is also associated with a raised risk of:
      fertility problems, cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, pregnancy complications,
      obstructive sleep apnoea and asthma. Patients should be offered advice on dietary
      change and increasing physical activity which includes behavioural components.
      Encouragement to make small changes in a sustained way can make significant
      differences to energy balance. Physical activity should be of moderate intensity 
      (increased heart rate and breathing but still able to converse). Drug treatment
      is a useful addition when lifestyle measures alone are not effective. Evidence is
      increasing for the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in treating obesity-related
      disease, particularly diabetes.

TI  - Keeping newborns warm: beliefs, practices and potential for behaviour change in
      rural Ghana.
PG  - 1118-24
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02593.x [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to collect data on thermal care practices in
      rural Ghana to inform the design of a community newborn intervention. METHODS:
      All 635 women who delivered in six districts in Ghana in the first 2 weeks of
      December 2006 were interviewed about immediate newborn care. Qualitative data on 
      thermal care practices and barriers and facilitators to behaviour change were
      collected from recently delivered/pregnant women, birth attendants/grandmothers, 
      and husband through birth narratives, in-depth interviews and focus group
      discussion. RESULTS: Respondents knew that keeping the baby warm was essential
      for health but 71% of babies born at home had delayed drying, 79% delayed
      wrapping, 93% early bathing and 10% were placed skin-to-skin. Birth attendants
      were usually in charge of mother and baby immediately after birth. Delays in
      drying/wrapping were linked to leaving the baby unattended until the placenta was
      delivered. Early bathing was linked to reducing body odour in later life, shaping
      the baby's head, and helping the baby sleep and feel clean. Respondents thought
      that changing bathing behaviours would be difficult, especially as babies are
      bathed early in facilities. The concept of skin-to-skin care was easily
      understood and most women said they would try it if it was good for the baby.
      CONCLUSION: Thermal care is a key component of community newborn interventions,
      the design of which should be based on an understanding of current behaviours and
      beliefs. Formative research can help select focus behaviours, decide who to
      include in interventions, ensure consistent messages and determine what messages 
      and approaches are needed to overcome behaviour change barriers.

TI  - Which family members use the best nets? An analysis of the condition of mosquito 
      nets and their distribution within households in Tanzania.
PG  - 211
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-9-211 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Household ownership of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) is
      increasing, and coverage targets have been revised to address universal coverage 
      with ITNs. However, many households do not have enough nets to cover everyone,
      and the nets available vary in physical condition and insecticide treatment
      status. Since 2004, the Government of Tanzania has been implementing the Tanzania
      National Voucher Scheme (TNVS), which distributes vouchers for ITNs through
      antenatal clinics to target pregnant women and their infants. This analysis aimed
      to determine the following: (1) coverage patterns of bed nets within households
      according to physical condition and treatment status; (2) who might be at risk if
      mosquitoes were diverted from occupants of untreated nets to those not using
      nets? (3) the degree to which those at highest risk of malaria use the most
      protective nets. METHODS: Data from the 2006 TNVS household survey were analysed 
      to assess within-household distribution of net use. The associations between net 
      characteristics and net user were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis was
      applied to the relationship between the number of holes per net and user
      characteristics while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: In households with a
      net:person ratio better than 1:4 (one net for every four household members), more
      than 80% of the people in such households reported using a net the previous
      night. ITNs were most likely to be used by infants, young children (1-4 y), and
      women of childbearing age; they were least likely to be used by older women
      (>or=50 y), older children (5-14 y), and adult men. The nets used by infants and 
      women of childbearing age were in better-than-average physical condition; the
      nets used by older women and older children were in worse-than-average condition;
      while young children and adult men used nets in intermediate (average) condition.
      When adjusted for confounders, the nets used by young and older children had more
      holes than nets used by infants. CONCLUSIONS: Infants and other vulnerable groups
      were most likely to sleep under the most protective nets. Nevertheless, more
      communication efforts are needed to increase use of intact ITNs within households
      for children. Further research is necessary to fully understand motivations
      influencing within-household net distribution.

TI  - A practice guide for continuous opioid therapy for refractory daily headache:
      patient selection, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring.
PG  - 1175-93
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01733.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a guide to the use and limitations of continuous opioid
      therapy (COT, or daily scheduled opioids) for refractory daily headache, based on
      the best available evidence and expert clinical experience. BACKGROUND: There has
      been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with
      limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and
      increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To
      date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting
      patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring. METHODS: A
      multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with
      extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache
      patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and
      clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December
      2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects
      the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American
      Headache Society. RESULTS: The guide identifies factors that would qualify or
      disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to
      initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a
      formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and
      functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT
      in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced
      hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan
      and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea 
      and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden
      cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy,
      neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric
      disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%)
      of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing
      headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative
      and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT
      trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety.

TI  - The uterus sustains stable biological clock during pregnancy.
PG  - 287-98
AB  - Maternal circadian information has been reported to play an important role in
      fetal physiology and development. Hormones and nutrition have been mainly
      investigated as circadian cues from mother to fetus. However, the influences of
      circadian properties of the pregnant reproductive organs on fetuses have not been
      fully investigated. To gain an insight on the circadian functions of the
      reproductive organs, we examined molecular clocks in the pregnant rat uterus and 
      placenta. By using a Period1-luciferase (Per1-luc) rat, whose tissues express
      luciferase corresponding to activation of Period1, a "key clock gene", we
      examined the uterus clock during non-pregnancy, on embryonic day 12 (E12), and on
      E22 (the end of pregnancy) in a light-dark (LD) cycle and constant darkness (DD).
      By in situ hybridization we further explored Per1 mRNA rhythms in the placenta on
      E12 and E22. The uterus in vitro showed clear circadian Per1-luc rhythms both in 
      and out of pregnancy, having peaks at around the time corresponding to dusk in
      LD. Likewise, in DD, the uterus in vitro had the same Per1-luc rhythms. The
      decidua in LD showed circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms, peaking during night 6 h after 
      dusk, while the decidua in DD showed the same Per1 mRNA rhythms only on E22. In
      contrast, the labyrinth showed no circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms in LD or DD during 
      pregnancy. These results suggest that the uterus and decidua, a
      maternally-originated tissue of the placenta, but not the labyrinth, a
      fetus-originated tissue of the placenta, can provide the fetus with circadian
      information.

AB  - In many modern societies, the proportion of women who delay childbearing beyond
      the age of 35 years has increased greatly in recent decades. They are falsely
      reassured by popular beliefs that advances in new reproductive technologies can
      compensate for the age-realted decline in fertility, but science cannot beat the 
      biological clock. Age is the single most important determinant of male and female
      fertility, either natural or treated. The consequences of advancing maternal age 
      are not only for the risk of natural and assisted conception, but also for the
      outcome of pregnancy. Female fertility has a 'best-before date' of 35, and for
      men, it is probably before age 45-50.

TI  - Is insomnia in late pregnancy a risk factor for postpartum depression/depressive 
      symptomatology?
PG  - 272-80
LID - 10.1016/j.psychres.2010.06.029 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present work was to investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a
      risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD).
      581 women in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires 
      about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and
      depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese version of
      the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers 
      participated again in the study. Insomnia in pregnancy was not a risk factor for 
      PPD (DSM-IV or ICD-10) but was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive
      symptomatology. Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum
      depressive symptomatology. Women with higher NA were 4.6 (CI95%=1.69-12.74) and
      5.3 times (CI95%=2.26-12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (DSM-IV/ICD-10,
      respectively) than women with lower NA. Lifetime Depression was a significant
      predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and ICD-10/PPD (OR=2.6;
      CI95%=1.16-4.38). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be a protective factor for
      postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR=1.5; CI95%=1.20-2.33).
      Controlling NA, PA and Lifetime Depression, insomnia lost its predictive role,
      suggesting these variables might work as mediators. Associations between
      insomnia, NA, PA and Lifetime Depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This
      might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of
      experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology.

PG  - 1034-9
LID - 10.3109/00016349.2010.499446 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to identify latent phase
      predictors of active labor duration. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING:
      Two delivery units in Sweden. SAMPLE: Healthy nulliparous women with a normal
      pregnancy, spontaneous onset of active labor at term, and a cervical dilatation
      of 4 cm or more on admission to the delivery ward (n = 2,072). METHODS: The women
      were asked to answer questions concerning their food and fluid intake, amount of 
      rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours and to assess their labor pain,
      sense of security and expectations of the childbirth on a visual analog scale
      (VAS). Duration and intervals of contractions, cervical dilatation, and position 
      of the fetal head were noted by the midwife. A multiple regression analysis was
      performed with active labor duration as the outcome variable. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Predictive factors of active labor duration. RESULTS: Normal food intake
      during the preceding 24 hours was associated with short labor duration. A long
      latent phase, low levels of assessed labor pain and few hours of rest and sleep
      during the preceding 24 hours were significant independent predictors of extended
      active labor duration, when high birth weight, long contraction intervals, slight
      cervical dilatation, intact membranes within 2 hours of admission, high maternal 
      age and malposition of the fetal head were controlled for. CONCLUSION: New
      findings are that latent phase duration as well as food intake and the amount of 
      rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours are independent predictors of labor 
      duration.

AB  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in
      offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk 
      for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and
      their child's sleep 4-7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression
      Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores >/=20 reported more sleep problems in their child,
      and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More
      research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression
      and sleep in offspring.

PG  - 1366-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome 
      (SAHS) and preeclampsia and the possible pathogenesis of the latter. METHODS:
      Twenty-five healthy pregnant women, 43 pregnant women with preeclampsia, and 27
      with preeclampsia complicated by SAHS were enrolled in this study. Apnea-hypopnea
      index (AHI) and the lowest arterial oxygen saturation (LSaO2) were measured
      through a 7-hour polysomnography (PSG), and the maternal age, gestational age,
      body mass index and 24-hour urine protein were recorded. RESULTS: All the indexes
      except for the maternal age and gestational age showed significant differences
      between the 3 groups. The two groups of preeclampsia patients showed a
      significant difference in BMI from the control cases. Significant positive
      correlations of AHI to BMI, MAP and 24-hour urine protein were noted; LSaO2 was
      found to inversely correlate to BMI, MAP, and 24-hour urine protein. In spite of 
      the significant correlation of BMI to the other indexes, we found that BMI was
      less important than AHI and LSaO2. CONCLUSION: SAHS may induce or aggravate
      preeclampsia. Greater attention should be given to the presence of SAHS in
      pregnant women with obesity, but obesity is not the predominant predisposing
      factor for preeclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of depression; investigate
      its association with risk factors including comorbidities and drug and health
      care use; and describe treatment patterns of depression in primary care using The
      Health Improvement Network database. METHOD: In this cohort study, subjects with 
      a first recorded diagnosis of depression (Read code) between January 1, 2002, and
      December 31, 2004 (n=47,170) were identified from a source population of
      1,287,829 subjects aged 10-79 years. A comparison group was sampled from the same
      population and frequency matched to the depression cohort by age, sex, and
      calendar year (n=50,000). Depression diagnoses were validated using
      physician-completed questionnaires. Odds ratios and 95% CIs for the relationship 
      of depression with a range of factors were estimated using unconditional logistic
      regression in a nested case-control analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      depression was 11.23% (95% CI, 11.18-11.28). This prevalence decreased with
      increasing age and was higher in women than in men. The incidence was 13.89 per
      1,000 person-years (95% CI, 13.82-14.08). Depression was associated with frequent
      use of health services, smoking, pregnancy in the previous year, anxiety, stress,
      sleep disorders, digestive and respiratory disorders, and pain. In the trimester 
      following diagnosis, 82% of cases were treated-98% with antidepressants and 81.5%
      with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). CONCLUSIONS: We found a
      high prevalence and incidence of depression diagnoses in primary care in the
      United Kingdom. Following diagnosis, the majority of individuals were prescribed 
      SSRIs. A diagnosis of depression is associated with a number of prior
      comorbidities, which could mask the depression. This fact should be taken into
      account when screening individuals in primary care.

TI  - Prenatal and perinatal complications: is it the link between race and SES and
      childhood sleep disordered breathing?
PG  - 264-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence has suggested that low socioeconomic status
      (SES), race, prematurity, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated
      with childhood sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We investigated (1) the
      association of SDB with a wide range of risk factors, including prenatal and
      perinatal complications; (2) the association of these complications with SES and 
      race; and (3) the association of SDB with developmental milestones. METHODS: Six 
      hundred thirteen school-aged children (105 clinically referred and 508 community 
      control subjects) underwent overnight polysomnography and had a complete history 
      and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was
      completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB to
      population-based control children without SDB from The Penn State Children's
      Cohort. RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy; maternal age and weight gain 
      during pregnancy; prenatal complications, such as maternal high blood pressure
      and gestational diabetes; perinatal complications related to prematurity; delayed
      motor milestones; race and SES were significantly associated with the presence of
      childhood SDB. Most of the risk factors became nonsignificant when analyses
      controlled for race and SES. Delayed motor milestones remained significantly
      associated with SDB after controlling for race and SES. CONCLUSION: These data
      suggest that there is a significant association between children who experience
      prenatal or perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe
      childhood SDB. SES and race may be mediating the impact on SDB through increased 
      prenatal and perinatal risks. The significant delay in motor milestones suggests 
      that prenatal and perinatal distress may result in neurologic insult, which could
      influence the development of SDB in later childhood.

TI  - Perioperative seizures in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.
PG  - 729-35
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181e534a4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of perioperative seizures in patients with a
      preexisting seizure disorder is unclear. There are several factors unique to the 
      perioperative period that may increase a patient's risk of perioperative
      seizures, including medications administered, timing of medication
      administration, missed doses of antiepileptic medications, and sleep deprivation.
      We designed this retrospective chart review to evaluate the frequency of
      perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with a documented
      history of a seizure disorder who received an anesthetic between January 1, 2002 
      and December 31, 2007. Patients excluded from this study include those who had an
      outpatient procedure or intracranial procedure, ASA classification of V, pregnant
      women, and patients younger than 2 years of age. The first hospital admission of 
      at least 24 hours during which an anesthetic was provided was identified for each
      patient. Patient demographics, character of the seizure disorder, details of the 
      surgical procedure, and clinically apparent seizure activity in the perioperative
      period (within 3 days after the anesthetic) were recorded. RESULTS: During the
      6-year study period, 641 patients with a documented seizure disorder were
      admitted for at least 24 hours after an anesthetic. Twenty-two patients
      experienced perioperative seizure activity for an overall frequency of 3.4%(95%
      confidence interval, 2.2%-5.2%). The frequency of preoperative seizures (P <
      0.001) and the timing of the most recent seizure (P < 0.001) were both found to
      be significantly related to the likelihood of experiencing a perioperative
      seizure. As the number of antiepileptic medications increased, so did the
      frequency of perioperative seizures (P < 0.001). Neither the type of surgery nor 
      the type of anesthetic (general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored
      anesthesia care) affected the frequency of perioperative seizures in this patient
      population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of perioperative seizures 
      in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder are likely related to the
      patient's underlying condition. The frequency of seizures is not influenced by
      the type of anesthesia or procedure. Because patients with frequent seizures at
      baseline are likely to experience a seizure in the perioperative period, it is
      essential to be prepared to treat seizure activity regardless of the surgical
      procedure or anesthetic technique.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6831-10-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of potential factors associated with sleep bruxism (SB) may
      help in determining the etiology of such parafunction. Thus, this study aimed to 
      evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of children with SB by means of a generic
      scale, in addition to the association of sociodemographic characteristics and
      other parafunctional habits. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included healthy
      children of both genders, aged 7.18 +/- 0.59 years, with (n = 25) and without (n 
      = 69) signs and symptoms of SB. Data were collected in caries-free children from 
      public schools by applying a translated and validated version of the
      Autoquestionnaire Qualite de Vie Enfant Image (AUQUEI), clinical examination and 
      interview with the parents. The psychometric properties evaluated for the scale
      referred to internal consistency (ceiling and floor effects, Cronbach's Alpha
      coefficient, Items Correlation Matrix, and corrected Item-Total Correlation) and 
      the discriminant validity (t-test). By means of logistic regression with stepwise
      backward elimination, associations were evaluated between SB and age, gender,
      body mass index, maternal use of alcohol/tobacco/medicine during pregnancy,
      maternal age at birth, parent's schooling, presence of sucking habit, nail
      biting, enuresis, number of children, child's order (first born), occurrence of
      divorce/parent's death, and AUQUEI scores. RESULTS: The results of the AUQUEI
      psychometric analysis showed homogeneity of items and a Cronbach's alpha
      coefficient of 0.65; no negative correlations between the items were found. The
      mean AUQUEI scores for children with SB did not differ significantly from those
      of children without the parafunction. Only the independent variable "maternal age
      at birth" showed a significant negative association with SB. CONCLUSIONS: In the 
      studied sample, children with SB presented scores of QoL that were similar to
      those without the parafunction, and children from the youngest mothers were more 
      likely to present SB.

TI  - Risk factors for development of asthma in Thai adults in Phitsanulok: a
      university-based study.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - Studies have shown that asthma in children is caused by environmental and genetic
      factors. In adult asthma, risk factors were less well recognized. Likewise, in
      Thailand, data in adult asthma is limited. This study aimed to evaluate risk
      factors, determine skin reactivities to allergens, and assess concomitant allergy
      among adult asthma in Phitsanulok, a major city in the lower northern Thailand.
      Five hundred and thirteen Naresuan University staff members and students
      completed 2 sets of questionnaires and underwent allergy skin prick tests. The
      first set of questionnaires was standardized Thai version of ISAAC questionnaire 
      for identifying asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema. The second set was 
      modified from ISAAC phase II questionnaire to identify asthma risk factors.
      Fifty-eight subjects (11.6%) were identified as having physician's diagnosed
      asthma and 89 subjects (17.7%) wheezed in the past 12 months. Among 89 subjects, 
      14.4% wheezed more than once a month, 45.6% had wheezes interfering with sleep.
      Concomitant allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema among these 
      asthma subjects were 82.5%, 67.9%, and 14.9%, respectively. Eighty seven point
      nine percent of asthmatic subjects had positive skin reactivities to at least one
      allergen. Two of the most common allergens were house dust mites and cockroaches.
      Maternal smoking during pregnancy, smoking among family members, and family
      history of allergy were statistically significant risks for developing asthma,
      while having a rice field around the residence represented a significant
      protective factor. In conclusion, high prevalence of asthma presented in
      Phitsanulok and many asthmatic subjects were partly controlled or uncontrolled.
      The environment such as a rice field could protect against asthma, however atopy 
      and smoking exposure were significant risks for asthma development

TI  - Pregnancy and fetal outcomes of symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing.
PG  - 849-55
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00021810 [doi]
AB  - The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to develop
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or protect against it. Studies evaluating
      outcomes of SDB symptoms in pregnancy are scarce. The goal of this study was to
      evaluate the prevalence of SDB symptoms in pregnancy and their relationship with 
      pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. A cross-sectional survey of randomly selected
      immediate postpartum females was performed using the multivariable apnoea
      prediction index. Record review, including demographics and medical history, was 
      performed. Main outcome measures included pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. 1,000 
      subjects were recruited. Mean+/-sd age was 29.1+/-6.1 yrs. Factors used in the
      regression analysis included age, body mass index, diabetes, chronic
      hypertension, multifetal gestations, smoking and renal disease. Snoring was
      present in 35.1% of subjects. Symptoms of SDB were associated with a higher
      likelihood of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 2.3, 
      95% CI 1.4-4.0), gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4) and
      unplanned Caesarean deliveries (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) after
      multivariable regression analysis. Gasping may have been associated with a higher
      likelihood of preterm delivery, after adjusting for age and multifetal
      pregnancies (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) but this association appeared to be
      mediated by pre-eclampsia. Symptoms of SDB are common in pregnancy and associated
      with a higher likelihood of gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational
      diabetes and unplanned Caesarean deliveries.

TI  - [Treatment of depressed pregnant women by selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors: risk for the foetus and the newborn].
PG  - D133-8
LID - 10.1016/j.encep.2009.06.005 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article is a review of literature data concerning the use of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed pregnant women.
      LITERATURE FINDINGS: The adverse effects for the foetus, the newborn and the
      child were evaluated. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is of around 
      10 to 20% of the population of childbearing women. Depression is often
      misdiagnosed and underestimated in pregnant women. Starting a pharmacological
      treatment for depression in these women is not easy because data concerning the
      safety of antidepressants during pregnancy are still unclear. The non-treated
      pathology is associated with higher risk of maternal morbidity, including
      arterial hypertension, which could lead to preeclampsia or eclampsia, ideation
      and suicide attempts, and postpartum depression. Foetal development is also
      affected and adverse outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight,
      irritability, and sleep disorders are frequent. Pharmacological therapy is
      necessary when non-pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Suicide attempts
      and relapse of depression have been described when depressive women stopped their
      pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women diagnosed with
      depression must be treated. Selective SSRIs are now largely used in this
      pathology and have replaced tricyclic antidepressants because of fewer side
      effects. In general, drugs have a low teratogenic potential, only 4 to 5% of
      malformations are iatrogenic. Teratogenic risk is high between conception until
      the end of the second month of gestation. Safety of SSRIs treatment during
      pregnancy and potential risk for the foetus and newborn were unquestioned before 
      publication, in the late 2005, of some alarming data concerning a possible
      teratogenic effect. Studies showed an increased risk for all congenital
      malformations with SSRIs and particularly with paroxetin. A few studies after
      2005 have also found an association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs
      (especially paroxetin) and congenital malformations. However, other studies
      failed to demonstrate this association and the risk for cardiovascular
      malformations also does not seem to be significantly increased. Numerous studies 
      in pregnant women have shown that SSRI treatments are associated with a
      significant increase of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth
      weight. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy has been associated with a three-fold
      increased risk of neonatal behavioural syndrome, including signs of withdrawal or
      serotonin impregnation. Restlessness, poor tone, respiratory distress,
      hypoglycaemia were the most frequent signs. These symptoms occur during the first
      days of life and are usually brief and not serious. Recent studies have also
      documented an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and cases of
      cerebral haemorrhage have been described. Data concerning a possible effect on
      motor and cognitive development at school age in children prenatally exposed to
      SSRIs are limited. DISCUSSION: Although a number of studies revealed that SSRIs
      are not teratogenic, some of them showed congenital malformations associated with
      use of these antidepressants; in particular an increased risk of cardiac defects 
      with paroxetin. In practice, the potential risk implies that the decision to
      treat a pregnant woman with SSRIs (notably paroxetin) should be taken carefully; 
      this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits, adverse effects
      and possible alternatives. Neonatal toxicity seems to be relatively frequent when
      SSRIs are prescribed during late pregnancy. For all depressed pregnant women, the
      severity of the depression must be taken into consideration before introducing a 
      pharmacological treatment. When depressive women are already treated, studies
      have shown that antidepressants must be maintained during pregnancy to prevent
      relapse and suicide attempts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the impact of short sleep duration (SSD) and
      frequent snoring (FS) on glucose metabolism during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: We
      conducted a prospective cohort study of healthy nulliparas who participated in a 
      sleep survey study. SSD was defined as <7 hours of sleep per night and FS, as
      snoring >or=3 nights per week. Outcomes included 1-hour oral glucose tolerance
      results and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 189 women participated;
      48% reported an SSD and 18.5% reported FS. SSD and FS were associated with higher
      oral glucose tolerance values: SSD (116 +/- 31 vs 105 +/- 23; P = .008) and FS
      (118 +/- 34 vs 108 +/- 25; P = .04). Both SSD (10.2% vs 1.1%; P = .008) and FS
      (14.3% vs 3.3%; P = .009) were associated with a higher incidence of GDM. Even
      after controlling for potential confounders, SSD and FS remained associated with 
      GDM. CONCLUSION: SSD and FS are associated with glucose intolerance in pregnancy.

AB  - Clinical observations in chronic inflammatory diseases have demonstrated the
      significant influence of neuroendocrine mechanisms on the immune system: (1)
      Amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy; (2) preponderance of women
      versus men with respect to autoimmune diseases; (3) negative effects of
      ovulation-inducing therapy, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy;
      (4) protective effect of hemiplegia; (5) influence of psychological stress on
      inflammation; and (6) influence of circadian rhythms on inflammatory symptoms.The
      effects of different hormones and neurotransmitters on the immune system are
      influenced by: (1) the immune stimulus (foreign antigens or autoantigens) and
      subsequent antigen-specific immune responses, (2) the cell types involved during 
      different phases of the disease, (3) the target organ with its specific
      microenvironment, (4) the timing of hormone or neurotransmitter increase in
      relation to the disease course, (5) the concentration of hormones and
      neurotransmitters, (6) the variability in expression of receptors depending on
      the microenvironment and the cell type, and (7) the intra- and extracellular
      peripheral metabolism of hormones and neurotransmitters leading to important
      biologically active metabolites with quite different anti- and proinflammatory
      functions.The circadian rhythm of disease-related symptoms with a peak in the
      early morning hours confirms that the neuroendocrine system has a strong
      influence on these chronic immune/inflammatory diseases. The influence is
      transmitted by the circadian fluctuation in the activity of hormonal and neuronal
      pathways linking the brain to immune cell activation.These considerations could
      lead to novel therapeutic strategies for rheumatic diseases in the future.

      women.
PG  - 23-30

AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and
      stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) 
      relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in
      Taiwan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: A convenience sample of 150
      second-trimester and 150 third-trimester pregnant women was recruited from two
      medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was
      recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to
      September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. FINDINGS: The
      prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0% for second- and
      third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling
      for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality,
      habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and
      poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third
      trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found
      in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed
      women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not 
      in nonpregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study provides
      preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep
      quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was
      related to stress and depression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Evaluation for sleep
      quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information 
      on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to
      individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional development of children born after
      treatment of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension with labetalol versus
      methyldopa, and no antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
      SETTING: Twelve Dutch hospital departments of obstetrics. POPULATION: Live-born
      children born in these hospitals and prenatally exposed to labetalol, methyldopa,
      or bed rest because of mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension. METHODS:
      Central nervous system development was measured with standard tests at 4-10 years
      of age. Linear regression techniques and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to 
      compare the groups with regard to the outcome measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Intelligence quotient (IQ), concentration, motor development, and behaviour at
      primary school age. RESULTS: A total of 202 children were included in the
      analyses. More children exposed to labetalol had attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) than those exposed to methyldopa (OR 2.3; 95% CI 0.7-7.3), or
      those born to women who had been admitted for bed rest (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.2-13.9).
      Sleeping problems seemed to be reported more frequently after prenatal methyldopa
      exposure than after exposure to labetalol (OR 3.2; 95% CI 0.6-16.7) or bed rest
      (OR 4.5; 95% CI 0.9-23.2), although the differences were not statistically
      significant. Test scores on other aspects of functional development did not
      differ between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating
      study, labetalol exposure in utero seemed to increase the risk of ADHD among
      children of primary school age, whereas prenatal methyldopa exposure might
      influence sleep. Further studies with appropriate sample sizes are warranted to
      determine the long-term effects of antihypertensive medications.

TI  - Glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes risk in relation to sleep duration
      and snoring during pregnancy: a pilot study.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/1472-6874-10-17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in
      modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and
      diabetes. Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep 
      and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational
      diabetes. METHODS: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early
      pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early
      pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models
      were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
      of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively. RESULTS: After
      adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women
      sleeping < or = 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR =
      5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m2) was
      3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (> or 
      = 25 kg/m2). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of
      GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated
      among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore,
      those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI
      2.87-16.6). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short
      sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent
      with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective
      measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise
      estimates of observed associations.

TI  - Crying babies, tired mothers - challenges of the postnatal hospital stay: an
      interpretive phenomenological study.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-10-21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to an old Swiss proverb, "a new mother lazing in childbed
      is a blessing to her family". Today mothers rarely enjoy restful days after
      birth, but enter directly into the challenge of combining baby- and self-care.
      They often face a combination of infant crying and personal tiredness. Yet,
      routine postnatal care often lacks effective strategies to alleviate these
      challenges which can adversely affect family health. We explored how new mothers 
      experience and handle postnatal infant crying and their own tiredness in the
      context of changing hospital care practices in Switzerland. METHODS: Purposeful
      sampling was used to enroll 15 mothers of diverse parity and educational
      backgrounds, all of who had given birth to a full term healthy neonate. Using
      interpretive phenomenology, we analyzed interview and participant observation
      data collected during the postnatal hospital stay and at 6 and 12 weeks post
      birth. This paper reports on the postnatal hospital experience. RESULTS: Women's 
      personal beliefs about beneficial childcare practices shaped how they cared for
      their newborn's and their own needs during the early postnatal period in the
      hospital. These beliefs ranged from an infant-centered approach focused on the
      infant's development of a basic sense of trust to an approach that balanced the
      infants' demands with the mother's personal needs. Getting adequate rest was
      particularly difficult for mothers striving to provide infant-centered care for
      an unsettled neonate. These mothers suffered from sleep deprivation and severe
      tiredness unless they were able to leave the baby with health professionals for
      several hours during the night. CONCLUSION: New mothers often need permission to 
      attend to their own needs, as well as practical support with childcare to recover
      from birth especially when neonates are fussy. To strengthen family health from
      the earliest stage, postnatal care should establish conditions which enable new
      mothers to balance the care of their infant with their own needs.

TI  - Family study of restless legs syndrome in Quebec, Canada: clinical
      characterization of 671 familial cases.
PG  - 617-22
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2010.67 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To fully ascertain the familial aggregation of restless legs syndrome
      (RLS) and to characterize the clinical features of familial RLS (fRLS) cases.
      DESIGN: A case series survey with a high response rate. SETTING: Academic
      research center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive RLS probands (n = 249) were followed
      up in a specialized sleep center for 15 years. A total of 671 cases of fRLS met
      the current standard diagnostic criteria, including 192 probands characterized
      using multidimensional clinical assessments and 479 affected family members
      assessed by their responses to a structured questionnaire telephone diagnostic
      interview. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sibling and offspring relative risk ratio and
      clinical and genetic features of patients with fRLS and families. RESULTS: Our
      data showed that RLS aggregates in families with a familial rate of 77%, a
      sibling relative risk of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.4), and an offspring
      relative risk of 1.8 (1.0-2.7). Familial RLS is a chronic disorder with a mean
      (SD) disease duration of 24 (16) years and a wide range of age of onset (mean
      [SD], 28 [15] years), with most family members having early-onset disease but
      mild to moderate RLS symptoms. Our clinical data also indicated that fRLS is more
      prominent among women who also had increased incidence of anemia/iron deficiency,
      arthritis, and number of pregnancies. Pregnancy-related RLS seems to be a
      characteristic feature of fRLS, and afflicted women tend to have a much younger
      age of onset. CONCLUSIONS: Restless legs syndrome significantly aggregated in
      families with variable phenotypic expressivity, and the siblings of severely
      affected individuals have an increased risk of developing the disease.

TI  - Prevention of the alcohol-induced changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      expression using neuroprotective peptides in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 457.e1-4
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2010.03.050 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the
      neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related
      peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. STUDY
      DESIGN: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed
      pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03
      mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours
      (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40.
      Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed 
      to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. 
      RESULTS: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in
      controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P<.05). Pretreatment 
      with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<.05)
      at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between
      alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P>.05). CONCLUSION: NAP plus SAL
      treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10
      days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part,
      the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS.

TI  - Infant sleep and paternal involvement in infant caregiving during the first 6
      months of life.
PG  - 36-46
LID - 10.1093/jpepsy/jsq036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to assess: (a) the involvement of
      fathers and mothers in overall and nighttime infant caregiving; (b) the links
      between paternal involvement in infant care and infant sleep patterns during the 
      first 6 months. METHODS: Fifty-six couples recruited during their first
      pregnancy, participated in the study. After delivery (1 and 6 months), both
      parents completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative
      to mothers in infant caregiving. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and
      sleep diaries. RESULTS: Mothers were significantly more involved than fathers in 
      daytime and nighttime caregiving. A higher involvement of fathers in overall
      infant care predicted and was associated with fewer infant night-wakings and with
      shorter total sleep time after controlling for breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: The
      findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental sleep
      research. Future studies should explore mechanisms underlying the relations
      between paternal involvement and infant sleep.

TI  - Inconsolable night-time awakening: beyond night terrors.
PG  - S7-10
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181d8300b [doi]
AB  - CASE: Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her
      parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother
      indicated that she has frequent (>6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by
      screaming and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes
      increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her
      brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and
      touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however,
      within 1 hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and
      unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions,
      including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep
      pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine
      including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion
      from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking,
      hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes.
      Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal
      hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum
      bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks,
      daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to
      sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not
      successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and
      difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in
      the first year. Occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed 
      by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture
      aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal 
      interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones
      appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and
      infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking 
      and a paternal history of sleeping walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily 
      schedule. Sleep deprivation, differences parent child-rearing practices, social
      isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as
      significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30
      minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first
      word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the
      developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment,
      she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician.

PG  - S126-9
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181db790c [doi]
AB  - CASE: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression,
      defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her
      bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her
      pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of
      authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an
      evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a
      transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and
      moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation,
      and Sonia may have been physically abused as well. Currently, Sonia is in third
      grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading,
      but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal
      and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to
      complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is
      because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned
      about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her
      younger brother and grandmother. Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term
      pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications.
      Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. 
      Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to
      read at the age of 3 years. Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity,
      seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings
      associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia "worries about
      everything," including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When
      an argument occurs at home, she "gets scared," bites her nails, and cries. Sonia 
      currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and
      grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and
      mental illness in the father's family. While conducting an interview with her
      mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. Instead, she illustrated
      a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She
      described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her
      persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was

TI  - Pitfalls in chronobiology: a suggested analysis using intrathecal bupivacaine
      analgesia as an example.
PG  - 980-5
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181dd22d4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of analgesia from epidural administration of local
      anesthetics to parturients has been shown to follow a rhythmic pattern according 
      to the time of drug administration. We studied whether there was a similar
      pattern after intrathecal administration of bupivacaine in parturients. In the
      course of the analysis, we came to believe that some data points coincident with 
      provider shift changes were influenced by nonbiological, health care system
      factors, thus incorrectly suggesting a periodic signal in duration of labor
      analgesia. We developed graphical and analytical tools to help assess the
      influence of individual points on the chronobiological analysis. METHODS: Women
      with singleton term pregnancies in vertex presentation, cervical dilation 3 to 5 
      cm, pain score >50 mm (of 100 mm), and requesting labor analgesia were enrolled
      in this study. Patients received 2.5 mg of intrathecal bupivacaine in 2 mL using 
      a combined spinal-epidural technique. Analgesia duration was the time from
      intrathecal injection until the first request for additional analgesia. The
      duration of analgesia was analyzed by visual inspection of the data, application 
      of smoothing functions (Supersmoother; LOWESS and LOESS [locally weighted
      scatterplot smoothing functions]), analysis of variance, Cosinor (Chronos-Fit),
      Excel, and NONMEM (nonlinear mixed effect modeling). Confidence intervals (CIs)
      were determined by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications with replacement) using 
      PLT Tools. RESULTS: Eighty-two women were included in the study. Examination of
      the raw data using 3 smoothing functions revealed a bimodal pattern, with a peak 
      at approximately 0630 and a subsequent peak in the afternoon or evening,
      depending on the smoother. Analysis of variance did not identify any
      statistically significant difference between the duration of analgesia when
      intrathecal injection was given from midnight to 0600 compared with the duration 
      of analgesia after intrathecal injection at other times. Chronos-Fit, Excel, and 
      NONMEM produced identical results, with a mean duration of analgesia of 38.4
      minutes (95% CI: 35.4-41.6 minutes), an 8-hour periodic waveform with an
      amplitude of 5.8 minutes (95% CI: 2.1-10.7 minutes), and a phase offset of 6.5
      hours (95% CI: 5.4-8.0 hours) relative to midnight. The 8-hour periodic model did
      not reach statistical significance in 40% of bootstrap analyses, implying that
      statistical significance of the 8-hour periodic model was dependent on a subset
      of the data. Two data points before the change of shift at 0700 contributed most 
      strongly to the statistical significance of the periodic waveform. Without these 
      data points, there was no evidence of an 8-hour periodic waveform for intrathecal
      bupivacaine analgesia. CONCLUSION: Chronobiology includes the influence of
      external daily rhythms in the environment (e.g., nursing shifts) as well as human
      biological rhythms. We were able to distinguish the influence of an external
      rhythm by combining several novel analyses: (1) graphical presentation
      superimposing the raw data, external rhythms (e.g., nursing and anesthesia
      provider shifts), and smoothing functions; (2) graphical display of the
      contribution of each data point to the statistical significance; and (3)
      bootstrap analysis to identify whether the statistical significance was highly
      dependent on a data subset. These approaches suggested that 2 data points were
      likely artifacts of the change in nursing and anesthesia shifts. When these
      points were removed, there was no suggestion of biological rhythm in the duration
      of intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia.

TI  - Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for pediatric airway management.
PG  - 1512-23
LID - 10.1016/j.joms.2009.09.099 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mandibular retrognathia may cause upper airway obstruction in the
      pediatric patient due to tongue collapse and physical obstruction in the
      hypopharyngeal region. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful
      treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who
      underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway
      management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and
      15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic
      and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 
      4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler
      syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea,
      Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All
      patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe
      retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct
      laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a
      tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient
      underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous
      Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO
      was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 
      mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42
      days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan)
      were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively
      for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper
      airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and
      pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea
      monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were
      normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic
      analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean
      decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and
      the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications
      included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic
      scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks 
      following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin 
      site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. CONCLUSION:
      Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient 
      with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a
      tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of
      the disease process and may allow for future growth.

AB  - The field of sleep medicine has grown exponentially worldwide. Sleep apnea is
      linked to the obesity epidemic, which, in some regions of the United States,
      affects more than one-third of the population. Sleep alterations increase the
      risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular pathology through a diversity of
      direct and indirect mechanisms. Recent investigations have found a clinical
      correlation between sleep disorders and diabetes. Obese pregnant women are at
      high risk for development of sleep apnea and preeclampsia. New studies have
      uncovered that restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements may increase
      the risk of hypertension and vascular disease. Sudden death in sleep may be
      preventable if conditions that lead to sudden death are investigated. New
      neuroimaging techniques during sleep in patients with insomnia have uncovered
      metabolic overactivity in areas of the brain related to maintenance of
      wakefulness. Sleep neuroimaging promises to have research and clinical diagnostic
      applications.

AB  - The current study compared the performances of pregnant women with education- and
      age-matched controls on a variety of measures that assessed perceptual speed,
      short-term and working memory capacity, subjective memory complaints, sleep
      quality, level of fatigue, executive functioning, episodic and prospective
      memory, and crystallized and fluid intelligence. A primary purpose was to test
      the hypothesis of Henry and Rendell (2007) that pregnancy-related declines in
      cognitive functioning would be especially evident in tasks that place a high
      demand on executive processes. We also investigated a parallel hypothesis: that
      the pregnant women would experience a broad-based reduction in cognitive
      capability. Very limited support was found for the executive functioning
      hypothesis. Pregnant women scored lower only on the measure of verbal fluency
      (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) but not on the Wisconsin Card
      Sorting Task or on any working memory measures. Furthermore, group differences in
      COWAT performance disappeared after controlling for verbal IQ (Shipley
      vocabulary). In addition, there was no support for the general decline
      hypothesis. We conclude that pregnancy-associated differences in performance
      observed in the current study were relatively mild and rarely reached either
      clinical or practical significance.

AB  - Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety
      of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive
      transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity.
      Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and
      discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are
      also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of
      physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess
      weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and
      those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take
      into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts,
      and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems
      in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine
      Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). STUDY DESIGN: The data come from the 1692
      participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, 
      a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4
      years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior
      Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of
      PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple 
      logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058).
      The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the
      curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these
      models. RESULTS: PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity
      problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to
      significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and
      3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy,
      sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for
      externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95%
      confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was
      0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly
      predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for
      internalizing problems.

AB  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on
      infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A
      retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing
      and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from
      2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB
      care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from 
      electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3
      months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS
      statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At
      the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of
      infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant
      missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only),
      breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified 
      analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate 
      of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant
      (P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of
      bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P =
      0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child 
      visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education
      during the third trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess features of sleep among pregnant women. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective cohort study of low-risk pregnant women in a tertiary
      perinatal centre (CHUS) in Eastern Townships, Quebec. Sleep was assessed during
      the second trimester (mean gestational age 16.1 +/- 3.0 weeks) (T2) and third
      trimester (mean gestational age 27.5 +/- 1.8 weeks) (T3) using a validated
      self-administered questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
      Scores in this index range from 0 to 21, representing the cumulative scoring of
      seven sleep components. Subjects with a score > 5 were identified as "poor
      sleepers." Descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses were performed.
      RESULTS: Among 260 consenting women, 192 (73.6%) had a term delivery without any 
      adverse outcome. There were no differences in sleep parameters between
      pregnancies with adverse outcome and without adverse outcome. Mean overall PSQI
      scores showed evidence of deterioration in sleep quality from T2 (5.26 +/- 3.16) 
      to T3 (6.73 +/- 4.02; P < 0.01). This deterioration was displayed in five of
      seven sleep components (P < 0.01). Scores in the "poor sleeper" range were
      recorded by 36% of women in T2 and 56%, of women in T3 (P < 0.01). "Poor sleep"
      in T2 and T3 was associated with low or high weight gain (P < 0.01), annual
      family income < $40,000 (P = 0.03), and single motherhood (P < 0.01). There was a
      trend for a seasonal influence on sleep scores (P = 0.08). The only predictor of 
      poor sleep using multivariate analysis was single motherhood (P < 0.01).
      CONCLUSION: Sleep is disturbed in early pregnancy and is worse in the third
      trimester. Interventions to improve sleep should be sought to optimize quality of
      life for pregnant women.

TI  - ARNTL (BMAL1) and NPAS2 gene variants contribute to fertility and seasonality.
PG  - e10007
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0010007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake,
      circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health
      hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and
      metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key
      circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and
      well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30
      and over, living in Finland. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511
      individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were
      assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to
      reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and
      pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2
      rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of
      six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight,
      appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296
      had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global 
      seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype
      experienced less seasonal variation of energy level. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
      ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal
      variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is
      the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in
      humans.

TI  - When and how to investigate the patient with headache.
PG  - 131-44
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1249221 [doi]
AB  - The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary
      headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations
      usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is
      indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of
      a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include 
      (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset
      headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache
      brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6)
      pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic
      findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk
      factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less
      worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur
      on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the
      patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's
      history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the
      brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of
      headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding,
      infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.

LID - 10.1016/j.acap.2010.01.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insufficient sleep in children is associated with adverse health
      effects. We examined the associations of early life risk factors with infant
      sleep duration. METHODS: We studied 1676 mother-infant pairs in a prebirth cohort
      study. Main outcomes were mothers' report of their infants' average 24-hour sleep
      duration at ages 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. RESULTS: Infants slept mean
      standard deviation [SD] durations of 12.2 (2.0) hours/day at age 6 months, 12.8
      (1.6) hours/day at age 1 year, and 11.9 (1.3) hours/day at age 2 years. In
      multivariable regression models, maternal antenatal depression, introduction of
      solids at age <4 months, and infant TV/video viewing were associated with shorter
      sleep durations at both 1 and 2 years of age. Estimates were 0.36 fewer hours/day
      of sleep for maternal antenatal depression, 0.39 fewer hours/day of sleep if
      infant was introduced to solids at age <4 months, and 0.11 fewer hours/day of
      sleep for each 1 hour of TV viewed per week. Attendance at child care outside the
      home was associated with 0.18 fewer hours/day of sleep at age 2 years. At age 2
      years, black, Hispanic, and Asian infants slept 0.40, 0.82, and 0.95,
      respectively, fewer hours per day than white infants. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal
      depression during pregnancy, early introduction of solid foods, infant TV
      viewing, and attendance of child care were associated with shorter infant sleep
      duration. Racial/ethnic minority children slept fewer hours in the first 2 years 
      of life than white children. Our results suggest that various risk factors, some

TI  - Effects of mindful yoga on sleep in pregnant women: a pilot study.
PG  - 363-70
LID - 10.1177/1099800409356320 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects 
      of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. METHODS:
      Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with
      singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha
      yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr
      of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS),
      were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data
      were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to 
      small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric
      statistics. RESULTS: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had
      significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less
      perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during
      the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention.
      Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at
      Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful yoga 
      shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total 
      number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further
      exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample
      size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future.

PG  - 285-301
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 11 per cent of pre-menopausal women though
      it often remains undetected. Women may present differently than men, and the
      classic findings of snoring, witnessed apnoeas and sleepiness may not be
      observed. Factors which predispose to OSA include polycystic ovarian syndrome,
      obesity, retromicrognathia, and hypothyroidism. OSA may contribute to
      neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, hypertension and metabolic syndrome.
      Emerging evidence indicates that snoring and OSA increase during pregnancy. For
      normal women with normotensive, low-risk pregnancies the prevalence of OSA is
      very low. Among normotensive pregnant women with high risk pregnancies, the
      prevalence of OSA is high and is even higher among those with gestational
      hypertension/preeclampsia during pregnancy. Incident snoring, which is a marker
      for OSA, is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational
      hypertension. Recent studies indicate that OSA per se is an independent risk
      factor for gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and may contribute to other
      poor obstetrical outcomes. The diagnostic test of choice for OSA is a
      polysomnography with electroencephalogram. Milder degree of disease than what is 
      usually considered clinically significant among men or non-pregnant women appears
      to be relevant for foetomaternal outcomes. There seems to be benefit for blood
      pressure control to treating even milder degrees of OSA with CPAP, both acutely
      and over the 9 months of pregnancy. Chronic hypertensive women should be strongly
      considered for diagnosis and treatment of OSA prior to or beginning as early as
      possible in pregnancy to help maintain blood pressure control. Increasing
      awareness of OSA among maternal health care providers is important given the
      potential benefits for pregnancy and other health-related outcomes associated
      with identification and treatment of OSA.

PG  - 571-8
LID - 10.1016/j.lpm.2009.09.030 [doi]
AB  - The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, 
      and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as
      iron deficiency or some drug treatments. The patients suffering from RLS should
      be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule. Drug treatment should be restricted
      to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on an individual basis, when
      the clinical impact is serious. Four drug classes are central to the treatment of
      RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines.
      Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily
      treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists 
      are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel) and
      pramipexole (Sifrol). After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit 
      from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to
      identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of 
      augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the
      symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with
      renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed.

AB  - Circadian rhythms and "clock gene" expression are involved in successful
      reproductive cycles, mating, and pregnancy. Alterations or disruptions of
      biological rhythms, as commonly occurs in shift work, jet lag, sleep deprivation,
      or clock gene knock out models, are linked to significant disruptions in
      reproductive function. These impairments include altered hormonal secretion
      patterns, reduced conception rates, increased miscarriage rates and an increased 
      risk of breast cancer. Female health may be particularly susceptible to the
      impact of desynchronizing work schedules as perturbed hormonal rhythms can
      further influence the expression patterns of clock genes. Estrogen modifies clock
      gene expression in the uterus, ovaries, and suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of 
      the primary circadian clock mechanism. Further work investigating clock genes,
      light exposure, ovarian hormones, and reproductive function will be critical for 
      indentifying how these factors interact to impact health and susceptibility to
      disease.

TI  - Racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity.
PG  - 686-95
LID - 10.1542/peds.2009-2100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity
      prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine
      racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity.
      METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother-child pairs
      were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity.
      The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4
      years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. RESULTS: In
      multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic 
      children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In
      pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]:
      1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01
      for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4
      months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of
      maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic);
      and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black,
      7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for
      black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black,
      3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive
      breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist
      prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity
      may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence and provide recommendations for the counselling
      and management of obese parturients. OUTCOMES: Outcomes evaluated include the
      impact of maternal obesity on the provision of antenatal and intrapartum care,
      maternal morbidity and mortality, and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
      EVIDENCE: Literature was retrieved through searches of Statistics Canada,
      Medline, and The Cochrane Library on the impact of obesity in pregnancy on
      antepartum and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, obstetrical
      anaesthesia, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Results were restricted to
      systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and 
      observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were
      updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to April 2009. Grey 
      (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health 
      technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical
      practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and
      international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The evidence obtained was
      reviewed and evaluated by the Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Practice
      Obstetric Committees of the SOGC under the leadership of the principal authors,
      and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian
      Task Force on Preventive Health Care. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Implementation 
      of the recommendations in this guideline should increase recognition of the
      issues clinicians need to be aware of when managing obese women in pregnancy,
      improve communication and consultation amongst the obstetrical care team, and
      encourage federal and provincial agencies to educate Canadians about the values
      of entering pregnancy with as healthy a weight as possible. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.
      Periodic health examinations and other appointments for gynaecologic care prior
      to pregnancy offer ideal opportunities to raise the issue of weight loss before
      conception. Women should be encouraged to enter pregnancy with a BMI < 30
      kg/m(2), and ideally < 25 kg/m(2). (III-B). 2. BMI should be calculated from
      pre-pregnancy height and weight. Those with a pre-pregnancy BMI > 30 kg/m(2) are 
      considered obese. This information can be helpful in counselling women about
      pregnancy risks associated with obesity. (II-2B). 3. Obese pregnant women should 
      receive counselling about weight gain, nutrition, and food choices. (II-2B). 4.
      Obese women should be advised that they are at risk for medical complications
      such as cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, gestational hypertension, gestational
      diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Regular exercise during pregnancy may help
      to reduce some of these risks. (II-2B). 5. Obese women should be advised that
      their fetus is at an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, and appropriate 
      screening should be done. (II-2B). 6. Obstetric care providers should take BMI
      into consideration when arranging for fetal anatomic assessment in the second
      trimester. Anatomic assessment at 20 to 22 weeks may be a better choice for the
      obese pregnant patient. (II-2B). 7. Obese pregnant women have an increased risk
      of Caesarean section, and the success of vaginal birth after Caesarean section is
      decreased. (II-2B). 8. Antenatal consultation with an anaesthesiologist should be
      considered to review analgesic options and to ensure a plan is in place should a 
      regional anaesthetic be chosen. (III-B). 9. The risk of venous thromboembolism
      for each obese woman should be evaluated. In some clinical situations,
      consideration for thromboprophylaxis should be individualized. (III-B).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves episodic nocturnal apneas.
      Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening
      questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate
      monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM
      abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of
      gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent
      polysomnography and FHM for > or =3 hours. The relationship between maternal
      characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were
      controlled for potential confounders. RESULTS: When compared with
      polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and
      63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with
      oxygen desaturation <95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder
      (r(s) = 0.44; P < .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities
      and OSA parameters. CONCLUSION: In pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire poorly
      predicts OSA. It is unclear whether fetal compromise during maternal apnea is a
      mechanism in OSA that is related to pregnancy outcome.

AB  - The objectives were to describe the association between body mass index (BMI,
      kg/m(2)), body composition and risk factors to metabolic diseases; observe the
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome and list the characteristics of overweight and
      obese women. Voluntaries (n=50; BMI=31+/-6; age=36+/-11 years old), were
      evaluated regarding clinical examination, anthropometrics measurements, samples
      of blood and urine, resting energy expenditure and food register. Phases in which
      they become obese in descending order: adulthood, pregnancy, adolescence, over 40
      years old and after marriage. The odds to have one or more obese family members
      were 316%. They were anxious (60%), depressives (12%), compulsives (34%) and had 
      sleep disturbance (32%). The odds to dyslipidemia was 28%, to hypertension was
      25% and to glucose over 100 mg/dL 35%. They were in caloric deficit, but,
      nitrogen balance was positive. The metabolic syndrome was present in 25% of these
      women and was positively correlated with body fat indicators and age. The obesity
      of these women seems to be multifactorial with a family influence that could be
      caused by genetics and environment contributions. The emotional/physical balance 
      should be influenced on this process.

TI  - Protein malnutrition during pregnancy in C57BL/6J mice results in offspring with 
      altered circadian physiology before obesity.
PG  - 1570-80
LID - 10.1210/en.2009-1133 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood
      obesity and diabetes are unclear. These studies investigated energy homeostasis
      in 8- and 20-wk-old male and female mice subjected to protein deficiency in
      utero. Pregnant C57BL/6J female mice were fed a protein-deficient diet (6%
      protein). Undernourished offspring (UO) and controls (CO) were cross-fostered to 
      lactating dams fed a 20% control diet. The 24-h profiles of energy expenditure,
      feeding behavior, physical activity, and whole-body substrate preference was
      assessed using 8-wk UO and CO weaned onto control diet. Blood chemistries,
      glucose tolerance, and expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid and glucose 
      metabolism were analyzed in 8- and 20-wk-old CO and UO fed control or a high-fat 
      diet. UO exhibited IUGR with catch-up growth at 8 wk of age and increased
      severity of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by 20 wk of age.
      Therefore, fetal malnutrition in the C57BL/6J mouse increases sensitivity to
      diet-induced obesity. Abnormal daily rhythms in food intake and metabolism,
      increased lipogenesis, and inflammation preceded obesity in the UO group.
      Arrhythmic expression of circadian oscillator genes was evident in brain, liver, 
      and muscle of UO at 8 and 20 wk of age. Expression of the clock-associated
      nuclear receptor and transcription repressor Rev-erbalpha was reduced in liver
      and muscle of UO. Altered circadian physiology may be symptomatic of the
      metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR, and altered feeding behavior and
      substrate metabolism may contribute to the obese phenotype.

TI  - Prenatal alcohol exposure alters biobehavioral reactivity to pain in newborns.
PG  - 681-92
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01137.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape
      Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry)
      newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born
      to abstainers (n = 14) or light (< or = 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers
      (controls). METHODS: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of
      pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity
      obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol
      exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least
      1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers
      [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral
      measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were
      collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and
      recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated
      Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. RESULTS: There were no
      between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity,
      depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational
      age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance
      and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower
      mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol
      levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed 
      infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in
      response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton
      Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. CONCLUSIONS: Both
      cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress reactivity measures
      suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns.
      This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced
      behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the
      first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed
      newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period.

AB  - We examined background information and course of labour from a cohort of 2,810
      low-risk nulliparas to identify possible lifestyle and anthropometrical risk
      indicators for dystocia. Criteria for dystocia: cervical dilatation <2 cm over 4 
      h during labour's active phase, or no descent during 2 h (3 h with epidural) in
      the descending phase, or no progress for 1 h during the expulsive phase. After
      adjustments, athletics or heavy gardening > or =4 h per week appeared protective 
      for dystocia (OR 0.63, CI 0.45-0.89), contrary to a non-significant finding of
      intensive physical training (OR 1.57, CI 0.84-2.93). Caffeine intake of 200-299
      mg/day was associated with dystocia (OR 1.37, CI 1.04-1.80); also high maternal
      age (OR 2.25, CI 1.58-3.22), small stature (OR 2.18, CI 1.51-3.15) and
      pre-pregnancy overweight (OR 1.28, CI 1.02-1.61). No association was found
      between dystocia and alcohol intake, smoking, night sleep and options for resting
      during the day.

      assessing brain activity in critically ill neonates. In extremely premature
      neonates, the aEEG trace is predominantly discontinuous, making it difficult to
      distinguish between a "normal" and "abnormal" trace. We measured aEEG activity in
      the first 48 h of life in neonates born before 29-wk gestation and used both
      visual and quantitative analysis of the aEEG data to assess differences in
      neonates with poor short-term outcome [death or peri/intraventricular hemorrhage 
      (P/IVH)] compared with those who survived without P/IVH to identify features of
      an abnormal aEEG. On quantitative analysis, EEG continuity <80% at 10-microV
      level was a sensitive and specific marker of poor short-term outcome. By using
      this marker, we identified 83% of neonates who died or developed grade 3 or 4 IVH
      and 60% of neonates who developed grades 1 or 2 IVH, with a positive predictive
      value for death or any IVH of 73% and a negative predictive value of 86%. Absence
      of sleep-wake cycling with baseline variability <2 microV was the strongest
      predictor of outcome using visual analysis alone.

TI  - Postnatal parental education for optimizing infant general health and
      parent-infant relationships.
PG  - CD004068
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004068.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is
      important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for
      their newborns during this time. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess 
      the effects of structured postnatal education delivered by an educator to an
      individual or group on infant general health and parent-infant relationships.
      SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
      Register (April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to July 2009), ERIC (1966 to July 2009),
      HealthSTAR (1966 to July 2009), PsycINFO (1806 to July 2009), Sociological
      Abstracts (1974 to July 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2009), Current
      Controlled Trials (August 2009), and Trialscentral.org (August 2009). SELECTION
      CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal
      education provided by an educator to individual parents or groups of parents
      within the first two months post birth related to the care of an infant or
      parent-infant relationships. We excluded studies of educational interventions for
      parents of infants in neonatal intensive care units. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Both authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published
      reports. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 25 trials (3689 mothers and 793 fathers) that met
      the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2868 mothers and 613 fathers) reported useable
      data. Educational interventions included: four on infant sleep enhancement, 13 on
      infant behaviour, two on general post-birth health, two on infant care, three on 
      infant safety, and one on father involvement/skills with infants. Details of the 
      randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss 
      were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only six were measured
      similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these
      six meta-analyses, only two were found to have a low enough level of
      heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education on sleep
      enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more minutes of infant sleep in
      24 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. Education
      on infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean
      difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The
      benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain
      unclear. Education on sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep and
      education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however
      more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm this.

TI  - Physical activity and sleep among pregnant women.
PG  - 45-52

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and safe treatments to improve
      sleep are needed. Generally, physical activity improves sleep, but studies are
      lacking on the associations of physical activity with sleep among pregnant women.
      Our aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association of various modes of
      physical activity and activity clusters with sleep quality and duration among
      1259 pregnant women. Participants were recruited into the Pregnancy, Infection,
      and Nutrition Study from prenatal clinics at the University of North Carolina
      Hospitals. Women self-reported sleep quality and duration and physical activity
      in the past week. We used cluster analysis to create seven physical activity
      profiles and multivariable logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for
      age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, parity, self-rated general
      health, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Women with higher levels of occupational
      physical activity were more likely to report either short or normal sleep
      duration than longer duration. Women with higher levels of indoor household
      physical activity were less likely to report normal sleep duration than shorter
      duration. Women in the recreational-indoor household activity cluster were less
      likely than women in the inactivity cluster to report normal sleep duration as
      compared with longer duration. Our data suggest weak associations of physical
      activity with sleep duration and quality in late pregnancy. Physical activity is 
      recommended to pregnant women for health benefits, yet more research is needed to
      understand if physical activity should be recommended for improving sleep.

PG  - 178-82
LID - 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.11.014 [doi]
AB  - Our aim was to examine the characteristics of EEG findings and epilepsy in
      autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and the associated clinical and familial risk
      factors. Fifty-seven children (86% male) with ASD, mean age 82+/-36.2 months,
      were included in the study. Thirty-nine (68.4%) children had the diagnosis of
      autism, 15 (26.3%) had Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, 
      and 3 (5.3%) had high-functioning autism. One hour of sleep and/or awake EEG
      recordings was obtained for each child. All patients were evaluated with respect 
      to clinical and familial characteristics and with the Childhood Autism Rating
      Scale, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The
      frequency of interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities (IIEAs) was 24.6% (n=14), 
      and the frequency of epilepsy was 14.2% (n=8). IIEAs were associated with a
      diagnosis of epilepsy (P=0.0001), Childhood Autism Rating Scale Activity scores
      (P=0.047), and a history of asthma and allergy (P=0.044). Epilepsy was associated
      with a family history of epilepsy (P=0.049) and psychiatric problems in the
      mother during pregnancy (P=0.0026). Future studies with larger samples will help 
      to clarify the possible associations of epilepsy/IIEAs with asthma/allergy,
      hyperactivity, and familial factors in ASD.

TI  - The effects of massage therapy on pain management in the acute care setting.
PG  - 4-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain management remains a critical issue for hospitals and is
      receiving the attention of hospital accreditation organizations. The acute care
      setting of the hospital provides an excellent opportunity for the integration of 
      massage therapy for pain management into the team-centered approach of patient
      care. PURPOSE AND SETTING: This preliminary study evaluated the effect of the use
      of massage therapy on inpatient pain levels in the acute care setting. The study 
      was conducted at Flagstaff Medical Center in Flagstaff, Arizona-a nonprofit
      community hospital serving a large rural area of northern Arizona. METHOD: A
      convenience sample was used to identify research participants. Pain levels before
      and after massage therapy were recorded using a 0 - 10 visual analog scale.
      Quantitative and qualitative methods were used for analysis of this descriptive
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital inpatients (n = 53) from medical, surgical, and
      obstetrics units participated in the current research by each receiving one or
      more massage therapy sessions averaging 30 minutes each. The number of sessions
      received depended on the length of the hospital stay. RESULT: Before massage, the
      mean pain level recorded by the patients was 5.18 [standard deviation (SD):
      2.01]. After massage, the mean pain level was 2.33 (SD: 2.10). The observed
      reduction in pain was statistically significant: paired samples t(52) = 12.43, r 
      = .67, d = 1.38, p < .001. Qualitative data illustrated improvement in all areas,
      with the most significant areas of impact reported being overall pain level,
      emotional well-being, relaxation, and ability to sleep. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      shows that integration of massage therapy into the acute care setting creates
      overall positive results in the patient's ability to deal with the challenging
      physical and psychological aspects of their health condition. The study
      demonstrated not only significant reduction in pain levels, but also the
      interrelatedness of pain, relaxation, sleep, emotions, recovery, and finally, the
      healing process.

TI  - Health promoting lifestyles and related factors in pregnant women.
PG  - 650-61
LID - 3206/320609 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore health promoting lifestyles 
      and related factors in pregnant women. METHODS: This was a descriptive study
      using convenience sampling. Altogether, 172 pregnant women were recruited from a 
      medical center in southern Taiwan. Personal data was collected, and the
      instruments used included perceived health status, self-efficacy of health
      behaviors, perception of family or peers' health-promoting behaviors, and Health 
      Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP Pi). RESULTS: The results showed that the
      standardized total score of health promoting lifestyles was 66.88 (moderate
      level). The subscales of the HPLP Pi in descending order of standardized scores
      were as follows: "interpersonal relationships," "health responsibility,"
      "psychological wellness," "nutrition," "stress management" and "physical
      activity." There were significant differences in the total scores of the HPLP Pi 
      among subjects with different educational level, socioeconomic status, chronic
      diseases, exercise habits, length of sleep, and perceived health status. Both
      perception of health-promoting behaviors among family (or peers) and
      self-efficacy of health behaviors had significantly positive relationships with
      health-promoting lifestyles. Perception of the family or peers' health-promoting 
      behaviors, self-efficacy of health behaviors, perceived health status and chronic
      diseases were the four significant predictors of health-promoting lifestyles,
      accounting for 62.4% of the variance. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study
      could be used as a reference for prenatal care, nursing education, and maternal /
      neonatal health policies.

      retention at 3 and 12 months postpartum.
PG  - 1996-2003
LID - 10.1038/oby.2009.458 [doi]
AB  - Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to
      obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to
      examine predictors of moderate (1-10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum
      weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed
      women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months,
      respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling
      using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months
      postpartum in this population was 9.4 lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7 lb (s.d. = 13.2), 
      respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight
      gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high
      weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and
      scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were
      associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy
      weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with
      moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race,
      employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated
      with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance
      of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum
      weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies 
      that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the
      results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such 
      aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized
      infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology.

LID - 10.1007/s00404-009-1327-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hormonal and physical changes during pregnancy are associated with 
      some sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) such as snoring and sleep apnea,
      and SRBD are associated with recurrent episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation and
      increased sympathic activity. We aimed to search the incidence of self-reported
      snoring and witnessed apnea in the third trimester of pregnancy and to analyze
      their influence on fetal outcome and gestational hypertension (GH). METHODS: Two 
      hundred pregnant women (group 1) during their stay for labor and 200 age-matched 
      control women (group 2) were included in the study. All patients were asked to
      complete a detailed questionnaire that covers demographic features. We measured
      neck circumference and performed Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) to determine
      excessive daytime sleepiness in all patients. RESULTS: The mean age was 27.4 +/- 
      6.7 and 26.3 +/- 5.8 for group 1 and 2, respectively. Habitual snoring was
      detected only in group 1 in 5 patients; 36 pregnant women and 7 control patients 
      reported occasional snoring. Both habitual and occasional snoring was
      significantly observed to be increased in pregnancy. Witnessed sleep apnea was
      been observed only in 1 patient in group 1. The mean neck circumference was 37.4 
      +/- 3.2, 35.1 +/- 2.1 cm and ESS was 6.7 +/- 3.01, 5.1 +/- 2.1 for group 1 and 2,
      respectively (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between snoring and
      GH. There was no significant relationship between all investigated parameters and
      fetal outcome. We found that excessive weight gain during pregnancy is
      significantly associated with snoring. CONCLUSION: We concluded that, although
      pregnant women, especially who gain excessive weight during their pregnancy,
      significantly snore more than nonpregnant women, this did not affect fetal
      outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances during
      pregnancy among healthy nulliparous women. METHODS: This was a prospective,
      cohort study of healthy nulliparous women, recruited between 6 and 20 weeks of
      gestation, who completed a baseline sleep survey at enrollment with follow-up in 
      the third trimester. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep
      questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Disordered Breathing, Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale, National Institutes of Health/International Restless Legs
      Syndrome Question Set, Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, and the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Differences in sleep characteristics between the 
      baseline and third trimester were compared using the paired t test or McNemar
      test for continuous or categorical data, respectively. RESULTS: One hundred
      eighty-nine women completed both baseline and follow-up sleep surveys. The mean
      gestational age was 13.8 (+/-3.8) and 30.0 (+/-2.2) weeks at the first and second
      surveys, respectively. Compared with the baseline assessment, mean sleep duration
      was significantly shorter (7.4 [+/-1.2] hours compared with 7.0 [+/-1.3] hours,
      P<.001), and the proportion of patients who reported frequent snoring (at least
      three nights per week) was significantly greater (11% compared with 16.4%, P=.03)
      in the third trimester. The percentage of patients who met diagnostic criteria
      for restless leg syndrome increased from 17.5% at recruitment to 31.2% in the
      third trimester (P=.001). Overall poor sleep quality, as defined by a Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Quality Index score greater than 5, became significantly more common as
      pregnancy progressed (39.0% compared with 53.5%, P=.001). CONCLUSION: Sleep
      disturbances are prevalent among healthy nulliparous women and increase
      significantly during pregnancy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

      infants.
PG  - 263-7
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2009.06.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children who were born prematurely are at higher risk for
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) compared to their same-age peers who were born
      fullterm. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess the
      frequency of SDB symptoms and effects on growth among preterm infants while they 
      are still infants, with a goal of identifying risk factors to facilitate
      prevention and early intervention. METHODS: The Louisville pediatric SDB risk
      survey was administered to the primary caretakers of prematurely born infants
      attending the Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic at West Virginia University Children's
      Hospital. RESULTS: Participation was 100% among 173 consecutive patients invited 
      to participate in the study. At 9.13 months corrected age, 8.1% of infants born
      at a mean of 31.6 weeks gestation were reported to snore > or = 3 days/week, a
      rate consistent with diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing among older
      children. A composite of nine parent-reported symptoms was created based on
      factor analysis. Birth weight and size for gestational age at birth did not
      differ between snoring groups or correlate with the composite score. But a
      significant negative correlation between the composite risk for SDB score and
      current weight for adjusted age percentile score indicate that infants with
      higher SDB symptom profiles have lower weight for age (r=-.18, p=.028).
      CONCLUSIONS: SDB symptoms are detectable among infants born preterm, while they
      are still infants. Because of their preferential risk for SDB and its somatic
      consequences, a primary research goal should be description of the natural
      history of SDB and identification of modifiable risk factors and treatment
      options.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal
      morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. STUDY
      DESIGN: Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic
      center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at 
      a 2:1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. 
      Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm
      birth (PTB). RESULTS: The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA.
      Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more
      preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0%; P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%; P = .007).
      Controlling for comorbid conditions, OSA was associated with an increased risk of
      PTB (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-6.6), mostly
      secondary to PET (63%). Cesarean delivery (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.9-22.1) and OSA
      were associated with maternal morbidity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-13.7). CONCLUSION: 
      Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical
      complications, and indicated PTB.

PG  - 115-9
LID - 10.2174/157015909788848938 [doi]
AB  - Despite advances in epilepsy therapeutics, some physicians feel uncomfortable
      with newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to difficulty in promptly obtaining
      blood levels to guide medication adjustment, and even when levels for newer AEDs 
      are obtained, many practitioners feel they are not very useful. Lacking
      confidence in AEDs whose levels that cannot readily or expeditiously be measured,
      many clinicians share uncertainty about proper use of the newer AEDs and
      monitoring AED administration. Similarly, some epilepsy patients inflate the
      importance of AED blood level monitoring, feeling that blood levels falling
      within traditionally therapeutic ranges are a fail-safe for seizure control,
      regardless of their compliance or personal behavior aggravating seizure burden,
      such as poor sleep or use of illicit substances. This review examines the elusive
      concept of therapeutic AED blood levels and potential uses and abuses of blood
      level monitoring, reinforcing appropriate uses for blood levels to ensure
      compliance and adjust for altered AED pharmacokinetics in the context of aging
      and disease states, pregnancy, or drug interactions.

PG  - 23-9
LID - 10.1016/j.infbeh.2009.10.004 [doi]
AB  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of
      depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and 
      on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the
      comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the
      depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily
      hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As
      compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances
      and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater
      incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the
      non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower
      birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did
      not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of
      the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and
      lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and
      non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data
      suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst
      condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no
      more impactful than depression alone.

AB  - With up to 80% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy
      (NVP), it is critical to have a graded scale of its severity as a guide for
      appropriate treatment. In 2002 we introduced the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification 
      of Emesis (PUQE) scoring system, which assessed the severity of nausea and
      vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) based on three physical symptoms: nausea, vomiting,
      and retching over the previous 12 hours. We present here validation of an
      extension of the original PUQE, by assessing NVP over 24 hours. This extension is
      deemed more clinically relevant, because assessment of symptoms over only 12
      hours may encompass sleeping hours and hence may not adequately capture the
      length and severity of the symptoms. In this study we assessed the external
      validity of the new PUQE-24 by examining its ability to evaluate several
      characteristics associated with NVP: (a) ability to take multivitamin
      supplements; (b) rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits for severe
      symptoms; (c) sleep patterns; (d) liquid intake; and (e) the woman's self-rated
      well-being scores. Data collected prospectively from 315 women counselled via the
      Motherisk NVP line were used for the validation. PUQE-24 showed strong
      correlation with all parameters examined except for sleep patterns and hydration 
      status. The well-being score, however, correlated significantly with hydration
      status. Capturing 24 hours rather than 12 hours of symptoms may better direct
      management of NVP and predict its outcome.

PG  - 773-8
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2009.10.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate
      withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state
      regulation. AIM: This study examines sleep-wakefulness-distress patterns as
      indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. PARTICIPANTS: A national 
      infant cohort (N=35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during
      pregnancy and a comparison group (N=36) of low-risk infants born in the same
      period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and
      distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers
      in the two groups. RESULTS: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely
      during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood.
      They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child
      was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of 
      the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite 
      of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant
      differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational
      age and maternal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up procedures combining
      drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after
      birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep-wakefulness
      patterns.

PG  - 795-8
LID - 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2009.11.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for
      assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it
      has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or 
      behavioural state. AIMS: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability
      between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep. STUDY
      DESIGN: Case-control. Cases had a gestational age of > or =42 weeks; controls
      were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile. SUBJECTS: 
      STAN registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was 
      selected during active and one during quiet sleep. OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute and
      normalized low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4-1.5 Hz) of heart rate
      variability. RESULTS: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences
      were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively,
      P=0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P=0.50) or absolute (41
      and 21 respectively, P=0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07
      respectively, P=0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency 
      power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively, P=0.03) and absolute (16 and 10
      respectively, P=0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and
      0.14 respectively, P=0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized
      low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both
      groups (all P values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found sympathetic predominance
      during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation 
      during rest was increased compared to near term.

TI  - Maternal characteristics and migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy:
      cross-sectional analysis of data from a large cohort study.
PG  - 1267-76
AB  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during
      pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%)
      reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525
      (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics
      (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and
      comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass
      index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h
      (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and
      acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with
      migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for
      migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period
      may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.

TI  - Hospital work and pregnancy outcomes: a study in the Danish National Birth
      Cohort.
PG  - 402-9
AB  - In hospitals, women of reproductive age do a range of work tasks, some of which
      are known to carry potential risks. Tasks such as working with radiation,
      chemicals, and infectious agents, as well as performing heavy lifting or tasks
      requiring erratic sleep patterns have been reported to increase the risk of
      reproductive failures. Our aim was to study pregnancy outcomes in female hospital
      workers in Denmark. We performed a cohort study of 5976 female hospital workers
      and used as a reference group 60,890 women employed outside of hospitals. The
      reproductive health of hospital workers working during pregnancy is comparable to
      those of non-hospital workers for the majority of reproductive failures studied. 
      However, an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities was noted in some
      subgroups of hospital workers, which may indicate that some hospital work still
      entails fetotoxic hazards.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore women's levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation,
      anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of
      pregnancy. DESIGN: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample.
      PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous 
      women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with
      uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience
      Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep
      Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire.
      RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and
      20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue,
      sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending 
      midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians.
      Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors,
      anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted
      higher levels of childbirth fear among women. CONCLUSION: One fourth of women
      reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue,
      available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of 
      a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy.

TI  - Disturbed sleep and preterm birth: a potential relationship?
PG  - 166-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Many women report disturbed sleep during pregnancy, but its impact on
      clinical outcomes remains unknown. This study examined subjective sleep quality
      and daytime sleepiness in relation to preterm birth. METHODS: A convenience
      sample of 220 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),
      the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during
      the second trimester. Women who had preterm and full-term births were compared on
      these measures. RESULTS: The preterm birth rate of the sample was 14.6%. Sleep
      latency, the period from lights out to sleep onset, was significantly longer in
      the preterm group, which also reported a tendency to use more sleep medications, 
      but had lower PSQI daytime dysfunction scores. Perceived stress did not
      differentiate preterm and full-term groups. CONCLUSION: Disturbed sleep in
      pregnancy may be associated with preterm birth. Future studies should examine
      specific physiological factors that underlie this increased vulnerability.

TI  - Less-restrictive, patient-specific radiation safety precautions can be safely
      prescribed after permanent seed implantation.
PG  - 101-11
LID - 10.1016/j.brachy.2009.06.006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To use radiation exposure rate measurements to determine
      patient-specific radiation safety instructions with the aim of reducing
      unnecessary precaution times and to evaluate potential doses to members of the
      public. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation exposure rate measurements were obtained
      from 1279 patients with Stage T1-2 prostate cancer who underwent transperineal
      (125)I or (103)Pd seed implantation from January 1995 through July 2008. An
      algorithm was developed from these measurements to determine the required
      precaution times to maintain public effective doses below 50% of the limits for
      specific exposure situations. RESULTS: The median air kerma rates at 30 cm from
      the anterior skin surface were 4.9 microGy/h (range: 0.1-31.5) for (125)I and 1.5
      microGy/h (range: 0.02-14.9) for (103)Pd. The derived algorithms depended
      primarily on the half-life T(p), the measured exposure rate at 30 cm, and
      specific exposure situation factors. For the typical (103)Pd patient, no
      radiation safety precautions are required. For the typical (125)I patient, no
      precautions are required for coworkers, nonpregnant adults who do not sleep with 
      the patient, or nonpregnant adults who sleep with the patient. Typical (125)I
      patients should only avoid sleeping in the "spoon" position (i.e., in contact)
      with pregnant adults and avoid holding a child for long periods of time in the
      lap for about 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The large number of cases available for this
      study permitted the development of an algorithm to simply determine
      patient-specific radiation safety instructions. The resulting precaution times
      are significantly less restrictive than those generally prescribed currently.

AB  - This review on intra-individual factors affecting drug metabolism completes our
      series on the biochemistry of drug metabolism. The article presents the molecular
      mechanisms causing intra-individual differences in enzyme expression and
      activity. They include enzyme induction by transcriptional activation and enzyme 
      inhibition on the protein level. The influencing factors are of physiological,
      pathological, or external origin. Tissue characteristics and developmental age
      strongly influence enzyme-expression patterns. Further influencing factors are
      pregnancy, disease, or biological rhythms. Xenobiotics, drugs, constituents of
      herbal remedies, food constituents, ethanol, and tobacco can all influence enzyme
      expression or activity and, hence, affect drug metabolism.

TI  - Oromandibular dystonia and hormonal factors: twelve years follow-up of a case
      report.

AB  - Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder
      characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction,
      usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw
      and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year 
      follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral
      pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive
      position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up 
      to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent
      during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with
      botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a
      1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid
      muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary
      activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms
      occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after 
      both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the
      patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress
      and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible
      relationship between OMD and hormonal factors.

AB  - The review was made on gene pass conception as individual DNA data bank
      reflecting unique genetic peculiarities of each human, its major potential
      contribution in achievements of active longevity and creation most favorable
      conditions for maximal duration of individual life-span. Participation of major
      age-regulated genes such as biological clock genes and the weak chain genes in
      aging processes of humans is briefly outlined. The significance of genetic
      testing of allelic polymorphisms and marker-genes implicated in common
      multifactorial disorders is stressed. The problems evoked by genetic results
      interpretation are mentioned. Special attention is paid to Genome Wide
      Association Studies (GWAS) technology implemented for analysis of genetic
      profiles and candidate genes associated with common diseases. Scientific problems
      and social interests in creation of individually oriented DNA-data banks (Gene
      Passes) amenable for the pregnant women, children, sportsmen, etc. are discussed.
      The relationship of Gene Pass idea to the current international genetic program
      "Personificated Genome" is highlighted. Feasible perspectives for genetic testing
      and basic contribution of Gene Pass into gerontology practical medical service
      are reviewed.

TI  - Hazardous cosleeping environments and risk factors amenable to change:
      case-control study of SIDS in south west England.
PG  - b3666
LID - 10.1136/bmj.b3666 [doi]
LID - bmj.b3666 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the factors associated with sudden infant death
      syndrome (SIDS) from birth to age 2 years, whether recent advice has been
      followed, whether any new risk factors have emerged, and the specific
      circumstances in which SIDS occurs while cosleeping (infant sharing the same bed 
      or sofa with an adult or child). DESIGN: Four year population based case-control 
      study. Parents were interviewed shortly after the death or after the reference
      sleep (within 24 hours) of the two control groups. SETTING: South west region of 
      England (population 4.9 million, 184 800 births). PARTICIPANTS: 80 SIDS infants
      and two control groups weighted for age and time of reference sleep: 87 randomly 
      selected controls and 82 controls at high risk of SIDS (young, socially deprived,
      multiparous mothers who smoked). RESULTS: The median age at death (66 days) was
      more than three weeks less than in a study in the same region a decade earlier.
      Of the SIDS infants, 54% died while cosleeping compared with 20% among both
      control groups. Much of this excess may be explained by a significant
      multivariable interaction between cosleeping and recent parental use of alcohol
      or drugs (31% v 3% random controls) and the increased proportion of SIDS infants 
      who had coslept on a sofa (17% v 1%). One fifth of SIDS infants used a pillow for
      the last sleep (21% v 3%) and one quarter were swaddled (24% v 6%). More mothers 
      of SIDS infants than random control infants smoked during pregnancy (60% v 14%), 
      whereas one quarter of the SIDS infants were preterm (26% v 5%) or were in fair
      or poor health for the last sleep (28% v 6%). All of these differences were
      significant in the multivariable analysis regardless of which control group was
      used for comparison. The significance of covering the infant's head, postnatal
      exposure to tobacco smoke, dummy use, and sleeping in the side position has
      diminished although a significant proportion of SIDS infants were still found
      prone (29% v 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Many of the SIDS infants had coslept in a
      hazardous environment. The major influences on risk, regardless of markers for
      socioeconomic deprivation, are amenable to change and specific advice needs to be
      given, particularly on use of alcohol or drugs before cosleeping and cosleeping
      on a sofa.

AB  - CASE: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression,
      defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her
      bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her
      pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of
      authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an
      evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a
      transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and
      moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation,
      and Sonia may have been physically abused as well.Currently, Sonia is in third
      grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading,
      but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal
      and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to
      complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is
      because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned
      about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her
      younger brother and grandmother.Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term
      pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications.
      Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. 
      Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to
      read at the age of 3 years.Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity,
      seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings
      associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia "worries about
      everything," including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When
      an argument occurs at home, she "gets scared," bites her nails, and cries. Sonia 
      currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and
      grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and
      mental illness in the father's family.While conducting an interview with her
      mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. Instead, she illustrated
      a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She
      described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her
      persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was
      poor, her vocabulary, sequencing, and illustrations demonstrated above age-level 
      skills for written expression and drawing. Examples of the writing that
      accompanied the drawings include: "I hate when my parents fight. I get scared and
      feel sick to my tummy like I want to throw up. I just hate that feeling!" "My mom
      told me she had a 'boyfriend.' These words were the most horrible I ever heard.
      Soon a nightmare began. Nightmares make me very, very scared."

TI  - A prospective investigation of the relationships among sleep quality, physical
      symptoms, and depressive symptoms during pregnancy.
PG  - 317-20
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2009.09.015 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between
      pregnancy physical discomforts experienced during the second trimester and late
      pregnancy depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effect of sleep quality
      on antenatal depressive symptomatology. Healthy pregnant women (N=257) completed 
      the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Inventory at early-mid second trimester, and then again at late 
      third trimester. Physical symptoms and sleep quality at the first time point were
      both correlated moderately with depressive symptoms at late pregnancy. Discomfort
      associated with physical symptoms was a better predictor of depressive symptoms
      than Frequency of symptoms, although a score combining Frequency, Discomfort and 
      Effect of symptoms on life was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms.
      Results of the hierarchical regression analyses of the mediation model indicated 
      that physical symptoms at early-mid second trimester predicted depressive
      symptoms in the last trimester both directly, and via poor sleep quality
      (prospectively), which mediated the relationship. The clinical implications of
      these findings for antenatal care are discussed.

TI  - The effect of active and passive household cigarette smoke exposure on pregnant
      women with asthma.
PG  - 601-8
LID - 10.1378/chest.09-0942 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The article was designed to estimate the effect of active and passive
      household cigarette smoke exposure on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal 
      outcomes in pregnant women with asthma. METHODS: We used a secondary
      observational analysis of pregnant women with mild and moderate-severe asthma
      enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study of asthma in pregnancy and a
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing inhaled beclomethasone and oral
      theophylline. A baseline questionnaire detailing smoking history and passive
      household smoke exposure was given to each patient. Smoking status was confirmed 
      in the RCT using cotinine levels. Data on asthma severity and obstetric and
      neonatal outcomes were collected and analyzed with respect to self-reported
      tobacco smoke exposure. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson chi(2) statistics were used to
      test for significance. RESULTS: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in
      the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women
      reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported
      passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total
      symptomatic days (P < .001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P < .001). Among the
      newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age
      < 10th percentile (P < .001), and a lower mean birth weight (P < .001). There
      were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with
      and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Among
      pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with
      increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 419-31
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2009.02159.x [doi]
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensory-motor disorder that
      is characterized by intense restlessness and unpleasant creeping sensations deep 
      inside the lower legs. Symptoms appear when the legs are at rest and are worst in
      the evening and at night. They force patients to keep moving their legs, and
      often to get out of bed and wander about. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are also
      common during sleep amongst those suffering from RLS, and sleep efficiency is
      severely reduced. There are idiopathic as well as symptomatic forms of RLS, the
      latter being associated with e.g. pregnancy, iron deficiency and chronic renal
      failure. A family history of RLS is very common and pedigrees in these cases
      suggest an autosomal-dominant transmission with high penetrance. Genetic
      investigations have been performed in order to identify genes associated with
      RLS. Several loci have been found (on chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, 20p and 16p).
      Pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood. However, advanced brain
      imaging studies and positive results of dopaminergic treatment suggest that RLS
      may be generated by dopamine dysfunction locally within the central nervous
      system. At present, there is a wide range of treatment options including
      levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and
      iron supplements.

TI  - Molecular signatures reveal circadian clocks may orchestrate the homeorhetic
      response to lactation.
PG  - e7395
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0007395 [doi]
AB  - Genes associated with lactation evolved more slowly than other genes in the
      mammalian genome. Higher conservation of milk and mammary genes suggest that
      species variation in milk composition is due in part to the environment and that 
      we must look deeper into the genome for regulation of lactation. At the onset of 
      lactation, metabolic changes are coordinated among multiple tissues through the
      endocrine system to accommodate the increased demand for nutrients and energy
      while allowing the animal to remain in homeostasis. This process is known as
      homeorhesis. Homeorhetic adaptation to lactation has been extensively described; 
      however how these adaptations are orchestrated among multiple tissues remains
      elusive. To develop a clearer picture of how gene expression is coordinated
      across multiple tissues during the pregnancy to lactation transition, total RNA
      was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissues collected from rat dams (n =
      5) on day 20 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, and gene expression was
      measured using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two types of gene expression analysis were
      performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between days within a tissue 
      were identified with linear regression, and univariate regression was used to
      identify genes commonly up-regulated and down-regulated across all tissues. Gene 
      set enrichment analysis showed genes commonly up regulated among the three
      tissues enriched gene ontologies primary metabolic processes, macromolecular
      complex assembly and negative regulation of apoptosis ontologies. Genes enriched 
      in transcription regulator activity showed the common up regulation of 2 core
      molecular clock genes, ARNTL and CLOCK. Commonly down regulated genes enriched
      Rhythmic process and included: NR1D1, DBP, BHLHB2, OPN4, and HTR7, which regulate
      intracellular circadian rhythms. Changes in mammary, liver and adipose
      transcriptomes at the onset of lactation illustrate the complexity of homeorhetic
      adaptations and suggest that these changes are coordinated through molecular
      clocks.

TI  - Correlates of absolute and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.
PG  - 1559-66
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2008.1275 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be
      linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined. METHODS: In this
      observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body
      weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation.
      Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was
      used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models
      were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain 
      and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended 
      by the Institute of Medicine). RESULTS: Women gained 14.4 (+/-5.0) kg during
      pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4 kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant
      women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported
      increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over
      one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight,
      judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived
      elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with
      excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
      2.01-19.32; OR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36,
      respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for
      excessive weight gain (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR = 0.35, 95% CI:
      0.57, 0.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical
      activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as
      modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain.
      Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus 
      on the identified factors.

PG  - 624-47
LID - S0034-70942009000500013 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Temporal cycles (dark/light; birth/death; etc.), along
      with environmental conditions (synchronizers), influence labor physiology because
      of the presence of endogenous clocks (oscillators) that interact with social
      diuturnal clues. In this review, the most important cyclic anesthetic-obstetric
      parameters in parturient care are listed. CONTENTS: Chronobiological analysis of 
      the main events in the obstetric pathophysiology of Mulier sapiens: I)
      Embryogenesis - risk of teratogenesis; II) From prematurity to post-didacticism: 
      from eutocic labor to cervical cerclage; III) Night and labor: higher incidence
      of nocturnal labor (physiological facilitation) and daylight cesarean section
      (choice of the obstetrician); IV) The moon and labor - non-conclusive results; V)
      The night shift in obstetric anesthesia: riskier professional contingency; VI)
      Phases of cesarean section: removal of the fetus: UD stage (uterotomy - delivery)
      as brief as possible; effective correction of hypotension and valorize
      pre-anesthetic fasting; VII) circadian variation of dystocia: pain; uterine
      contraction; blood loss; hypertension (HTN); risk of allergy and asthma. In the
      nocturnal phase, the intensity of contraction and risk of hemorrhage, allergy,
      and asthma are greater. On the other hand, HTN in eclampsia does not show
      circadian variation; VIII) Obstetric chronopharmacology: local anesthetics,
      analgesics, hypnotics, general anesthetics, and neuromuscular blockers.
      Chronoenergy explains the matinal peak of opioid analgesia, vespertine of local
      anesthetic, and nocturnal of inhalational anesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: The
      chronobiological approach of labor anesthesia emphasizes the obstetric importance
      of circadian rhythmicity in labor humanization and safety.

TI  - [Clinical application of the Epworth sleepiness score in pregnant women with
      obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome].
PG  - 1914-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a convenient method for screening obstructive sleep
      apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pregnant women. METHODS: Seventy-eight
      pregnant women with suspected OSAHS were calculated for the EP index using
      Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) with also measurement of the neck circumference
      (NC) and body mass index (BMI). The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated and
      the lowest SaO(2) (LSaO(2)) measured through a 7-h polysomnography (PSG). The
      women were then divided into 4 groups according to the AHI and LSaO(2). The ESS
      was compared with the PSG-AHI and the receiver operating characteristic curve
      (ROC) was generated. RESULTS: All the clinical indexes (NC, BMI, EP, AHI, and
      LSaO(2)) showed significant differences between the 4 groups (P<0.05). EP and PSG
      were found to have greater correlations to AHI (r=0.759, P=0.000) than NC
      (r=0.668) and BMI (r=0.663). The area under the ROC of the EP (0.825) was greater
      than that of NC (0.772) and BMI (0.784). The index of EP showed greater clinical 
      diagnostic value of OSAHS in pregnancy. Base on the ROC, EP at the optimal
      operating point of 7.5 had a sensitivity of 76.8% and specificity of 68.2% for
      diagnosis of OSAHS in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The ESS is an economic and
      convenient method for screening OSAHS in pregnant women with high diagnostic
      sensitivity and specificity.

PG  - 376-82
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a strong link between female sex hormones and sleep. This 
      implies the existence of sex differences both in the structure of sleep as in the
      incidence of various sleep disorders. AIM: To review the changes in the pattern
      of sleep experienced by women along different stages of their life cycle (fertile
      period, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause and postmenopause), as well as the
      most frequent sleeping pathologies in which there exist more gender differences
      (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome and
      narcolepsy). DEVELOPMENT: About normal sleeping has been reported a higher
      quality of it, in women compared with men (increased sleeping time, reduced sleep
      onset latency, and a greater efficiency of sleeping), but they frequently
      complain of sleep problems. Moreover, different stages in the life of women are
      associated with significant physiological and hormonal changes that favour the
      disruption of normal sleep pattern and by this way, possibly, increase risk to
      suffer sleep disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The reasons that underlie in gender
      differences in sleeping disorders are attributed to differences in normal sleep
      pattern, in the clinical manifestations and risk factors for sleep disorders, and
      in the results and optimal dose of treatments.

TI  - Classical Rett Syndrome in a Ghanaian child: a case report.
PG  - 134-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Rett Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder in females is
      thought to be relatively common from worldwide studies. There are few or probably
      no reports from the West African sub region. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Rett 
      Syndrome in a Ghanaian. METHODS: Using International Diagnostic criteria for Rett
      syndrome, a 21-month old female presenting with mental retardation and autistic
      features was followed up for nearly two years and all clinical features and
      relevant investigations recorded. RESULTS: Pregnancy and delivery were
      uneventful, child developed normally till age 12 years when her development began
      to decline. She exhibited handwriting and bruxism was underweight with
      microcephaly investigations were normal except for epileptiform discharges on EEG
      and prolonged QT interval on ECG. She was treated with melatonin and dompor for
      her sleep and reflect problems respectively. The patient met the criteria for a
      diagnosis of classical Rett Syndrome. CONCLUSION: This report shows that Rett
      syndrome does exist in the West African sub-region. It is possible to identify
      the condition in girls presenting with mental retardation or autistic features if
      they are appropriately followed up.

TI  - Changing patterns of daily rhythmicity across reproductive states in diurnal
      female Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus).
PG  - 547-56
LID - 10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.08.012 [doi]
AB  - A suite of changes in circadian rhythms have been described in nocturnal rodents 
      as females go through pregnancy and lactation, but there is no information on
      such patterns in diurnal species. As the challenges faced by these two groups of 
      animals are somewhat different, we characterized changes in activity and core
      body temperature (T(b)) in female diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus)
      as they went through a series of reproductive states: virgin, pregnant, pregnant 
      and lactating, lactating only, and post-weaning. The phase of neither rhythm
      varied, but the amplitude did. Females increased their overall levels of daily
      activity from early to late pregnancy, regardless of whether they were also
      lactating. The pattern of activity was less rhythmic during early than
      mid-lactation, in both non-pregnant and pregnant females, as a consequence of a
      decrease in daytime relative to nighttime activity. The T(b) rhythm amplitude
      dropped from mid-pregnancy through mid-lactation, and there were rises in T(b)
      troughs during the mid-light and mid-dark phases of the day, though pregnancy and
      lactation affected T(b) at these times in somewhat different ways. This study
      demonstrates that rhythms in diurnal grass rats change during pregnancy and
      lactation in different ways than those of nocturnal species that have been
      studied to date and that the effects of pregnancy and lactation are not additive 
      in any simple way.

PG  - 249-57
LID - 10.1007/s00737-009-0104-3 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health
      related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n = 245)
      completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life 
      stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester.
      Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian
      normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL
      domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, 
      bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions
      were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems
      emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the
      exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently
      associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain,
      general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. 
      Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores 
      on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems.
      Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical
      domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early
      in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed.

TI  - Prenatal origins of poor sleep in children.
PG  - 1086-92
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal
      tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in
      children. DESIGN: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children
      born at term. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep duration and efficiency were
      measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used
      both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and
      low sleep efficiency ( < or = 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep
      Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth
      were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight
      and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7),
      respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of
      parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0).
      Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to
      7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and
      low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, 
      gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8
      years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Poor
      sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol 
      consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size
      at birth.

AB  - Sleep complaints are a common occurrence in pregnancy that are in part due to
      pregnancy-associated anatomic and physiological changes but may also be due to
      pathological causes. In the non-pregnant population, sleep deprivation has been
      associated with physical and cognitive issues; poor sleep may even be associated 
      with adverse maternal outcomes. Maternal obesity, one of the most prevalent risk 
      factors in obstetric practices, together with physiologic changes of pregnancy
      predispose to the development of sleep disordered breathing. Symptoms of sleep
      disordered breathing have also been associated with poor maternal outcomes.
      Management options of restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy pose a challenge in
      pregnancy; benefits of therapy need to be weighed against the potential harm to
      the fetus. This article briefly reviews the normal changes in pregnancy affecting
      sleep, gives an overview of certain sleep disorders occurring in pregnancy, and
      suggests management options specific for this population.

AB  - Snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome and obesity
      hypoventilation syndrome are all defined as sleep-disordered breathing. Many
      changes occur in the respiratory system and sleep physiology during pregnancy due
      to physical and hormonal causes. Functional residual capacity, total sleep time, 
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and stage 3-4 non-REM sleep are reduced during the
      third trimester of pregnancy. Snoring is more prevalent in pregnant women than
      nonpregnant women. Snoring during pregnancy may be associated with pregnancy
      induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation and low APGAR
      scores in infant. The prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome during pregnancy is
      unknown. All pregnant women, especially obese and preeclamptic were asked to
      possibility of sleep disordered breathing. In this review we summarized, first
      normal physiological changes of respiratory system and sleep during pregnancy,
      second maternal and fetal outcome of sleep disordered breathing and finally
      treatment of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.
