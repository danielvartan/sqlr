N2  - Presents a case report of a 34 years old female. The patient and her identical twin were diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) in 2004 at 22. At that time, patient's urine was tested positive for porphobilinogen, coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin. One year later, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with poor sleep, restlessness and high energy. From 2004, she had multiple admissions to general hospitals for abdominal pain and AIP relapse, triggered by reduced food intake and menstruation. The patient and her twin experienced vomiting episodes, abdominal pain and radiating nerve pain, lasting two weeks. She also experienced a relapsing remitting course of a variety of psychiatric symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, mood and anxiety symptoms, that coincided with her porphyria attacks. Each exacerbation of her psychiatric symptoms coincided with an attack of porphyria. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Once a woman becomes postmenopausal, ovarian function ceases completely, and the symptoms of the postmenopause—relate to an estrogen deficiency syndrome. This chapter focuses on the menopause transition, also known as the climacteric. As these symptoms and signs are usually reported as a continuum, we usually consider them together, and classify them into several types: (1) Vasomotor—these include "hot flashes," palpitations, night sweats, an altered sleep pattern and fatigue; (2) Neuromuscular—these include headaches and joint and muscle pain. Other degenerative changes may occur such as hair and skin changes, which can include a crawling sensation (formication) and itchy skin; (3) Psychogenic—these include poor concentration, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety, claustrophobia, agoraphobia, irritability, difficulty coping, tearfulness and lack of drive, including sex drive; (4) Urogenital— symptoms of vaginal dryness, uterovaginal prolapse and urinary symptoms of urge incontinence/overactive bladder. Although stress incontinence is more common in postmenopausal women, the etiology of this is probably not due to estrogen deficiency; and (5) Indirect symptoms of menopausal osteoporosis—repeated fractures.

N2  - Loss of libido is the most common sexual complaint of women, often being a find common pathway of many sexual disorders. However, the degree of distress associated with loss of libido may be minimal and therefore not sexually dysfunctional. Lack of arousal and orgasmic disorders are frequently correlated with loss of libido, as are sexual pain disorders. It is important for the medical doctor to help the patient decipher the chain of events and their combination, to facilitate change and improvement. Making assumptions about a particular set of expectations is likely to lead to neglect of key factors. In psychosexual medicine, listening and observing the patient's expression of feelings can help to interpret the predominant issue(s) which can be resolved using brief psychotherapeutic intervention. The menopause is associated with specific features that may directly contribute to sexual decline. Symptoms of mood change and lability, night sweats and flashing, sleep problems and urogenital atrophic changes can be dealt with by the use of medication, most appropriately hormone replacement therapy.

N2  - Previously I demonstrated that the slow wave sleep (SWS) functioned to adjust the emotional balance disrupted by emotional memories randomly accumulated during waking, while the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep played the opposite role. Many experimental results have unambiguously shown that various emotional memories are processed during REM sleep. In this article, it is attempted to combine this confirmed function of REM sleep with the atonic state unique to REM sleep, and to integrate a new theory suggesting that improvement of muscular efficiency be a new function of REM sleep. This new function of REM sleep is more advantageous than the function of REM sleep in emotional memories and disinhibited drives to account for the phylogenetic variations of REM sleep, especially the absence of REM sleep in dolphins and short duration of REM sleep in birds in contrary to that in humans and rodents, the absence of penile erections in REM sleep in armadillo, as well as the higher voltage in EEG during REM sleep in platypus and ostrich. Besides, this new function of REM sleep is also advantageous to explain the association of REM sleep with the atonic episodes in SWS, the absence of drastic menopausal change in duration of REM sleep, and the effects of ambient temperature on the duration of REM sleep. These comparative and experimental evidences support the improvement of muscular efficiency as a new and major function of REM sleep. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  -  The present study investigated the concomitants of menopause-specific quality of life among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Based on the Wilson and Cleary model of quality of life, this cross-sectional study recruited 329 women of age 40–65 years following operational convenience. The study was conducted in the office of the Korea Population, Health and Welfare Association (KPHWA) in Incheon, South Korea. Data collected on sociodemographic characteristics, social support, biological/physiological characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-K), and self-rated health. Menopause-specific quality of life questionnaire (MENQOL) was used in this study. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was performed. The study found that social support and self-rated health were negatively correlated with MENQOL in premenopausal women, while the income level and self-rated health were negatively associated with MENQOL in postmenopausal women. Sleep quality was positively correlated with MENQOL in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The study results indicate the need for tailored approaches based on menopausal status. Especially, social support may help improve the MENQOL of premenopausal women, while in postmenopausal women, improved sleep quality may enhance their menopause-specific quality of life.

N2  - In terms of reproductive and social functions, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is best known as a major regulator of prolactin secretion in vertebrates and hence, as an essential contributor to parental care. However, VIP and its cognate VPAC receptors are distributed throughout the social behavior network in the brain, suggesting that VIP circuits may play important roles in a variety of behaviors. With the exception of VIP neuronal populations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and tuberal hypothalamus (which regulate circadian rhythms and prolactin secretion, respectively), we have known very little about the functional properties of VIP circuits until recently. The present review highlights new roles for VIP signaling in avian social behaviors such as affiliation, gregariousness, pair bonding and aggression, and discusses recent advances in VIP's role as a regulator of biological rhythms, including the potential timing of ovulation, photoperiodic response and seasonal migration.

N2  - This study analyzed the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and associated factors among Cambodian women. A cross-sectional study was performed with 200 women aged 40–60 years in three provinces and one urban area in Cambodia from July 2017 to August 2017. Three symptom categories: somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms (totaling 11 symptoms) related to menopause were assessed using the Khmer version of Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Over one-fifth (21.5%) of the participants were premenopausal; 22.5% were perimenopausal, and 56% were postmenopausal. Somatic and psychological symptoms occurred more frequently than urogenital symptoms in all three statuses. The three most prevalent symptoms for all women were physical and mental exhaustion (88.1%), irritability (85.9%), and sleep problems (82.5%). The average MRS score was 12.22 ± 5.37 (range 0–44). Postmenopausal women had significantly higher rates of menopausal symptoms than pre- and perimenopausal women. Increased severity of menopausal symptoms was associated with less personal income (≤100 US$), higher parity (>4 children), abortion(s), use of calcium supplements, and history of heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. This study demonstrated a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms among Cambodian women in Cambodia. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to deal with independent factors associated with these symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Menopause is associated with problematic symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep problems, mood disorders, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and declines in cognitive functioning. Many women seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for symptom management. This article critically reviews the existing literature on CAM treatments most commonly used for menopausal symptoms. Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant, English-language literature published through March 2017. Results indicate that mind and body practices may be of benefit in reducing stress and bothersomeness of some menopausal symptoms. In particular, hypnosis is a mind-body intervention that has consistently shown to have a clinically significant effect on reducing hot flashes. Evidence is mixed in regard to the efficacy of natural products and there are some safety concerns. Health care providers should consider the evidence on CAM in providing an integrative health approach to menopausal symptom management. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep disorders affect people at all stages of life. For women, sleep complaints may vary by hormonal status as well as life stage. Certain broad perceptions about sleep and sleep disorders are supported by population surveys. In earlier research, most study populations that included women did not differentiate findings by gender. Even in studies of women with sleep disorders, the potential effects of hormonal condition or reproductive status were not identified. These topics have been more frequently addressed in recent years. Women develop more sleep problems during pregnancy and with menopause. Postmenopausal and elderly woman have more insomnia complaints while sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases in the peri- and postmenopausal population. This chapter provides an introduction to recent findings on sleep and women from menarche to menopause. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This chapter discusses Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and its management in premenopausal women. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent sleep-induced collapsibility of the pharyngeal airway. Normal adult women (ages 20-45 years) are a cohort of women in whom menstrual cycles, the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and lactation are associated with a varied hormonal environment. These differences in the hormonal status may in turn potentially change the likelihood for the development of OSAHS in premenopausal women. The clinical spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing includes apnea, hypopneas, and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is an extremely common disorder in reproductive-age women. Affected patients frequently complain of menstrual irregularities, symptoms of hyperandrogenism, and infertility. The entity was first characterized by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, who observed enlarged ovaries, obesity, hirsutism, and infertility associated with chronic anovulation. Because PCOS is associated in the long term with diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, accurate diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that PCOS is also a significant risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and can be a debilitating condition leading to serious health problems if not treated or diagnosed adequately.

N2  -  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder. In women, the frequency of OSA increases substantially during and after the menopause, as does the prevalence of obesity in this reproductive life stage. This cross-sectional study uses data from the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO, 2007), and comprises a sample of 500 women aged 20–80 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the factors associated with OSA in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. All participants underwent polysomnography, and obesity was assessed using the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body mass index, neck and waist circumference, measured using standard methods. WHtR was the factor most associated with a significant increase in risk of OSA in premenopausal women. Waist circumference was the factor most associated with OSA in postmenopausal women, for all severities of the disease. Anthropometric factors presented a high rate of accuracy in the classification of women with OSA. The study found that different obesity-related anthropometric measures should be considered in the diagnosis of OSA, according to the woman’s reproductive stage.

N2  - There is no more fraught topic for parents with spectrum kids than dating and sex. Kids on the spectrum struggle to understand complex, nuanced social situations—just the kinds of situations that dating and sex place them into. Social stories can be very helpful in training teens on the spectrum to understand how to ask someone out and what to expect on a date. Spectrum kids' relative weakness in interpreting and understanding the motivations and emotions of other people makes them particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some girls and women on the spectrum may require birth control options to control menstruation if they are on different types of medication or struggle with hygiene issues. Sensory issues and weakness in social understanding can make it hard for kids on the spectrum to understand proper hygiene and to follow it. Children with autism may also have sleep and eating disorders. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article Mood disorder history and personality assessment in premenstrual dysphoric disorder by S. K. Dørheim (2001). Pregnancy and the postpartum period are characterized by dramatic physical, mental, and hormonal changes. Sleep is disrupted particularly in the third trimester, when the majority of women report awakening at night, and sleep continues to be disrupted for the first few months postpartum in mothers, mainly due to meeting the needs of the newborn. The disruption to sleep is expected and considered a normal part of pregnancy and postpartum. However, for some women, clinically significant poor sleep quality can have negative consequences for maternal and fetal health. Disturbed sleep is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. An important question is: What factors determine whether a woman will experience more severe sleep disruption during her pregnancy or will be impacted to a greater extent by the typical sleep disruption?

N2  - Women breast cancer survivors frequently experience a wide range of long-lasting physiological and psychological symptoms and side effects that result from their experiences of being diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer. The most common late and long-term symptoms and side effects among these women include: lymphedema of the arm; numbness, tingling, or tightness in the chest walls, arms, or shoulders; chronic pain; impaired fertility; premature menopause; cardiovascular problems; osteoporosis; myalgia (muscle pain); arthralgia (joint pain); chronic fatigue, chronic sleep problems, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, fear of recurrence, depression, cognitive impairment, poor body image, sexual dysfunction, and decreased life satisfaction. Breast cancer survivors' posttreatment symptomatology may negatively impact their quality of life. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is an 8-week psychosocial group program that can be effective in alleviating women breast cancer survivors' posttreatment physiological and psychological residual symptomatology, in addition to improving their quality of life, well-being, and cancer prognosis.

N2  - Reviews the book, Cure: A Journey Into the Science of Mind Over Body by Jo Marchant (see record 2016-07494-000). Along with the aging of our population and people living longer than ever before, chronic diseases and stress-related conditions are becoming both a burden and a responsibility of the future. Chronic diseases and stress-related conditions impose a huge financial cost on a nation, and call for new and different approaches to caring for a population whose demographics are changing. With this book, Marchant argues that part of the different approach may be in understanding the links between mind and body, or what we commonly know to be a part of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Besides chronic diseases, mind–body therapy and techniques have been used in a variety of other health conditions (Barnes, Bloom, & Nahin, 2008), including mental health, sleep disturbances, menopause, nutrition, substance abuse, domestic violence, and cancer. This book would be interesting for a wide audience. It is written for a lay reader but offers enough for a more sophisticated reader and/or a scientist.

N2  - There has been an increased awareness of windows of vulnerability, reflected in greater adoption of screening tools for mood and behavioral changes in the postpartum period and the recent recognition by the American Psychiatric Association of the severity and functional impairment associated with the occurrence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), leading to its inclusion as a diagnostic category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition). The existence of a menopause-associated depression, however, has been a more controversial point. Although it is undeniable that changes in sex hormones and metabolism may affect quality of life (QOL) and overall functioning among some women during midlife years, other factors — unrelated to the menopause transition — may also influence depression at this stage in life, including comorbid medical conditions, cardiovascular issues, vasomotor symptoms (VMS), sleep problems, and stressful life events, to name a few.

N2  - Women experience increased vulnerability for both mood and sleep disorders, and the female menstrual cycle represents one fundamental mechanism related to risk. This review evaluates recent literature integrating female reproduction, sleep, and mood. For as many as one third of women, sleep is disrupted premenstrually, and sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent in those with premenstrual mood disorders. Variation in sleep patterns, circadian rhythm alterations, and decreased melatonin secretions due to hormonal fluctuations during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle could explain sleep complaints and have been linked to menstrual irregularity. Menstrual irregularity is also independently associated with increased risk of mood complaints and poor sleep. Therefore, there is growing evidence for the interactional relationships between poor sleep, circadian rhythm disruption, and mood in reproductive-age women, although further research relating to specific mechanisms of risk are needed.

N2  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman’s life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

N2  - Purpose This study was performed to determine relationship between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and sleep quality among nursing and medical students. Design and Methods This descriptive, cross‐sectional and correlational study was completed with 313 students attending the nursing department and medical faculty. Data were collected using the premenstrual syndrome scale (PMSS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Findings The PSQI was positively correlated with PMSS and its subscales scores. Sleep changes were the strongest predictor, followed by depressive thoughts (p < .01), depressive mood, bloating and total PMSS (p < .05) for sleep quality. Practice Implications Training should be organized about PMS for university students to provide information and skills about managing symptoms, and to increase the awareness about this syndrome. Interventional studies should be planned to increase sleep quality in PMS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which the upper airway becomes constricted or occluded during sleep, leading to decreased or absent airflow, hypoxia, and sympathetic activation. This chain of events, occurring dozens of times an hour, can contribute to the development of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. This article discusses the epidemiology of comorbid OSA and cardiovascular disease, the pathophysiology of OSA, how it acts as a risk factor for cardiovascular problems, and how appropriate treatment of OSA ameliorates the consequences. The importance of having a high suspicion for OSA in people with risk factors (including obesity, middle age, male or postmenopausal female) or symptoms (snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating) is pointed out. The article concludes with clinical and research implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - One of the defining symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is abnormally elevated arousal levels, appearing as both hypervigilance during waking, and disturbed sleep. In this chapter we address the following topics relevant to elevated arousal levels in PTSD: (1) we briefly review arousal systems in the brain and the evidence concerning hyperarousal in PTSD; (2) we outline catecholamine (epinephrine and norepinephrine) responses to stressors and trauma; (3) we provide an overview of the evidence for genetic vulnerability of the arousal system in PTSD; (4) we examine the noradrenergic arousal system that most likely contributes to hyperarousal and sleep disturbance symptoms; (5) we propose a mechanism by which hyperactivity in the noradrenergic system at times when it normally falls silent (i.e., REM sleep and the transition to REM sleep) would contribute to contextual memory-processing deficits and provide a positive feedback loop in the pathophysiology of PTSD; and (6) we discuss how differential catecholamine regulation of arousal systems during phases of the menstrual cycle can lead to sex differences in susceptibility to PTSD.

N2  - Hot flashes (HFs) are a prominent symptom of menopause known to unfavorably influence mood, sleep, and quality of life. More women living with HIV are entering menopause and may experience a greater prevalence of HFs and more severe HFs compared with uninfected women. This integrative review evaluated existing evidence on potential health characteristics associated with HFs in women living with HIV during menopause. A search strategy was conducted within 6 databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the review, and the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice model was used to evaluate methodological quality and appraisal of the evidence. Five articles met the review eligibility criteria. Three content categories emerged from the key findings of the 5 articles: HIV-specific characteristics, mental health and cognitive characteristics, and quality of life and social characteristics. Implications for research and clinical care were identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep dysfunction is one of the primary symptoms reported by patients with psychiatric disorders, specifically those suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders. Conversely, primary insomnia and other sleep dysfunctions produce symptoms of mood disturbance that are similar to those reported by patients with psychiatric disorders. Because of this overlap in the symptoms and treatments for insomnias and psychiatric disorders, it is important for clinicians to be able to accurately identify the root cause of sleep dysfunction in individual patients in order to optimize treatment. Part of the Oxford Psychiatry Library series, Sleep Disorders, Second Edition provides clinicians with an overview of the current understanding of sleep physiology, the pathophysiology of sleep disturbance, and the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. This second edition includes new sections covering sleep problems in children and the elderly, sleep in pregnancy and menopause, and new algorithms from the British Association of Psychopharmacology's (BAP's) new Consensus Guidelines on the management of sleep disorders.

N2  - The study of some of the characteristics of the female libido and of other features which are exclusive to the female inner world might help us to understand the aetiology of perversion in women. We might then see female perversions not as parallels to the psychopathology found in men, but as having their own separate and distinct causes. There is a dramatic difference in the sense of temporality in males and females. Women have a ‘biological clock’ that is present and evident from the moment they are born. From menarche to menopause, this clock dominates women's lifespan and subjects her to the hope/dread of pregnancy. This grounds women firmly in the reality principle. They not only have a different libidinal development from men but they also experience a sense of pressure provided by this inexorable marking of the passage of time which is exclusive to their sex and is intimately related to their reproductive functions.

N2  - Sleep quality in women has been linked to changes in hormone levels due to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum recovery, and menopause. Postpartum women are more likely to experience sleep disturbances than any non-postpartum women, with the most reporting exhaustion during the first 3 postpartum months. The most common reasons for sleep disturbances are related to newborn sleep and feeding patterns. A sudden drop in placental hormones following birth, as well as the unpredictable sleep patterns of the newborn, contributes to the postpartum woman's poor sleep and alteration of her circadian rhythm. Complaints about excessive sleepiness, fatigue and sleep loss should be evaluated by health care providers, considering the fact that they are potentially harmful to the newborn and relationship with postpartum depression. They should be treated with proper pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic ones to sleep disturbances should be viewed with caution during lactation because of the risk to infant development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Childhood obesity is a public health crisis that continues to grow in size and whose impact threatens the future well-being of today's children. The causes are complex and multi-factorial; and the consequences are both chronic and serious in nature. Insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndromes, fatty liver disease, menstrual abnormalities, gallstones, sleep apnea, poor body image, low self esteem, and discrimination are all potential consequences of childhood obesity. Research indicates that school-based interventions have the potential to be effective in reducing body mass index and childhood obesity. Increasing physical activity opportunities, requiring nutritional education for all students, altering the environment to encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors, and creating a school wellness council have all shown to be effective in decreasing childhood obesity, although to varying degrees. This paper proposes an evidence-based guideline for the management of childhood obesity in schools, based on the available literature. However, some findings are inconsistent and some of the interventions are expensive to implement. Further research is suggested in an effort to further refine these guidelines.

N2  - Insomnia is a frequent climacteric symptom. This pilot, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial compared estradiol associated with trimegestone or placebo in 12 women with perimenopausal insomnia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered, and polysomnography was performed at baseline and after 28 days. Sleep efficiency and median score of the PSQI improved significantly in the hormone therapy group (HT) (p = 0.041 and p = 0.027, respectively) and not in placebo group. Perimenopausal insomnia improved after short-term HT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Since 1962, when Critchley and Hoffman coined the term Kleine–Levin Syndrome (KLS) for the triad of hypersomnia, excessive eating and “often abnormal behavior” which they have observed in 11 adolescent boys, the number of patients recognized with this rare syndrome expanded, the spectrum of the clinical presentation, disease course, prognosis, gender specificity and the presence of familial cases were established. However, in spite of the progress made in neuroscience, the search for the cause, neuroanatomy, pathophysiology and drug treatment of KLS is still ongoing. In this mini-review we will describe in some detail the scientific efforts made to understand in depth the complex symptomatology of KLS and refer also to updated findings reached up till now.

N2  - The menopause—the last menstrual period—takes place within a gradual process of physiologic change, but also concurrently with age and developmental changes, and within varied psychosocial and cultural contexts. Psychological perspectives on menopause include the meanings of menopause, appraisals and attributions of symptoms to menopause, as well as cognitive, affective and behavioral reactions to the menopause. Assessment and psychological interventions will be described here with particular reference to depression, anxiety, sleep and vasomotor symptoms—hot flashes and night sweats. The chapter first discusses what the literature tells us about the roles of psychological and social factors on women's experience during the menopause.

N2  - Across the life cycle of women, the quality and quantity of sleep can be markedly impacted by both internal (e.g., hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms) and external (financial, marital, and child care responsibilities) factors. This chapter will outline some of the major phases of the adult life cycle in women that have been associated with sleep problems. The main messages from this chapter include that sleep disturbance and sleep disorders are common in women and increase across the lifespan for a variety of reasons; once identified, the sleep problem is generally best addressed by the standard therapeutic approach, although special cases arise in pregnant and lactating women due to concern for the fetus and child; and little systematic, large-scale research has been performed in virtually every area reviewed. This chapter is organized into sections that address sleep problems associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and the perimenopause.

N2  - Comments on an article by C. Diaz-Piedra et al. (see record 2015-33755-004). There is no doubt that sleep disruption is a distinct clinical feature of fibromyalgia (FM). As noted by Diaz-Piedra and colleagues, there is a robust literature documenting the presence of sleep problems among patients with FM. Almost all women with FM self report poor sleep quality and objective measures of sleep have frequently documented evidence of disordered sleep. Regardless of which of these suppositions is true, identifying subgroups of patients with similar sleep complaints could be a useful first step in understanding the range of etiologies that result in an FM phenotype, which would aid in the development of more effective treatments and perhaps prevention strategies. It is time to move beyond small studies. It is time for a large epidemiological study of sleep in patients with FM that purposefully includes patients with a wide range of BMI; a study that documents rather than excludes comorbid medical and psychological comorbidities, and carefully documents menopause status. It is time for a clear picture, rather than a series of snapshots of very different patient populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - While women have a higher objective sleep efficiency than do men, they paradoxically report more sleep problems. It is unclear whether the reporting gap is a descriptive difference or measurement problem. Certainly, some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and hypersomnolence, are more frequent in women, whereas others, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), are more prevalent in men. This chapter reviews gender-specific sleep disorders and the impact of pair-sleeping in the context of sex differences in sleep, reproductive phases, and circadian timing across the life span.

N2  - This editorial focuses on combat menopause as an Alzheimer’s risk factors. Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in Western societies, affecting over 50 million people worldwide, and projected to nearly triple by the year 2050. The menopause transition is a midlife neuroendocrine transition state unique to the female that ends with reproductive senescence. However, symptoms are largely neurological in nature, including disruption of estrogen-regulated systems such as thermoregulation, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as depression and impairment in multiple cognitive domains.

N2  - A growing body of work supports the concept that menopause is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). These observations come from clinical and population data examining the relationship between menopausal status and sleep-disordered breathing, studies examining the clinical characteristics of disease in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and laboratory studies seeking to understand what changes occur to place postmenopausal risk at increased risk for sleep apnea. This chapter will review what is known about the increased prevalence of OSA among postmenopausal women, how menopausal status affects the presentation of sleep disordered breathing, and the mechanisms that may underlie the development of sleep apnea among postmenopausal women.

N2  - Insomnia is defined as a persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. A comprehensive history and physical examination differentiate the subtypes of insomnia: acute, chronic, and associated with comorbid disorders. Evaluation of insomnia entails understanding the predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors of insomnia unique to each person. Effective treatment is incomplete without implementing cognitive- behavioral therapy for behaviors nonconducive to sleep as monotherapy or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Setting realistic goals and expectations of quality and quantity of sleep required to feel rested determine treatment success and outcomes. This article reviews the prevalence, symptoms, subtypes, and diagnosis and management of insomnia, particularly in women with emotional and hormonal changes of symptomatic premenstrual syndrome, pregnancy, and menopause.

N2  - Comments on an article by Megan Sands-Lincoln et al. (see record 2013-20778-003). Lincoln et al. explored the relationship between sleep duration, insomnia, and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in post-menopausal women. The study found that participants with high insomnia scores had a modest yet significant increased risk for the incidence of CHD and CVD in fully adjusted models. The association between insomnia and CHD found in the Lincoln et al. study was not as strong as a previous study with middle-aged Chinese participants. The exclusive inclusion of post-menopausal women could have played some role in the differences. This was the first study to explore and identify an interaction between sleep duration and insomnia. The findings from the present study highlight the importance of sleep in women's health. Future research on the relationship between sleep and CHD would ideally have repeated measures of sleep parameters, confounders, and mediators over the life-course to appropriately gauge their influence.

N2  - With age, many aspects of the brain structure undergo a pronounced decline, yet individuals generally function well until advanced old age. There appear to be several compensatory mechanisms in brain aging, but their precise nature is not well characterized. Here we provide evidence that the brain of older adults expends more energy when compared to younger adults, as manifested by an age-related increase (P = 0.03) in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO₂) (N = 118, men = 56, ages 18 to 74). We further showed that, before the mean menopausal age of 51years old, female and male groups have similar rates of CMRO₂ increase (P = 0.015) and there was no interaction between age and sex effects (P = 0.85). However, when using data from the entire age range, women have a slower rate of CMRO₂ change when compared to men (P < 0.001 for age × sex interaction term). Thus, menopause and estrogen level may have played a role in this sex difference. Our data also revealed a possible circadian rhythm of CMRO₂ in that brain metabolic rate is greater at noon than in the morning (P = 0.02). This study reveals a potential neurobiological mechanism for age-related compensation in brain function and also suggests a sex-difference in its temporal pattern.

N2  - Background: Menopause is associated with poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, which may lead to impaired quality of life and impaired functioning in daily activities. Objective: To study whether exercise training improves sleep quality or decreases the amount of night time hot flushes among menopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. Study design: A randomized controlled trial. Sedentary women (N = 176) aged 43–63 years with menopausal symptoms were randomized to a six-month unsupervised aerobic training intervention (50 min 4 times per week) or a control group. Both groups attended lectures on physical activity and health once a month. Main outcome measures: Sleep quality and the amount of hot flushes disturbing sleep. The women reported daily via mobile phone whether hot flushes had disturbed their sleep and how they had slept (scale 1–5). Responses received by mobile phone over the 6-month period totaled on average 125 (5.2 per week) responses per participant. Results: At baseline there was no difference between the groups in the demographic variables. Sleep quality improved significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (OR 1.02; 95% CI = 1.0–1.05, p = 0.043). The odds for sleep improvement were 2% per week in the intervention group and a decrease of 0.5% per week in the control group. The amount of hot flushes related to sleep diminished (p = 0.004) by the end of the intervention. Conclusions: Aerobic training for 6 months may improve sleep quality and reduce hot flushes among symptomatic menopausal women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 281 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2021-15931-073). Fig. 3 contains an incorrect graphical illustration of the results based on the group comparison between women with a history of depression and women without prior depression regarding their current symptoms of depression. The corrected figure is provided in the erratum.] Background: There is a prevalence peak of depression in the perimenopause, with this reproductive phase being considered a window of vulnerability due to major biopsychosocial changes. Depression has been associated with physical and psychosocial impairment. Prior depression has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of several somatic and mental diseases. We assume that women with prior depression will exhibit increased burdensome symptoms in the perimenopause compared to women without prior depression. Methods: A total of 135 perimenopausal women aged 40–56 years participated in the longitudinal Swiss Perimenopause Study. For the purpose of this investigation, a cross-sectional design was chosen. A wide range of validated psychosocial questionnaires were used to compare women with and without prior depression regarding their experience of the perimenopause. Findings were statistically adjusted for multiple testing. Results: Women with prior depression showed significantly more depressive symptoms (U = 1215.5, p U = 1395.0, p U = 1583.5, p U = 1573.0, p U = 1524.0, p < .05) than those without prior depression. Limitations: Self-report data may affect the results. Furthermore, due to the cross-sectional design, causality cannot be inferred. Conclusions: Prior depression affects women's experience of the perimenopause. Women with prior depression exhibit significantly more negative health outcomes in the perimenopause than those without prior depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To systematically review placebo-controlled randomized trials of homeopathy for psychiatric conditions. Data Sources: Eligible studies were identified using the following databases from database inception to April 2010: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Horn-Inform, Cochrane CENTRAL, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine grantee publications database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Gray literature was also searched using Google, Google Scholar, the European Committee for Homeopathy, inquiries with homeopathic experts and manufacturers, and the bibliographic lists of included published studies and reviews. Search terms were as follows: (homeopath* or homoeopath*) and (placebo or sham) and (anxiety or panic or phobia or post-traumatic stress or PTSD or obsessive-compulsive disorder or fear or depress* or dysthym* or attention deficit hyperactivity or premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder or traumatic brain injury or fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalitis or insomnia or sleep disturbance). Searches included only English-language literature that reported randomized controlled trials in humans. Study Selection: Trials were included if they met 7 criteria and were assessed for possible bias using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 50 guidelines. Overall assessments were made using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation procedure. Identified studies were grouped into anxiety or stress, sleep or circadian rhythm complaints, premenstrual problems, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mild traumatic brain injury, and functional somatic syndromes. Results: Twenty-five eligible studies were identified from an initial pool of 1,431. Study quality according to SIGN 50 criteria varied, with 6 assessed as good, 9 as fair, and 10 as poor. Outcome was unrelated to SIGN quality. Effect size could be calculated in 16 studies, and number needed to treat, in 10 studies. Efficacy was found for the functional somatic syndromes group (fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome), but not for anxiety or stress. For other disorders, homeopathy produced mixed effects. No placebo-controlled studies of depression were identified. Meaningful safety data were lacking in the reports, but the superficial findings suggested good tolerability of homeopathy. A funnel plot in 13 studies did not support publication bias (χ²i = 1.923, P = .166). Conclusions: The database on studies of homeopathy and placebo in psychiatry is very limited, but results do not preclude the possibility of some benefit.

N2  - The menopausal transition is marked by increased prevalence in disturbed sleep and insomnia, present in 40–60% of women, but evidence for a physiological basis for their sleep complaints is lacking. We aimed to quantify sleep disturbance and the underlying contribution of objective hot flashes in 72 women (age range: 43–57 years) who had (38 women), compared to those who had not (34 women), developed clinical insomnia in association with the menopausal transition. Sleep quality was assessed with two weeks of sleep diaries and one laboratory polysomnographic (PSG) recording. In multiple regression models controlling for menopausal transition stage, menstrual cycle phase, depression symptoms, and presence of objective hot flashes, a diagnosis of insomnia predicted PSG-measured total sleep time (p p =0.01) and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) (p =0.01). Women with insomnia had, on average, 43.5min less PSG-measured sleep time (p p =0.03). From diaries, women with insomnia reported more WASO (p =0.002), more night-to-night variability in WASO (p p =0.012) compared with controls. Women who develop insomnia in the approach to menopause have a measurable sleep deficit, with almost 50% of the sample having less than 6h of sleep. Compromised sleep that develops in the context of the menopausal transition should be addressed, taking into account unique aspects of menopause like hot flashes, to avoid the known negative health consequences associated with insufficient sleep and insomnia in midlife women.

N2  - In this study, the effects of the light/dark cycle, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and nocturnal melatonin supplementation on osteogenic markers and serum melatonin levels were examined in a blind mouse model (MMTV-Neu transgenic mice). Melatonin levels in this mouse strain (FVB/N) with retinal degeneration (rd−/−) fluctuate in a diurnal manner, suggesting that these mice, although blind, still perceive light. Real-time RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that Runx2, Bmp2, Bmp6, Bglap, and Per2 mRNA levels coincide with melatonin levels. The effect of chronic HRT (0.5 mg 17β-estradiol + 50 mg progesterone in 1800 kcal of diet) alone and in combination with melatonin (15 mg/L drinking water) on bone quality and density was also assessed by histomorphometry and microcomputed tomography, respectively. Bone density was significantly increased (P P Bglap mRNA levels. These data suggest that the endogenous melatonin rhythm modulates markers important to bone physiology. Hormone replacement therapy with or without nocturnal melatonin in cycling mice produces unique effects on bone markers and bone density. The effects of these therapies alone and combined may improve bone health in women in perimenopause and with low nocturnal melatonin levels from too little sleep, too much light, or age.

N2  - Past research suggests that women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have higher levels of alcohol use/ abuse. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that women with diverse patterns of affective response to the menstrual cycle (PMS pattern, mid-cycle pattern, and noncyclical pattern) would show mean-level differences on measures of self-reported affective response to alcohol, alcohol use, and sleep changes following alcohol use. All participants from an initial study of n = 213 college-aged women who had prospectively completed daily questionnaires for two full menstrual cycles were asked to complete a one-time retrospective questionnaire regarding their alcohol use and typical affective response when consuming alcohol. From that original study, n = 161 also participated in the present study. Results showed significant differences, in the expected direction, on three out of five measures (hard alcohol use, negative affective response to alcohol, and change in sleep following alcohol use). Women in the PMS pattern group reported (retrospectively) higher levels of hard alcohol use, a less negative affective response associated with alcohol use, and lower levels of sleep changes in relation to alcohol use, as compared to the mid-cycle group. The discussion considers potential mechanisms that may be responsible for these associations (i.e., GABAA modulation). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Exposure of anestrous females to a ram or his odour induces rapid secretion of LH that can lead to ovulation. This response is mediated by the main olfactory system (MOS) in sexually experienced ewes. The accessory olfactory system (AOS) has a minor, but unclear, role in this response. In sexually naive ewes, male odour is less effective than in experienced ewes, but the neural pathway involved is not known. In our experiment, we investigated the brain regions activated by the male or his odour in young and sexually naive anestrous ewes using immunohistochemistry for Fos alone, Fos double-labeled with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) or with Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH). Ram odour caused neural activation in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and not the AOS. Exposure to a male induced significant activation in the MOB, the cortical and medial nuclei of the amygdala and the ventromedial hypothalamus but not in cortical areas, or in GnRH or TH positive neurons. These results confirm the predominant role of the MOS in the detection of olfactory signals in sheep and underline the importance of learning processes.

N2  - Reports an error in "Influence of trigger factors on the efficacy of almotriptan as early intervention for the treatment of acute migraine in a primary care setting: The START study" by M. Leone, C. Vila and C. McGown (Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 2010[Sep], Vol 10[9], 1399-1408). In the original article, there were errors in the sentences on page 1401, 1402 and table 5. The corrected sentences and table 5 are present in the current erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2010-20594-011). In a large observational general practice study (the Standardized Study with Almotriptan in Early Treatment of Migraine [START]), 12.5 mg almotriptan administered within 1 h of pain onset and when pain was mild significantly improved pain-related outcomes, compared with later treatment or when pain was more severe. Migraine triggers at baseline and during treatment were recorded, and it was examined whether trigger factors could affect almotriptan-induced headache improvement. More than 400 patients were enrolled, and 1174 attacks were assessed. At baseline, patients reported a mean of 2.6 types of triggers related to the start of their previous migraine attacks. During the trial, a mean of 1.5 trigger factors for each attack was recorded. The most frequent trigger during the study was stress (37% of migraine attacks), with poor sleep (34%), fatigue (32%) and menses (19%) also being widely reported. Stress and fatigue and/or poor sleep were the most frequent trigger combinations. Early treatment with almotriptan improved clinical outcomes, regardless of the trigger factors involved. Similar results were observed for nonearly administration, although this was less efficacious than early intervention. An exception in the nonearly group was that migraines triggered by poor sleep had better responses than attacks in which sleep disorder was not a factor. Almotriptan maintained its efficacy irrespective of trigger factors in migraine patients treated in everyday clinical practice and, as shown in other studies, it was most effective in reducing pain-free rates when administered early, when pain was still mild.

N2  - There is an urgent need to better understand the problem of vitamin D deficiency, and its health effects, in population groups of different ethnicity. The principal aim of this project was to examine vitamin D status, sunlight exposure, and health outcomes in UK dwelling South Asian and Caucasian women. A cohort of 80 postmenopausal and 32 premenopausal South Asian and Caucasian women were assessed for vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D; 25(OH)D), musculoskeletal health, light exposure and sleep-wake cycles. In postmenopausal women, South Asians had a significantly lower vitamin D concentration than Caucasians (p=0. 002), with 83% of Asians vs. 24% of Caucasians below 50nmol/l for 25(OH)D. Despite adaptations in tibial bone structure of the South Asians to improve bone strength, their bones were weaker by 38% compared with Caucasians (p<0. 001). Stand-to-walk time (Asian mean (+-SD) time 8. 1 s +- 1. 8 vs. Caucasian mean (+-SD) time 6. 9 s +- 1. 4); p=0. 002) and grip strength (Asian strength=70% of Caucasian strength, p<0. 001) were worse in the South Asians. For both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, Caucasians showed a significantly higher actigraphic sleep efficiency (p<0. 001) and lower sleep fragmentation (p=0. 002) than Asians. There was a higher outdoor light exposure (over 1000 lux) in premenopausal and postmenopausal Caucasians than in same-age Asians (p=0. 052). Qualitative analysis of interview data suggested that religious and cultural influences on family, work and community life may partly explain the reduced sunlight exposure in South Asian women, which contributes to vitamin D deficiency. The implications of this work are that older South Asian women are in need of intervention to improve vitamin D status. There is also some evidence for poorer musculoskeletal health, lower light exposure and poorer sleep in this group. The qualitative research included in the current study offers future intervention options to improve the health of UK dwelling South Asian women.

N2  - Presents an editorial discussing the articles in the current issue of the International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice. In our first article Möller provides a review on the effects of DSM-5 on psychiatric diagnosis and psychopharmacotherapy. Laux and colleagues assessed the efficacy of agomelatine in depressive patients as monotherapy, combination therapy and after treatment switch. Chiesa et al. investigated the possible influences of rs4680 (COMT) and rs6276 on diagnosis and clinical outcomes in patients with major depression. Di Riso and colleagues examined the interplay of depression, anxiety, and psychological resources in adolescents. Pailhez et al. explored the association between somatotype measures and joint hypermobility (JH) in panic and agoraphobic patients. Tauch and colleagues sought to determine the frequency and distribution of suicide attempts to the patients’ characteristics, the type of suicide attempt and the method of treatment proposed by the consultation-liaison service in a general hospital. Nwachukwu et al. described the profile and activities of home-based psychiatric treatment (HBT) service in Ireland. Zahra and colleagues evaluated the reliability and sensitivity of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) in patients with anxiety and depression. Jahangard et al. compared premenopausal and menopausal women with regard to differences in mood, sleep, and health quality. In the last two articles of the issue Sansone and colleagues report their findings on sex and age differences and drug-related criminal behavior in patients with borderline personality (BP).

N2  - Abstract Background. Anecdotal evidence suggests that mood, sleep, and health quality change in women from premenopausal to menopausal period; however, data supporting these assumptions from non-Western countries are scarce. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess premenopausal and menopausal Iranian women with regard to mood, sleep, and general health. Methods. One hundred and twenty Iranian women took part in the study. Sixty were in a premenopausal state (mean age (M): = 46.9 years) and 60 in a menopausal state (M = 53.8 years). They completed a series of self-rating questionnaires related to sleep, mood, and health quality. Results. Compared to premenopausal women, menopausal women reported more difficulties such as falling asleep, and less general physical activities and vitality. No statistically significant differences were found for sleep quality, sleep schedules, difficulties in social life, general mood state, or general physical and mental health. Menopausal women reported to be more irritable, and to have more energy. Conclusions. Data suggest that among a sample of Iranian premenopausal and menopausal women, differences in mood, sleep, and general health are small. Data, therefore, do not support “beliefs” and hearsay that mood, sleep, and general health do decrease from premenopausal to menopausal state.

N2  - Presents a case report of a 32-year-old, married woman who was presented to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of galactorrhea from both breasts, occurring for one month. She had begun treatment for depression with escitalopram 10 mg/day four months earlier; she reported improvement in the depressive symptoms at four weeks of treatment. However, she had developed galactorrhea, which had lasted for a month. A mental status examination revealed mild depressed affect and sleep disturbance. The patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder partly in remission and galactorrhea associated with escitalopram. Her physical and neurological examinations were normal, except for the galactorrhea. MRI of the brain and hypophysis, breast ultrasonography, and cytological examination were normal. As a result, galactorrhea was associated with escitalopram, and therefore escitalopram treatment was discontinued. This is the first case report to document that escitalopram alone induced euprolactinemic galactorrhea in a postmenopausal woman. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To determine interhemispheric differences and effect of postmenstrual age (PMA), height, and gender on somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) from the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortices in healthy newborns. Methods: We recorded SEFs to stimulation of the contralateral index finger (right in 46 and left in 12) healthy fullterm newborns and analyzed the magnetic responses with equivalent current dipoles. Results: Activity from both the SI and SII was consistently detectable in the contralateral hemisphere of the newborns during quiet sleep. No significant interhemispheric differences existed in SI or SII response peak latencies, source strengths, or location (n = 8, quiet sleep). SI or SII response peak latency or source strength were not significantly affected by PMA, height, or gender. Conclusions: During the neonatal period (PMA 37–44 weeks), activity from the contralateral SI and SII can be reliably evaluated with MEG. The somatosensory responses are similar in the left and right hemispheres and no corrections for exact PMA, height, or gender are necessary for interpreting the results. However, the evaluation should be conducted in quiet sleep. Significance: The reproducibility of the magnetic SI and SII responses suggests clinical applicability of the presented MEG method.

N2  - A history of child abuse (CA) is associated with morbidity and mortality in adulthood, and one proposed mechanism is dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Therefore, we evaluated whether a history of physical and sexual CA was associated with daily rhythms of HPA hormones (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) among postmenopausal women (mean age: 60.6 years). In 2013, 233 participants from the Nurses’ Health Study II provided up to 5-timed saliva samples over the course of a day: immediately upon awakening, 45 min, 4 h, and 10 h after waking, and prior to going to sleep. Among these 233 participants, 217 provided ≥ 4 timed saliva samples. Assessment of physical and sexual CA history occurred in 2001 using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. Cumulative CA history was derived by combining reports of physical and sexual abuse prior to age 18. Piecewise linear mixed models compared diurnal rhythms of cortisol and DHEA between participants with none-to-moderate CA (n = 104, reference group) versus high-to-severe CA (n = 113). Models adjusted for characteristics at each saliva collection, health status, sleep quality, medications, and hormone use. Compared to those with none-to-moderate CA, women with high-to-severe CA had different diurnal rhythms in the early and evening hours, including blunted (less steep) early declines in DHEA (% difference (%D) = 10.7, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 4.3, 17.5), and steeper late declines in both cortisol and DHEA (cortisol %D = -2.5, 95 % CI -4.8, -0.1, and DHEA %D = -3.9, 95 % CI -6.0, -1.8). In conclusion, high-to-severe abuse history prior to age 18 was more strongly associated with differences in DHEA rather than cortisol, suggesting that early life abuse may be related to dysregulation of stress-response mechanisms later in life.

N2  - There is a new appreciation of the perimenopause—defined as the early and late menopause transition stages as well as the early postmenopause—as a window of vulnerability for the development of both depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes. However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: (1) epidemiology; (2) clinical presentation; (3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; (4) effects of hormone therapy; and (5) efficacy of other therapies (e.g., psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (i.e., vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (i.e., antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Data on estrogen plus progestin are sparse and inconclusive. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The menopause is still a taboo topic as well as a source of uncertainty and embarrassment for many women. In Managing Hot Flushes and Night Sweats, Myra Hunter and Melanie Smith aim to provide women with up-to-date and balanced information about menopause and a self-help guide to reduce the impact of hot flushes and night sweats in just four weeks. This book sets out an interactive four-week programme using cognitive behavioural therapy, with exercises and worksheets designed to enable women to develop strategies for managing menopausal symptoms. This approach is based on the authors' research and has been shown to be effective in recent clinical research trials. This guide can help you to: understand the biological as well as the psychological and cultural influences on menopause; understand and manage hot flushes in social situations; learn to modify triggers and use paced breathing to reduce the impact of hot flushes; reduce stress and improve well being; and develop strategies to help if night sweats disturb your sleep. With a companion audio exercise and downloadable resources available online, Managing Hot Flushes and Night Sweats offers a complete and effective framework for approaching menopause with confidence and for managing symptoms without the use of medication. The book is ideal for women approaching or going through the menopause, for women having menopausal symptoms following treatment for breast cancer, for their friends and relatives and for healthcare professionals working with women.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance in midlife women has been studied extensively, although less is known about sleep after menopause. This study examined the relative impact of sociodemographics, modifiable lifestyle factors, and health status on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women from Queensland, Australia. Methods: The longitudinal Healthy Aging of Women (HOW) Study examines health-related quality of life (HRQOL measured by the 12-item Short Form [SF-12®] survey [Medical Outcomes Trust, Hanover, CA]); chronic illness; modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking; and sleep disturbance (General Sleep Disturbance Scale [GSDS] (Lee, San Francisco, CA) ≥ 43 represents poor sleep) in midlife and older women from low- and high-socioeconomic rural and urban areas of South East Queensland, Australia. This article presents cross-sectional data from the 322 women, aged 60–70 years, participating in the HOW study in 2011. Results: For women in this study, sleep disturbance was relatively common, with 23% (n = 83) reporting poor sleeping (GSDS ≥ 43). Sleep-disturbance scores were strongly correlated with being unemployed or on a disability support pension (β = 18.69, p p p p = 0.01), and these variables explained almost one-third of variance in sleep-disturbance scores (ηρ² = 29%). Conclusions: Multivariable analysis revealed that sleep disturbance was correlated with physical and mental HRQOL, disability, and sedentary lifestyle but not other lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. It may be, however, that modifiable lifestyle factors may indirectly impact sleep by influencing health status. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: Women experience insomnia more frequently than men. Menstrual cycle changes in reproductive hormones and circadian rhythms may contribute to sleep disruptions. Our aim, therefore, was to clarify the interaction between menstrual and circadian processes as it affects sleep. Design: Participants entered the laboratory during the mid-follicular (MF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle for an ultra-rapid sleep-wake cycle (URSW) procedure, consisting of 36 cycles of 60-min wake episodes alternating with 60-min nap opportunities. This procedure concluded with an ad libitum nap episode. Setting: Time-isolation suite. Participants: Eight unmedicated, physically and mentally healthy females with regular ovulatory menstrual cycles. Interventions: N/A. Measurements: Polysomnographic sleep from nocturnal sleep episodes and 60-min naps; subjective alertness; core body temperature (CBT); salivary melatonin; urinary estradiol; and urinary progesterone. Results: Increased CBT values at night and decreased CBT amplitude were observed during ML compared to MF. Circadian phase of CBT and the circadian melatonin profile were unaffected by menstrual phase. All analyzed sleep parameters showed a circadian variation throughout the URSW procedure, with no menstrual phase differences observed for most, including slow wave sleep (SWS). The circadian variation of REM sleep duration, however, was sensitive to menstrual phase, with reduced REM sleep during ML at circadian phase 0° and 30°. Conclusions: Moderate but significant changes in REM sleep across the menstrual and circadian cycles were observed. These results support an interaction between circadian and menstrual processes in the regulation of REM sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To measure knowledge of the health consequences of obesity among overweight/obese Black and Hispanic adults and examine the relationship to prior weight loss. Methods: Knowledge of the health consequences of obesity was assessed among 410 Black and Hispanic adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² enrolled in a behavior change weight loss study. The relationship between obesity risk knowledge and previous weight loss was also examined. Results: The majority of participants were knowledgeable of the risk of hypertension (94%), diabetes (96%), high cholesterol (91%), joint pains/arthritis (89%) and sleep apnea (89%) associated with obesity. Among post-menopausal age women, 53% were aware of the increased risk of breast cancer. There was no significant relationship between obesity risk knowledge and previous weight loss of 10 pounds or more (OR = 1.075, 95% CI: [0.808, 1.430]). Conclusions: We found that knowledge of the health consequences of obesity was high, except for knowledge of the risk of breast cancer. Obesity risk knowledge was not associated with past weight loss. Practice implications: Further health education is needed regarding the increased risk of breast cancer associated with obesity. Our data suggest that knowledge of the health consequences of obesity is not associated with weight loss success. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

Methods: A total of 320 perimenopausal women in Jinan were assessed with the WHO Quality of Life Brief Questionnaire, Self-Rating Depression Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and self-designed general condition questionnaire. Women with regular menses were also assessed and categorized into two control groups. Results: Quality of life of perimenopausal women was poorer than reproductive stage women and non-perimenopausal women aged 40 to 59 years (P P P < 0.01). Conclusion: Quality of life of perimenopausal women would be poorer than ordinary middle-aged women. Profession, education, depression, anxiety and sleep quality are main factors influencing quality of life of perimenopausal women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To investigate the impact of the subjective sleep quality and quantity on health-related quality of life (QOL) amongst women between the ages of 40 and 60 years seeking medical advice (SMA) in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 1098 climacteric women were drawn from two hospitals and each subject was asked to fill out a World Health Organization quality of life questionnaire. In addition, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was employed to evaluate the sleep quality and quantity of the climacteric women. Multiple linear regression analysis was first employed to reveal influential demographic factors and sleep parameters related to the QOL outcome variables. Structural equation modeling was then built on the identified important variables to validate the causal relationships between menopausal symptoms, sleep parameters, and QOL. Results: The mean scores for the physical and environmental domains were significantly lower than those of the premenopausal women, as were the overall quality of life and general health for perimenopausal women. Although usual quantitative sleep parameters did not significantly predict QOL in the climacteric women, after controlling for demographic factors, severity of the menopausal symptom, and menopausal status, subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction were found to be major determinants of the scores in different QOL domains. Conclusion: Subjective poor sleep quality and poor daytime function should be taken into consideration in the management of climacteric women seeking medical advice.

N2  - Objective: Two types of sleep preference have been supported in the literature. Morning types awaken early and are refreshed upon waking, whereas Evening types rise later and have more erratic sleep schedules. Sleep affects menstrual functioning in adult women. However, there is scant research on the association between sleep preference and menstrual functioning in adolescents. Thus, the present study examined the association between sleep preference and menstrual functioning in 210 adolescent girls (11–17 years old). Methods: Data represent baseline measures from a longitudinal study examining the association of psychological functioning and smoking with reproductive and bone health. Measures included the Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ), regularity and duration of menstrual cycles, and the Morningness/Eveningness scale (measuring sleep preference). MSQ factor scores were used in analyses: abdominal pain, negative affect/somatic complaints, back pain, and anxiety/fatigue. Results: The results from hierarchical linear regression analyses showed significant associations between Evening preference and more symptoms of abdominal pain (P<.01), negative affect/somatic complaints (P<.01), anxiety/fatigue (P<.01), and shorter menses (P<.05). Conclusion: Adolescent girls with Evening preference experience more menstrual symptoms than those with Morning preference. Future research should include sleep preference in studies of health and behavior particularly in adolescence when there is a normative shift toward Evening preference.

N2  - Objective: To prospectively examine the influence of the oestrogen-α receptor (ESR1) PvuII polymorphism on changes in memory performance over a 2-year period among 80 midlife postmenopausal Australian women. Methods: Healthy women aged 56–67 years were administered a battery of four memory (verbal and non-verbal) tasks at baseline and 2 years later. Results: Carriers of the ESR1 p allele had significantly greater declines in logical memory compared to participants with the PP genotype, independent of demographic characteristics (e.g. age), chronic illness (e.g. hypertension), sleep aid usage, hormone levels, apolipoprotein E e4 status and prospective changes in mood, smoking and alcohol consumption. Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence for larger and longer prospective trials that will be able to determine if the p allele of the ESR1 PvuII polymorphism is a potential biomarker of logical memory decline among aging women.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, when subjects were living in a moderately warm environment: (1) the softness of clothing worn during the daytime could influence the subjects’ preference in the evening for the softness of clothing and a face towel; and (2) the softness of bedding materials could modulate their nocturnal body temperature, overnight urinary catecholamine excretion, and sleep quality. Six females were tested during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycles. The experiment was conducted over three consecutive days and nights in a climatic chamber controlled at 28 ± 0.2 °C and 50% RH during the evening (from 19:30 to 21:30 h) and at 29 ± 0.2 °C and 50% RH during the sleep period (from 22:30 to 07:00 h). The first night was for adaptation to the experimental chamber. Five different sets of clothing and bedding were used; these were identical except for the softness/hardness of the materials used (due to treatment with fabric softener or starch), and material softness decreased in the order: Type A (softest) > Type B > Type C > Type D > Type E (hardest). There were two phases to the experiment, conducted in random order. In one phase, subjects wore “soft type” (Type B) T-shirt and shorts in the daytime and, in the other phase, “hard type” (Type D/E) T-shirt and shorts. In both phases, subjects were asked at 21:30 h to select a T-shirt and a face towel which they felt would be most comfortable to use. At night, they slept on bedding (a mattress cover, a pillowcase and a covering blanket) which was of the same degree of softness as the T-shirt and shorts that had been worn in the daytime in that phase. Rectal temperature, skin temperatures at seven sites, and body movement were measured during sleep, an overnight urine sample was taken for measurement of urinary excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and subjective sleep quality was assessed on being woken the following morning. The main results were as follows: (1) T-shirt preference in the evening showed large inter-individual variation but did not differ significantly between the two phases (when “hard type” or “soft type” clothing had been worn during the daytime). The preferred texture of the face towel was softer than that of the T-shirt, the difference in softness between the chosen face towel and T-shirt being significant (p p pp < 0.05 for adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively) bedding. (4) When sleeping with “soft type” bedding materials, five out of the six subjects showed less body movements during the sleep period and reported that they had slept better. These results suggest that, in a moderately warm environment, bedding materials with a softer texture might be more comfortable to the subject (due to less tactile stimulation of the skin, which results in neurophysiological relaxation) and provide them with better sleep quality.

N2  - Background: Epilepsy is one of the major brain disorders worldwide. Breakthrough seizures carry a heavy burden of epilepsy, with increased morbidity and risk of premature mortality. Several factors have been suggested to precipitate break through seizures but these have not been studied in our setting. The study sought to determine the prevalence of breakthrough seizures, as well as precipitating factors in adults with epilepsy attending Mulago hospital. Methods: This study was conducted in Mulago Hospital, using a cross sectional study design between August and December 2009. Subjects with epilepsy and had been receiving anti-epileptics treatment for at least 6 months prior to the study were consecutively enrolled. Results: A total of 256 patients with epilepsy were recruited. Prevalence of breakthrough seizures among epilepsy patients attending Mulago hospital was 75.3%. Factors found to be significantly associated with breakthrough seizures were non compliance to anti-epileptic therapy (p < 0.0001); duration of treatment (p < 0.0001); infections (p < 0.044) and menses among female study participants (p < 0.0001). The level of education, sleep deprivation, alcohol and substance abuse, and flickering lights were not associated with breakthrough seizures. Conclusions: Breakthrough seizures are high in Mulago National referral hospital, with drug non-compliance the commonest cause. The attending physicians need to identify precipitating factors among patients attending Mulago hospital and have them addressed appropriately during patient care.

N2  - Till now, no evidence illustrates the prevalence and predictors of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) in rural areas of China. The objective of this study was, firstly, to examine the prevalence of MHO in rural areas of China, and identify contributing determinants of MHO, Secondly, to comprehensively investigate to the different characteristics between MHO and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of 2037 participants with obesity in rural Liaoning Province during 2012–2013. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥28 kg/m2 and metabolically healthy was defined as not having the metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of MHO was 23.1%, and significantly decreased with advancing age in female group. However there was no significant tendency with advancing age in male group. Independent determinant factors for MHO were age p = .001), non-current smoking (OR 1.397; p = .038), pre-menopause (OR 1.648; p = .030) and non-hyperuricemia (OR 2.317; p < .001), whereas race, gender, diet score, current drinking, marriage, sleep duration, hyperhomocysteinemia, levels of physical activity, annual income and educational status were not significant contributors. In conclusion, we found that age <55 years, non-current smoking, pre-menopause and non-hyperuricemia were identified as independent determinant factors for MHO in this population.

N2  - The transition due to immigration from one country to another country (referred to as immigration transition henceforth) is inherently stressful, placing an additional dimension of stress to midlife women in the menopausal transition. However, few studies have examined the association of immigration to sleep-related symptoms experienced by midlife women in the menopausal transition. The authors’ purpose for this study was to explore the associations of immigration to sleep-related symptoms among four major racial/ethnic groups of 1,054 midlife women in the United States. This was a secondary analysis of data from two national surveys that were collected from 2005 to 2013. The instruments included questions on background characteristics, health and menopausal status, immigration transition, and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women. The data were analyzed using t-tests, chi-square tests, correlation analyses, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Immigrants reported fewer total numbers of and lower total severity scores of sleep-related symptoms than non-immigrants (p R² = 0.02, p < .01). Health-care providers need to consider self-reported racial/ethnic identity as a factor significantly related to sleep-related symptoms during the menopausal transition.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of poor sleep and its risk factors for adults living in a suburban area of Shanghai with rapid urbanization. Methods: A total of 37,545 residents who were aged 20 to 74 years and from the “Peak Program,” a community-based natural population cohort study, were included. Data on demographics, lifestyle, and physical health-related factors were collected using a face-to-face questionnaire interview. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and poor sleep was defined as a PSQI score above 7. Results: The overall mean of PSQI score was 3.69 ± 2.57 while the prevalence of poor sleep was 8.3%. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was higher in participants who were older than 40 years, had less education, smoked tobacco, had anxiety, and had a chronic disease (p p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In addition, compared to women who were premenopausal, the naturally postmenopausal women (OR 1.675, 95% CI 1.44–1.94) and induced menopausal women (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.81–2.82) were more likely to report poor sleep. Conclusion: The prevalence of poor sleep among individuals who lived in the Songjiang District of Shanghai and were aged 20 to 74 years was remarkably lower than in the general population of China. Poor sleep was generally more common in middle-aged and elderly residents and in those suffering from anxiety and chronic diseases. Regular exercise, anxiety relieving, and treatment improvement of different chronic diseases may help sleep better. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Sleep has been closely linked to breast cancer risk. However, the association between sleep and breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the separate and joint effects of multiple sleep characteristics on breast cancer prognosis among Chinese women. Methods: A total of 1580 breast cancer patients were recruited between October 2008 and December 2014 and followed up until December 31, 2017 in Guangzhou. Multivariate Cox models were conducted to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for breast cancer prognosis in association with sleep characteristics. Results: Long sleep duration at night (> 9 h) (HR = 2.33, 95%CI: 1.01–5.42), poor sleep quality (HR = 3.08, 95%CI: 1.74–5.47), and impaired daytime function (HR = 2.49, 95%CI: 1.65–3.79) after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression. Both short sleep duration (Pinteraction = 0.011) and long sleep duration (> 9 h) (HR = 4.69, 95%CI: 1.31–16.78, Pinteraction = 0.187) increased the progression risk only among patients with impaired but not normal daytime function. In addition, daytime napping significantly modified the effect of short sleep duration on the progression (HR = 3.55, 0.59, 95%CI: 1.55–7.97, 0.23–1.53 for patients without and with daytime napping, respectively, Pinteraction = 0.005). Stratification results suggested that the associations were more evident among pre-menopausal patients, although no significant interaction was observed. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that inadequate sleep duration to feel one's best and poor sleep quality after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer progression, particularly for pre-menopausal women.

N2  - Purpose: To examine associations of daytime napping and diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal Chinese women. Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional. Setting: 2015 cross-sectional data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Participants were recruited from 150 counties/districts and 450 villages/resident committees. Participants: Six thousand nine hundred and forty women aged 45 years and older (mean age = 61 years) stratified by age and menopausal status. Measures: The outcome was self-reported diagnosed diabetes. The exposure was self-reported daytime napping (0, >0-≤60, or >60 min/d). Participants were stratified to middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal women according to their age (≤60 or >60 years) and menopausal status. Analysis: One-way analysis of variance and χ² tests were conducted to explore differences on characteristics of middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal women. Multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for diagnosed diabetes according to daytime napping in the total sample, middle-aged premenopausal, middle-aged postmenopausal, and older postmenopausal Chinese women. Results: Participants’ mean self-reported daytime napping duration was 34 minutes. Women who napped more than 60 minutes were more likely to report diagnosed diabetes (OR = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.76) comparing to those who did not nap, after adjusting for potential confounders. No statistical significance of interaction term between daytime napping and age/menopausal status was detected (P = .602 and P = .558) among total women. The stratified analysis revealed the significant association among middle-aged postmenopausal women napping more than 60 minutes (OR = 1.81, 95% CI, 1.18-2.77). The association, however, was found to be insignificant in middle-aged premenopausal women and older postmenopausal women. Conclusions: Long daytime nap (>60 min/d) was associated with diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged postmenopausal women in China. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep spindles benefit declarative memory consolidation and are considered to be a biological marker for general cognitive abilities. However, the impact of sexual hormones and hormonal oral contraceptives (OCs) on these relationships are less clear. Thus, we here investigated the influence of endogenous progesterone levels of naturally cycling women and women using OCs on nocturnal sleep and overnight memory consolidation. Nineteen healthy women using OCs (MAge = 21.4, SD = 2.1 years) were compared to 43 healthy women with a natural menstrual cycle (follicular phase: n = 16, MAge = 21.4, SD = 3.1 years; luteal phase: n = 27, MAge = 22.5, SD = 3.6 years). Sleep spindle density and salivary progesterone were measured during an adaptation and an experimental night. A word pair association task preceding the experimental night followed by two recalls (pre‐sleep and post‐sleep) was performed to test declarative memory performance. We found that memory performance improved overnight in all women. Interestingly, women using OCs (characterized by a low endogenous progesterone level but with very potent synthetic progestins) and naturally cycling women during the luteal phase (characterized by a high endogenous progesterone level) had a higher fast sleep spindle density compared to naturally cycling women during the follicular phase (characterized by a low endogenous progesterone level). Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between endogenous progesterone level and fast spindle density in women during the luteal phase. Results suggest that the use of OCs and the menstrual cycle phase affects sleep spindles and therefore should be considered in further studies investigating sleep spindles and cognitive performance.

N2  - A robust surge of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release triggers the luteinizing hormone surge that induces ovulation. The GnRH surge is attributable to estradiol feedback, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) regulate hormone release and neuronal excitability, and may be part of the surge-generating mechanism. We examined VGCCs of GnRH neurons in brain slices from a model exhibiting daily luteinizing hormone surges. Mice were ovariectomized (OVX), and a subset was treated with estradiol implants (OVX + E). OVX + E mice exhibit negative feedback in the A.M. and positive feedback in the P.M. GnRH neurons express prominent high-voltage-activated (HVA) and small low-voltage-activated (LVA) macroscopic (whole-cell) Ca currents (ICa). LVA-mediated currents were not altered by estradiol or time of day. In contrast, in OVX + E mice, HVA-mediated currents varied with time of day; HVA currents in cells from OVX + E mice were lower than those in cells from OVX mice in the A.M. but were higher in the P.M. These changes were attributable to diurnal alternations in L- and N-type components. There were no diurnal changes in any aspect of HVA-mediated ICa in OVX mice. Acute in vitro treatment of cells from OVX and OVX + E mice with estradiol rapidly increased HVA currents primarily through L- and R-type VGCCs by activating estrogen receptorβ and GPR30, respectively. These results suggest multiple mechanisms contribute to the overall feedback regulation of HVA-mediated ICa by estradiol. In combination with changes in synaptic inputs to GnRH neurons, these intrinsic changes in GnRH neurons may play critical roles in estradiol feedback.

N2  - Purpose: User-generated content on social media sites, such as health-related online forums, offers researchers a tantalizing amount of information, but concerns regarding scientific application of such data remain. This paper compares and contrasts symptom cluster patterns derived from messages on a breast cancer forum with those from a symptom checklist completed by breast cancer survivors participating in a research study. Methods: Over 50,000 messages generated by 12,991 users of the breast cancer forum on MedHelp.org were transformed into a standard form and examined for the co-occurrence of 25 symptoms. The k-medoid clustering method was used to determine appropriate placement of symptoms within clusters. Findings were compared with a similar analysis of a symptom checklist administered to 653 breast cancer survivors participating in a research study. Results: The following clusters were identified using forum data: menopausal/psychological, pain/fatigue, gastrointestinal, and miscellaneous. Study data generated the clusters: menopausal, pain, fatigue/sleep/gastrointestinal, psychological, and increased weight/appetite. Although the clusters are somewhat different, many symptoms that clustered together in the social media analysis remained together in the analysis of the study participants. Density of connections between symptoms, as reflected by rates of co-occurrence and similarity, was higher in the study data. Conclusions: The copious amount of data generated by social media outlets can augment findings from traditional data sources. When different sources of information are combined, areas of overlap and discrepancy can be detected, perhaps giving researchers a more accurate picture of reality. However, data derived from social media must be used carefully and with understanding of its limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective Troublesome hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) are experienced by many women after treatment for breast cancer, impacting significantly on sleep and quality of life. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to be effective for the alleviation of HFNS. However, it is not known if it can effectively be delivered by specialist nurses. We investigated whether group CBT, delivered by breast care nurses (BCNs), can reduce the impact of HFNS. Methods We recruited women with primary breast cancer following primary treatment with seven or more HFNS/week (including 4/10 or above on the HFNS problem rating scale), from six UK hospitals to an open, randomised, phase 3 effectiveness trial. Participants were randomised to Group CBT or usual care (UC). The primary endpoint was HFNS problem rating at 26 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included sleep, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Results Between 2017 and 2018, 130 participants were recruited (CBT:63, control:67). We found a 46% (6.9‐3.7) reduction in the mean HFNS problem rating score from randomisation to 26 weeks in the CBT arm and a 15% (6.5‐5.5) reduction in the UC arm (adjusted mean difference −1.96, CI −3.68 to −0.23, P = .039). Secondary outcomes, including frequency of HFNS, sleep, anxiety and depression all improved significantly. Conclusion Our results suggest that specialist nurses can be trained to deliver CBT effectively to alleviate troublesome menopausal hot flushes in women following breast cancer in the NHS setting.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are a frequent complaint in women and are often attributed to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. Rodents have been used as models to examine the effects of sleep deprivation on hormonal and behavioral changes. Among the many comorbidities common to sleep disorders, sexual behavior remains the least well studied. Aim: To determine whether paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) can affect sexual receptivity (male acceptance) and proceptivity (male solicitation) behaviors in female rats. Methods. Female Wistar rats were subjected to PSD or were maintained as controls. After this period, the estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, and diestrus) was determined, and all females were placed with a sexually experienced male. In order to investigate the role of hormones in sexual behavior, we included additional groups that were artificially induced to be sexually receptive via administration of a combination of estradiol and progesterone. Main Outcome Measurements: Receptivity and proceptivity behaviors, as well as progesterone and corticosterone concentrations were monitored. Results: Selective sleep loss caused a significant increase in proceptivity and receptivity behaviors in females exclusively during the proestrus phase. The rejection response was increased in PSD rats during the estrus and diestrus phases, as compared with PSD-receptive and proestrus females. PSD reduced progesterone levels during the proestrus phase relative to the respective control group during the same phase of the estrous cycle. The PSD-proestrus females that displayed the most robust sexual response exhibited greater concentrations of corticosterone than PSD-diestrus females, with an absence of sexual solicitation behaviors. Conclusions: PSD produced a distinct response in the hormonal profile that was consistent with the phase of the estrous cycle. These results show that sleep loss can affect sexual motivation and might lead to important clinical implications, including alterations in female physiology and reproductive abnormalities.

N2  - Study Objectives: To describe racial/ethnic differences in sleep duration, continuity, and perceived sleep quality in postmenopausal women and to identify statistical mediators of differences in sleep characteristics. Methods: Recruited from the observational Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), 1,203 (548 white, 303 black, 147 Chinese, 132 Japanese, and 73 Hispanic; mean age 65 years, 97% postmenopausal) women participated in a week-long actigraphy and daily diary study in 2013–2015. Actigraphic measures of sleep duration and wake after sleep onset (WASO), and diary-rated sleep quality were averaged across the week. Candidate mediators included health-related variables; stress; and emotional well-being assessed up to 13 times across 18 years from baseline to sleep study. Results: Whites slept longer than other groups; the significant mediators were concurrent financial hardship and increasing number of stressors for Hispanics or Japanese versus whites. Whites had less WASO than blacks and Hispanics; significant mediators were concurrent number of health problems, physical inactivity, waist circumference, vasomotor symptoms, number of life stressors, and financial hardship, and increasing number of health problems from baseline to sleep study. Whites reported better sleep quality than blacks, Chinese, and Japanese; significant mediators were concurrent physical inactivity, vasomotor symptoms, positive affect, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Sleep differences between blacks or Hispanics versus whites were mediated by health problems, number of stressors, and financial hardship, whereas sleep differences between Chinese or Japanese versus whites were mediated by emotional well-being. This is the first study using formal mediational approaches. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Insomnia affects midlife women as they approach and experience menopause at a rate higher than most other stages of life. Insomnia is considered one of the climacteric symptoms of menopause, which can be controlled with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This study examined the relationship between menopause and sleep in women with insomnia and compared the sleep quality of menopausal women with and without HRT. Methods: A total of 74 women (age range = 40–59years old) with insomnia who were either pre or peri/post menopause were evaluated at Laval University's Sleep Disorders Center as part of ongoing clinical trials of insomnia therapies. All participants completed daily sleep diaries for a 2-week period and a series of psychological and insomnia questionnaires, followed by three consecutive nights of polysomnographic evaluation (PSG). A detailed medical history interview was taken by the study physician. Results: PSG measures showed that menopausal women had significantly longer total wake time (TWT, 84.2 vs. 63.2min, Cohen's d = 0.504) and lower sleep efficiency (SE, 81.8% vs. 86.0%, d = 0.487) than the non-menopausal women. Women using HRT did not show significantly better sleep compared to those who did not use HRT. No significant difference was observed between menopausal groups on subjectively assessed sleep parameters. Conclusion: Menopause may contribute to specific aspects of sleep disturbances in midlife women with insomnia. Use of HRT for menopausal symptoms does not seem to attenuate such disturbances, although further investigation using hormonal level dosing and a larger sample size is warranted.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the association of sleep disturbance with psychological characteristics, somatic symptoms and previously identified risk factors. Methods: Data were from 148,938 postmenopausal women enrolled in The Women’s Health Initiative who provided cross-sectional information about psychological characteristics, somatic symptoms and the character of their sleep. Overall sleep quality was based on the Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHI IRS), a measure that assessed five types of sleep disturbance. Results: Three factors accounted for nearly 20% of the variation in the WHI IRS: a scale for somatic symptoms, daytime restlessness and either depression or emotional well-being. Other independently associated factors were night sweats, pain and worry about expressing anger. Several factors that had been linked to sleep disturbance in other studies were found to have at most a weak independent association in this analysis. These included income, education, marital status, activity level, obesity level, hot flashes, coffee drinking and smoking. Conclusion: Factors strongly associated with sleep disturbance in this study deserve further evaluation to determine the reasons for the association and whether the associations suggest possible treatments for sleep disturbance.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the sleep disturbance and its correlates in Chinese middle-aged women. Methods: A total of 2046 Chinese women 40–60 years of age were recruited in this cross-sectional descriptive study. The subjects were surveyed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the modified Kupperman Index (KI), and a general questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic data. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software. Results: In this study, the mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 51.69 (6.54) years and the mean PSQI score was 6.88 (3.20). The prevalence of sleep disturbance was 33.2% (a PSQI global score ≥ 8). The prevalence of sleep disturbance was higher in women with a menopausal status (from 34.8% in premenopausal women to 40.9% in postmenopausal women, P < .001) and in women with an increased age (from 21.7% in women 40–44 years of age to 41.8% in women 55–60 years of age, P < .001). Vasomotor symptoms (classical menopausal symptoms, VMS) were associated with sleep disturbance. An increase in the severity of menopausal symptoms (higher total KI scores) was observed in women who experienced sleep disturbance. A logistic regression analysis revealed that menopausal status, vasomotor symptoms, modified KI scores, a history of disease, and older age (≥ 50 years) were significant risk factors for sleep disturbance. Conclusions: Sleep disturbance was highly prevalent in this large sample of middle-aged Chinese women. Therefore, clinicians should pay more attention to sleep problems in middle-aged Chinese women and measures should be taken to improve the quality of sleep in these women.

N2  - The aim of this study was to identify factors that most influence the perception of sleep quality in postmenopausal women. We used the methodological strategy of the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD), which is based on a theoretical framework of social representations theory. We obtained the data by interviewing 22 postmenopausal Brazilian women who were experiencing insomnia. The women gave accounts of their difficulties with sleep; a variety of dimensions were identified within the data. The onset of sleep disorders might have occurred during childhood or in situations considered to be stressful, and were not necessarily associated with menopause. We found that hormonal alterations occurring during menopause, psychosocial factors, and sleep-breathing disorders triggered occasional sleep disturbances during this time of life. Participants were aware of the consequences of sleep deprivation. In addition, inadequate sleep hygiene habits figured prominently as determinants in the persistence of sleep disturbances.

N2  - Background: To examine the effectiveness and safety of yoga of women with sleep problems by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Medline/PubMed, ClinicalKey, ScienceDirect, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched throughout the month of June, 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga groups with control groups in women with sleep problems were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias by using the risk of bias tool suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration for programming and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The main outcome measure was sleep quality or the severity of insomnia, which was measured using subjective instruments, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), or objective instruments such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and safety of the intervention. For each outcome, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and confidence intervals (CIs) of 95% were determined. Results: Nineteen studies in this systematic review included 1832 participants. The meta-analysis of the combined data conducted according to Comprehensive Meta-Analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep (SMD = −0.327, 95% CI = −0.506 to −0.148, P P = 0.003). However, three RCTs revealed no effects of yoga compared to the control group in reducing insomnia among women using ISI (SMD = −0.13; 95% CI = −0.74 to 0.48; P = 0.69). Seven RCTs revealed no evidence for effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving sleep quality for women with breast cancer using PSQI (SMD = −0.15; 95% CI = −0.31 to 0.01; P = 0.5). Four RCTs revealed no evidence for the effects of yoga compared with the control group in improving the sleep quality for peri/postmenopausal women using PSQI (SMD = −0.31; 95% CI = −0.95 to 0.33; P = 0.34). Yoga was not associated with any serious adverse events.DiscussionThis systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that yoga intervention in women can be beneficial when compared to non-active control conditions in term of managing sleep problems. The moderator analyses suggest that participants in the non-breast cancer subgroup and participants in the non-peri/postmenopausal subgroup were associated with greater benefits, with a direct correlation of total class time with quality of sleep among other related benefits.

N2  - The hallmark of menopause is the marked reduction of estradiol levels due to ovarian failure. This, among other factors result in hot flashes, the most common menopausal symptom. Hot flashes (HFs) can be measured objectively, both inside and outside the laboratory, using sternal skin conductance, an electrical measure of sweating. We have found that HFs are triggered by small elevations in core body temperature (TC), acting within a greatly reduced thermoneutral zone. This reduction is caused by elevated central sympathetic activation, among other factors. There is a circadian rhythm of HFs peaking at 1825 h. Imaging studies have shown that hot flash activation begins in the brainstem, followed by the insula and by the prefrontal cortex. HFs in the first, but not the second half of the night can produce awakenings and arousals. This is because rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suppresses thermoregulatory effector responses, which include hot flashes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Few studies have experimentally manipulated sleep to study its effect on aggressive behavior. The current study examined how reactive aggression was affected by having sleep restricted to 4‐hours on a single night, a level of disruption commonly experienced. Both rested and sleep‐restricted participants completed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a laboratory task in which participants seek to earn points, are provoked by a fictitious opponent stealing their points, and may choose to steal points in response. Logistic mixed‐effect models were used to investigate the effect of sleep restriction and the role of sex hormones on the odds of choosing to steal. For men, and women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction did not result in significant changes reactive aggression, although the patterns of aggressive behavior appeared less reactive and retaliatory in nature. For women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction was associated with higher levels of reactive aggression. For both men and women in the luteal phase, sleep restriction disrupted an association between hormone change over the task (testosterone and estradiol, respectively) and reactive aggression that was observed in their control participants. In addition, higher testosterone before the PSAP in men was associated with maintaining a high level of stealing over the task. These results indicate a complex dynamic in which sex hormones and sleep interact to predict aggressive behavior in response to provocation.

N2  - In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acts as the master circadian pacemaker of the body. The SCN coordinate the thousands of individual oscillators throughout the body to maintain optimal health and homeostatic functioning. The importance of maintaining circadian rhythmicity is exemplified by its role in reproduction, as disruption of the circadian clock inhibits reproduction. Experiment 1 shows that the proper temporal coordination by the SCN of two hypothalamic neuropeptides, GnRH and RFRP-3, is imperative to initiation of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that stimulates ovulation in the Syrian hamster. The maintenance of temporal homeostasis in reproductive, neural, and immune health was further studied using a model of circadian disruption similar to chronic jet lag that resulted in an incongruence between the endogenous ∼24-hour rhythm generated by the SCN and the environmental 24-hour day. In Experiment 2, jet-lagged hamsters exposed to 6-hour shifts in the light:dark cycle every 3 days for 25 days exhibit a dysregulation in the temporal activation of the GnRH and kisspeptin systems, two neuropeptide populations that stimulate the LH surge, and in the temporal deactivation of the RFRP-3 system that inhibits the reproductive axis, around the time of the LH surge. The importance of temporal homeostasis was further explored in Experiment 3, in which jet-lagged hamsters exhibit decreases in hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis compared to non-jet-lagged controls. Interestingly, jet lag hamsters not only exhibit deficits in learning and memory during the period of repeated phase shifts, but also one month following the cessation of chronic jet lag, suggesting that the jet-lag-induced decrease in neurogenesis has long lasting effects on hippocampal function. Similarly, as jet lag influences hippocampal cell proliferation, it is also shown to impact immune function by dysregulating splenocyte proliferation in Experiment 4. Additionally, both innate and humoral immune functions, including complement system activity, total antibody production, and bacterial killing, are suppressed in jet-lagged hamsters compared to controls. Taken together, the previous studies strongly implicate the necessity of coordination between an intact circadian system and environmental cues to maintain proper homeostatic function.

N2  - Individual differences in morningness/eveningness are relatively stable over time and, in part, genetically based. The night-owl pattern is more prevalent in men than in women, particularly after puberty and before women reach menopause. It has been suggested that eveningness evolved relatively recently in human evolutionary history and that this trait may be advantageous to individuals pursuing short-term mating strategies. Consistent with this hypothesis, eveningness is associated with extraversion, novelty-seeking, and in males, with a higher number of sexual partners. In this study, I investigated whether eveningness is associated with short-term relationship orientation, higher risk-taking, and higher testosterone or cortisol. Both female and male night-owls were more likely to be single than in long-term relationships than early morning individuals. Eveningness was associated with higher risk-taking in women but not in men; this association was not testosterone-dependent but mediated by cortisol. Female night-owls had average cortisol profiles and risk-taking tendencies more similar to those of males than to those of early-morning females. Taken together, these findings provide some support to the hypothesis that eveningness is associated with psychological and behavioral traits that are instrumental in short-term mating strategies, with the evidence being stronger for women than for men.

N2  - The objective was to investigate the effects of a mid-afternoon nap during the late-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle on sleepiness, alertness, mood, cognitive performance, and subsequent nocturnal sleep among women with significant emotional/behavioral premenstrual symptoms compared to women with minimal symptoms. Following an adaptation sleep recording, 10 women with significant premenstrual symptoms and 9 women with minimal or no symptoms were recorded during one night in the follicular phase, and two nights during the late-luteal phase, -one after a nap of a maximum duration of 30 minutes, and another without a nap. Measures of sleepiness, alertness, mood, and cognitive performance were completed before, and at intervals after the nap and no nap sessions. Napping improved sleepiness, alertness, mood, and some aspects of cognitive performance. Improvements were maintained for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours after napping. An afternoon nap benefited both groups of women, but those with significant symptoms had a slightly greater improvement in intensity of mood 30 minutes after the nap. Variables related to attention and cognitive processing were more responsive to napping than those related to impulsivity. No significant negative effects on subsequent nocturnal sleep were noted suggesting that a short mid-afternoon nap is a practical intervention to temporarily improve and possibly prevent worsening of premenstrual symptoms.

N2  - As a recurrent, cyclical phenomenon, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects a significant proportion of women of the reproductive age, and leads to regular monthly days of functional impairment. Symptoms of PMS include somatic and psychological symptoms, such as headaches, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal and mood changes, during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which alleviate during the follicular phase. This study investigated neurocognitive functioning in women with moderate to severe PMS symptoms (n = 13) compared to women with mild/no PMS (n = 27) through administration of a battery of neuropsychological tests during the asymptomatic follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Relative to women with mild/no PMS symptoms, women with moderate to severe PMS showed significantly poorer accuracy and more errors of omission on the N-0-back, as well as more errors of omission on the N-2-back task, indicating the presence of impairment in selective attention and working memory. This study provides evidence of persistent, subtle working memory and selective attention difficulties in those with moderate to severe PMS during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

N2  - Objective: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) promotes physiological stability and interaction between parents and infants. Temporal analyses of predictability in EEG-sleep time series can elucidate functional brain maturation between SSC and non-SSC cohorts at similar post-menstrual ages (PMAs). Methods: Sixteen EEG-sleep studies were performed on eight preterm infants who received 8 weeks of SSC, and compared with two non-SSC cohorts at term (N = 126) that include a preterm group corrected to term age and a full term group. Two time series measures of predictability were used for comparisons. Results: The SSC premature neonate group had increased complexity when compared to the non-SSC premature neonate group at the same PMA. Discriminant analysis shows that SSC neonates at 40 weeks PMA are closer to the full term neonate non-SSC group than to the premature non-SSC group at the same PMA; suggesting that the KC intervention accelerates neurophysiological maturation of premature neonates. Conclusions: Based on the hypothesis that EEG-derived complexity increases with neurophysiological maturation as supported by previously published research, SSC accelerates brain maturation in healthy preterm infants as quantified by time series measures of predictability when compared to a similar non-SSC group. Significance: Times series methods that quantify predictability of EEG sleep in neonates can provide useful information about altered neural development after developmental care interventions such as SSC. Analyses of this type may be helpful in assessing other neuroprotection strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The present study was designed to determine the magnitude of the relationship between amount, frequency, and length of shift work completed by female transportation employees and the number, degree, and extent of problems related to physical, menstrual and psychological health including depression. It was hypothesized that workers that are employed in areas such as transportation who are working shift work on a regular basis place themselves at higher risk for developing health or psychosocial related effects. These health related outcomes can have a profound impact on an employee's job performance, daily functioning, and personal life. The present study sought to understand the potential relationship between working shift work and higher disturbances to the bodies' natural functioning. The present study has the potential for explaining new ways to decrease the risk factors for those working shift work by contributing to the overall understanding of this multifaceted relationship. This study has many important findings and implications. This study has implications for explaining that the effects of disturbances to the circadian rhythm as a result of certain shift work schedules can result in ill-related health effects. Additionally, this study sought to challenge limitations to current research that has been conducted on the topic as the majority of studies have been performed on men. The overall purpose of the study was to gain a better understanding of the negative effects of shift work on females working within the transportation industry. This study sought to explain the health implications specifically for female workers as fewer studies have been conducted with gender as a main effect in the analysis. The present study suggests that due to the circadian rhythm controlling hormone secretion within the body, disturbances to its natural rhythm can have additional effects on female cycles such as menstruation. Overall, this study offers implications for further research on females working shift work and highlights the continued importance for further exploration into recent developments. These implications have the potential to further our current understanding of the relationship between shift work and ill-health effects, particularly the factors that women face.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the correlation between somatic and psychological symptoms and insomnia and the contribution of depression and anxiety to insomnia in a sample of peri- and post-menopausal women in a clinical setting. Study design: The responses of 237 peri- and post-menopausal women enrolled in the Systematic Health and Nutrition Education Program (SHNEP) at the Menopause Clinic of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital between November 2007 and December 2010 to the Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life (MHR-QOL) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires were subjected to Spearman's rank correlation and logistic regression analyses. Results: The analysis revealed that (1) insomnia is highly prevalent, (2) the symptoms of difficulty in initiating sleep (DIS) and experiencing non-restorative sleep (NRS) are more strongly correlated with psychological than somatic symptoms, and (3) DIS is strongly associated with anxiety while NRS is strongly associated with depression in the population studied. Conclusions: Insomnia is highly prevalent among peri- and post-menopausal female patients in a clinical setting and more closely associated with psychological than somatic symptoms. DIS is strongly correlated with anxiety while NRS is strongly correlated with depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by Laila Simpson et al. (see record 2010-06826-009). The association between obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is well known. The paper by Simpson et al. aims to examine the effects of regional obesity in the development of OSA and its severity by using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure total body fat mass, regional fat mass and lean body mass in obese, middle aged men and women diagnosed with the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. They have utilized traditional methods of anthropometric measurement, Body Mass Index (BMI) and DXA in their prospective observational case series of 96 obese patients with OSA to assess regional and total body fat distribution in relation to the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) as a marker of disease severity. Unfortunately, there were no population controls for this study and hormonal status for women was not factored into the equation. Android distribution of fat has been well documented in postmenopausal women and percentage body fat (PBF) has been found to correlate significantly better with BMI than waist circumference in women, with the converse being true of men, mirroring some of the findings of Simpson et al. Future studies investigating the role of percentage body fat and regional body fat distribution on the severity of OSA should control for wide variations within the normal population. Concurrent physiological measurements would provide an extra dimension to such studies in an effort to determine causality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Circadian disruption is hypothesized to impact reproductive signaling, which in turn has long been linked to breast cancer. The melatonin hypothesis holds that increased exposure to artificial light at night and resulting inhibition of nocturnal melatonin may account for recent increased breast cancer incidence. Coregulation of melatonin, circulating reproductive hormones and precursor gonadotropins has been well documented in animal models, particularly those of seasonal breeders, yet elucidation of these complex hormonal relationships in humans has proven challenging. This work investigates the link between circadian disruption and female gonadal activity and reproductive-related outcomes in the context of breast cancer risk. Methods: We examined the association between rotating shift work and age at menopause among the Nurses' Health Study II cohort, estimating cause-specific hazards using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. The cross-sectional associations between nocturnal melatonin production, menstrual cycle length and circulating sex steroid hormones and prolactin were examined in two additional populations using ordinary least squares regression and generalized estimating equations. Effect modification of nocturnal melatonin and prolactin by age and diurnal preference was additionally investigated. Results: The hazard of natural menopause was observed to be lower in women who had worked >10 years of rotating shifts since baseline (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69-0.85), in the direction of our hypothesis. The strength of this effect was not maintained upon inclusion of prior exposure. Nocturnal melatonin levels were not found to be associated with menstrual cycle length, nor with daytime circulating levels of estradiol, progesterone or prolactin. However, we observed effect modification of nocturnal melatonin and circulating daytime prolactin by age. Conclusion: Our findings do not conclusively support or refute an association between circadian disruption and reproductive risk factors for breast cancer. Future work will benefit from more precise measurement and observation of the interplay between endocrine markers of circadian activity and reproductive function over time.

N2  - Managing Hot Flushes with Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is an evidence-based manual drawing on their research which has demonstrated, in randomized controlled trials, that Group CBT effectively reduces the impact of hot flushes and night sweats. The treatment is effective for women going through a natural menopause and for women who have menopausal symptoms following breast cancer treatments and for other groups of women who have troublesome symptoms. This manual provides health professionals with everything they need to run groups to help women to manage hot flushes and night sweats. Managing Hot Flushes with Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy equips health professionals with knowledge, skills and materials to run groups to help women to manage menopausal symptoms in six (or four) weekly sessions without the need for medication. It is easy to use with a companion audio exercise and downloadable resources online, as well as Power Point slides, homework sheets and diaries. Following Group CBT women have the information, practical skills and strategies to help them to cope with hot flushes and night sweats, and also report improvements in sleep and quality of life. This manual will be an essential resource for nurses, psychologists, counselors, psychological wellbeing practitioners and cognitive behavior therapists working in health care and voluntary settings.

N2  - Objectives: Chronic diseases may aggravate or simulate climacteric symptoms. Although acknowledged in clinical practice, there is a lack of research systematically analysing the association between chronic diseases and climacteric symptoms. Study design and main outcome measures: Our study was a cross-sectional population-based study, which included 3421 women, aged 41–54 years. Climacteric symptoms were evaluated using the Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ), of which we included seven symptom domains (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety/fears, cognitive, sexual, and menstrual) and a question concerning whether the women were worried about growing old. The occurrence of various diseases (cardiovascular, neurological, sensory organ, bronchopulmonary, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, urological, dermatological, and thyroid disease, diabetes, and cancer) was recorded. The associations between the diseases and symptoms were defined with multivariable analyses, adjusting for various confounding factors. Results: The women with the diseases had more symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms and sleep problems were associated only with gastrointestinal diseases, and lower sexual functioning only with diabetes. The remaining symptoms were associated with several diseases, except being worried about growing old, which was not associated with any. Conclusions: Many symptoms connected to the climacteric may manifest also due to chronic diseases. Thus, health-care professionals should consider the origin of the symptoms when treating middle-aged women with chronic diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate sleep disturbances among menopausal women: their prevalence, risk factors for them and the quality of life of women who have them. Design: A population-based sample of 887 Turkish women aged 45–59 years and living in Malatya was recruited in this cross-sectional descriptive study. The women were administered the Interview Form, which covers sociodemographic, health and lifestyle variables, as well as the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, the Menopause Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: The prevalence of sleep disturbance in this sample of menopausal women was 54%. Logistic regression models revealed that the risk of sleep disturbance was 2.4 times higher in the perimenopausal than in the premenopausal period, 1.7 times higher among those who received hormone therapy than among those who did not, 1.5 times higher among those with a physical disease than among those without, and 3.9 times higher among those with depression than among those without; an increase of one year in age was associated with a 5% increase in the prevalence of sleep disturbance. Average scores on the vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual sub-scales of the Menopause Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire were significantly higher for women with sleep disturbance than for those without (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of sleep disturbance was found to be high among menopausal women. Initiatives aimed at reducing sleep disturbance should be added to menopausal care programmes in order to improve the quality of life of menopausal women.

N2  - We aimed to show the effect of osteoporosis on sleep quality in 59 postmenopausal women. The participants' bone‐mineral density levels were measured by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). According to their DEXA results, participants were divided into two groups as osteoporotics and controls. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality. Fourteen osteoporotic women (43.8%) and four controls (14.8%) were “poor” sleepers (p < 0.05). Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis scored greater on the “sleep latency” and “sleep duration” components of PSQI than controls. According to the findings of our study, osteoporosis is a risk factor for poor sleep quality in postmenopausal women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The functional significance of psychological, physiological, and behavioral differences between morning- and evening-types may be crucially linked to variation in sociosexuality associated with chronotype. Morning- and evening-types have a constellation of traits that are commonly associated with slow and fast life histories. The findings that variation in chronotype is significantly heritable, that sex differences in chronotype exist, and are most apparent in the time period between puberty and the onset of menopause in women, also strongly suggest that examining the mating strategies of morning- and evening-types can enhance our understanding of the evolution of morningness-eveningness and its functional significance. This chapter argues that the functional/evolutionary significance of variation in chronotype is best understood if this trait is framed within evolutionary life history theory (LHT) and in relation to differences in sociosexuality between slow and fast life history individuals. It illustrates some fundamental concepts in LHT, examines how LHT predicts interindividual variation in sociosexuality, and reviews and discusses recent studies of morningness-eveningness and sociosexuality from an evolutionary perspective.

N2  - Fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster females display rhythmic egg-laying under 12:12 h light/dark (LD) cycles which persists with near 24 h periodicity under constant darkness (DD). We have shown previously that persistence of this rhythm does not require the neurons expressing pigment dispersing factor (PDF), thought to be the canonical circadian pacemakers, and proposed that it could be controlled by peripheral clocks or regulated/triggered by the act of mating. We assayed egg-laying behaviour of wild-type Canton S (CS) females under LD, DD and constant light (LL) conditions in three different physiological states; as virgins, as females allowed to mate with males for 1 day and as females allowed to mate for the entire duration of the assay. Here, we report the presence of a circadian rhythm in egg-laying in virgin D. melanogaster females. We also found that egg-laying behaviour of 70 and 90% females from all the three male presence/absence protocols follows circadian rhythmicity under DD and LL, with periods ranging between 18 and 30 h. The egg-laying rhythm of all virgin females synchronized to LD cycles with a peak occurring soon after lights-off. The rhythm in virgins was remarkably robust with maximum number of eggs deposited immediately after lights-off in contrast to mated females which show higher egg-laying during the day. These results suggest that the egg-laying rhythm of D. melanogaster is endogenously driven and is neither regulated nor triggered by the act of mating; instead, the presence of males results in reduction in entrainment to LD cycles.

N2  - Background/objectives: The extent to which alterations in energy expenditure (EE) in response to sleep restriction contribute to the short sleep-obesity relationship is not clearly defined. Short sleep may induce changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR), thermic effect of food (TEF) and postprandial substrate oxidation. Subjects/methods: Ten females (age and body mass index: 22-43 years and 23.4-28 kg m−2) completed a randomized, crossover study assessing the effects of short (4 h per night) and habitual (8 h per night) sleep duration on fasting and postprandial RMR and respiratory quotient (RQ). Measurements were taken after three nights using whole-room indirect calorimetry. The TEF was assessed over a 6-h period following consumption of a high-fat liquid meal. Results: Short versus habitual sleep did not affect RMR (1.01 ± 0.05 and 0.97 ± 0.04 kcal min−1; P = 0.23). Fasting RQ was significantly lower after short versus habitual sleep (0.84 ± 0.01 and 0.88 ± 0.01; P = 0.028). Postprandial EE (short: 1.13 ± 0.04 and habitual: 1.10 ± 0.04, P = 0.09) and RQ (short: 0.88 ± 0.01 and habitual: 0.88 ± 0.01, P = 0.50) after the high-fat meal were not different between conditions. TEF was similar between conditions (0.24 ± 0.02 kcal min−1 in both; P = 0.98), as was the ∼6-h incremental area under the curve (1.16 ± 0.10 and 1.17 ± 0.09 kcal min−1 × 356 min after short and habitual sleep, respectively; P=0.92). Conclusions: Current findings observed in non-obese healthy premenopausal women do not support the hypothesis that alterations in TEF and postprandial substrate oxidation are major contributors to the higher rate of obesity observed in short sleepers. In exploring a role of sleep duration on EE, research should focus on potential alterations in physical activity to explain the increased obesity risk in short sleepers.

N2  - Successful reproduction depends upon a highly orchestrated cascade of events during optimal environmental conditions in order to appropriately time ovulation. In spontaneously ovulating rodents, neurons in the hypothalamus secreting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are triggered by a timed, stimulatory signal originating from the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), initiating a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the release of a mature egg from it's follicle. Reproductive viability is maintained in part by the temporal precision of GnRH signaling, and ageingrelated declines in ovulatory function are a direct result of the dysregulation of circadian control of GnRH. The transition to reproductive senescence is characterized by irregular estrous cycles prior to any decline in ovarian reserves, suggesting the central mechanisms controlling GnRH are initially responsible for determining reproductive quiescence. In addition to the circadian control of the HPG axis, most mammals are markedly affected by the availability of energy with regard to reproductive function. In most natural habitats, food availability and energetic status fluctuate markedly, requiring individuals within a species to prioritize survival via foraging and ingestive behaviors over behaviors that perpetuate the individual during periods of low available energy. Consequently, the mechanisms monitoring available energy also regulate the reproductive axis, primarily through inhibiting or permitting the release of GnRH under specific energetic conditions. The specific mechanisms connecting the circadian clock and energy balance to the reproductive axis remain to be fully characterized. Two related RFamide (Arg-PHe-NH2), kisspeptin and RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) stimulate and inhibit GnRH, respectively, and may bridge the gap between the circadian system, energy balance and reproduction. All studies utilized female Syrian hamsters, which exhibit precise 4-day estrous cycles and are considered to be ideal model systems for understanding reproductive cyclicity. In the first series of experiments, the role of kisspeptin in the circadian control of ovulation was examined. Kisspeptin neurons exhibit a circadian pattern of activation and are regulated by the SCN via vasopressin (AVP) efferents. AVP administration upregulates kisspeptin indiscriminately, but the GnRH response is restricted to the afternoon. Furthermore, GnRH neurons exhibited a timed sensitivity to kisspeptin administration, suggesting these neurons act as a gating site for upstream signals in order to properly time ovulation. The circadian control of RFamide peptides may be critical to maintain ovulatory function in aging animals. The second set of experiments investigated whether or not the transition to reproductive acyclicity is characterized by disruptions in the timing of RFamide activation. Middle-aged, female Syrian hamsters exhibiting irregular estrous cycles displayed alterations in the timing of RFRP-3 activation, compared to young and middle-aged, regularly cycling hamsters. Furthermore, middle-aged hamsters exhibit abnormally high levels of kisspeptin immunoreactivity around the time of the LH surge, which may be indicative of improper kisspeptin release during the periovulatory period. The final set of experiments aimed to determine whether or not the neural circuitry detecting energy status communicates to RFRP-3, and if metabolic challenge, such as food deprivation, alters the activational state of this inhibitory peptide. RFRP-3 activation increases following 48 hours of food deprivation, and may downregulate the HPG axis during periods of negative energy balance. Furthermore, immense innervation of RFRP-3 by the orexigenic peptide, NPY, provides a mechanism of control between these two systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Migraine and epilepsy appear as fundamentally different diseases at first sight. However, both of them are characterized by recurrent attacks of nervous system dysfunctions, with a return to baseline between attacks. They share some clinical characteristics such as trigger factors (visual stimuli, sleep deprivation, stress, menses, etc.), enhanced sensitivity for sensory input such as light and sound and transient neurological symptoms including visual, sensory or speech symptoms. The possible occurrence of migrainous headaches before, during some ictal phases of a partial seizure (hemicrania epileptica) or after any seizure (postictal headaches), and the precipitation of an epileptic attack by a typical migrainous aura (migralepsy) also illustrate the reciprocal influences between migraine and epilepsy. Moreover, the alterations of neuronal excitability observed in migraine patients emphasize the debate of a common pathogenic mechanism between the two diseases. The purpose of this review is to present the clinical and pathophysiological similarities between these two disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The objective of this study was to examine the quality of life in female Turkish patients with overactive bladder (OAB). The investigation was conducted as a cross‐sectional study between January and April 2010. Two hundred eighty female patients responded to the Overactive Bladder Validated Eight‐Question Screener, the OAB disease‐specific health‐related quality‐of‐life scale (OAB questionnaire (OAB‐q)) and the general quality‐of‐life scale EuroQol Five‐Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ‐5D) for the study. Of the 280 patients, 38.9% was classified as having OAB. The mean age was 47.0 ± 8.7. All of the quality‐of‐life domains (coping, concern, sleep and social) and OAB‐q total scores in women with OAB were significantly worse than in women without OAB (P index and EQ‐5DVAS scores for women with OAB were significantly worse than for women without OAB (P index scores in menopausal women were significantly lower than non‐menopausal women (P < 0.05) in patients with OAB. In conclusion, OAB negatively affects quality of life in Turkish women. However, many women's quality of life can be improved if the patients seek medical treatment. Thus, nurses should encourage the patients to seek medical support in order to cope with health‐related quality‐of‐life problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: To determine whether the duration of sleep, sleep quality, insomnia, or sleep disturbance was associated with incident breast cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Women enrolled in one of the Clinical Trial (CT) arms or the Observational Study (OS) from the WHI conducted in the United States. Participants: This study included 110,011 women age 50 to 79 years with no history of cancer. Measurements and Results: Typical sleep duration, sleep quality, and other self-reported sleep measures over the past 4 weeks were assessed during the screening visits for both the CT and OS participants. The presence of insomnia and level of sleep disturbance was calculated from an index of the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale. The outcome for this study was primary, invasive breast cancer. A total of 5,149 incident cases of breast cancer were identified in this study. No statistically significant associations were found between sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia, or level of sleep disturbance with the risk of breast cancer after multivariable adjustment. A positive trend was observed for increasing sleeping duration with the risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, but the association estimates for each sleep duration category were weak and nonsignificant. Conclusions: This study does not provide strong support for an association between self-reported sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia, or sleep disturbance with the risk of breast cancer.

N2  - Attention has been paid to "objective" characteristics but not "subjective" perceptions of neighborhood environments and associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; the latter may be of particular import since one of the ways in which impoverished neighborhood environments are theorized to impact health is through their roles as daily sources of stress. Few studies have examined how neighborhood characteristics impact CVD risk within Latinos. The current study examined the relationship between perceptions of neighborhood physical and social disorder and CVD risk as assessed by body mass index (BMI), the Homeostasis Model of Assessment – Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (total/HDL-c), triglycerides, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Indirect effects through behavioral (dietary patterns, sedentary behavior, exercise, smoking, sleep quality/quantity) and psychological (chronic stress, perceived stress, anxiety, depression) factors were also examined. A sample of 304 healthy, Mexican-American women, aged 40-65 years, were recruited from south San Diego communities of diverse SES. Participants completed questionnaires assessing demographics, health behaviors and neighborhood disorder. Trained assessors measured blood pressure and obtained anthropometric measurements. Levels of lipids, insulin, and glucose were collected through a fasting venous blood draw. Findings showed no significant relationship between physical disorder and CVD risk factors in either age-adjusted or fully-adjusted (controlling for SES, acculturation, menopausal status, and medications relevant to CVD risk factors) models. Social disorder was significantly associated with total/HDL-c ratio, triglycerides, and MAP and were marginally associated with HOMA-IR (p=.058). No associations remained significant in fully-adjusted models. In addition, no indirect effects through behavioral or psychological pathways were significant. Sensitivity analyses revealed an interaction between social disorder and neighborhood SES on MAP that approached significance (p= .053). Simple slope analyses showed a trend for a stronger association between social disorder and MAP with increasing neighborhood SES. In sum, results provide preliminary evidence of associations between greater perceived social disorder in one's neighborhood and CVD risk through increased lipids and blood pressure in Latino women. However, these effects may be due to confounding with SES. Findings contribute to the understanding of how appraisals of macro-level influences relate to CVD risk within the Latino population.

N2  - A large portion of reproductive-aged women report experiencing distressing premenstrual symptoms. These symptoms can be exacerbated by concurrent mood problems and contribute to long-term depressive risk. However, difficulty sleeping and regulating emotional responses are also associated with the premenstrual phase and represent additional, well-established risk factors for depression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether habitual sleep problems and emotion regulation strategies serve to mediate the relationship between mood and premenstrual symptoms in non-treatment–seeking young women. Participants included 265 adult women between the ages of 18 and 25 who provided retrospective self-reports of depressive symptoms, habitual sleep quality, and premenstrual symptoms for the past month. Trait-based difficulties in regulating emotions were also assessed. Greater depressive symptoms significantly predicted greater premenstrual symptoms and both poor sleep and ineffective emotion regulation were shown to mediate this relationship. Poor sleep may enhance experience of premenstrual symptoms via its well-established impact on physical, cognitive, and/or affective functioning. Similarly, an inability to effectively regulate emotional responses in general may exacerbate experience or perception of somatic and mood symptoms during the premenstrual period, contributing to mood disturbances and risk. Findings require replication in future studies using prospective designs and more diverse samples of women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Hormonal side effects, frequently reported with antipsychotic medications, have been rarely associated with the use of antidepressant medications. We hereby report a 25 year old female with a diagnosis of Tension Type Headache with Depressive Disorder who developed galactorrhea while on escitalopram and had normal prolactin levels. A 25 year old unmarried female presented to us with complaints of headache which was dull aching, mild to moderate in severity, with no aggravating or relieving factors, occurring almost daily for the past 6 months along with complaints of sadness of mood, decreased interest in previously pleasurable activities, off and on disturbed sleep and appetite. Antidepressants can induce galactorrhea and the etiology seems to be multifactorial. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of antidepressant induced galactorrhea while evaluating patients presenting with galactorrhea. Future research should try to explore the precise mechanisms of antidepressant-induced galactorrhea. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

The headaches were occurring about twice a week for a few years but decreased in frequency to about 3 per month when she started topiramate 100 mg daily 1 year ago. Are migraines more common in neurologists than the general population? If so, why should neurologists and headache specialists self-medicate for migraine? Triggers include her menses, lack of sleep, and stress from her medical practice. Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders, and a lot of epidemiological studies have been published on the prevalence and on its burden. All these studies suggest unanimously that migraine is much more prevalent among headache specialists and neurologists than in the general population. A presence of migraine in the insurance records would, for example, lead to higher rates for or even exclusion from private health insurances in Germany. Finally, there is of course no reason why neurologists and headache specialists should not self medicate for their own migraine. If they do self-treat with prescription medications, they should keep records on themselves as they would for any other patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: To explain the controversy about whether midlife women who self-report hot flashes have relatively increased affective symptoms, poor cognitive performance or worse sleep. Methods: Retrospective data from 88 women seeking relief from bothersome day and night hot flashes were submitted to mixed linear regression modeling to find if estimated hot flashes, as measured by Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) items, or diary-documented hot flashes recorded daily, were associated with each other, or with affective, cognitive or sleep measures. Results: Subjects averaged 6.3 daytime diary-documented hot flashes and 2.4 nighttime diary-documented hot flashes per 24h. Confounder-controlled diary-documented hot flashes but not estimated hot flashes were associated with increased Leeds anxiety scores (F = 4.9; t = 2.8; p = 0.01) and Leeds depression scores (3.4; 2.5; 0.02), decreased Stroop Color–Word test performance (9.4; 3.5; 0.001), increased subjective sleep disturbance (effect size = 0.83) and increased objective sleep disturbance (effect size = 0.35). Hot flash effects were small to moderate in size. Univariate but not multivariate analyses revealed that all hot flash measures were associated with all affect measures. Different measures of hot flashes associated differently with affect, cognition and sleep. Only nighttime diary-document hot flash consistently correlated with any affect measures in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: The use of differing measures for hot flashes, affect, cognition and sleep may account for the continually reported inconsistencies in menopause study outcomes. This problem impedes forging a consensus on whether hot flashes correlate with neuropsychological symptoms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Menstrual cycle–associated changes in reproductive hormones affect body temperature in women. We aimed to characterize the interaction between the menstrual, circadian, and scheduled sleep-wake cycles on body temperature regulation. Eight females entered the laboratory during the midfollicular (MF) and midluteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle for an ultradian sleep-wake cycle procedure, consisting of 36 cycles of 60-minute wake episodes alternating with 60-minute nap opportunities, in constant bed-rest conditions. Core body temperature (CBT) and distal skin temperature (DT) were recorded and used to calculate a distal-core gradient (DCG). Melatonin, sleep, and subjective sleepiness were also recorded. The circadian variation of DT and DCG was not affected by menstrual phase. DT and DCG showed rapid, large nap episode–dependent increases, whereas CBT showed slower, smaller nap episode–dependent decreases. DCG values were significantly reduced for most of the wake episode in an overall 60-minute wake/60-minute nap cycle during ML compared to MF, but these differences were eliminated at the wake-to-nap lights-out transition. Nap episode–dependent decreases in CBT were further modulated as a function of both circadian and menstrual factors, with nap episode–dependent deceases occurring more prominently during the late afternoon/evening in ML, whereas nap episode–dependent DT and DCG increases were not significantly affected by menstrual phase but only circadian phase. Circadian rhythms of melatonin secretion, DT, and DCG were significantly phase-advanced relative to CBT and sleep propensity rhythms. This study explored how the thermoregulatory system is influenced by an interaction between circadian phase and vigilance state and how this is further modulated by the menstrual cycle. Current results agree with the thermophysiological cascade model of sleep and indicate that despite increased CBT during ML, heat loss mechanisms are maintained at a similar level during nap episodes, which may allow for comparable circadian sleep propensity rhythms between menstrual phases.

N2  - Background: Medical marijuana alleviates a variety of symptoms, including those associated with menopause, such as insomnia, irritability, depression and joint pain. However, little work has addressed the use of marijuana in a population of menopausal women, or the role of menopausal women’s marijuana treatment expectancies in regard to consumption. We hypothesized that menopausal women who used marijuana would expect it to alleviate symptoms that have responded well to the plant in previous research. Based on the marijuana expectancy literature, we also hypothesized that links from menopause symptoms to marijuana use would arise via indirect paths through expectancies. Methods: Menopausal and post-menopausal women (N = 115) who endorsed lifetime marijuana use completed an online survey assessing their frequency of use, average intoxication—a proxy for quantity, menopause symptoms, and expectancies of relief from menopause symptoms. Results: Women expected marijuana to improve joint/muscle discomfort, irritability, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and hot flashes, but not sex problems, heart discomfort, exhaustion, vaginal dryness and bladder problems. Expectancies mediated the links between menopause symptoms and frequency of use. Average intoxication did not correlate with symptoms or expectations of relief. Symptoms, expectancies, and frequency of marijuana use were all independent of marijuana-related problems. Conclusions: Particularly as the population ages, increased research on how medical marijuana might help menopause symptoms without increasing marijuana-related problems could prove heuristic.

N2  - Aims: To describe levels of sexual desire across the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopause (PM), including effects of age, MT-related factors, health, stress, symptoms (hot flash, sleep, mood), and social opportunity factors. Methods: A subset of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study (SMWHS) participants who provided data during the early reproductive, early and late menopausal transition stages, or postmenopause (n = 286), including menstrual calendars for staging the MT, annual health reports between 1990 and 2005, and morning urine samples assayed for estrone glucuronide (E₁G), testosterone (T), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was included. Multilevel modeling using the R program was used to test factors related to sexual desire. Results: Women experienced a significant decrease in sexual desire during the late MT stage (p p p  0.0001, 0.06, and 0.0002, respectively). Women using hormone therapy also reported higher sexual desire (p = 0.02). Those reporting higher perceived stress reported lower sexual desire (p p range from p p < 0.0001). Having a partner was associated with lower sexual desire. Conclusions: Clinicians working with women traversing the MT should be aware that promoting healthy sexual functioning among midlife women requires consideration of their changing biology as well as ongoing life challenges.

N2  - Comments on an article by Joanna Wieczorek et al. (see record 2016-14382-009). In Wieczorek et al., study, salivary samples for melatonin analysis were obtained every 4 h throughout designated 24 h spans, starting at 11:00 h, both during the winter and summer, from 8 Polish young adults. The authors concluded that the melatonin peak value does not depend upon season, flight direction and day of arrival, whereas the peak time of the melatonin circadian rhythm is related to season and flight direction. In addition, the authors state that the peak of the melatonin circadian rhythm as a result of travel in both directions – to Tromso from Warsaw and to Warsaw from Tromso – is related to diurnal activity level. This article lacks a great number of particulars to properly interpret the melatonin data. We focus below on several of them, in particular, in female subjects oral contraceptive use and phase of menstrual cycle and in both male and female subjects physical exertion/ exercise, alcohol consumption and hypobaric hypoxia exposure during flight, all known to be of importance for a study on melatonin, but seemingly not taken into consideration.

N2  - Sleep and is critical for proper memory consolidation. The locus coeruleus (LC) releases norepinephrine throughout the brain except when the LC falls silent throughout rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and prior to each non-REM (NREM) sleep spindle. We hypothesize that these transient LC silences allow the synaptic plasticity necessary to incorporate new information into preexisting memory circuits. We found that spontaneous LC activity within sleep spindles triggers a decrease in sleep spindle power. By optogenetically stimulating norepinephrine-containing LC neurons at 2 Hz during sleep, we reduced sleep spindle occurrence as well as NREM delta power and REM theta power, without causing arousals or changing sleep amounts. Stimulating the LC during sleep following a hippocampus-dependent food location learning task interfered with consolidation of newly learned locations, and reconsolidation of previous locations, disrupting next-day place cell activity. The LC stimulation-induced reduction in NREM sleep spindles, delta, and REM theta, and reduced ripple-spindle coupling all correlated with decreased hippocampus-dependent performance on the task. Thus, periods of LC silence during sleep following learning are essential for normal spindle generation, delta and theta power, and consolidation of spatial memories.Sleep quantity and quality also impact many physiological and neural processes. Sleep is affected by the menstrual cycle; however, few studies have examined the effects of the estrous cycle on sleep in rodents. Thus, studies of disease mechanisms in females lack critical information regarding estrous cycle influences on relevant sleep characteristics. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from multiple brain regions to assess sleep states as well as sleep traits such as spectral power and interregional spectral coherence in males and freely cycling females across the estrous cycle. Our findings show that the high hormone phase of proestrus decreases the amount of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increases the amount of time spent awake compared with males and other estrous phases. This spontaneous sleep deprivation of proestrus was followed by a sleep rebound in estrus with increased NREM and REM sleep and rebound-like sleep architecture. Spectral power increased in the delta 0.5-4 Hz) and the gamma (30-60 Hz) ranges during NREM sleep of proestrus, and in the theta range (5-9 Hz) during REM sleep of both proestrus and estrus. Slow wave activity and cortical sleep spindle density also increased in NREM sleep of proestrus. Finally, interregional NREM and REM spectral coherence increased during proestrus. This work demonstrates that the estrous cycle affects more facets of sleep than previously thought and reveals further sex differences in feature of the sleep-wake cycle, which are relevant to a myriad of physiological processes influenced by sleep.

N2  - Women report insomnia more frequently than men, though the reasons for this remain unclear. Theories aiming to explain this observation have often focused on the menstrual cycle, and its associated variations in sex hormones, as a causative factor. Circadian rhythms are known to have an influence on sleep, and the expression of circadian physiology may be altered by the menstrual cycle. The aim of the current thesis was to study the interaction between menstrual and circadian processes, with a particular emphasis on how this interaction affects sleep quality, propensity, and organization, as well as body temperature regulation and neuroendocrine hormone secretion. In the first of two studies, we observed a reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at specific circadian time points during the mid-luteal (ML) phase compared to the mid-follicular phase. Circadian sleep propensity rhythms were unchanged between menstrual phases, despite the raised core body temperature during the ML phase. Subsequent analyses aimed to explore the thermoregulatory system across circadian, menstrual, and sleep-wake states. These results demonstrated that nap episode-dependent peripheral heat loss mechanisms are maintained at a similar level between menstrual phases, which is likely to explain the similarity in observed circadian sleep propensity rhythms. In a second experiment, women diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) who present with insomnia symptoms were studied as a model, in which their specific luteal phase-associated pathophysiology can be used as a tool to further explore the interaction between menstrual and circadian processes on the expression of sleep. PMDD was found to be associated with an impaired circadian melatonin rhythm, as well as significantly increased nocturnal slow wave sleep (SWS) compared to healthy controls. These results indicate that a chronobiological abnormality in PMDD patients has functional consequences for the expression of subjective sleep perception, objective sleep organization, and possibly the regulation of homeostatic sleep-wake mechanisms. Taken together, evidence presented here suggests that an interaction between the menstrual cycle and the circadian system plays a role in the regulation of sleep in women. Results of the current thesis may be useful in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of sleep complaints in the female population.

N2  - Presents a case of a 47 year old Caucasian woman who reported symptoms of snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and witnessed apneas. She also had frequent nocturnal diaphoresis, which she attributed to the onset of possible menopause. The patient underwent a split night polysomnogram with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration, which demonstrated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). At a CPAP titration pressure of 6 cm H2O, the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was reduced to 6.0 and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation rose to 87%. The patient had laboratory work-up for her menopausal symptoms shortly after the sleep study. The human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level was 2.1 mI U/ml. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level was 52 mI U/ml. Lutenizing hormone (LH) level was 35.3 mI U/ml. Prolactin level was 6.5 N G/ml. These levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state. A repeat series of laboratory work was initiated. The FSH level was now 3.2 mI U/ml. The LH level was 8.1 mI U/ml. The prolactin level was 49.9 N G/ml. Approximately five weeks later a repeat FSH level was taken and was noted to be 2.1 mI U/ml. A HCG level was noted to be <2 mI U/ ml. LH was 3.2 mI U/ml. These results were no longer in the range of menopausal patients and indicated the return of normal cycling of these hormones as seen with normal menstrual cycles.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the most prevalent chronic disease in the aging population. Older women are at greatest risk for CVD, higher than their male counterparts. Disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CVD and CVD risk factors in older women, suggest that current prevention strategies are not effective for these populations. Research shows that post-menopausal women experience difficulty adapting to age-related changes in sleep. Considering 1/3 of the day is spent sleeping, sleep duration is a potential modifiable CVD lifestyle risk factor worthy of greater exploration. Aging research to date has included a focus on the cardiometabolic associations of sleep duration, including large-scale epidemiological studies and meta-analyses concluding that inadequate sleep duration and poor sleep quality are associated with increased development, progression, and severity of CVD and CVD comorbidities. Research, however, has mostly employed self-reported sleep measures, focused on Caucasian populations and has not considered sleep as part of the 24 hour day. There is a need for research to examine the relationship between sleep duration and CVD risk in an older population of women, and to determine if insufficient sleep duration, short or long, is a CVD risk factor worthy of further examination. Methods: This dissertation leverages data from the unique "Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health" (OPACH) study among 6489 women, ages 63-99, recruited from a Women's Health Initiative cohort. Women wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip for 24 hours per day and completed a daily sleep log over a 7-day period. In addition to accelerometer-measured 24-hour activity data, the OPACH study includes measures of physical functioning, lifestyle questionnaires, and clinical biomarkers. Participants were contacted yearly to provide updated medical history including self-report of CVD events with follow-up up to 5 years. Sleep data were scored according to a standard protocol using sleep logs. Chapter 1 assessed if sleep duration, measured with accelerometers, is associated with numerous cardiometabolic markers, including measures of insulin resistance, inflammation and body composition in older women. Chapter 2 was an examination of the relationship between sleep duration and the Reynolds Risk Score, a clinically relevant composite CVD risk score. In Chapter 3, the relationship between cardiovascular events over 3--5 years of follow-up and self-reported sleep duration and accelerometer-measured sleep duration was examined. Results: Chapter 1 found significant associations between sleep duration and markers of cardiometabolic health. Several of these relationships suggested the relationship was u-shaped, with short and long sleep associated with higher cardiometabolic values. Chapter 2 further explored this relationship and demonstrated that sleep duration is non-linearly associated with 10-year estimated CVD risk among older women. In Chapter 3, there was no significant increase in CVD risk for short or long sleep durations over the 5-year period, measured by self-report or accelerometer. Discussion: The results of this analysis demonstrate sleep duration is related to markers of cardiometabolic health and intermediate CVD risk, but that sleep duration does not independently predict incident CVD. These findings may be explained by the interdependence of 24-hour activities, including sleep duration, and their relationship to cardiometabolic health. While results do not support sleep duration as a risk factor for CVD, they do support sleep duration as a lifestyle behavior worth targeting for cardiometabolic risk reduction in older women. To better understand how sleep relates to cardiometabolic health, we must better understand the interdependence and interrelationships of activities throughout the 24-hour day.

N2  - Background: Little is known about the course of depression in midlife women. This study aims to identify factors that distinguish risk factors for persistent or recurrent depression from those of a milder course across 13-years of follow-up. Methods: 297 Black and White premenopausal women aged 42–52 were enrolled at the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Pittsburgh site. Psychiatric interviews obtained information on lifetime psychiatric diagnoses at baseline and occurrences of depression annually. We identified four depression patterns: 91(31%) had Persistent/recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), 27(9%) Single Episode MDD, 35(12%) Minor Depression (minD) only, 144(48%) No Depression. We compared baseline risk factors for the Persistent/recurrent MDD group with each of the other three. Results: A lifetime history of major or minor depression (p-values = .001–.08) and 2+ very upsetting life events in the previous year (p-values = .003–.04) were more likely to be reported by women in the Persistent/recurrent group than in the other three. The Persistent/recurrent group was more likely to report a family history of depression (p = .03) than the MinD group, and to report current sleep problems (p = .002) at baseline than the Single Episode MDD group. Limitations: Small numbers of women with minD or a Single Episode MDD. Childhood maltreatment and family depression history were retrospectively reported. Conclusions: A Persistent/recurrent depression course is common during midlife. In addition to personal and family histories of depression, providers of midlife health care should recognize that current sleep problems and recent very upsetting events are strong risk factors for a pernicious depression course.

N2  - The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and predictors of depressive symptoms in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In a cross-sectional study of 114 women seeking consultation for symptoms of PCOS (menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and/or acne), personal and family history of depression (HD and FHD respectively) were enquired. Vitamin D status (n = 104) and manifest depressive symptoms assessed by personal health questionnaire (PHQ) (MD) were evaluated in a subset (85). Relationships between HD and MD with PCOS symptoms, FHD, and vitamin D status were assessed using adjusted analyses. Thirty-five percent acknowledged a HD; MD (PHQ > 4) was apparent in 43 %. HD was associated with hirsutism (OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.01–5.9), disturbed sleep (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 1.3–6.9), and with FHD (OR 4.8, 95 % CI 1.7–13.5). Disturbed sleep (OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.01–5.7) and FHD (OR 3.8, 95 % CI 1.3–11.2) were independent predictors of HD adjusting for race and BMI. An inverse correlation was noted between serum 25 OH vitamin D (25OHD) levels and PHQ score, but only in those with vitamin D deficiency (25OHD ≤ 30 ng/ml, n = 57, r = −0.32, p = 0.015). 25OHD HD (OR 12.8, 95 % CI 3.6–45.2) predicted scoring in the highest PHQ tertile after adjusting for hirsutism, BMI, and race. In women with PCOS, disturbed nocturnal sleep and FDH predicted personal HD, whereas HD and vitamin D deficiency related to the severity of MD symptoms.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study is to examine the life-long relationship between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and mania/hypomania symptoms and declared personality structure among girls who are university students. Methods: A total of 294 volunteers selected by random sampling method from 13 universities located in Fatih (4), Sisli (5) and Uskudar (4) districts of Istanbul were included in the study. The inventories used in data collection phase of the study are Premenstrual Assessment Form (PAF), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and a Sociodemographic Form developed by the research group. Results: %5.1 of the participants (n = 15) are between 17-19 years of age, 83.7% (n = 246) are between 20-23 years of age, 5.1% (n = 15) are 24-26 years of age and 6.1% (n = 18) are 27-28 years of age. There is a significant correlation between depressive affect, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, depressive thoughts, pain, appetite changes and sleep thoughts which are the dimensions of PAF and MDQ scores. There is a significant relationship between the age variable and depressive affect, depressive thoughts and MDQ scores. There is a significant relationship between depressive affect, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, depressive thoughts, pain, appetite changes and sleep thoughts which are the dimensions of Premenstrual Assessment Form and declared personality structure. Conclusion: According to the findings of our study, there is a statistically significant relationship between hormonal changes in PMS and mania/hypomania symptoms. Additionally, there is a statistically significant relationship between PMS and declared personality structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of a 19-year-old woman pursuing her graduate course presented in the psychiatric outpatient department with the complaints of nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, restlessness, irritability, sadness, lethargy, difficulty in concentration, and decreased sleep. symptoms were cyclic, lasting for 14 to 15 days every month postmenstrually for the last 2 years. Notably, the patient used to be totally asymptomatic during the 14 to 15 days of premenstrual period. After assurance, dietary advice, and psychoeducation, cyproheptadine 4 mg/d (for nausea and vomiting), alprazolam 0.75 mg/d (for anxiety), and fluoxetine 20 mg/d (for depressive symptoms) were prescribed. The next follow-up noted emergence of similar symptoms only during the postmenstrual period. During the third follow-up, symptoms starting with the onset of menses were again noticed. During the fifth month, quetiapine 25 mg at bedtime and paroxetine 10 mg twice a day were started. Postmenstrual symptoms decreased during the next 3 cycles to 7 to 10 days but not fully. At this stage, lamotrigine was titrated to 50 mg twice a day for 8 weeks, whereas paroxetine and quetiapine were tapered off. The patient’s distress reduced to 1 to 2 days during the next 3 to 4 cycles. Lamotrigine was continued for another 9 months and was then tapered off gradually. At the time of submitting this article, the patient was asymptomatic for 8 months. The index case not only calls for identifying patients with postmenstrual dysphoric disorder but underlines the effectiveness of lamotrigine in curtailing the distress and disability associated with such disorder.

N2  - Sleep impacts diverse physiological and neural processes and is itself affected by the menstrual cycle; however, few studies have examined the effects of the estrous cycle on sleep in rodents. Studies of disease mechanisms in females therefore lack critical information regarding estrous cycle influences on relevant sleep characteristics. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from multiple brain regions to assess sleep states as well as sleep traits such as spectral power and interregional spectral coherence in freely cycling females across the estrous cycle and compared with males. Our findings show that the high hormone phase of proestrus decreases the amount of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increases the amount of time spent awake compared with other estrous phases and to males. This spontaneous sleep deprivation of proestrus was followed by a sleep rebound in estrus which increased NREM and REM sleep. In proestrus, spectral power increased in the delta (0.5–4 Hz) and the gamma (30–60 Hz) ranges during NREM sleep, and increased in the theta range (5–9 Hz) during REM sleep during both proestrus and estrus. Slow-wave activity (SWA) and cortical sleep spindle density also increased in NREM sleep during proestrus. Finally, interregional NREM and REM spectral coherence increased during proestrus. This work demonstrates that the estrous cycle affects more facets of sleep than previously thought and reveals both sex differences in features of the sleep–wake cycle related to estrous phase that likely impact the myriad physiological processes influenced by sleep.

N2  - Purpose: Although pubertal timing is gradually becoming earlier in Japan, support as for physical and mental health among children experiencing earlier puberty than their peers is inadequate. To better understand health and life satisfaction in seventh grade students (age 12–13 years), examination of relationships between health outcomes and pubertal timing, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors is necessary. Methods: Participants of the Toyama Birth Cohort Study (4,752 males and 4,740 females) answered questions regarding school year of onset of voice break for boys and menarche for girls, sleep quality, mental health difficulties, overall health, quality of life (QOL), and lifestyle. Relationship between health outcomes and pubertal timing was examined using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Earlier pubertal timing was associated with four health-related outcomes. For poor sleep quality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of fourth grade males and crude OR of fifth grade females were statistically significant. Regarding mental health difficulties, the crude OR of fifth grade males and adjusted OR of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade females were statistically significant. Associations between poor overall health and fourth grade males and fourth or fifth grade females were observed. For poor QOL, the adjusted OR of fourth grade males and females was statistically significant. Conclusions: Relationships between earlier pubertal timing and poor sleep quality, mental health difficulties, poor physical health, and poor QOL were observed. To improve children's quality of life, support from teachers and school doctors and nurses is needed—especially for children with earlier pubertal timing.

N2  - This study examined the effects of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia. A randomized controlled trial was performed on 44 women. The intervention included one group session of sleep hygiene education and four individual sessions of counseling. The instruments included the Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Menopausal quality of life. The data were analyzed using repeated measure MANOVA, followed by repeated measure ANOVA. Repeated measure MANOVA showed that time had a significant main effect on the anthropometric variables (body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressures) and revealed significant main effects of the group and time on the psychosocial variables (sleep quality, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and quality of life) (p p < .05). Overall, the intervention was effective in improving insomnia and poor sleep quality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Various medical conditions, disorders, and syndromes exhibit predictable-in-time diurnal and 24 h patterning in the signs, symptoms, and grave nonfatal and fatal events, e.g., respiratory ones of viral and allergic rhinorrhea, reversible (asthma) and non-reversible (bronchitis and emphysema) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, high altitude pulmonary edema, and decompression sickness; cardiac ones of atrial premature beats and tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 3rd degree atrial-ventricular block, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature beats, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, symptomatic and non-symptomatic angina pectoris, Prinzmetal vasospastic variant angina, acute (non-fatal and fatal) incidents of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac arrest, in-bed sudden death syndrome of type-1 diabetes, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and heart failure; vascular and circulatory system ones of hypertension, acute orthostatic postprandial, micturition, and defecation hypotension/syncope, intermittent claudication, venous insufficiency, standing occupation leg edema, arterial and venous branch occlusion of the eye, menopausal hot flash, sickle cell syndrome, abdominal, aortic, and thoracic dissections, pulmonary thromboembolism, and deep venous thrombosis, and cerebrovascular transient ischemic attack and hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Knowledge of these temporal patterns not only helps guide patient care but research of their underlying endogenous mechanisms, i.e., circadian and others, and external triggers plus informs the development and application of effective chronopreventive and chronotherapeutic strategies.

N2  - Reflex epilepsies (REs) are identified as epileptic seizures that are consistently induced by identifiable and objective-specific triggers, which may be an afferent stimulus or by the patient’s own activity. RE may have different subtypes depending on the stimulus characteristic. There are significant clinical and electrophysiologic differences between different RE types. Visual stimuli-sensitive or photosensitive epilepsies constitute a large proportion of the RE and are mainly related to genetic causes. Reflex epilepsies may present with focal or generalized seizures due to specific triggers, and sometimes seizures may occur spontaneously. The stimuli can be external (light flashes, hot water), internal (emotion, thinking), or both and should be distinguished from triggering precipitants, which most epileptic patients could report such as emotional stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol, and menstrual cycle. Different genetic and acquired factors may play a role in etiology of RE. This review will provide a current overview of the triggering factors and management of reflex seizures.

N2  - Background: Cognitive problems such as forgetfulness, concentration difficulty, and inattention are commonly reported among women in or around the menopause transition. However, objective neurocognitive data do not consistently corroborate subjective cognitive complaints, nor do they effectively distinguish women in different reproductive stages. Further assessments must be conducted to determine the specific cognitive changes occurring around the menopause transition in comparison to other reproductive stages (e.g., late postmenopause). Furthermore, non-pharmacological methods for addressing reported cognitive difficulties should be explored. Aims: The primary study aim (Aim 1) was to evaluate cross-sectional differences in subjective and objective cognitive function among women in perimenopause (irregular menstruation to 1 year after the final menstrual period), early postmenopause (1-5 years after the final menstrual period) and late menopause (> 5 years after the final menstrual period). The secondary aim (Aim 2) was to compare changes in cognitive function and physical activity among women who completed a six-month physical activity intervention. Hypotheses: It was hypothesized that women in perimenopause would score lower on tests of attention and working memory than women in postmenopause. It was also hypothesized that increases in physical activity would be significantly associated with improvements on attention and working memory tasks. Procedure: Forty-five women age 40 to 63 (mean age = 53.6 years) were recruited for a six-month, group-based intervention designed to help midlife women increase sustained aerobic activity. Neurocognitive and physical activity assessments occurred at baseline and 6 months. Participants were given weekly exercise prescriptions, gradually working toward 250 minutes of MVPA per week. Measures: The following neurocognitive domains were evaluated using clinician-administered tests: Global cognition (MoCA) and intelligence (WTAR), attention and working memory (Letter N-Back computer test; Digit Span), verbal learning and memory (Selective Reminding Test), verbal fluency (COWA), and executive function (Trails A and B). Physical activity was quantified by seven-day ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer readings. Statistical Analyses: Regression and ANOVA tests were performed (using the GLM procedure in SPSS), in addition to Pearson's r correlations. Results: At baseline, women in early postmenopause showed significantly worse verbal memory performance than women in perimenopause or late postmenopause (p < .05), controlling for age, mood, and sleep quality. At six months, women in early postmenopause showed significantly greater improvement in verbal memory than women in perimenopause (p = .048). Reproductive stage also significantly predicted changes in verbal fluency after controlling for covariates. Self-reported improvement in concentration was also significantly associated with improved verbal fluency scores at 6 months (p = .004). While physical activity was not significantly associated with changes in neurocognitive function at 6 months in the full sample, increases in light activity were associated with improvements in verbal fluency among women in perimenopause. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the early postmenopause stage is a period of cognitive vulnerability, specifically with respect to verbal memory. While sustained aerobic activity did not have a clear impact on neurocognitive function in this participant sample, women in the menopause transition may find benefit from light activity. Women should be informed of the possibility of cognitive disruption after menopause, and effective behavioral methods for managing verbal difficulties should be identified.

N2  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at 28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200–600 lux and night was 5–30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36–44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants.

N2  - Study Objectives: In adults, wakefulness can be markedly prolonged at the expense of sleep, e.g. to stay vigilant in the presence of a stressor. These extra-long wake bouts result in a heavy-tailed distribution (highly right-skewed) of wake but not sleep durations. In infants, the relative importance of wakefulness and sleep are reversed, as sleep is necessary for brain maturation. Here, we tested whether these developmental pressures are associated with the unique regulation of sleep–wake states. Methods: In 175 infants of 28–40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), we monitored sleep–wake states using electroencephalography and behavior. We constructed survival models of sleep–wake bout durations and the effect of PMA and other factors, including stress (salivary cortisol), and examined whether sleep is resilient to nociceptive perturbations (a clinically necessary heel lance). Results: Wake durations followed a heavy-tailed distribution as in adults and lengthened with PMA and stress. However, differently from adults, active sleep durations also had a heavy-tailed distribution, and with PMA, these shortened and became vulnerable to nociception-associated awakenings. Conclusions: Sleep bouts are differently regulated in infants, with especially long active sleep durations that could consolidate this state’s maturational functions. Curtailment of sleep by stress and nociception may be disadvantageous, especially for preterm infants given the limited value of wakefulness at this age. This could be addressed by environmental interventions in the future. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To examine the occurrence of menstrually-entrained mood cycling in women with treated bipolar disorder as compared to healthy controls, and to explore whether there is a specific effect of lamotrigine in dampening menstrually-entrained cyclicity of mood. Methods: Observational comparison study of daily self-ratings of mood, sleep, and insomnia obtained over a mean of four menstrual cycles in 42 women with bipolar disorder taking lamotrigine as part of their treatment, 30 women with bipolar disorder receiving mood stabilizing regimens without lamotrigine, and 13 healthy controls, all with physiological menstrual cycles. Additional exploratory analysis of interactions between psychopharmacological regimen and hormonal contraceptive use in the group of women with bipolar disorder, with the addition of 19 women with bipolar disorder who were using hormonal contraceptives. Results: Women treated for bipolar disorder manifested lower average mood, longer average nightly sleep duration, and greater fluctuations in mood and sleep across menstrual cycle phases than healthy controls. Women with bipolar disorder who were taking lamotrigine had less fluctuation in mood both within and across menstrual cycle phases, and were more similar to the control group than to women with bipolar disorder who were not taking lamotrigine in this respect. In addition, medications with GABA-A receptor modulating effects were found to result in improved mood ratings when combined with hormonal contraceptives. Conclusions: Menstrually-entrained mood fluctuation is present in women treated for bipolar disorder to a greater degree than in healthy controls. Lamotrigine may be of use in mitigating this fluctuation. GABA-A receptor modulators in general may act synergistically with hormonal contraceptives to enhance mood in women with bipolar disorder; this hypothesis merits further study.

N2  - Aims and objectives: To evaluate sexual dysfunction and the factors that affect sexual dysfunction in women with chronic disease. Background: Sexual dysfunction is one of the most common problems in women with chronic disease. There is limited understanding of the related factors of sexual dysfunction in women with chronic disease, with research currently limited to other problems and problems related to chronic diseases. Design: This research was conducted as a descriptive survey. Methods: This study involved 100 female inpatients at clinics of internal medicine of a university hospital. Data were collected with a patients identification form and a female sexual function index (KCFI). Kruskal–Wallis test, test of significance of difference between two means and test of significance of difference between two pairs were used in the data analysis. Results: Sixty‐five percentage of women in the sample were defined to have sexual dysfunction. The majority of women expressed pain during sexual intercourse, problems in orgasm and satisfaction, and reluctance to have sex. Older age, being unemployed, being in menopause, fatigue, sleep disorder, and pain and weakness in extremities were the factors that were found to significantly affect the prevalence of sexual dysfunction (p < 0·05). Conclusions: This study concluded that sexual function of women with chronic disease is affected negatively. Chronic disease–related symptoms, experienced changes in the body and psychosocial problems are changing the lives of women. Ultimately, these changes also affect sexual activity. Relevance to clinical practice: Determination of the factors affecting sexual activity in women with chronic disease is important for women' ability to cope with sexual dysfunction and keep it under control. To be able to accomplish this, it is necessary for healthcare personnel, the partners and family to work together. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Many women experience emotional or physical side effects when taking oral contraceptives (OCs). Despite the potential impact on women's health and well-being, there are no valid methods to screen women for their risk of OC side effects. The present paper presents the results of two studies where anthropometric indicators of androgen exposure, 2D:4D and middle-phalangeal hair, were examined for their potential as predictors of OC side effects. In study 1, 2D:4D was associated with women's reports of a history of: (a) negative mood side effects; (b) discontinuation due to negative mood side effects; (c) specific mood side effects (i.e., crying, sadness, and altered trust in one's partners) and (d) specific physical side effects (i.e., headaches, fatigue, and decreased sex drive). In study 2, 2D:4D and/or middle-phalangeal hair was/were associated with a reported history of: (a) discontinuation due to negative mood side effects; (b) specific mood-related side effects (i.e., negative mood, disrupted sleep, increased aggression, and altered trust in one's partner) and (c) specific physical side effects (i.e., headaches, decreased menstrual cramps, and increased sex drive/arousal). The general pattern was that adverse OC side effects were experienced by women with lower 2D:4D and fewer middle-phalangeal hairs. Almost all relationships remained significant when response bias was controlled. These results suggest a possible role for prenatal testosterone exposure and both androgen action and sensitivity in women's experience of OC side effects. Furthermore, these two digit measures may be useful predictors of hormonal contraceptive side effects in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: This follow-up study aimed to evaluate risk factors for menopausal sleep disturbances already identifiable before menopause. Methods: At baseline, all 81 women were premenopausal. At year-five follow-up, 27 of the women were premenopausal, 40 postmenopausal, and 14 postmenopausal and using hormone therapy. We used the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire to study sleep; additional questionnaires evaluated risk factors for sleep impairment. Results: Sleep quality differed only marginally between the groups. The following baseline variables were associated with impaired sleep quality at follow-up: depressive symptoms increased the risk of nocturnal awakenings (OR 1.16 (95%CI 1.02–1.32), p = 0.025), morning tiredness (OR 1.22 (95%CI 1.06–1.40), p = 0.007), daytime tiredness (OR 1.24 (95%CI 1.06–1.44), p = 0.007) and propensity to fall asleep during work or leisure time (OR 1.18 (95%CI 1.01–1.37), p = 0.036). Personal crises increased the risk of longer sleep latency (OR 5.46 (95%CI 1.13–26.32), p = 0.035) and of propensity to fall asleep when not active (OR 5.41 (95%CI 1.42–20.83), p = 0.014). Use of medications affecting the CNS increased the risk of worse general sleep quality (OR 11.44 (95% CI 1.07–121.79), p = 0.044). Perceived impaired general health (OR 2.87 (95%CI 1.04–7.94), p = 0.043) and frequent night sweats (OR 10.50 (95%CI 2.25–49.01), p = 0.003) increased the risk of difficulty falling asleep. Conclusions: Various premenopausal health-related factors seem to predict poor sleep in menopausal transition. Menopause itself appears to have only minor effects. Thus, it is essential to identify high-risk women to allow timely interventions that may prevent the development of sleep disturbances at menopause.

N2  - Purpose: Fatigue and disrupted sleep often coexist and both are prominent clinical problems in cancer affecting quality of life. Disrupted sleep patterns are likely related to cancer-related fatigue. The relationship needs further investigation. This study aimed to characterize and compare disrupted sleep patterns in fatigued breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with postmenopausal women without a history of cancer. Anxiety levels were also examined. Methods: Data for this secondary analysis came from two studies. Global sleep quality and state anxiety were self-reported by 30 fatigued female breast cancer chemotherapy outpatients and 32 non-cancer postmenopausal women using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Results: Fatigued breast cancer patients showed significant sleep difficulties, characterized by prolonged sleep onset latency (M = 54.3, SD=49.2min) and frequent nighttime awakenings, despite 40% of the patients using sleep medications three or more times a week. Compared to the non-cancer comparison group, fatigued patients reported significantly longer sleep latency (p = 0.041), more use of sleep medications (p = 0.006), and higher total PSQI scores (p = 0.005). State anxiety levels did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.88). Conclusions: Sleep is disrupted in fatigued breast cancer women undergoing chemotherapy. Nearly all fatigued patients (97%) had trouble sleeping (global PSQI scores>5), indicating significant difficulties in overall sleep quality among those patients. Knowledge of the nature of sleep disruption among cancer patients may contribute to CRF symptom management leading to tailored interventions designed to improve sleep quality in cancer patients thereby managing fatigue and improving quality of life.

N2  - We assessed daytime sleepiness using objective and subjective measures in women with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) compared with women without significant premenstrual symptoms. Nine women with severe PMS and eight controls (aged 18−40 years) completed a laboratory-based daytime protocol including the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), quantitative waking electroencephalogram (EEG), auditory and visual event-related potentials (ERPs), and sleepiness and mood scales during the mid-follicular and late-luteal (premenstrual) phases of the menstrual cycle. In association with increased perceived sleepiness, fatigue and other premenstrual symptoms in the late-luteal phase, women with PMS performed more poorly on the PVT, with increased lapses and slower reaction times (P < 0.05), compared with the follicular phase and controls. However, there were no significant group or menstrual phase differences in latency to sleep on the MWT. Waking spectral EEG power and ERP measures also did not differentiate PMS women when symptomatic. Both groups of women displayed increased spectral power in the delta/theta frequencies (2−6 Hz) and fast alpha frequency (11−12 Hz) in the late-luteal phase relative to the follicular phase. Trait-like differences were apparent in that women with PMS had increased beta1 (12−16 Hz) power and smaller P300 amplitude than controls in both menstrual cycle phases. Our findings indicate that women with severe PMS are subjectively sleepy and fatigued, and show psychomotor slowing when symptomatic compared with when they are symptom-free and compared with controls. However, the ability to maintain wakefulness under soporific conditions, spectral properties of waking EEG and cognitive processing do not vary in synchrony with premenstrual symptoms.

N2  - A well-defined season of sexual rest controlled by photoperiod is observed in female sheep and goats during spring and summer, delineating their “anestrous season”; bucks also decrease sexual activity at about the same time. Nutrition and/or socio-sexual stimuli play only secondary roles. However, the presence of sexually active males can reduce the length of seasonal anestrus. Whether it can also completely suppress anestrus has not been investigated. Here we tested this in goats in 3 experiments, using bucks rendered sexually active out of season by exposure to long days. The continuous presence of these males prevented goats to display seasonal anestrus: 12/14 females cycled the year round, vs. 0/13 and 0/11 for females with un-treated bucks or without bucks (experiment 1). When active bucks were removed, females immediately entered anestrus (7/7 stopped ovulating vs. 1/7 if maintained with active bucks; experiment 2). Finally, 7/7 anestrous does with bucks in sexual rest since 1.5 months commenced cycling rapidly during mid-anestrous, when these bucks became sexually active following a treatment with artificial long days, vs. 0/7 with un-treated bucks or no bucks (experiment 3). The presence/withdrawal of active bucks had a highly significant effect in the three experiments (P ≤ 0.002). Therefore, the presence of a mating opportunity can completely override the photoperiodic inhibition of reproduction of females throughout the anestrous season. Results suggest that we must re-evaluate the relative contributions of photoperiod vs. other external cues in controlling seasonal reproduction, thus offering new non-pharmaceutical ways for controlling out-of-season reproduction in small ruminants.

N2  - Menopause is a period in which women stop menstruating and experience changes in their body that mark the end of their reproductive period. We noted that symptoms are not the same in all women. There are some biological and socioeconomic factors that affect the form and appearance of symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, hot flashes, sleep disorder, incontinence, and sexual difficulties. We must state that these symptoms do not affect all women, and they do not affect them to the same degree. We explained variables that have been related to a greater risk and greater protection; for example, it has been found that attitude or belief about the menopause is an important factor related to this experience. Nowadays, this cycle in the lives of women is an issue of concern for those who suffer from it and for the scientific community. The principal treatments for these symptoms are reviewed in this chapter to explain the principal findings found in the literature. In conclusion, there are some types of treatments that have been proven effective and should be included, such as coadjuvant treatment to improve the quality of life of women with these problems. Hence, multidisciplinary and preventive treatment could be the key. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  -  Objective/Background This pilot study explored the efficacy of a novel forehead cooling device for perceived sleep difficulties and hot flashes in menopausal-age women. Participants 20 women (55.1 ± 4.2 years; 19 post-menopausal) with insomnia symptoms and self-reported two or more hot flashes per day. Methods Participants completed daily assessments of sleep and hot flashes (via diaries) across 1 baseline week and 4 weeks of open-label, in-home, nightly treatment with a forehead cooling device (15–18°C) along with sleep hygiene instructions. They also completed ratings of insomnia and menopausal symptoms using standardized questionnaires. Results Women reported reductions in sleep onset latency (SOL), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), and nocturnal hot flash severity during the first week of treatment (SOL: 25.7 ± 18.4 min; WASO: 36.3 ± 27.3 min; hot flash severity: 3.0 ± 2.8) compared with baseline (SOL: 38 ± 26.3 min; WASO: 52.2 ± 35.6 min; hot flash severity: 6.8 ± 3.7), with further improvements after 2–4 weeks of use (p < .001). There were also clinically meaningful reductions in insomnia severity and hot flash-related daily interference and lower psychological and physical symptom scores on the Greene climacteric scale after treatment (all p’s<0.001). Conclusions This exploratory, naturalistic, pilot study shows that nightly use of a forehead cooling device produces improvements in self-reported sleep and reductions in insomnia, hot flash, and other menopausal, symptoms. Controlled studies are warranted to determine the role of this therapy in the management of sleep difficulties and menopausal symptoms in women. Further mechanistic studies are needed to understand the physiological impact of forehead cooling on sleep and menopausal symptoms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Climacteric symptoms such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness are very common in breast cancer patients, resulting either from age or adjuvant therapy. Tibolone, a synthetic steroid, is effective in reducing these symptoms in healthy post-menopausal women, but this has never been studied in a large breast cancer population. Objectives: The primary objective of LIBERATE trial was to study safety of tibolone 2.5mg daily versus placebo as primary, in symptomatic breast cancer survivors. The aim of this present paper was to report effects of tibolone on climacteric symptoms, vaginal dryness and health-related quality of life in the study population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, n. NCT00408863. Methods: The trial was conducted between June 2002 and July 2007. Concerning quality of life variables, a daily Diary Cards during the first three months and the Climacteric Symptoms Form and at each visit were used to register frequency and intensity of hot flushes. Mean vaginal dryness scores were calculated on the basis of individual ratings at baseline and at week 104. A subset of patients assessed their quality of life filling in the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Results: Of the 3148 women recruited, 3133 received trial medication (1575 in the tibolone group and 1558 in the placebo group). The median duration of treatment was 2.75 years. In total 3098 women (1556 on tibolone, 1542 on placebo) were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population for efficacy analysis. Data on vaginal dryness are available for 2144 patients and 883 women (438 on tibolone, 445 on placebo) answered to WHQ. The mean change in number of hot flushes per day was 2.74 (43.1%) in the tibolone group and −1.77 (−27.5%) in the placebo group (p = 0.0006). Vaginal dryness score improved at week 104 in the tibolone group as compared to placebo (−0.46 versus −0.29, respectively; p < 0.0001). Across the assessments up to two years with WHQ, tibolone was more effective than placebo in improving sexual health, sleep quality and mood domains. Women using tamoxifen showed less improvement in climacteric symptoms with tibolone, than women only receiving tibolone without any adjuvant therapy. Conclusion: The results of the LIBERATE trial show that tibolone is effective in symptomatic breast cancer patients and improves their quality of life. However, this finding should be judged within the context of the main outcome of the trial, showing that tibolone increases the risk of recurrence. The use of tibolone in women with breast cancer will remain contraindicated and any off-label use incurs a now proven risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized as a distressing experience to the female partner, but a causal association remains controversial. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence supports a relationship of distress and sleep disruptions with musculoskeletal pain, also prevalent in middle-aged women. To test the hypothesis that sharing a bed with an OSA man may contribute to manifestations of distress and impaired sleep, we conducted a case-control study of 17 OSA wives and 17 wives of healthy sleepers. Methods: Clinical outcome variables were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and visual analog scales (VAS), tender point (TP) count and algometric index. Sleep outcome parameters were VAS scores for sleep quality and polysomnographic (PSG) parameters. Secondary outcomes were VAS scores for distress and marital relationship and coping strategies adopted by OSA wives. Clinical assessment and PSG scoring were conducted blindly. Results: After controlling for age and menopausal status, OSA wives exhibited lower sleep quality and higher distress scores than controls (p < 0.05, all). Increase in pain threshold (TP count and algometric index) and in FIQ score were also observed, and in their PSG, there was an increase in awaken period and stage 1 amount during sleep, as well as in alpha power during slow wave sleep (p < 0.05, all). These sleep parameters had substantial correlation with tiredness and poor sleep quality and were moderately correlated to pain assessments and distress scores. Conclusion: Thus, independently of age and menopausal status of the group, wives of OSA patients exhibited an increase in pain threshold, distress and impaired sleep in comparison to controls.

N2  - The pattern of secretion of many hormones, including prolactin, is dependent on the circadian rhythm. Night shift work involves exposure to artificial light at night and sleep deficiency, which in turn can affect prolactin synthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between night shift work characteristics, sleep quality, lifestyle factors and prolactin concentration, using data from a cross-sectional study of nurses and midwives. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 327 nurses and midwives currently working on rotating night shifts, and 330 nurses and midwives working during the day (aged 40–60 years) (388 premenopausal and 269 postmenopausal). Information about night shift work characteristics, lifestyle, reproductive factors, sleep pattern and other covariates was collected through a face-to-face interview, and from a one-week work and sleep diary completed by the subjects. Weight and height were measured. Prolactin concentration was measured in the morning blood sample using the electrochemiluminesence immunoassay method. Associations were analyzed using linear regression models adjusted for important confounders. Analyses were carried out separately in pre- and postmenopausal women. None of the night shift work or sleep characteristics was significantly associated with prolactin concentration. Prolactin concentration was significantly (p < 0.05) inversely associated with smoking and time of blood sample collection. These results were consistent among both pre- and postmenopausal women. Nulliparity was significantly positively associated with prolactin among premenopausal women, but inversely among postmenopausal. Age was related to prolactin among postmenopausal women only. Our study indicates that rotating night shift work is not associated with prolactin concentration. Smoking, parity, time of blood collection and age among postmenopausal women were significant determinants of prolactin. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Migraine attacks have a seasonal, menstrual and circadian periodicity, suggesting a role of chronobio-logical mechanisms probably related to a hypothalamic involvement. The aim of the study was to evaluate the chronotypes in patients with menstrual migraine, a migraine sub-type with a cyclical recurrence compared to normal female. Ninety-three patients with ICHD-II diagnosis of pure menstrual migraine and menstrually-related migraine were recruited and compared to 85 age-matched healthy women. The Italian version of Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire was administered to identify circadian preference of our participants. No differences were found regarding the distribution of chronotypes in patients with menstrual migraine and healthy controls. The study did not confirm the presence of a morning and evening preference among migraineurs as previously reported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Women taking tamoxifen experience hot flashes and night sweats (HF&NS); acupuncture may offer a nonpharmaceutical method of management. This study explored whether traditional acupuncture (TA) could reduce HF&NS frequency, improve physical and emotional well-being, and improve perceptions of HF&NS. Design/settings/location: This was a single-arm observational study using before and after measurements, located in a National Health Service cancer treatment center in southern England. Subjects: Fifty (50) participants with early breast cancer completed eight TA treatments. Eligible women were ≥35 years old, ≥6 months post active cancer treatment, taking tamoxifen ≥6 months, and self-reporting ≥4 HF&NS incidents/24 hours for ≥3 months. Interventions: Participants received weekly individualized TA treatment using a core standardized protocol for treating HF&NS in natural menopause. Outcome measures: Hot Flash Diaries recorded HF&NS frequency over 14-day periods; the Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ) assessed physical and emotional well-being; the Hot Flashes and Night Sweats Questionnaire (HFNSQ) assessed HF&NS as a problem. Measurements taken at five points over 30 weeks included baseline, midtreatment, end of treatment (EOT), and 4 and 18 weeks after EOT. Results for the primary outcome: Mean frequency reduced by 49.8% (95% confidence interval 40.5–56.5, pn = 48) at EOT over baseline. Trends indicated longer-term effects at 4 and 18 weeks after EOT. At EOT, seven WHQ domains showed significant statistical and clinical improvements, including Anxiety/Fears, Memory/Concentration, Menstrual Problems, Sexual Behavior, Sleep Problems, Somatic Symptoms, and Vasomotor Symptoms. Perceptions of HF&NS as a problem reduced by 2.2 points (standard deviation = 2.15, n = 48, t = 7.16, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: These results compare favorably with other studies using acupuncture to manage HF&NS, as well as research on nonhormonal pharmaceutical treatments. In addition to reduced HF&NS frequency, women enjoyed improved physical and emotional well-being, and few side-effects were reported. Further research is warranted into this approach, which offers breast cancer survivors choice in managing a chronic condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - It has long been known that time-of-day information is required for successful initiation of the ovulation-triggering luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. This is true in rodents and evidence suggests it is true in humans too. LH release is driven by neural release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from GnRH neurons in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, and these neurons represent the last neuronal control point in the brain's decision to ovulate for all vertebrates. Time of day, or circadian, information is centrally regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, also in the hypothalamus. How information from the SCN reaches the GnRH neurons was not known. Female rats are similar to humans in both relevant neurological structure and behavioral and physiological responses to circadian challenges. Using female rats as a model system, I provide evidence here that the suprachiasmatic nucleus times ovulation indirectly through projections from the dorsomedial (dm) SCN to the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), wherein kisspeptin-producing neurons integrate this circadian information with estrodiol levels. I further show evidence suggesting that the AVPV is a peripheral circadian oscillator entrained by the dmSCN, and that circadian phase within the AVPV drives its receptivity to vasopressin – the primary neuropeptide transmitter released from the dmSCN. If both hormonal (estradiol) and daily cycles are in the right phase, then kisspeptin neurons stimulate GnRH neurons to trigger the LH surge. Kisspeptin is the strongest known driver of GnRH neuronal excitation, but I demonstrate that GnRH cells still exert some kisspeptin-independent control over the shape of the LH surge by integrating information coded by the ventrolateral SCN, which influences the amplitude of the LH surge in a phase-dependant manner.

N2  - In the early-twenty-first century, extended cycle oral contraception (ECOC) became available by physician prescription in North America. Researchers speculate that this drug, with its capacity to reduce or eliminate menstrual bleeding, may shift not only women's biological processes but also their experiences of menstruation. In this paper, I discuss women's experiences of menstrual suppression drawing on findings from a qualitative study conducted before ECOC was available, and examine these findings against recently published research on menstrual suppression in an ECOC era. Findings suggest that the body as a natural entity figures strongly in women's discourses on suppression. They further suggest that suppression is a contingent, paradoxical and practical achievement, not a securely or fully realised embodied state. This paper reads women's accounts of menstrual suppression prior to ECOC as a challenge to the modern artifice of a mind/body split, and questions whether this challenge is perhaps made less discernible in an ECOC era, where attention may no longer be paid to the daily practices of menstrual suppression. Hence, a case is made for the varied political effects of ongoing non-menstruation versus event-specific practices of non-menstruation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Studies on menopause-related quality of life (QoL), especially using the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS), in Asian women are scarce. This study surveyed menopausal symptoms in a convenience sample of 442 Chinese women aged 40–60 years who attended the Well-Women Clinic, Macau, China, in a public health center. The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, the MRS, and a novel question on which area of QoL was affected. The average age of the participants was 49.2 ± 5.08 years, and 98.9% of them reported experiencing menopausal symptoms. The four most prevalent menopausal symptoms were physical and mental exhaustion (90.3%), joint and muscle discomfort (88.5%), irritability (78.1%), and sleep problems (77.1%). The average MRS score was 14.2 ± 8.80. A severe MRS score (≥ 17) was found in 35.5% of participants. Severe scores in the psychological, somatic, and urogenital MRS subscales were found in 17.9%, 42.8%, and 34.8%, of women, respectively. Menopausal symptoms affected QoL in 57.2% of women: daily life in 36.7%, work in 29.2%, sexual life in 17.0%, and relationship with husband in 13.8%. Daily life was significantly affected by hot flushes and joint/muscular discomfort; work was reportedly affected by irritability and exhaustion; sexual life was reported to be affected by hot flushes, sexual problems, and vaginal dryness, and relationship with husband was affected by sexual problems. We concluded that menopausal symptoms were highly prevalent among midlife Chinese women and often affected their QoL. The MRS, however, did not have a high sensitivity in detecting impaired QoL.

N2  - The current growth of the older population is unprecedented in U.S. history. Chronic disease and functional limitation commonly develop prior to old age, leading to prolonged physical disability and decreased well-being. The development of chronic disease and loss of independence is associated with lean body mass (LBM) loss and fat mass gain beginning in middle age. Therefore, it is important to identify modifiable factors to mitigate deleterious shifts in body composition to promote successful aging (SA). The concept of SA is associated with longevity, the absence of disease and disability, and subjective components of well-being, however, an operational definition has yet to be established. For this thesis, we defined SA as low cardiometabolic risk, preservation of physical function, and a positive state of well-being. Nutrition is a key driver of SA and is a proposed modulator of cardiometabolic risk, physical function, and well-being in adults. Among nutrients, several studies have identified dietary protein and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3), as key supportive nutrients for SA in older adults. Therefore, the overall objective of this dissertation was to determine the effect of nutrition, specifically dietary protein and n-3 PUFAs on SA outcomes of cardiometabolic risk, physical function, and well-being. The central hypothesis of this dissertation was that increased intake of high-quality dietary protein or n-3 PUFAs would improve SA outcomes of cardiometabolic risk, physical function, and well-being in adults. Therefore, one meta-analysis (study 1) and two clinical trials (studies 2 and 3) were designed to test our hypothesis. The objective of the first study was to systematically evaluate the available evidence of randomized control trials assessing the effect of beef and beef's nutrients on well-being in healthy, adults ≥ 50 years of age to increase physical function and well-being to promote SA. The objective of the second study was to determine and compare the acute effects of a high-protein breakfast containing either animal protein or plant protein on appetite, food intake, energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation in young versus older men to decrease cardiometabolic risk and promote SA. The objective of the third study was to determine the individual and combined effect of protein and n-3 PUFAs on body composition, cardiometabolic risk, indexes of sleep, and mood states in postmenopausal women to decrease cardiometabolic risk and increase physical function, and well-being to promote SA. Collectively, the results suggest high-quality protein and n-3 PUFAs act as potential regulators of SA outcomes. However, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of protein and n-3 PUFA-based nutrition strategies to promote SA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This trial compared the effects of lavender and bitter orange on sleep quality in postmenopausal women. This trial was conducted in 2015. Eligible postmenopausal women were allocated into one of two intervention groups or a control group (n = 52 per group) in a 1:1:1 ratio using a randomized block design. Intervention groups received 500 mg capsules containing only bitter orange or lavender flower powder, and the control group received 500 mg capsules containing starch. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory was used before and eight weeks after starting the intervention. Data analyses were based on intention to treat. A one-way ANOVA showed a slightly significant difference in mean sleep score among the three groups before the intervention (p = .045). The general linear model, adjusted for baseline sleep score and confounding factors, showed significant differences among the groups in the mean sleep score after eight weeks of treatment (p pp = .003, respectively). The positive effect of bitter orange and lavender on sleep quality in postmenopausal women suggests that they can be used to improve sleep quality in such women.

The intervention included 2 weeks of nighttime use of a warming/cooling device worn on the wrist and was compared to a 2-week baseline period (no device). All participants completed questionnaires at the end of each 2-week period, including the Insomnia Severity Index, the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment scales, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale.Results: The intervention resulted in a reduction in sleep onset latency, as well as an increase in nighttime sleep. There was a significant improvement of scores on the Insomnia Severity Index, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment scales, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Significantly fewer women reported that hot flashes interfered with their sleep (90% vs 70%) and more perceived control over the degree of sleep disruption due to nighttime hot flashes while using the device (5% vs 49%). The majority reported a positive experience, with two-thirds reporting that the device improved their thermal comfort and ability to return to sleep after a night waking.Conclusions: Overall, a thermal comfort intervention may offer sleep benefits for women who experience disruptive nighttime hot flashes, particularly in terms of falling asleep at bedtime and subjective perception of control over nighttime hot flash sleep interference.

N2  - In spontaneously ovulating rodent species, the timing of the luteinising hormone (LH) surge is controlled by the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN initiates the LH surge via the coordinated control of two opposing neuropeptidergic systems that lie upstream of the gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal system: the stimulatory peptide, kisspeptin, and the inhibitory peptide, RFamide‐related peptide‐3 (RFRP‐3; the mammalian orthologue of avian gonadotrophin‐inhibitory hormone [GnIH]). We have previously shown that the GnRH system exhibits time‐dependent sensitivity to kisspeptin stimulation, further contributing to the precise timing of the LH surge. To examine whether this time‐dependent sensitivity of the GnRH system is unique to kisspeptin or a more common mechanism of regulatory control, we explored daily changes in the response of the GnRH system to RFRP‐3 inhibition. Female Syrian hamsters were ovariectomised to eliminate oestradiol (E₂)‐negative‐feedback and RFRP‐3 or saline was centrally administered in the morning or late afternoon. LH concentrations and Lhβ mRNA expression did not differ between morning RFRP‐3‐and saline‐treated groups, although they were markedly suppressed by RFRP‐3 administration in the afternoon. However, RFRP‐3 inhibition of circulating LH at the time of the surge does not appear to act via the GnRH system because no differences in medial preoptic area Gnrh or RFRP‐3 receptor Gpr147 mRNA expression were observed. Rather, RFRP‐3 suppressed arcuate nucleus Kiss1 mRNA expression and potentially impacted pituitary gonadotrophs directly. Taken together, these findings reveal time‐dependent responsiveness of the reproductive axis to RFRP‐3 inhibition, possibly via variation in the sensitivity of arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurones to this neuropeptide.

N2  - The female reproductive cycle is gated by the circadian timing system and may be vulnerable to disruptions in the circadian system. Prior work suggests that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are one pathway by which the circadian clock can influence the estrous cycle, but the impact of the loss of this peptide on reproduction has not been assessed. In the present study, we first examine the impact of the genetic loss of the neuropeptide VIP on the reproductive success of female mice. Significantly, mutant females produce about half the offspring of their wild-type sisters even when mated to the same males. We also find that VIP-deficient females exhibit a disrupted estrous cycle; that is, ovulation occurs less frequently and results in the release of fewer oocytes compared with controls. Circadian rhythms of wheel-running activity are disrupted in the female mutant mice, as is the spontaneous electrical activity of dorsal SCN neurons. On a molecular level, the VIP-deficient SCN tissue exhibits lower amplitude oscillations with altered phase relationships between the SCN and peripheral oscillators as measured by PER2-driven bioluminescence. The simplest explanation of our data is that the loss of VIP results in a weakened SCN oscillator, which reduces the synchronization of the female circadian system. These results clarify one of the mechanisms by which disruption of the circadian system reduces female reproductive success. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Loss of ovarian function in women is associated with sleep disturbances and cognitive decline, which suggest a key role for estrogens and/or progestins in modulating these symptoms. The effects of ovarian hormones on sleep and cognitive processes have been studied in separate research fields that seldom intersect. However, sleep has a considerable impact on cognitive function. Given the tight connections between sleep and cognition, ovarian hormones may influence selective aspects of cognition indirectly, via the modulation of sleep. In support of this hypothesis, a growing body of evidence indicates that the development of sleep disorders following menopause contributes to accelerated cognitive decline and dementia in older women. This paper draws from both the animal and human literature to present an integrated view of the effects of ovarian hormones on sleep and cognition across the adult female lifespan.

N2  - Males and females can respond differentially to the same environmental stimuli and experimental conditions. Chronic sleep loss is a frequent and growing problem in many modern societies and has a broad variety of negative outcomes for health and well-being. While much has been done to explore the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on cognition in both human and animal studies over the last few decades, very little attention has been paid to the part played by sex differences and gonadal steroids in respect of changes in cognitive functions caused by sleep loss. The effects of gonadal hormones on sleep regulation and cognitive performances are well established. Reduced gonadal function in menopausal women and elderly men is associated with sleep disturbances and cognitive decline as well as dementia, which suggests that sex steroids play a key role in modulating these conditions. Finding out whether there are sex differences in respect of the effect of insufficient sleep on cognition, and how neuroendocrine mediators influence cognitive impairment induced by SD could provide valuable insights into the best therapies for each sex. In this review, we aim to highlight the involvement of sex differences and gonadal hormone status on the severity of cognitive deficits induced by sleep deficiency in both human and animal studies.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the features of sleep disorders in europeoid and mongoloid women in different phases of the climacteric period. Materials and methods: A total of 542 women in the climacteric period at age 45–60 years were studied: 342 were of the europeoid race (ethnic group—Russian) and 200 were of the mongoloid race (ethnic group—Buryats). All women underwent examination by a gynecologist, with general clinical assessment and analysis of medical records. Diagnoses of insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) were made in accordance with questionnaire results using specialist somnology questionnaires and polysomnographic monitoring. Results and conclusions: The prevalence of sleep disorders in Russian women in the perimenopausal period was 61.2%, compared with 65.5% in the postmenopausal period; among Buryats, 63.5% had sleep disorders in the perimenopausal period and 72.9% in the postmenopausal period. The structure of sleep disorders in Russian women in the perimenopause period was dominated by difficulty in going to sleep (69.4%) and morning waking (63.5%), while in the menopause the structure consisted mainly of frequent nocturnal waking (83.5%) and OSAS (48.9%). In Buryats, the structure of sleep disorders was independent of the phase of the climacteric, with complaints most frequently consisting of nocturnal waking (69.5% in the perimenopause and 76.9% in the postmenopausal period). Interethnic differences in complaints of sleep disorders were seen only in the perimenopausal period. The sleep pattern demonstrated decreases in measures of sleep effectiveness and changes in the content of rapid eye movement sleep in women of the Buryat ethnic group as compared with members of the Russian ethnic group. furthermore, ethnic Buryat women had a higher index of apnea/hypopnea and a lower mean oxygensaturation. Thus, formation of sleep disorders in women in different phases of the climacteric period has ethnogenetic characteristics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Despite research indicating that sleep disorders influence reproductive health, the effects of sleep on reproductive hormone concentrations are poorly characterized. We prospectively followed 259 regularly menstruating women across one to two menstrual cycles (the BioCycle Study, 2005–2007), measuring fasting serum hormone concentrations up to eight times per cycle. Women provided information about daily sleep in diaries and chronotype and night/shift work on a baseline questionnaire. We evaluated percent differences in mean hormone concentrations, the magnitude of shifts in the timing and amplitude of hormone peaks, and the risk for sporadic anovulation associated with self-reported sleep patterns and night/shift work. We estimated chronotype scores—categorizing women below and above the interquartile range (IQR) as “morning” and “evening” chronotypes, respectively. For every hour increase in daily sleep duration, mean estradiol concentrations increased by 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0, 5.9%) and luteal phase progesterone by 9.4% (CI 4.0, 15.2%). Receiving less than 7 hours of sleep per day was associated with slightly earlier rises in peak levels for several hormones. Women reporting night/shift work (n = 77) had lower testosterone relative to women employed without night/shift work (percent difference: −9.9%, CI −18.4, −0.4%). Women with morning chronotypes (n = 47) had earlier rises in estradiol during their cycles and potentially an earlier rise in luteinizing hormone. Compared to those who had intermediate chronotypes, women with evening chronotypes (n = 42) had a later luteinizing hormone peak of borderline statistical significance. A reduced risk for sporadic anovulation was suggested, but imprecise, for increasing hours of daily sleep leading up to ovulation (risk ratio 0.79, CI 0.59, 1.06), while an imprecise increased risk was observed for women with morning chronotypes (risk ratio 2.50, CI 0.93, 6.77). Sleep-related hormonal changes may not greatly alter ovarian function in healthy women, but have the potential to influence gynecologic health.

N2  - Background: Sleep disorders among middle-aged women are regarded as a common symptom of menopause or menopausal transition. This study was aimed to investigate factors associated with sleep quality among reproductive age (RA), peri- and post-menopausal women with poor self-reported sleep quality in Taiwan. Methods: 129 women aged 45-60 who self-reported with poor sleep quality and were screened using Chinese version Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (C-PSQI) > 5 points, were recruited from a women health outpatient in one regional teaching hospital in Taipei City. Participants were administered the C-PSQI, Greene Climacteric scale (GCS) and demographic questionnaire. Results: The results of general linear model (GLM) showed that the perimenopausal and postmenopausal women did not show significant difference from RA women for subjective sleep quality measured by C-PSQI, after adjusting for age, educational levels and employment status. However, heavier psychological symptom significantly resulted in worse sleep quality (p < 0.001) under multivariate model analysis. Besides, perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women had significantly longer sleep latency than RA women (26.61 and 27.526 mins, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The health policy authority may need to provide more medical resources for the health promotion of mid-aged women, especially for psychological care, rather than relying solely on reimbursement for episodic care.

N2  - Age and sex are two of the three major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (ApoE-e4 allele is the third), with women having a twofold greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease after the age of 75 years. Sex differences have been shown across a wide range of cognitive skills in young and older adults, and evidence supports a role for sex steroids, especially estradiol, in protecting against the development of cognitive decline in women. Sleep may also be a protective factor against age-related cognitive decline, since specific electrophysiological sleep events (e.g. sleep spindle/slow oscillation coupling) are critical for offline memory consolidation. Furthermore, studies in young women have shown fluctuations in sleep events and sleep-dependent memory consolidation during different phases of the menstrual cycle that are associated with the levels of sex steroids. An under-appreciated possibility is that there may be an important interaction between these two protective factors (sex steroids and sleep) that may play a role in daily fluctuations in cognitive processing, in particular memory, across a woman’s lifespan. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of sex steroid-dependent influences on sleep and cognition across the lifespan in women, with special emphasis on sleep-dependent memory processing. We further indicate gaps in knowledge that require further experimental examination in order to fully appreciate the complex and changing landscape of sex steroids and cognition. Lastly, we propose a series of testable predictions for how sex steroids impact sleep events and sleep-dependent cognition across the three major reproductive stages in women (reproductive years, menopause transition, and post-menopause).

N2  - Presents case reports of three women with perimenopausal depression. The first case is of a 48-year-old teacher who had no past psychiatric history and has two teenage sons and a supportive husband. Over a period of 6 weeks, she became tearful, had poor interrupted sleep, experienced two panic attacks and described feeling ‘foggy’ about routine tasks. She was physically well and described menstrual cycle changes over the past 6 months, with irregular menses. The second case is of a 51-year-old nurse with a 20-year history of depression that had been well-managed with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) until the previous year. She described a significant increase in the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, panic, anger, hostility, memory impairment and poor concentration. She had been treated with two different serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) plus antipsychotic medication. The third case is of a 52-year-old administrative assistant, who described depressed mood, tearfulness, anxiety symptoms and poor sleep for the past 3 years. She had been treated with escitalopram, but felt angry and that her thoughts were racing on this. These symptoms settled 2 weeks after stopping medication, but her experience with this SSRI made her refuse further antidepressant treatment.

N2  - Background: We previously reported no postintervention differences in quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes when comparing 12-month high versus moderate volume of aerobic exercise in postmenopausal women. Here, we report the 24-month follow-up for these outcomes. Methods: At 24-month follow-up, 333 out of 400 postmenopausal women were randomized to a year-long intervention of 150 (moderate) or 300 (high) minutes per week of aerobic exercise returned a battery of self-reported measures assessing quality of life, psychosocial outcomes, and sleep quality, also assessed at baseline and postintervention. Intention-to-treat analyses using linear models were conducted to determine the changes between baseline and 24-month followup. Results: No significant effects between moderate- and high-volume aerobic exercise groups were observed among any outcomes. There was some evidence of effect moderation by baseline body mass index in relation to quality of life, psychosocial outcomes, and sleep quality, where obese women benefitted from the moderate-volume exercise and nonobese women benefitted from the high-volume exercise prescription. Conclusion: Although high-volume aerobic exercise did not improve psychosocial outcomes when compared with moderate volume at the 24-month follow-up, we did observe potential effect of moderation between obese and nonobese women. Confirmation of these interactions is warranted in this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Oestrogen‐stimulated preovulatory gonadotrophin surges are temporally regulated in a way that remains not fully understood. Mammalian ovulation requires surges of gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH), released from specialised neurones in the hypothalamus. Surge regulation is mediated by ovarian oestrogen (17β‐oestradiol; E₂) feedback‐acting as a negative signal until the early afternoon of the pro‐oestrous phase, at which point it stimulates robust increases in GnRH release. Multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for the circadian clock in surge generation, although the presence of endogenous oscillators in several neuronal populations throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus complicates an elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of circadian regulation. In the present study, we propose that endogenous oscillators within GnRH neurones are modulated by oestrogen to elicit GnRH surge secretion. One mechanism by which this may occur is through the up‐regulation of receptors of known stimulators of GnRH, such as kisspeptin’s cognate receptor, GPR54. Through analysis of mRNA and protein abundance patterns, we found that high levels of E₂ elicit circadian expression profiles of GPR54 in vitro, and that disruption of endogenous GnRH oscillators of the clock dampens this effect. Additionally, although kisspeptin administration to GT1‐7 cells does not result in surge‐level secretion, we observed increased GnRH secretion from GT1‐7 cells treated with positive feedback levels of E₂. These results in this in vitro neuronal model system suggest a possible mechanism whereby receptor expression levels, and thus GnRH sensitivity to kisspeptin, may change dramatically over the pro‐oestrous day. In this way, elevated ovarian E₂ may increase kisspeptidergic tone at the same time as increasing GnRH neuronal sensitivity to this neuropeptide for maximal surge release.

N2  - Background: We assessed frequency of vestibular symptoms in Headache Clinic patients over 10 years. Methods: A descriptive study of 5111 consecutive patients with tension-type headache or migraine, analyzed for dizziness/vertigo accompanying headache and for a lifetime history of motion-sickness, cyclic vomiting, recurrent abdominal pain or atopy. Migraine patients were re-grouped as those with vestibular symptoms (dizziness/vertigo or motion sickness) and those without and their data then re-analyzed. Results: There were 1880 migraine patients and 3231 tension-type headache patients. Significantly more migraine patients than tension-type headache patients experienced vestibular symptoms (p p p < 0.0001). Menstruation and reported sleep problems impacted on headaches. While past history of cyclical vomiting, recurrent abdominal pain or atopy was about twice as common in migraine with aura and it was also more common in migraine with vestibular symptoms than migraine without vestibular symptoms. Conclusions: Vestibular symptoms are common in migraine patients. Migraine with vestibular symptoms might constitute a special group, one more likely to have had cyclic vomiting, recurrent abdominal pain or atopy.

N2  - Objectives: The sedating antidepressant mirtazapine is used off label for insomnia in perimenopausal women. Despite its apparent efficacy, mirtazapine causes significant increases in appetite and weight gain. Prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) is approved for primary insomnia in patients aged 55 years and older. A clinical experience with PRM add-on to mirtazapine in facilitating mirtazapine withdrawal while maintaining improved sleep quality and abrogating weight gain in perimenopausal women with insomnia is described. Methods: Eleven perimenopausal women (ages 45–52; FSH = 53 ± 8; normal BMI, 22.9 ± 0.6) with insomnia, who do not suffer from depression as assessed by the Hamilton scale, were treated with 15 mg mirtazapine (Remeron®) for 2–4 weeks. PRM, 2 mg (Circadin®), was then added on, and mirtazapine was tapered off for another 1–3 months. Prospective data on body weight and subjectively assessed sleep quality and well-being (assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI, and Well-Being Index, WHO-5, respectively) were collected before, during, and at the end of the treatment. Results: Sleep quality ratings improved significantly (by 103% on average) during combined mirtazapine and PRM intake and 180% during subsequent intake of PRM alone or together with very low doses of mirtazapine (P < 0.05 for all). Well-being significantly improved by 83% during the treatment. Seven of 11 women demonstrated weight gain following mirtazapine intake, five of whom have started to reduce weight following mirtazapine withdrawal and PRM intake. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Application of mirtazapine followed by PRM add-on and monotherapy improves sleep in perimenopausal women while evading mirtazapine-induced weight gain. These results warrant further investigation of a larger population in controlled clinical trials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In rodents, the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is timed by a circadian rhythm. We recently reported that a phenobarbital-induced delay of the estrous cycle in Syrian hamsters is associated with an approximately 2-h phase advance in both the circadian locomotor activity rhythm and the timing of the LH surge. The following study tests the hypothesis that a >2-h nonpharmacological phase advance in the circadian pacemaker that delays the estrous cycle by a day will also phase advance the LH surge by approximately 2 h. Activity rhythms were continuously monitored in regularly cycling hamsters using running wheels or infrared detectors for about 10 days prior to jugular cannulation. The next day, on proestrus, hamsters were transferred to the laboratory for 1 of 3 treatments: transfer to a “new cage” (and wheel) from zeitgeber time (ZT) 4 to 8 (with ZT12 defined as time of lights-off), or exposure to a “novel wheel” at ZT5 or ZT1. All animals were then placed in constant dark (DD). Blood samples were obtained just before onset of DD and hourly for the next 6 h, on that day and the next day for determination of plasma LH concentrations. Running activity was monitored in DD for about 10 more days. Transfer to a novel wheel at either ZT5 or ZT1 delayed the LH surge to day 2 in most hamsters, whereas exposure to a new cage did not. Only the delayed LH surges were phase advanced at least 2.5 h on average in all 3 groups. However, wheel-running activity was similarly phase advanced in all 3 groups regardless of the timing of the LH surge; thus, the phase advances in circadian activity rhythms were not associated with the 1-day delay of the LH surge. Interestingly, the number of wheel revolutions was closely associated with the 1-day delay of LH surges following exposure to a novel wheel at either ZT1 or ZT5. These results suggest that the intensity of wheel running (or an associated stimulus) plays an important role in the circadian timing mechanism for the LH surge.

N2  - Background: Midlife represents an important time to evaluate health status and health behaviors that may affect health-related quality of life (HRQL) in later years. This study examines change in women’s HRQL over 11 years from ages 47–59 to 57–69 and identifies midlife characteristics that predict HRQL at older ages. Methods: Physical (PCS) and mental component summaries (MCS) of the SF-36 were used to assess HRQL from 2002 to 2013 in 2,614 women from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multiethnic/racial cohort study. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) models to obtain unadjusted predicted mean trajectories of PCS and MCS as a function of age. Results: LOESS predicted PCS declined from 51.6 to 47.1, whereas MCS increased from 49.2 to 53.1. In multivariable models, controlling for baseline PCS, higher baseline physical activity (p = .002) and increase in physical activity from baseline (p p p p p p p p p = .004) and late postmenopause (p = .001; vs. premenopause) and aging (p = .05) predicted higher MCS. Predictors of lower MCS were less than very good health (p p p p = .004). Race/ethnicity was related to MCS, but not PCS. Conclusions: Several potentially modifiable midlife factors, such as improved sleep hygiene, physical activity, and body mass index, might improve HRQL for older women.

N2  - The study aimed to document self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, and triggers of epileptic seizures and techniques to control seizures for people with epilepsy, and to establish patterns in these self-reported experiences of epilepsy in relation to age, gender and seizure type. Of the 338 people with epilepsy who had registered interest in participating in social research, 225 returned a self-report questionnaire (66% response rate) that contained information regarding demographic characteristics, living with epilepsy, and self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, triggers of seizures and techniques to control seizures. Of 225 respondents, 195 (86.6%) experienced at least one initial symptom prior to a seizure and 202 (89.8%) experienced at least one seizure trigger. Gender analysis of triggers revealed that females differed from males regarding seizures triggered by low blood sugar, dieting, fasting, touch and female specific triggers (menstruation, pregnancy and ovulation). Respondents reported tiredness as the most frequent trigger (65.3%), followed by stress (64%) and sleep deprivation (55.1%). Many respondents (63.6%) reported that they could predict seizure occurrence, with 91 (40.4%) also indicating that family members could predict seizure occurrence. A total of 157 (69.8%) respondents had tried at least one of 12 possible seizure avoidance techniques, with resting and medication the most frequently reported. Finding that respondents were able to recognise warning signs, initial symptoms and triggers of seizures, and some were able to stop seizures provides scope for developing interventions, such as promoting avoidance of high risk triggers, which supplement existing treatments of epilepsy.

N2  - Sleep disturbances are commonly associated with menopause. Hormone replacement therapy is often used to treat various menopausal symptoms, but its efficacy for improving sleep is a matter of debate. We addressed this question by using a rodent model of ovarian hormone loss and replacement in midlife. Middle-aged female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with capsules containing estradiol with or without progesterone, or oil. After two weeks, sleep/wake states were recorded polygraphically during a 24-h baseline period, followed by 6 h of sleep deprivation in the second half of the light phase, and a 24-h recovery period. During the baseline dark phase, hormone treatments increased wakefulness, and decreased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) by shortening NREMS episodes; however, NREMS EEG delta power or energy (cumulative power) was unaffected by combined hormones. Following sleep deprivation, all the groups showed NREMS and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) rebounds, with similar relative increases from respective baseline levels. The increases in NREMS EEG delta power/energy during recovery were enhanced by combined hormones. These results from middle-aged ovariectomized rats indicate that replacement with estrogen with or without progesterone reduces baseline NREMS without affecting sleep intensity, particularly during the dark (active) phase, whereas following sleep deprivation the same hormone treatments do not affect the ability to increase NREMS or REMS, but treatment with both hormones, in particular, enhances the intensity of recovery sleep. These results support the usefulness of ovariectomized middle-aged rats as a model system to study the biological effects of hormone replacement on sleep regulation.

N2  - Introduction: Migraine is a common complex neurological disorder involving multiple brain areas that regulate autonomic, affective, cognitive, and sensory functions. This review explores autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in migraine headache sufferers. Areas covered: Reference material for this review was obtained through PubMed searches. Migraine attacks can present with up to 4 phases (premonitory, aura, headache, postdrome) each with distinguishable signs and symptoms. Altered ANS tone can be found from the premonitory through the postdrome phases. Features of the migraine attack that are indicative of altered autonomic function, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria, eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, and ptosis, are discussed and putative mechanisms explored. In addition, alteration of ANS function by endogenous and exogenous stressors, such as bright lights, hunger, poor sleep quality, menses, and special dietary components is discussed. The influence of currently employed pharmacological treatments on altered autonomic function during the migraine attack is explored. Expert commentary: Migraine-related alterations in ANS function have a complex pattern, but, in general, an imbalance occurs between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Through an improved understanding the role of autonomic changes in pathogenesis of migraine, it may be possible to develop even more effective treatments for migraine sufferers.

N2  - Presents a case report of a 29-year-old woman who was suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The author encountered this case to study the effectiveness of ramelteon for the treatment of residual sleep disturbances or hypersomnia even after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) therapy. The patient experienced symptoms such as marked affective lability, marked irritability and anger, marked depressed mood, marked anxiety and tension, decreased interest in usual activities, lethargy, marked lack of energy, cravings for sweet foods, excessive daytime sleepiness, and frequent nocturnal awakenings. The patient expressed a strong desire for improvement in these premenstrual sleep problems. With the aim of ameliorating the frequent nocturnal awakenings, ramelteon was additionally administered, which resulted in complete resolution of not only the frequent nocturnal awakenings, but also the excessive daytime sleepiness during her subsequent menstrual cycle. This case of PMDD responded favorably to additional administration of ramelteon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Medical advancements in neonatology have significantly increased the number of high-risk preterm survivors. However, recent long-term follow-up studies have suggested that preterm infants are at risk for behavioral, educational, and emotional problems. Although clear relationships have been demonstrated between preterm infants and developmental problems during childhood and adolescence, less is known about the early indications of these problems. Recently, numerous studies on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) have demonstrated temporal correlations of activity between spatially remote cortical regions not only in healthy adults but also in neuropathological disorders and early childhood development. In order to compare RSFC of the cerebral cortex between preterm infants at term-equivalent ages and full-term neonates without any anatomical abnormality risk during natural sleep, we used an optical topography system, which is a recently developed extension of near-infrared spectroscopy. We clarified the presence of RSFC in both preterm infants and full-term neonates and showed differences between these groups. The principal differences were that on comparison of RSFC between the bilateral temporal regions, and bilateral parietal regions, RSFC was enhanced in preterm infants compared with full-term neonates; whereas on comparison of RSFC between the left temporal and left parietal regions, RSFC was enhanced in full-term neonates compared with preterm infants. We also demonstrated a difference between the groups in developmental changes of RSFC related to postmenstrual age. Most importantly, these findings suggested that preterm infants and full-term neonates follow different developmental trajectories during the perinatal period because of differences in perinatal experiences and physiological and structural development.

N2  - Aim: The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of sleep continuity disorders in women during menopausal transition, to evaluate the relationship between disturbances of sleep continuity and the severity of menopausal syndrome and the occurrence of various symptoms of this syndrome, as well as to evaluate the association between the presence of sleep disturbances and serum concentrations of gonadotropins, prolactin and sex hormones. Methods: Consecutive 140 women (mean age 54.4 ± 4.7 years) searching for the treatment in the Clinic for Gynaecological Endocrinology who reported symptoms of menopausal syndrome were investigated. The type and severity of disturbances of sleep continuity were evaluated using a survey based on the sleep related questions from Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The severity of symptoms of menopausal syndrome was assessed using the Kupperman Index. The concentration of the following hormones in blood serum was tested: FSH, LH, 17β-estradiol, PRL, total testosterone, DHEAS and SHBG. Results: Disturbances of sleep continuity were a prevalent complaint in the studied group of women. Difficulties in falling asleep were found in 57.8% of women, difficulties in maintaining sleep in 70%, waking up too early in 60.7%. The severity of all three types of sleep continuity disturbances was related to the severity of menopausal syndrome as measured with Kupperman Index (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.63, r = 0.61, r = 0.52, respectively; p < 0.001). Difficulties in maintaining sleep were negatively correlated with the concentration of FSH (r = - 0.19; p < 0.05), 17β-estradiol (r = - 0.19; p < 0.05) and SHBG (r = - 0.18; p < 0.05), difficulties in falling asleep negatively correlated with the concentration of 17β-estradiol in the blood serum (r = - 0.19; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Sleep continuity disturbances are frequently reported by women during the menopausal transition. Interventions aimed at reducing the symptoms of menopausal syndrome should be considered as important action to improve sleep quality in this population of patients.

N2  - Preventing, delaying and managing morbidities is critical to sustain a strong economy and health care system as the proportion of adults over 65 years increases. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Americans. Signs of CVD are apparent in the vasculature before symptoms of clinical disease are present. Subclinical disease can be measured using non-invasive B-mode ultrasound to assess carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, common carotid artery intima media thickness, adventitial diameter and lumen diameter. Vascular aging is a natural process that can be modified by lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors on vascular aging. Hormone therapy use in early postmenopausal women was associated with significantly smaller adventitial and lumen diameter than those who did not use hormone therapy after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. These results concur with findings from another study in which higher levels of endogenous estrogen was related to smaller adventitial diameters. Together, these results suggest endogenous and exogenous estrogen have similar effects on adventitial diameter. Sedentary, overweight and obese male young adults at low risk of sleep apnea, and non-snorers had better vascular health, reflected in smaller adventitial and lumen diameters, than those at high risk for sleep apnea and snorers in a cross-sectional study. Results were robust after adjustment for age and systolic blood pressure and add to the literature linking CVD with sleep disordered breathing. Sedentary older adults who participated in a 6-month physical activity intervention had a clinically relevant decline in arterial stiffness, but greater increases in adventitial and lumen diameters compared to control participants. These findings support that it is never too late to gain cardiovascular benefit from physical activity. Research is needed to understand the implications of arterial diameter following introduction of physical activity to sedentary older adults. Together these studies support the public health importance of lifestyle factors contribution to subclinical CVD. Each study also provides evidence that measurement of adventitial diameter is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the vascular remodeling processes that accompany these lifestyle changes across the vascular aging continuum.

N2  - We investigated the percentage of women with poor sleep quality and its related factors among mainland Chinese women. Sleep quality and menopausal status were self-reported. We explored the contribution of possible risk factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, lifestyle, psychological status, stressful life events, and vasomotor symptoms. We found that 38.6% of midlife Chinese women were poor sleepers. This percentage was higher in comparison with women from other Asian countries. Our multiple logistic regression showed that anxiety, comorbidities, perceived stress, and vasomotor symptoms were risk factors for poor sleep quality.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and intensity of menopausal symptoms, taking into account the length of one’s relationship, its nature and one’s assessment of it. Participants and procedure The study included 200 women between the ages of 45 and 68, with secondary or higher education, married or in cohabiting relationships. Women were divided into three groups depending on the experience related to menopause: premenopause (46 respondents), perimenopause (75 respondents), and postmenopause (79 respondents). The study used a survey of self-design, the “Women’s Health” Questionnaire (WHQ) by M. Hunter, and the “Partner Relations Questionnaire” (PFB) by K. Hahlweg. Results: Most menopausal symptoms—including those of the greatest severity—are experienced by women in perimenopausal and postmenopausal phases, but one’s own relationship’s assessment is the lowest in postmenopausal women. In this group of women, relevant and significant relations between the dimensions of the quality of the relationship and the menopausal symptoms are the most numerous. The most essential assessment was the one relating to intimacy—its poor evaluation is accompanied by higher intensity of experienced depression symptoms, somatic symptoms, and disorders of memory and concentration, sex and sleep, and also the sum of menopausal symptoms is higher. In all three groups, no significant differences in the severity of menopausal symptoms were observed between women in marital and cohabiting relationships. In women in the perimenopausal phase, the shorter the length of the relationship (its seniority), the greater is the severity of sexual dysfunction symptoms, whereas in women in the postmenopausal stage, along with the length of the relationship, the severity of psychological and somatic symptoms increases. Conclusions: One should find that the perimenopausal and postmenopausal phases are particularly difficult for women, meaning that the intensity of menopausal symptoms is the greatest during them. The assessment of one’s relationship’s quality is relevant for the menopausal symptoms experienced. Women who perceive their relationship as more intimate report less severe menopausal symptoms. The type of relationship does not differentiate women with regards to their experience associated with menopause. Both shorter and longer seniority of the relationship may constitute a risk factor triggering an increase of the severity of menopausal symptoms.

N2  - Background: Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is diagnosed when an impairment in the sexual response cycle is associated with distress in women. The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and FSD has been poorly investigated with conflicting results. Aim: To assess the role of OSA in determining FSD in pre menopausal obese women. Methods: Forty-six women underwent standard polysomnography. Data on sexual function and sexual-related distress were obtained using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS). Women with both abnormal FSFI and FSDS scores were classified as having FSD. Results: Thirty-one women were classified as having OSA. Fourteen (30.4%) women had both sexual difficulties and sexual distress resulting in FSD; they showed higher values of sleep time spent with SpO₂ p = 0.004). FSD was present in 10 women with OSA (32.2%); in this group T₉₀ was higher (23.5 ± 26.3) in women with FSD than in those without FSD (4.8 ± 5.8; p = 0.003). In a logistic multiple regression analysis, T₉₀ was the only factor associated with an increased risk for FSD (odds ratio [OR] 1.07) (confidence interval [CI]) 1.006–1.13]; p = 0.03). Conclusions: In premenopausal obese women the presence of FSD is correlated with OSA only when nocturnal hypoxia is present. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study identified trajectories of morningness–eveningness (M–E) and physical activity when chronological (i.e., time since birth) versus gynecological (i.e., time since menarche) age is used to indicate maturation. Piecewise models were fit for girls (N = 262, ages 11–19) using chronological or gynecological age as the time metric. Girls stayed up later (i.e., eveningness) as they approach menarche. After menarche no change in M–E was observed. In contrast, no change in M–E was detected with chronological age. No change in physical activity was observed before menarche, and physical activity declined after menarche. With chronological age, physical activity declined as girls got older. Gynecological age may be more appropriate than chronological age as a metric for understanding changes in M–E and physical activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Although the menopause associates to poor sleep quality, insomnia severity data in the menopausal transition is scarce or lacking. Objective: To assess insomnia prevalence, severity and related factors in mid-aged women. Methods: In this cross-sectional study 340 women (40 to 59 years) completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and a general questionnaire containing personal/partner data. Hot flush presence and intensity was also assessed with the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Results: Median age of the sample was 48.0 years, with 63.5% having lower education and 52.9% being postmenopausal. At the moment of the survey 7.1% were on hormone therapy, 8.2% on phytoestrogens and 2.1% on psychotropic drugs. A 63.8% were abdominally obese (waist circumference > 88 cm) and 65.5% sedentary. According to item 1 of the MRS, 60.9% presented hot flushes, graded in 17.4% as severe-very severe. Regarding the partner (n = 255), erectile dysfunction was present in 23.9%, premature ejaculation 37.6%, 35.3% abused alcohol and 42.4% were faithful. The ISI tool displayed a high internal consistency (alpha Cronbach coefficient = 0.87), identifying 41.5% of women with some degree of insomnia (Total ISI score ≥8) further categorized as sub-threshold or mild (32.0%), moderate (7.4%) and severe (2.1%). Multiple linear regression analysis obtained two best fit models predicting total ISI scores, one not including and one including partner data. In the first model, hot flush severity, psychotropic use and sedentarism displayed significant positive correlations with total ISI scores. In the second, hot flush intensity, psychotropic drug use and male erectile dysfunction positively correlated whereas partner faithfulness inversely with ISI scores. Conclusion: In this mid-aged series insomnia severity was related to female and partner factors; several of which are susceptible of intervention.

N2  - Background: Previous studies have found more frequent increases in dietary intake and nonrestorative nocturnal sleep during the luteal phase than in the follicular phase, but few studies have investigated how increased energy intake at dinner influences sleep by considering the correlation between female hormone and cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. This study examined the effects of energy intake at dinner on ANS activity during nighttime sleep in order to evaluate restorative sleep in healthy women. We also examined whether ANS activity is associated with female hormone dynamics. Methods: Twenty-four healthy collegiate women participated in this randomized crossover trial. Each was assigned to receive a High Energy Dinner (HED) or Low Energy Dinner (LED) treatment. Energy ratios of each test meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) to total energy intake were 1:1:2 and 1:2:1 for HED and LED treatments, respectively. Each participant wore an ECG recorder before dinner and removed it upon waking the next morning. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used to calculate low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and total spectral power (TP). Cardiac sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) nervous system activity were evaluated as LF/HF and HF/TP, respectively. Results: Mean HF/TP for the entire sleeping period was lower with HED treatment compared to LED treatment (41.7 ± 11.4 vs. 45.0 ± 12.13, P = .034). Intergroup comparisons of the initial 3-h sleeping period revealed that LF/HF (0.87 ± 0.82 vs. 0.66 ± 0.82, P = .013) and HF/TP (45.6 ± 13.9 vs. 51.5 ± 11.8, P = .002) were higher and lower, respectively, with HED treatment compared to LED treatment. Progesterone levels were positively correlated with LF/HF with LED treatment, and negatively correlated with HF/TP with both HED and LED treatments. Conclusion: Higher energy intake at dinner increases and decreases SNS and PNS activities, respectively, resulting in nonrestorative nocturnal sleep. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between progesterone and PNS activity, highlighting the difficulty of increasing PNS activity during sleep in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.

N2  - Objective: Migraine is a recurrent primary headache disorder characterized by different clinical presentations. Migraneurs report excessive sensitivity to light, sound, motion, odours, and other sensory stimuli in and between acute migraine attacks. This study was undertaken to document different trigger factors and to evaluate the differences in episodic and chronic migraine forms. Headache trigger factors were questioned in 190 patients. Methods: Headache triggering factors were questioned in 190 patients. A set of questions concerning the trigger factors were prepared and the information about the triggering factors was collected by a structured interview. All the patients were administered Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All analyses in this study were performed by NCSS 2007 packet programme. Results: The trigger factors reported in this study were stressor factors, noise, sleep disturbances, fatigue, hunger, physical effort, light, sun, cold, factors affecting scalp, traveling by motor vehicle, eye strain, crowd, odours, crying, weather, high blood pressure, cigarette smoke and menstruation respectively. Conclusion: The prophylactic treatment of migraine decreases the frequency of headaches by affecting various factors. Understanding the link between the trigger factors and headache may yield novel preventative and therapeutic approaches in the management of headache.

N2  - Background: Women report many nonvasomotor symptoms across the menopausal transition, including sleep disturbances, depressed mood, and sexual problems. The co-occurrence of these three symptoms may represent a specific menopausal symptom triad. We sought to evaluate the interrelatedness of disturbed sleep, depressed mood, and sexual problems in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) and determine the characteristics of women exhibiting this symptom triad. Methods: SWAN is a multisite, multiethnic observational cohort study of the menopausal transition in the United States. Sleep disturbance, sexual problems, and depressed mood were determined based on self-report. Women who reported all three symptoms simultaneously were compared to those who did not. Logistic regression models estimated the association of demographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics with the symptom triad. Results: Study participants (n = 1716) were 49.8 years old on average and primarily in very good or excellent health. Sixteen and a half percent had depressed mood, 36.6% had a sleep problem, and 42.2% had any sexual problem. Five percent of women (n = 90) experienced all three symptoms. Women with the symptom triad compared with those without had lower household incomes, less education, were surgically postmenopausal or late perimenopausal, rated their general health as fair or poor, and had more stressful life events and lower social support. Conclusions: The symptom triad of sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and sexual problems occurred in only 5% of women, and occurred most often among women with lower socioeconomic status, greater psychosocial distress, and who were surgically menopausal or in the late perimenopause.

N2  - Decreases in heart rate variability, a marker of autonomic nervous system function, are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability increases in non‐rapid eye movement sleep, peaking in slow‐wave sleep. Therefore, decreasing the amount of deep sleep, for example, by introducing patients to a sleep laboratory environment, could decrease heart rate variability, increasing cardiovascular risk. We studied four groups of women with no previous sleep laboratory experience: young [n = 11, 23.1 (0.5) years]; perimenopausal [n = 15, 48.0 (0.4) years]; postmenopausal without hormone therapy [n = 22, 63.4 (0.8) years]; and postmenopausal on hormone therapy [n = 16, 63.1 (0.9) years], using a cross‐sectional design. Polysomnography including electrocardiogram was performed over two consecutive nights. Heart rate variability was assessed overnight, and the first‐night effect on heart rate variability was analysed. Furthermore, correlations between heart rate variability and sleep variables were analysed. Using combined groups, only minor changes were observed in non‐linear heart rate variability, indicating increased parasympathetic tone from the first to the second night. No group differences in first‐night effect were seen. Heart rate variability and sleep variables were not significantly correlated. Heart rate variability decreased with increasing age, and it was lowest in the postmenopausal women on hormone therapy. We conclude that a first night in a sleep laboratory elicits only minimal changes in overnight vagally mediated non‐linear heart rate variability in women irrespective of reproductive state. This finding warrants further analyses in different sleep stages, but suggests that changes in sleep architecture per se do not predict the autonomic strain of a poor night.

N2  - Good sleep quality is important for good health, both physical and mental, and indeed for quality of life, performance and productivity. Sleep problems increase with age in both sexes, but women are more susceptible to them at all ages. Although menopause is considered an important milestone (the decrease in both oestrogen and progesterone has been shown to reduce sleep quality), an increase in sleep problems is already evident in midlife, as there is an increased incidence of other diseases as well as mood symptoms, which may exert an effect on sleep quality either directly or via the side-effects of the associated medications. Weight changes at midlife and the menopause may also affect sleep quality. In addition to reductions in sleep quality, specific sleep disorders, like sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome, become more prevalent in midlife and especially after menopause. Because sleep problems are commonly present in association with other conditions, rather than as isolated, independent disorders, treatment is often complex and patients generally need multiprofessional appraisal.

N2  - One of the most striking facts is the transition to eveningness in adolescence around the age of 12-14 years which seems to be associated with pubertal development and with increasing sexual hormones. As women in their transition during menopause (at approx. 50 years) experience the contrary pattern, namely the reduction of sexual hormones, one should expect a turn towards morningness during these developmental stages. Women between 40 and 55 years, who were unaffected by hormone replacement therapy, gynaecological operations or hormonal contraceptives, participated in our study (pre-, peri- and post-menopausal stages). We found that women became more morning-orientated during the transition through menopause, which is considered an effect of hormonal changes rather than of age. Sleep problems increased from pre- to post-menopause while psychological complaints were highest during the peri-menopause. Further, we found a correlation between eveningness and psychological complaints, and a correlation between sleep problems and morningness. The presence of a partner was associated with higher morningness scores and earlier bed and rise times on weekends. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Decreases in subjective sleep quality are prevalent among nurses and midwives engaged in rotating shift work. Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the relationship between differences in work schedules and subjective sleep quality among female nursing staff. Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used for descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Data collection was conducted from December 2016 to September 2017. Settings: Participants were recruited from five regional core hospitals in Japan. Participants: A total of 1253 nurses and midwives were included in the final analysis. Methods: Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Chronotype and social jet lag were calculated for both work day and work-free day. Symptoms related to restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease were assessed using the Japanese version of the Cambridge-Hopkins questionnaire short form 13. Participants with the urge to move their legs, though not fulfilling the restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease criteria, were classified as having leg motor restlessness. Logistic regression analyses for poor sleep were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, drinking, menstruation status, the presence of premenstrual syndrome, and the presence of a spouse. Results: Rates of poor sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score ≥6) among those working, day shifts, rotating 12.5 hour night shifts, rotating 16 hour night shifts, and three-shift rotations were 41.2%, 51.1%, 44.5%, and 60.4%, respectively. Approximately 40% of three-shift rotation workers experienced difficulty initiating sleep. Shift workers tended to exhibit evening chronotype, delayed sleep phase, and high social jet lag. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease was 2.5%. Leg motor restlessness was observed in. 15.5% of participants. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of three-shift work (vs. day shift), evening chronotype (vs. morning chronotype), and the presence of leg motor restlessness (vs. no leg motor restlessness) for those with poor sleep were 2.20 (1.47–3.30), 1.95 (1.29–2.94), and 1.66 (1.15–2.39), respectively. Conclusions: Regardless of the working schedules, rates of poor sleep were high among female hospital nurses and midwives. Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality is influenced by three-shift rotation, the evening chronotype, and leg motor restlessness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study assessed factors associated with quality of life (QOL) among Serbian peri- and postmenopausal women using two menopause-specific scales. This cross-sectional study included 500 women aged 40–65 years who had a gynecologic check-up in one of two Community Health Centers in Belgrade during February 2014 to January 2015. Women completed: a questionnaire about socio-demographics, habits, and health status; a menopause-specific questionnaire, Utian’s Quality of Life Scale (UQOL); and a Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI). Higher education was associated with better occupational UQOL and memory/concentration, but with lower emotional UQOL and more anxiety/fears. City center residency was associated with better occupational and sexual UQOL. Being employed was associated with better occupational UQOL and lower anxiety/fears. Higher income was associated with better emotional UQOL. Not having uterine prolapse, insomnia, or tachycardia was associated with better occupational UQOL and fewer sleep problems. Higher parity was associated with better sexual UQOL. Having regular recreation was associated with better health and sexual UQOL but with more frequent vasomotor symptoms. Leaner women felt more attractive. QOL during the menopausal transition does not entail only somatic symptoms and therefore requires a more comprehensive approach that includes psychosocial underpinnings.

N2  - Reports an error in "Prior depression affects the experience of the perimenopause—findings from the Swiss Perimenopause Study" by Jasmine Willi, Hannah Süss, Jessica Grub and Ulrike Ehlert (Journal of Affective Disorders, 2020[Dec][1], Vol 277, 603-611). Fig. 3 contains an incorrect graphical illustration of the results based on the group comparison between women with a history of depression and women without prior depression regarding their current symptoms of depression. The corrected figure is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-75728-081). Background: There is a prevalence peak of depression in the perimenopause, with this reproductive phase being considered a window of vulnerability due to major biopsychosocial changes. Depression has been associated with physical and psychosocial impairment. Prior depression has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of several somatic and mental diseases. We assume that women with prior depression will exhibit increased burdensome symptoms in the perimenopause compared to women without prior depression. Methods: A total of 135 perimenopausal women aged 40–56 years participated in the longitudinal Swiss Perimenopause Study. For the purpose of this investigation, a cross-sectional design was chosen. A wide range of validated psychosocial questionnaires were used to compare women with and without prior depression regarding their experience of the perimenopause. Findings were statistically adjusted for multiple testing. Results: Women with prior depression showed significantly more depressive symptoms (U = 1215.5, p U = 1395.0, p U = 1583.5, p U = 1573.0, p U = 1524.0, p < .05) than those without prior depression. Limitations: Self-report data may affect the results. Furthermore, due to the cross-sectional design, causality cannot be inferred. Conclusions: Prior depression affects women's experience of the perimenopause. Women with prior depression exhibit significantly more negative health outcomes in the perimenopause than those without prior depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Hot flashes and night sweats, or vasomotor symptoms (VMS), are reported by an estimated 70-80% of women during the menopausal transition. Measures of negative affect are among the strongest and most consistent correlates of all aspects of VMS experience, though the mechanisms linking these factors are unclear. The current study aimed to examine the within day and day-to-day relationships between vasomotor symptoms and negative affect, and the potential role of sleep disturbance and cortisol dysregulation in these relationships, in a sample of women in midlife. Methods: Fifty-three women (49% African American) who reported daily vasomotor symptoms were enrolled in an ambulatory study. For seven days, participants documented their mood state, VMS experience, sleep, and health behaviors multiple times a day using electronic diaries, and wore Actiwatches to capture additional data related to sleep parameters. Participants also provided morning and bedtime saliva samples for salivary cortisol collection over three days during the observed period. Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine relationships between VMS, negative affect, and related factors. Results: Accounting for a number of health and demographic variables, women reported more negative affect on both the same day (beta=1.46, p<.001 for VMS bother) and the day following (beta=0.80, p=0.02 for night sweat severity, beta=0.61, p=0.02 for night sweat bother) a more negative experience of vasomotor symptoms. A flatter diurnal cortisol slope was related to hot flash severity (beta=0.09, p=0.03) and bother (beta=0.10, p<.01) as well as negative affect (beta=0.68, p=0.01), and partially explained the relationship between negative affect and VMS. Sleep disturbance did not appear to play a role in linking VMS to next day negative affect. Conclusion: The subjective experience of VMS plays a key role in relationships between VMS, negative affect, and health-related factors on a daily basis. The findings of this study do not support a small role of sleep disturbance in linking night sweat severity to next day negative affect, but suggest that further research is warranted to better understand the relationship between daily VMS experience, stress physiology, and negative affect.

N2  - Comments on an article by Peter T. Morgan et al. (see record 2012-35260-019). Morgan et al. report a 12% increase in occipital GABA, measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), in primary insomnia (PI) subjects relative to healthy controls. Moreover, in both groups, GABA levels correlated negatively with wake after sleep onset measured by ambulatory polysomnography. The authors hypothesized that increased occipital GABA in PI may reflect an adaptive compensatory response to chronic hyperarousal in the disorder. The recent work by Morgan and colleagues, careful analysis related to MRS methodologies, differences in study participants, and timing of MRS acquisition may guide further scientific inquiry into the role of GABA in PI. Morgan and colleagues also considered a first-degree relative with depression exclusionary, which may have affected results given well-established decrements in occipital GABA in major depressive disorder (MDD). Morgan and colleagues accounted for changes in GABA across the menstrual cycle, which may be an important uncontrolled covariate in their design, given prior reports of the GABAergic system being modulated by menstrual phase. Morgan and colleagues for their thought-provoking findings, which are certain to stimulate further research in this area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: We evaluated associations among subjective and objective measures of sleep and the metabolic syndrome in a multi-ethnic sample of midlife women. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants’ homes. Participants: Caucasian (n = 158), African American (n = 125), and Chinese women (n = 57); mean age = 51 years. Age range = 46-57 years. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Metabolic syndrome was measured in the clinic and sleep quality was assessed by self-report. Indices of sleep duration, continuity/fragmentation, depth, and sleep disordered breathing were assessed by in-home polysomnography (PSG). Covariates included sociodemographics, menopausal status, use of medications that affect sleep, and self-reported health complaints and health behaviors known to influence metabolic syndrome risk. Logistic regression was used to test the hypothesis that the metabolic syndrome would be associated with increased subjective sleep complaints and PSG-assessed sleep disturbances. In univariate analyses, the metabolic syndrome was associated with decreased sleep duration and efficiency and increased NREM beta power and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). After covariate adjustment, sleep efficiency (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-3.93), NREM beta power (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.09-3.98), and AHI (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.40-2.48) remained significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio values are expressed in standard deviation units). These relationships did not differ by race. Conclusions: Objective indices of sleep continuity, depth, and sleep disordered breathing are significant correlates of the metabolic syndrome in midlife women, independent of race, menopausal status and other factors that might otherwise account for these relationships.

N2  - Background: Dementia, as a global public health problem, is becoming increasingly serious. As a precursor of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of dementia. Recent studies have found a correlation between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and cognitive function in men. The relationship between GGT levels and cognitive function in women remains unclear because GGT activity and expression differ between the sexes. Method: We recruited a total of 2,943 Chinese women from Jidong and Taian in 2019. We grouped the participants according to GGT levels, diagnosed MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale, and modeled the study outcomes using logistic regression to explore the relationship between GGT level and MCI. We also analyzed the interaction of obesity, sleep duration, and hyperuricemia with GGT in the development of MCI. Results: The prevalence of MCI increased with increasing GGT level, from the lowest quartile to the highest quartile of GGT: 8.4% (66/786), 14.2% (119/840), 17.6% (108/613), and 21.4% (151/704), respectively. At the same time, as GGT levels increased, so did the risk of MCI. In the fully adjusted model, compared with those for participants in the lowest GGT quartiles, the odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MCI for participants in the second, third, and fourth GGT quartiles were 1.49 (1.04–2.12), 1.53(1.06–2.21), and 1.88 (1.33–2.65), respectively. The risk of developing MCI was further increased in people with high GGT levels who were obese (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.39–2.76, P P P P < 0.001). Conclusion: We found that MCI is more common in women with elevated GGT levels, so GGT could be a potential diagnostic marker for MCI. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that women with high GGT levels had an increased risk of MCI when they were obese, sleep deprived, had high serum uric acid (SUA) levels or underwent menopause.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep interruption is often reported by women with hot flashes and night sweats (or vasomotor symptoms, VMS). Although women report that VMS awaken them, polysomnography (PSG) studies have not consistently supported this contention. Design: We mimicked menopause using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to investigate whether VMS increase awakenings and wake after sleep onset (WASO). VMS, serum estradiol, and at-home PSGs (two pretreatment, two posttreatment) were measured before and after 4 weeks on GnRHa. Regression models were used to determine the effect of increasing VMS frequency on awakenings and WASO, as measured objectively and subjectively. Participants: Twenty-nine healthy women (mean 27.3 y). Setting: Academic medical center. Interventions: Depot GnRHa (leuprolide 3.75-mg). Results: Serum estradiol was rapidly and uniformly suppressed on GnRHa. Persistent VMS were reported by 69% of women. The number of nighttime VMS correlated directly with the degree of sleep disturbance. Each additional reported nighttime VMS was associated with a 62% increase from baseline in PSG-measured WASO (P = 0.007), a 3% increase in awakenings (P = 0.05), and 6% increase in %N1 sleep (P = 0.02). Nighttime VMS were also associated with increased perceived WASO (312%; P = 0.02), awakenings (16%; P = 0.007), Insomnia Severity Index (P = 0.03), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P = 0.03) scores, and decreased perceived sleep efficiency (P = 0.01). Objectively recorded nighttime VMS correlated with PSG-measured WASO (rs = 0.45, P = 0.02). Conclusions: This menopause model demonstrates that nighttime vasomotor symptoms correlate with increased sleep fragmentation. These findings are consistent with a specific contribution of vasomotor symptoms to polysomnography-measured sleep interruption suggesting that nighttime vasomotor symptoms interrupt sleep in the setting of menopause.

N2  - This chapter discusses sleep disorders in women. We now know that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a very common disorder that affects both men and women (premenopausal women less than postmenopausal women) and can affect both overweight and normal weight people. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), another well-described sleep disorder, was thought of rare until recently as well, and now is known to be quite prevalent especially in women. In addition, the increased recognition and acceptance of insomnia, a condition more prevalent in women, as a sleep disorder in its own right have established the fact that sleep disorders are quite common and are not gender-specific disorders of the male population. The recent findings on sleep duration and mortality have shown some gender differences, with both sexes having higher mortality if they slept 5 or less hours or 10 or more hours but these extremes of sleep were only a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in women. In this chapter, I will discuss the prevalence of the complaint of difficulty sleeping and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in women. 1 will also discuss the gender differences in the prevalence of the two most common sleep syndromes: OSAS and RLS.

N2  - This chapter discusses adolescent sleep disorders and their treatment. Several factors contribute to the onset of insomnia, delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), inadequate sleep hygiene, and behavioral sleep restriction in adolescents. Strong evidence links the differentiation in risk for sleep disorders to menarche-onset. Adult studies support connections between the menstrual cycle and insomnia symptoms. However, no studies have fully explored this connection between the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances in female adolescents. Biological delays in the adolescent circadian timing system combined with environmental and societal factors further contribute to the onset of sleep disturbances. Improved education regarding sleep and sleep disorders is needed for adolescents, parents, educators, and healthcare providers in order to increase diagnosis and connect adolescents with treatment. In addition, studies providing treatment outcomes specific to adolescents are sorely needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Melatonin is known for its regulation of circadian rhythm. Recently, studies have shown that melatonin may have a positive effect on the skeleton. By increasing age, the melatonin levels decrease, which may lead to a further imbalanced bone remodeling. We aimed to investigate whether treatment with melatonin could improve bone mass and integrity in humans. In a double‐blind RCT, we randomized 81 postmenopausal osteopenic women to 1‐yr nightly treatment with melatonin 1 mg (N = 20), 3 mg (N = 20), or placebo (N = 41). At baseline and after 1‐yr treatment, we measured bone mineral density (BMD) by dual X‐ray absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and high‐resolution peripheral QCT (HR‐pQCT) and determined calciotropic hormones and bone markers. Mean age of the study subjects was 63 (range 56–73) yr. Compared to placebo, femoral neck BMD increased by 1.4% in response to melatonin (P P P = 0.55) and by 2.3% (P P = 0.04), and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in the spine, by 3.6% (P = 0.04) in the 3 mg/day. Treatment did not significantly affect BMD at other sites or levels of bone turnover markers; however, 24‐hr urinary calcium was decreased in response to melatonin by 12.2% (P = 0.02). In conclusion, 1‐yr treatment with melatonin increased BMD at femoral neck in a dose‐dependent manner, while high‐dose melatonin increased vBMD in the spine. Further studies are needed to assess the mechanisms of action and whether the positive effect of nighttime melatonin will protect against fractures.

N2  - Background: Trauma-related diagnoses such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent in veterans. The identification of mechanisms related to stress vulnerability and development of PTSD specifically in a veteran population may aid in the prevention of PTSD and identification of novel treatment targets. Methods: Veterans with PTSD (n = 27), trauma-exposed veterans with no PTSD (TEC, n = 18) and non-trauma-exposed controls (NTEC, n = 28) underwent single-voxel proton (¹H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3 Tesla in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) using a two-dimensional (2D) J-resolved point spectroscopy sequence in addition to completing a clinical battery. Results: The PTSD and TEC groups demonstrated lower gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)/H₂O (p = 0.02) and glutamine (Gln)/H₂O (p = 0.02) in the dACC as compared to the NTEC group. The PTSD group showed a trend towards higher Glu/GABA (p = 0.053) than the NTEC group. Further, GABA/H2O in the dACC correlated negatively with sleep symptoms in the PTSD group (p = 0.03) but not in the TEC and NTEC groups. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design, concomitant medications, single voxel measurement as opposed to global changes, absence of measure of childhood or severity of trauma and objective sleep measures, female participants not matched for menstrual cycle phase. Conclusions: Exposure to trauma in veterans may be associated with lower GABA/H₂O and Gln/H₂O in the dACC, suggesting disruption in the GABA-Gln-glutamate cycle. Further, altered Glu/GABA in the dACC in the PTSD group may indicate an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Further, lower GABA/H₂O in the ACC was associated with poor sleep in the PTSD group. Treatments that restore GABAergic balance may be particularly effective in reducing sleep symptoms in PTSD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Exercise generally improves quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial functioning in adult populations but few randomized trials have examined dose-response effects. Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to report the QoL and psychosocial outcomes from the Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA). Methods: Healthy but inactive postmenopausal women at risk for breast cancer were randomized to a year-long aerobic exercise intervention consisting of either 150 min/week (moderate volume group, n = 200) or 300 min/week (high volume group, n = 200). QoL was assessed at baseline and 1 year using the short form-36 health survey. Sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and happiness were also assessed. Participant preference for group assignment (i.e., exercise volume) was assessed at baseline and tested as a moderator. Results: There were no statistically significant dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on any QoL, sleep quality, or psychosocial outcome. Participant preference for group assignment did not moderate any QoL, sleep quality, or psychosocial responses. Marital status was a significant moderator (p for interaction = 0.01) and obesity showed a trend towards being a moderator (p for interaction = 0.08) of the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on global sleep quality such that unmarried and obese women improved sleep quality with the higher volume of aerobic exercise. Conclusions: A higher volume of aerobic exercise, approximately double the minimum public health guideline, did not provide additional QoL or psychosocial benefits compared to the minimum public health guideline in inactive postmenopausal women, even for women who preferred the higher volume of exercise at baseline.

N2  - A unifying physiological explanation of the urge to initiate eating is still not available as human hunger in meal-to-meal eating may not be under homeostatic control. We hypothesized that a central circadian and a gastrointestinal ultradian timing mechanism coordinate non-deprivation meal-to-meal eating. We examined hunger as a function of time of day, inter-meal (IM) energy expenditure (EE), and concentrations of proposed hunger-controlling hormones ghrelin, leptin, and insulin.Methods: In two crossover studies, 10 postmenopausal women, BMI 23–26 kg/m2 engaged in exercise (EX) and sedentary (SED) trials. Weight maintenance meals were provided at 6 h intervals with an ad libitum meal at 13 h in study 1 and 21 h snack in study 2. EE during IM intervals was measured by indirect calorimetry and included EX EE of 801 kcal in study 1, and 766–1051 kcal in study 2. Hunger was assessed with a visual analog scale and blood was collected for hormonal determination. Results: Hunger displayed a circadian variation with acrophase at 13 and 19 h and was unrelated to preceding EE. Hunger was suppressed by EX between 10 and 16 h and bore no relationship to either EE during preceding IM intervals or changes in leptin, insulin, and ghrelin; however leptin reflected IM energy changes and ghrelin and insulin, prandial events. Conclusions: During non-deprivation meal-to-meal eating, hunger appears to be under non-homeostatic central circadian control as it is unrelated to EE preceding meals or concentrations of proposed appetite-controlling hormones. Gastrointestinal meal processing appears to intermittently suppress this control and entrain an ultradian hunger pattern. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We examined whether sunlight affects hot flushes in working menopausal women and explored effect modification by shift work and season. In this prospective cohort study, daily hot flush score (outcome) was measured by the 7-day North Central Cancer Treatment Group Daily Vasomotor Symptoms Diary. Daily duration of sunlight (≥2000 lux) was recorded by the HOBO MX2202 pendant. Both variables were measured in two 7-day data collection phases. T0 data were collected during the Australian Summer (December 2017, January and February 2018); and T1 data were collected in the Australian winter (June, July and August 2018). Linear mixed effects model was used. Shift work and season were both confounders and effect modifiers. To detect a median effect size of R² = 0.2, 34 women were required to achieve an effective sample size of 41. A total of 49 menopausal women were recruited, 11 shift and 38 day workers. Some 13 women had various missing observations. For shift workers, an hour increase in sunlight exposure was associated with a 1.4-point reduction in hot flush score (p = .016). This relationship was not significant for day workers (p = .185). The finding of this study suggests increased sunlight exposure might improve hot flushes in menopausal shift workers who are moderately bothered by hot flushes, but probably not in day workers. The possible role of shift-work associated circadian disruption on estrogen level in regard to elevated intensity and frequency of hot flush in menopausal women is discussed.

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 73 of Psychoneuroendocrinology (see record 2016-46963-033). In the original article, there were some errors in the abstract and the 4th paragraph of the discussion section. The corrections are present in the erratum.] Distressing symptoms such as hot flashes and sleep disturbances affect over 70% of women approaching menopause for an average of 4–7 years, and recent large cohort studies have shown that anxiety and stress are strongly associated with more severe and persistent hot flashes and can induce hot flashes. Although high estrogen doses alleviate symptoms, extended use increases health risks, and current non-hormonal therapies are marginally better than placebo. The lack of effective non-hormonal treatments is largely due to the limited understanding of the mechanisms that underlie menopausal symptoms. One mechanistic pathway that has not been explored is the wake-promoting orexin neuropeptide system. Orexin is exclusively synthesized in the estrogen receptor rich perifornical hypothalamic region, and has an emerging role in anxiety and thermoregulation. In female rodents, estrogens tonically inhibit expression of orexin, and estrogen replacement normalizes severely elevated central orexin levels in postmenopausal women. Using an ovariectomy menopause model, we demonstrated that an anxiogenic compound elicited exacerbated hot flash-associated increases in tail skin temperature (TST, that is blocked with estrogen), and cellular responses in orexin neurons and efferent targets. Furthermore, systemic administration of centrally active, selective orexin 1 or 2 and dual receptor antagonists attenuated or blocked TST responses, respectively. This included the reformulated Suvorexant, which was recently FDA-approved for treating insomnia. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that dramatic loss of estrogen tone during menopausal states leads to a hyperactive orexin system that contributes to symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and more severe hot flashes. Additionally, orexin receptor antagonists may represent a novel non-hormonal therapy for treating menopausal symptoms, with minimal side effects.

N2  - Study objectives: Women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle exhibit better cognitive performance overnight than women in the follicular phase, although the mechanism is unknown. Given the link between core body temperature (CBT) and performance, one potential mechanism is the thermoregulatory role of progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), and their ratio (P4/E2), which change across the menstrual cycle. We examined the role of P4/E2 in modulating performance during extended wake in premenopausal women. Additionally, we compared the acute effects of nighttime light exposure on performance, CBT, and hormones between the menstrual phases. Methods: Participants were studied during a 50 h constant routine and a 6.5 h monochromatic nighttime light exposure. Participants were 16 healthy, naturally cycling women (eight follicular; eight luteal). Outcome measures included reaction time, attentional failures, self-reported sleepiness, CBT, melatonin, P4, and E2. Results: As compared to women in the luteal phase, women in the follicular phase exhibited worse performance overnight. CBT was significantly associated with performance, P4, and P4/E2 but not with other sex hormones. Sex hormones were not directly related to performance. Light exposure that suppressed melatonin improved performance in the follicular phase (n = 4 per group) to levels observed during the luteal phase and increased CBT but without concomitant changes in P4/E2. Conclusions: Our results underscore the importance of considering menstrual phase when assessing cognitive performance during sleep loss in women and indicate that these changes are driven predominantly by CBT. Furthermore, this study shows that vulnerability to sleep loss during the follicular phase may be resolved by exposure to light. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The aim of the present study was to determine alterations in thyroid blood flow parameters and thyroid volume (TV), measured at inferior thyroid artery (ITA), due to changes in sex hormones and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at four different periods of menstrual cycle (MC) showing infradian rhythm in healthy women. Twenty-two women with regular MC were recruited. Individuals were assessed with hormone levels, and Doppler ultrasound (US) findings at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 of MC. Mean TSH, peak systolic velocity (PSV), resistance index (RI), pulsatile index (PI), and TV were statistically analyzed. Compared to days 3 and 7, significant increases were detected in TSH, TV, and PSV at day 14 (p = 0.005, p = 0.000, p = 0.014; and p = 0.021, p = 0.002, p = 0.021, respectively). No significant differences were found for PI at different periods of MC (p > 0.05). RI significantly decreased at days 14 and 21 when compared to day 3 (p = 0.020 and p = 0.015, respectively). Alterations occur in ITA blood flow parameters and TV along with TSH levels throughout the MC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To examine the patterns and differences among sleep and hot flashes based on menopausal status (pre, peri, or post) in breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy patients before, during, and after treatment. Design: Secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient clinics and participants’ homes. Patients/Participants: Two hundred nineteen (219) women; mean age of 52 years (29-79); postoperative, Stages I to IIIA breast cancer. Methods: Participants were randomized to a behavioral sleep intervention or a healthy eating control group. Variables measured were menopausal status (self-report), subjective sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), objective sleep (actigraphy), perceived interruption of sleep by hot flashes (diary), and demographic/medical characteristics. Data reported were collected 48 hours before initial chemotherapy, at treatment 4, and 30 days after the last treatment. Analysis included descriptives and repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance. Results: Objective sleep and the perceived interruption of sleep by hot flashes changed significantly over time. Sleep and hot flashes differed over time by menopausal status. Only hot flashes were significantly different by study group and by menopausal status over time. Conclusion: Women’s menopausal status when starting chemotherapy was associated with differing patterns of sleep and hot flashes over time.

N2  - Rhythmic events in the female reproductive system depend on the coordinated and synchronized activity of multiple neuroendocrine and endocrine tissues. This coordination is facilitated by the timing of gene expression and cellular physiology at each level of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, including the basal hypothalamus and forebrain, the pituitary gland, and the ovary. Central to this pathway is the primary circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that, through its myriad outputs, provides a temporal framework for gonadotropin release and ovulation. The heart of the timing system, a transcription-based oscillator, imparts SCN pacemaker cells and a company of peripheral tissues with the capacity for daily oscillations of gene expression and cellular physiology. Although the SCN sits comfortably at the helm, peripheral oscillators (such as the ovary) have undefined but potentially critical roles. Each cell type of the ovary, including theca cells, granulosa cells, and oocytes, harbor a molecular clock implicated in the processes of follicular growth, steroid hormone synthesis, and ovulation. The ovarian clock is influenced by the reproductive cycle and diseases that perturb the cycle and/or follicular growth can disrupt the timing of clock gene expression in the ovary. Chronodisruption is known to negatively affect reproductive function and fertility in both rodent models and women exposed to shiftwork schedules. Thus, influencing clock function in the HPO axis with chronobiotics may represent a novel avenue for the treatment of common fertility disorders, particularly those resulting from chronic circadian disruption.

N2  - Background and aim: Cultural variation in pain and headache presentation may exist. The objective of this study was to assess cross-cultural differences in the use of drugs commonly managed to treat and prevent migraine, and to analyze the awareness about symptoms and triggers between two populations of migraneurs in Brazil and Spain. Methods: International cross-cultural study. Patients answered a socio-demographic questionnaire that included questions about trigger factors, and use of drugs to treat and prevent migraine attacks. Results: 292 patients (mean age 34.6 years; 80% females) were included in the study. Most common identified triggers in Brazilian and Spanish patients were: food (30.5% vs 12.6%), sleep (56.7% vs 28.5%), odors (52.5% vs 9.3%), stress (73.1% vs 46.4%), and menstrual period (55.6% vs 38.1%), all p < 0.01. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used drugs to treat migraine attacks. Brazilian migraneurs used less commonly triptans (16.3% vs 47%; p < 0.0001). Prophylactic drugs were used less frequently in Brazil than in Spain (21.9% vs 52.9%; p < 0.0001). Calcium-antagonists, tricyclic anti-depressives, beta-blockers, and anti-epileptic drugs were significantly more used in Spanish migraineurs (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Brazilians migraneurs are more often undertreated for migraine, and underutilization of triptans and preventatives was observed.

N2  - Estrogen is involved in numerous activities in the brain, such as learning, memory, fear, anxiety and mood. However, little is known about the pathways involved in the effects of estrogen in the brain. Therefore, to improve our understanding of the effects of estrogen, we examined the effects of ovariectomy (OVX)—a model of estrogen deficiency and menopause—on psychiatric functions, including voluntary activity. Female Wistar rats underwent OVX or sham operation. Voluntary momentum and circadian activity were monitored at 2 and 6 weeks, respectively. Rats also underwent microdialysis of the amygdala to determine serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine levels. Although the circadian rhythm was unchanged at 2 weeks, voluntary activity at 6 weeks was significantly lower in OVX rats than that in sham rats. This was due to significantly reduced voluntary activity in the 12-h dark phase, while no significant difference was detected in the 12-h light phase. Both 5-HT and dopamine levels in the amygdala were significantly lower in OVX rats than those in sham rats at 6 weeks after the procedure. In conclusion, these results indicate that estrogen is an important mediator of voluntary activity in rats, particularly during the dark phase. These effects of estrogen appear to involve reduced 5-HT and dopamine release in the amygdala. Further studies are needed to determine whether estrogen (and its deficiency) influences the synthesis, vesicular packaging, release, re-uptake and degradation of these transmitters.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSA) is the most common breathing-related sleep disorder and affects more than 20% of older individuals. Furthermore, risk of OSA increases in postmenopausal women. OSA is effectively treated using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, Mary, a 74-year-old White woman with OSA, severe, refused to obtain a CPAP machine because the sound of the machine elicited memories of her late husband’s suicide. Intervention focused on reducing Mary’s fear of CPAP sounds. Treatment involved imaginal exposure, in vivo exposure, sleep hygiene strategies, and relaxation strategies. Although evidence-based treatments for OSA and trauma separately exist, there are no treatment protocols designed to address the specific combination of the conditions. Treatment gains included a reduction in trauma-related symptoms and an increase in CPAP compliance. Quantity and quality of patient’s sleep did not improve despite sleep hygiene and CPAP use. At 3-week follow-up, treatment gains and CPAP compliance were maintained. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Internalizing disorders refer primarily to anxiety and depressive disorders. In the most recent version of the DSM-5, seven distinct anxiety disorders are included: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobia, selective mutism, agoraphobia, and panic disorder. Depressive disorders include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), which is a new diagnosis in the DSM-5, along with major depressive disorder (MDD), persistent depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. For the anxiety and depressive disorders, "other," "unspecified," or "due to medical conditions" categories also exist. There is a physiological, a cognitive, and a behavioral component to internalizing disorders. With anxiety disorders, there is a combination of anticipatory worry, physiological arousal symptoms of anxiety or fear, and behavioral avoidance.These symptoms are out of proportion to any actual threat or danger, so cognitively the threat is overestimated. With depressive disorders, the irritable, hopeless, sad, or flat emotional experience is pervasive. There are accompanying physiologic changes in sleep, appetite, lethargic or agitated motor responses, and energy levels. Common features include cognitive patterns of rumination over negative events and distortions about how events relate to the self. Externalizing problems and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may have overlapping symptoms with internalizing behaviors, including irritability, agitation, and inattention.

N2  - How do singles' strategies for engaging in sexual activity with a new partner vary across the adult lifespan? Using three large and independent demographically representative cross-sectional samples of heterosexual single adults in the U.S., we found that females approaching the typical age of menopause became less likely to establish relationship exclusivity prior to sexual activity with a new partner. However, after the typical age of menopausal onset, females returned to earlier levels of commitment choosiness. These changes in commitment choosiness surrounding the age of menopause were consistent across two studies (including a larger dataset combining two samples). Findings suggest that single females approaching menopause—a major life history milestone—alter their behavior to achieve reproductively relevant partnering goals but abandon this mating strategy once the typical reproductive period has ended. Males exhibited similar, though attenuated, changes in expected relationship commitment before sexual activity during midlife as well. Age-related changes in commitment corresponded with the amount of stress expressed regarding one's “biological clock”. However, reduced commitment choosiness did not vary with frequency of sexual thoughts, frequency of sexual behaviors, or external pressures to find a romantic partner. Results are discussed in terms of life history theory and sex differences in sexuality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of a 48-years old, postmenopausal housewife, with nil contributory family/past medical/past psychiatric or substance related history; hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (for fibroid-uterus) one year ago; presented to us with chief complaints of low mood, feeling anxious, restlessness, and with decreased sleep for one year. On mental status examination patient was looking of her age, dressed appropriately to her socioeconomic status, but had reduced eye contact. Her motor activity was reduced, speech was coherent and relevant but with reduced productivity; with depressed affect, intact abstract and judgment abilities. Therefore, mirtazapine is theoretically not expected to raise prolactin levels, and thus is unlikely to cause galactorrhea. Hence, mirtazapine may be a safe option for those unable to tolerate SSRI-associated galactorrhea, but nevertheless requiring antidepressant treatment for their symptoms.

N2  - Migraine management requires knowledge of both medical and medico-legal aspects. Expert opinions on a clinical case are offered from the unique position of a neurologist who is also an attorney. The case involves a 33-year-old woman who presents with a 12-year history of migraine without aura occurring 2-3 times per week over the last 2 years. Triggers include stress, lack of sleep, and menses. The necessity of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is discussed, including the low probability of any abnormalities. Preventive medication options are reviewed and the patient is started on topiramate. Questions address in the article include: Should an MRI of the brain be routinely discussed as part of the evaluation for migraine? Should an MRI be performed in this patient with migraine and a normal neurological exam? If the patient is concerned about the possibility of a brain tumor or cerebral aneurysm and requests testing that is not medically indicated based upon guidelines, should the physician order that study? What does the physician do if the MRI is rejected in precertification? What medication adverse events should be discussed with the patient before starting a drug? How should the discussion be documented? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article discusses women's oppression, sexism and activism from the point of view of Charlie Gross. Charlie drew on evidence from comparative and physiological psychology to debunk the idea that womenʼs inferiority to men was based on sex differences in biology. He listed a series of biological myths about female inferiority and then debunked them. These included the idea that, among primates, dominance and leadership are male traits. He described a number of primate species where such gender differences do not exist. He argued for consideration of environmental influences and pointed out that male dominance was greatest among those species that lived on the ground rather than in the trees. He next went on to question data arguing that male bonding in primates was a unique evolutionary development that made men more suitable for political leadership and that women are unsuitable for leadership positions because of mood shifts based on the menstrual cycle. He described conflicting data in both areas and noted the absence of research on what is now known as “jet lag” as well as on circadian rhythms in both sexes. Finally, Charlie discussed the evidence for a genetic basis for masculine and feminine characteristics. Charlie has been a rare model of male feminism when some think that it is a contradiction in terms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Breast cancer patients have a high incidence of co-morbid chronic insomnia which frequently persists into survivorship. The mechanism behind this insomnia is poorly understood, yet maladaptive responses to the sleep disturbance resulting from an acute stressor are implicated in cognitive models of insomnia. Evidence suggests that health anxiety, pre-sleep cognitive arousal and compensatory sleep effort may predispose and/or perpetuate psychophysiological insomnia. These mechanisms have not been examined in patients with breast cancer, but if present, may be used to identify individuals at risk for developing chronic insomnia as well as inform intervention. Twenty women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy (age  M = 54.6, SD = 7.9, range = 36-64) and 20 healthy age-matched women without history of breast cancer (age M = 53.6, SD = 7.5, range = 38-69) completed self-assessments and 72-hour wrist actigraphy on two occasions: (a) baseline, which for breast cancer patients was prior to start of chemotherapy (BL); and (b) at a subsequent occasion during or yoked to the last week of cycle 4 of chemotherapy (C4). Two-factor ANOVA revealed that at BL and C4 both groups reported similar levels of insomnia in addition to health anxiety, pre-sleep cognitive arousal and compensatory sleep effort. Actigraphic sleep and menopausal symptoms were also similar. Linear regression-based mediation analyses revealed that at BL, both groups demonstrated an association between health anxiety, compensatory sleep effort and insomnia. At C4, both groups demonstrated an association between compensatory sleep effort, pre-sleep cognitive arousal and insomnia. Additionally, compensatory sleep effort mediated links between health anxiety and insomnia, and pre-sleep cognitive arousal and insomnia. The results validate cognitive models of insomnia and provide support for targeting health anxiety, pre-sleep cognitive arousal and compensatory sleep effort as risk factors for insomnia in women with and without breast cancer.

N2  - Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a complex clinical syndrome that includes many symptoms beyond chronic pain. The studies that have addressed brain morphometry in FMS have had very heterogeneous results. Thus, the question of which specific FMS symptoms and clinical features—pain, but also psychological distress, sleep-related problems, health status, and medication intake—impact on brain morphometry remains open. Here, we wanted to determine if brain changes in FMS are “symptom-related” more than “diagnostic-related”. We performed an observational study of 46 premenopausal women (23 FMS patients and 23 age-matched healthy participants). Magnetic resonance images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and subcortical segmentation. We used multiple regression models to assess the associations between total and local brain volumes and FMS clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we calculated associations between subcortical structures’ shapes and volumes and FMS clinical characteristics. Larger psychological distress, anxiety, and sleepiness, and higher analgesic consumption accounted for 38 % of FMS patients’ smaller total gray matter volume (GMV). For both groups, local decrements of GMV in the medial orbitofrontal cortex were associated to larger psychological distress. Local increases of GMV were positively related to pain scores (superior frontal gyrus), psychological distress (cerebellum), anxiety (medial orbitofrontal cortex), and sleepiness (frontal superior medial cortex). FMS clinical characteristics were also associated to deformations in subcortical structures and volumes changes. This study reveals that total and local GMV changes in FMS go beyond the traditional “pain matrix” alterations. We demonstrated that brain morphology is altered by pain, but also by clinical characteristics that define the FMS experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Whether sleep problems of menopausal women are associated with vasomotor symptoms and/or changes in estrogen levels associated with menopause or age-related changes in sleep architecture is unclear. This study aimed to determine if poor sleep in middle-aged women is correlated with menopause. This study recruited women seeking care for the first time at the menopause outpatient department of our hospital. Inclusion criteria were an age ≥ 40 years, not taking any medications for menopausal symptoms, and no sleeping problems or depression. Patients were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), modified Kupperman Index (KI), and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). A PSQI score of ≥ 7 indicated no sleep disorder and < 7 indicated a sleep disorder. Blood specimens were analyzed for follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels. A total of 244 women were included in the study; 103 (42.2%) were identified as having a sleep disorder and 141 as not having one. In addition, 156 (64%) women were postmenopausal and 88 (36%) were not menopausal. Follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels were similar between the groups. Patients with a sleep disorder had a significantly higher total modified KI score and total MRS score (both, P < 0.001) compared with those without a sleep disorder. Correlations of the PSQI total score with the KI and MRS were similar in menopausal and non-menopausal women. These results do not support that menopause per se specifically contributes to sleep problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To compare characteristics of migraine and some lifestyle habits in migraineurs with and without a positive family history for migraine. Method: The prevalence study was combined with a case-control study and comprised 245 female students with migraine. Results: Out of 245 female students with migraine, 132 (53.9%) had a positive family history for migraine. In comparison with migraineurs who had not, those with a positive family history were younger at the onset of migraine and significantly more frequently reported menstrual migraine (p < 0.001), unilateral pain ( p < 0.05) and pulsate pain ( p < 0.05) as well as severe headache ( p < 0.01). In comparison to migraineurs with a positive family history for migraine, those who did not report a significantly higher frequency of average number of meals per day of <3 ( p < 0.001), missed meals ( p < 0.05) and an average sleep duration of ≤6 h ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: The results of the present study are in line with literature showing a high frequency of positive family history for migraine among migraineurs. They also suggest that subjects with a positive family history have a lower “migrainous threshold” for the development of migraine and that environmental factors are more important for the occurrence of migraine in subjects without a positive family history. Accordingly, the conclusions of this study are limited to reproductive aged women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This chapter discusses the genetics of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by clusters of hyperkinetic motor seizures of frontal semiology appearing from sleep, which vary in intensity and duration. The onset of the epilepsy is usually during childhood or adolescence and the disorder is lifelong but not progressive. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy manifestations can improve after puberty, but there is a marked clinical variability and some patients also experience seizures in old age. The clinical neurologic examination is almost always normal, as well as neuroimaging. Rare exceptions are represented by patients presenting focal brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance abnormalities. A few cases can show positive risk factors for epilepsy (e.g. birth anoxia, febrile convulsions, or head injury), and stress, sleep deprivation, and menstruation can be triggering factors in some patients. The seizures often appear nightly and in clusters, but they can have a variable frequency, ranging from a few attacks per month to several per night. Up to a third of patients present with occasional secondarily generalized seizures or rare seizures during wakefulness Patients can complain of diurnal symptoms such as tiredness and sleepiness due to the sleep integrity disruption caused by the epileptic episodes, especially in patients experiencing many episodes per night. Patients with NFLE show seizures with variable manifestations that, on the basis of the different presentations in intensity and duration, can be classified into three main types: paroxysmal arousals (PA), nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD), and episodic nocturnal wanderings (ENW). There is a characteristic and marked intraindividual stereotypy that is usually maintained over the years, and frequently a marked autonomic activation is a common finding during the seizures. Few patients can present only a single type of seizure, and different seizures tend to overlap in the same patient, the briefest ones often being the initial part of a more prolonged attack.

N2  - Purpose: Melatonin has anti-carcinogenic properties, including modulation of estradiol production, cell cycle regulation, and promotion of apoptosis. Urinary melatonin has been inversely associated with breast cancer in some studies, but the association with ovarian cancer has not been investigated. Methods: We measured urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) in nested ovarian cancer case–control studies in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; n = 100 cases; 199 controls) and NHSII (n = 52 cases; 105 controls); samples were mainly from first morning voids. Controls were matched to cases on year of birth, menopause status, use of menopausal hormone therapy, and urine collection characteristics. We evaluated the association of tertiles of aMT6s, corrected for creatinine concentrations, with risk of ovarian cancer using conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for key ovarian cancer risk factors, and we additionally evaluated adjustment for usual sleep duration, snoring, and history of rotating night shift work. Results: aMT6s was not significantly associated with risk of ovarian cancer. In multivariable models, the odds ratio comparing the highest tertile of aMT6s to the lowest was 0.79, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.40–1.56 in the NHS and 2.88, and 95 % CI in the NHSII 0.97–8.52. Additional adjustment for sleep habits and night shift work had little impact on the observed results. We observed no clear association between urinary melatonin and ovarian cancer risk. Conclusions: These results are consistent with our previous study in which we reported no association between night shift work and ovarian cancer; however, given the small sample size in our study, additional evaluation in larger studies is warranted.

N2  - Study Objectives: To determine the prevalence and polysomnographic correlates of insomnia in subjects with self-reported medical disorders. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Participants: Community-based sample of 3282 men and women aged 18 to 65 years old, with a subset who underwent polysomnography. Measurements: Self-reported measures of sleep habits and current health, and polysomnographic sleep variables. Results: The prevalence of insomnia was 21.4%. The adjusted odds of insomnia were 2.2 times as high in persons with any medical disorders as in those without medical disorders. Specifically, odds of insomnia were higher in people with heart disease (OR = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.2-23], P = 0.004), hypertension (1.5 [12-18], P < 0.001), diabetes (1.4 [105-20], P = 0.04), stomach ulcers (2.1 [1.6-2.7], P < 0.001), arthritis (1.8 [1.5- 2.2], P < 0.001), migraine (1.8 [1.5-2.1], P < 0.001), asthma (1.6 [1.3-2.0], P = 0.04), COPD (1.9 [1.5-2.5], P < 0.001), neurological problems (2.0 [1.5-2.7], P < 0.001), and menstrual problems (1.7 [1.3-2.1], P < 0.001) than in people without these disorders. Prevalence of insomnia increased with increasing number of medical disorders. However, polysomnographic sleep was not significantly different in persons with or without medical disorders for most disorders assessed. Conclusion: This large population-based study suggests that insomnia is highly prevalent in diverse chronic medical disorders. However, polysomnographic evidence of disturbed sleep is present in only a subset of comorbid insomnia populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of 48 year old women, who seeks evaluation of sleep difficulties. She is perimenopausal and notes that over the past year she has had problems with sleep initiation and maintenance. Even though she has no prior history of depression, she has struggled recently with depressed mood. She has had progressive weight gain and snoring. She endorses a dry mouth in the morning, often with frontal headaches that subside within the first hour or two after awakening. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, glucose intolerance, and recent blood pressure elevations. She is not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Physical examination is notable for body mass index (BMI) of 35, neck circumference of 16 ½ inches, and central obesity. She has mild retrognathia with resultant crowding of the oropharynx such that only the hard palate can be visualized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Long sleep duration has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. Inflammation and coagulation have been hypothesized as possible physiological pathways to explain this association, although specific biomarkers have not been studied. Using longitudinal data from 3942 postmenopausal women in the Women’s Health Initiative observational study and clinical trials, we investigated whether fibrinogen, an acute-phase inflammatory protein involved in blood clotting, mediates the associations between sleep duration and coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality among women. Fibrinogen levels were associated positively with self-reported long sleep duration (9+ h per night), CHD and all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for a range of sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. Compared with self reported 7–8 h per night sleep duration, self-reported long sleep duration was associated with increased odds of CHD [odds ratio (OR) = 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–4.11]. Adjustment for fibrinogen levels reduced the increased odds of CHD associated with long sleep by approximately 8 percentage points (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.98–3.97). A similar reduction in the OR was observed with mortality. For both outcomes there is support for partial mediation of 6–7%, suggesting that fibrinogen may be a mechanism through which long sleep duration is associated with CHD and mortality.

N2  - Fibromyalgia, or the fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), is a chronic pain disorder (e.g., fatigue, muscle pain, tenderness, and sleep difficulties) that affects 1% to 5% of the general population. This syndrome is also referred to as "soft-tissue rheumatism." Fibromyalgia is a disorder that intrudes upon the daily lives of people and is a worldwide phenomenon. Fibromyalgia might also include other symptoms such as concentration and memory problems, labile mood, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, painful menstrual cramps, and numbness. Because FMS has no relevant organic pathology, it is placed in the realm of medically unexplained physical symptoms. Recent studies are providing early evidence for the use of EMDR therapy for chronic pain patients. Also, EMDR therapy is being used for other pain conditions, including fibromyalgia. Therefore, the authors created the EMDR Fibromyalgia Syndrome Protocol that includes the Three-Pronged Protocol and an in-depth history of the client's FMS and trauma. More research is needed to support this new protocol. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". This review discusses the unique contribution of nonhuman primate research to our understanding of the neurocognitive effects of estrogens throughout the adult lifespan in females. Mounting evidence indicates that estrogens affect many aspects of hippocampal, prefrontal and cholinergic function in the primate brain and the underlying mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated. In addition, estrogens may also influence cognitive function indirectly, via the modulation of other systems that impact cognition. We will focus on the effects of estrogens on sleep and emphasize the need for primate models to better understand these complex interactions. Continued research with nonhuman primates is essential for the development of therapies that are optimal for the maintenance of women's cognitive health throughout the lifespan.

N2  - This prospective repeated-measures study explored potential factors (postmenstrual age, body weight, gender, chronological age, illness severity, and circadian rhythm) related to preterm infants’ circadian sleep/wake patterns. Circadian sleep/wake patterns were measured using an Actiwatch for 3 continuous days in preterm infants (gestational age of 28-36.4 weeks) in a neonatal intensive care unit and hospital nursery. Potential factors associated with circadian sleep/wake patterns were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation. For our sample of 30 preterm infants, better sleep/wake patterns were associated with male gender, younger postmenstrual and chronological age, lower body weight, and less illness severity. Preterm infants’ total sleep time (B = 41.828, p B = 3.711, p < .01) were significantly longer at night than during the day. These findings can help clinicians recognize preterm infants’ sleep problems, signaling the need to provide individualized support to maintain these infants’ sleep quality during their early life.

N2  - Aim: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep, based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep, which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis that babies have lower saturations while asleep. Methods: We studied infants with CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO₂), heart rate and plethysmographic waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep. Results: Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO₂ values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of 66 (37–130) weeks, for 229 (89–330) min. Mean SpO₂ was 97.6% during sleep and 97.0% awake (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

N2  - Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age‐related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post‐partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post‐partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well‐being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi‐factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well‐being.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effects of bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens (BZA/CE) on sleep parameters and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Methods: This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. Postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and experiencing ≥7 moderate-to-severe hot flushes daily were randomized to BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, or placebo. In these secondary efficacy analyses, the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep scale and Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaires and the Menopause Symptoms Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MS-TSQ) evaluated measures of sleep, menopausal symptoms, and satisfaction with treatment, respectively. Results: A total of 318 subjects (mean age, 53.4 years) received ≥1 dose of study drug. At Week 12, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.45 and 0.625 mg showed significant improvements over placebo in the MOS sleep scale for time to fall asleep, sleep adequacy, sleep disturbance, and sleep problems indexes I and II (P P P P < 0.05), as well as greater satisfaction with sleep quality, ability to control hot flushes during the day and night, effect on mood/emotions, and tolerability. Conclusion: Symptomatic postmenopausal women treated with BZA/CE experienced significant improvements in sleep parameters and overall HR-QOL.

N2  - Objectives: Menopausal symptoms—hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS)—are particularly troublesome for women who have undergone breast cancer treatment. Non-medical treatments, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, are being developed but there is a lack of information about cognitive and behavioural reactions to HF/NS in breast cancer patients. Methods: Thirty-five women who had completed active breast cancer treatment with at least 10 HF/NS per week completed questionnaires assessing HF/NS, mood and beliefs, and took part in interviews to elicit cognitive and behavioural reactions and a thematic content analysis used to analyse the data. Results: The mean weekly frequency of HF/NS was 76 (SD = 46) (57 HF and 19 NS). Smokers reported significantly more night sweats, but BMI and mood were not associated with HF/NS frequency. Cognitive and behavioural responses were varied but broadly similar to those of well women. The main cognitive themes were: embarrassment/social anxiety, loss of control, beliefs about NS, sleep and tiredness, and the main behaviours were: carry on and ignore them, cool down, avoidance, communication with others. Conclusions: The results are discussed within a cognitive behavioural framework and might inform the development of psychological interventions for these treatment related symptoms.

N2  - Presents the case report of a 14-year-old Hispanic girl with no psychiatric history admitted to the inpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry unit for acute onset of psychotic symptoms, including paranoid delusions and disorganization of behavior and speech. Associated symptoms included tangential thoughts, reduced sleep, worsening anxiety, and agitation that required emergency medication. The onset of symptoms, nearly a week before admission, occurred without evidence of substance use or a general medical condition. Before onset of psychotic symptoms, A had experienced premenstrual irritability and anxiety, but had not sought care. With the onset of menses, the symptoms promptly resolved. Without a prodromal phase suggestive of schizophrenia or history of depressive or manic episodes, the diagnosis evaded specification. Given the short duration of treatment and acute presentation, Unspecified psychosis led the differential, with rule/out diagnoses, including brief psychotic disorder; psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.

N2  - Background: It is widely known that menstrual cycle fluctuations can significantly affect a woman's mood, behavior and quality of life over the course of her reproductive years, largely due to reproductive hormonal variations during the course of the menstrual cycle. In fact, women are twice as likely as men to experience a mood disorder. Approximately 85% percent of women experience some form of premenstrual symptom exacerbation (PME) and the majority experience symptoms, which are severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. Little is known, however, about the differences in symptom severity, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women who experience PME with and without psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, little is known about how psychiatric comorbidities affect severity of PME, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception. Methods: This study was conducted using a comparative descriptive design to compare premenstrual symptoms, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women experiencing PME and psychiatric comorbidities to women who experience PME without psychiatric comorbidities. Women with PME were recruited from various nursing organizations using secure online surveys. After collection of socio-demographic information, premenstrual symptom severity was measured with the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), stress with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), quality of life with the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) and healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception were assessed using the Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) & Wellness Self-Perception Scale (WSPS). Data Analysis: The data was cleaned, coded and assessed for outliers and shape of distribution prior to data analysis. Analysis included descriptive statistics to describe key characteristics of the sample, and inferential statistics to test the hypotheses. Results: After controlling for diet, exercise, sleep and caffeine intake, psychiatric comorbidities predicted greater PME symptom severity (beta=0.22; T=2.45; P=0.02), higher perceived stress (beta=0.25; T=2.61; P=0.01), and lower levels of wellness self-perception (beta= -0.30; T= -3.14; P=0.00). Psychiatric comorbidities did not predict quality of life (beta= -0.13; T= -1.28; P=0.20) or healthy lifestyle (beta= -0.13; T= -1.43; P =0.16). Significance: These findings may inform novel pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions and treatment guidelines to achieve optimal symptom management, reduce stress and improve wellness self-perception among women with PME and psychiatric comorbidities.

N2  - Biological rhythms are critical for the timing of hormone secretion, reproduction, and rest-wake activity patterns. Sex differences in daily (circadian) rhythms have been described for a number of species including humans. Women have a higher incidence of sleep disorders than men and are twice as likely to have difficulty falling and staying asleep. Additionally, women report sleep problems that change across their menstrual cycle and during the peri-menopausal period. Hormone replacement studies in women and in animals indicate that estrogen can modify the expression of daily rhythms; however, the exact mechanism and sites of action for steroid hormones have not been determined. Understanding the relationship of gonadal hormones on the normal functioning of circadian rhythms will shed light on the etiology of sex differences in sleep disorders and the basic mechanisms of hormonal regulation of activity patterns. The overarching goal of my research is to determine the mechanisms by which estrogens can modify circadian rhythms both during development and in the adult animal. I hypothesize that estrogens modify the expression of daily and circadian rhythms via the estrogen receptor subtype 1 (ESR1) and via “non-classical” estrogenic mechanisms. I hypothesize that impaired estrogen signaling results in a decreased sensitivity to the light-dark cues that allow normal circadian entrainment. To test these hypotheses I determined if estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) is necessary for normal entrainment to the light-dark (LD) cycle and for the expression of circadian rhythms in activity by characterizing circadian entrainment in intact NERKI and ERKO mice. I also quantified free-running parameters in intact NERKI and ERKO mice and compared them to wildtype (WT) counterparts (Chapter 1). To determine if estrogens alter the ability to respond to changes in the LD cycle via the ESR1 and/or non-classical estrogen signaling, I quantified and compared the behavioral response to light pulse in NERKI and ERKO male and female mice. I also measured the cellular response to light pulse to test the hypothesis that behavioral shifts in light response are mediated through the master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Chapter 2). In addition to describing how impaired response to estrogens at ESR1 modifies circadian rhythms and patterns of daily activity in intact NERKI and ERKO mice, I determined the developmental role of estrogens acting at ESR1 and via non-classical mechanisms by examining circadian behaviors in gonadectomized NERKI and ERKO male and female mice. Specifically, I characterized the circadian behavior of male and female gonadectomized mice with and without estradiol replacement in entrainment and free-running conditions (Chapter 3, 4). Finally, I confirmed the organizational and activational roles of estrogenic modification of circadian rhythms via an ESR1-mediated mechanism by looking at the expression of circadian behaviors with ESR1 over-expressing mice (EROE). I quantified the activity patterns of intact EROE male and female mice in entrained and free-running conditions, and established a role of ESR1 on organization of circadian rhythms during development by looking at behavior of gonadectomized EROE mice compared to control littermates (Chapter 5). I hypothesized that estrogens acting via both organizational and activational mechanisms influence the development and the expression of circadian behaviors in adulthood. I have established that the differential ability to respond to estrogens at ESR1 results in differences in entrainment and circadian rhythms (Chapter 1) and behavioral response to light (Chapter 2). Genotype and sex differences that are present in gonadectomized mice indicate that estrogens acting via ESR1 and “non-classical” pathways during development permanently change circadian rhythms (Chapters 3 and 4).

N2  - Introduction: Victims of child sexual abuse (CSA) often experience symptoms such as recurrent nightmares, which affect their adult life. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of psychotherapy on the quality of life and sleep in a female patient with a previous history of CSA. Methods The patient was climacteric (menopausal transition) and treated in an outpatient clinic. She underwent 40 sessions of psychotherapy and was evaluated before and after the sessions using questionnaires and polysomnography (PSG). Main Outcome Measures: Measurements were taken using the following: Kupperman Index (KI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, and PSG. Reports of dream content were also evaluated during the study. Results: After psychotherapeutic intervention, the frequency of nightmares and their attendant suffering decreased. Additionally, the context of the nightmares changed, and a decrease was noted in the KI, BAI, and BDI parameters. The PSG indicated an increase in rapid eye movement sleep. Conclusion: Psychotherapeutic intervention combined with zolpidem and fluoxetine treatment contributed to a resignification of the dreams of a patient with a history of CSA. The treatment also improved the quality of her dreams and her quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: This study characterized the self-reported reason for a gynecology visit among midlife women in three different practice settings. We hypothesized that women seeking specialty care were more likely to report nonvasomotor symptoms potentially related to the menopausal transition. Methods: Participants were 625 women aged 40–60 seen by gynecologists at three sites: an urban, academic, gynecologic menopause practice (Midlife Practice, or MLP) and urban (site A) and suburban (site B) locations of a general, nonacademic obstetrics and gynecology practice. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire asking them to choose and weigh the reason for their visit as "very much," "somewhat," or "not at all" for 15 common gynecologic and menopausal concerns. Demographic questions included age, self-rated health status, race/ethnicity, difficulty of paying for basics, and education. Comparisons between the three groups were made using parametric and nonparametric tests as appropriate. The main outcome measure was the response to the reason for participants’ visit compared across the three sites. Results: Women presenting to the MLP were significantly older and more likely to report vasomotor symptoms (VMS), moodiness, sexual problems, sleep problems, and weight and to learn more about menopause. When "very much" and "somewhat" reasons were combined, nearly 80% of the MLP responses listed sleep problems, 60% listed vaginal dryness or low desire, 34% listed weight gain, and 30.7% listed mood. Conclusions: Midlife women seeking care in a menopause gynecology practice had significantly more visits for vasomotor and nonvasomotor concerns than did women seeing general gynecologists. Women sought care for a broad range of concerns that are not typically in gynecologists’ scope of practice, including sleep disturbances, moodiness, and weight management.

N2  - Objectives: Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) experience disturbed mood, altered melatonin circadian rhythms, and frequent reports of insomnia during the luteal phase (LP) of their menstrual cycle. In this study we aimed to investigate nocturnal polysomnographic (PSG) sleep across the menstrual cycle in PMDD women and controls. Methods: Seven PMDD women who indicated insomnia during LP, and five controls, spent every third night throughout a complete menstrual cycle sleeping in the laboratory. Results: In PMDD and controls progesterone and core body temperature (BTcore) were elevated during LP compared to the follicular phase (FP). Stage 2 sleep showed a significant main effect of menstrual phase and was significantly increased during mid-LP compared to early-FP in both groups. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for both groups was decreased during early-LP compared to early-FP. Slow wave sleep (SWS) was significantly increased, and melatonin significantly decreased, in PMDD women compared to controls. Conclusions: PMDD women who experience insomnia during LP had decreased melatonin secretion and increased SWS compared to controls. The sleep and melatonin findings in PMDD women may be functionally linked. Results also suggest an altered homeostatic regulation of the sleep–wake cycle in PMDD, perhaps implicating melatonin in the homeostatic process of sleep–wake regulation.

N2  - Objective: Sleep quality is closely related to bone health. Aging and estrogen deficiency are known determinants of poor sleep quality and osteoporosis. However, the impact of aging and menopause on the associations between sleep quality and bone mineral density (BMD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between sleep quality and BMD in Chinese women vary by age groups and menopausal status. Methods: A total of 2067 women aged 18–80 years were included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the score > 7 was indicative of poor sleep quality. BMD was determined using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants were categorized into three age groups. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations between sleep quality and BMD. Covariates included in the models were age, menopausal status, weight, height, percent body fat, physical activity, alcohol drinking, calcium supplement use, marital status, education and metabolic diseases. Results: We observed that poor sleep quality was correlated to low total BMD and legs BMD in middle-aged women after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, when we reran the regression models based on menopausal status in middle-aged women, significant associations between BMD and sleep quality were observed in premenopausal and early postmenopausal groups. Conclusion: Our findings showed a more robust association between sleep quality and BMD in premenopausal and early menopausal groups. Further studies should be conducted to explore whether sleep quality intervention would improve bone health of women in these periods and prevent osteoporosis in their late life.

N2  - Study Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a novel female-specific autotitrating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) algorithm (AutoSet for her, AfH) in premenopausal women relative to a standard autotitrating algorithm (AutoSet, S9) (ResMed Ltd., Bella Vista, New South Wales, Australia). Design: Prospective randomised crossover noninferiority trial. Setting: Tertiary hospital sleep clinic and university research sleep laboratory. Participants: 20 female patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) established on long-term CPAP treatment. Interventions: Treatment with 1 night each of AfH and AutoSet while monitored with overnight laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG); order randomly allocated. Measurements and Results: The primary outcome variables were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI 3%) determined from PSG. Treatment efficacy on the AfH night was noninferior to the AutoSet night as assessed by median (IQR) AHI (1.2 [0.60–1.85]/h versus 1.15 [0.40–2.85]/h, respectively, P = 0.51) and 3% ODI (0.85 [0.25–1.5]/h versus 0.5 [0.25–2.55]/h, respectively, P = 0.83). Other PSG measures were similar, except for the percentage of the night spent in flow limitation, which was lower on the AfH (0.14%) than the AutoSet night (0.19%, P = 0.007). The device-downloaded 95th centile pressure on the AfH night was also lower than on the AutoSet night (10.6 ± 1.7 versus 11.6 ± 2.6 cmH₂O, respectively; mean difference [95% confidence interval]: −1.1 [−2.13 to −0.01] cm H₂O). Conclusion: Among premenopausal women a novel female-specific autotitrating algorithm (AfH) is as effective as the standard AutoSet algorithm in controlling obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The new algorithm may reduce flow limitation more than the standard algorithm and achieve control of OSA at a lower (95th centile) pressure.

N2  - As insufficient sleep and obesity become more widespread, finding strategies to overcome changes in appetite and food cravings after sleep reduction is imperative. This study examined the effects of a high-protein (HP) and high-carbohydrate (HC) breakfast on appetitive sensations, food cravings, and dietary intake after nights of habitual (HS) and curtailed sleep (CS). Twenty-seven non-obese, premenopausal women who reported routinely eating breakfast participated in this randomized crossover study. Participants completed 4 laboratory visits with different combinations of sleep and breakfast conditions. Sleep was reduced by 33% on curtailed nights. At each visit, appetitive sensations were measured before breakfast and every 30 min thereafter throughout the 4-hour visit; area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Food cravings were assessed before and 3.5 h after breakfast. Intake of ad libitum lunch and daily dietary intake were measured. Regardless of the breakfast condition, CS increased hunger (p = 0.043) and desire to eat (p = 0.044) and decreased fullness (p = 0.035). The HP breakfast increased fullness AUC after HS (p = 0.022) but not CS. Regardless of the sleep condition, the changes in food cravings scores were significantly different based on breakfast condition (p = 0.009), with food cravings increased after the HC breakfast and decreased after the HP breakfast. However, breakfast condition did not influence hunger or desire to eat AUC after either sleep condition. Neither the breakfast condition nor the sleep condition influenced lunch and daily energy intake. In conclusion, it appears protein reduces food cravings regardless of sleep condition in this population but obtaining sufficient sleep is necessary to benefit from the effects of high protein intake on fullness.

N2  - There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype. The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145 (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 4.4 d) than among morning (27.7 ± 2.6 d; p  0.01) and intermediate (27.8 ± 3.3 d; p = 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p  0.001) and after limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p  0.05). In multivariable analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p p  0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the reproductive function in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The study examined prevalence of self-reported use of medication recommended or prescribed by a doctor for depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep problems; and modelled baseline factors that predicted use over 3 years for each condition. Methods: Analyses were undertaken on the 2001 and 2004 surveys of mid-aged women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. Dependent variables were self-reported use in past 4 weeks of medications recommended or prescribed by a doctor for depression, anxiety, stress, or sleep problems in 2001 and 2004. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to predict medication use for each condition over 3 years. Results: Prevalence of prescribed medication use (2001, 2004) for each condition was depression (7.2, 8.9 %), anxiety (7.4, 9.0 %), stress (4.8, 5.7 %), and sleep problems (8.7, 9.5 %). Multivariable analyses revealed that odds of medication use across 3 years in all four conditions were higher for women with poorer mental and physical health, using hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or having seen a counsellor; and increased over time for depression, anxiety, and stress models. Medication use for depression was also higher for overweight/obese women, ex-smokers, and unmarried. Medication use for anxiety was higher for unmarried and non-working/low occupational women. Medication use for stress was higher for non-working women. Additional predictors of medication for sleep were surgical menopause, and area of residence. Conclusions: Self-reported use of prescribed medication for four mental health conditions is increased over time after controlling for mental and physical health and other variables. Research needs to explore decision-making processes influencing differential rates of psychoactive medication use and their relationship with health outcomes.

N2  - Background: Sleep is disrupted in depressed subjects, but it also deteriorates with age and possibly with the transition to menopause. The nature of interaction between mood, sleep, age and reproductive state is not well-defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mood and sleep among healthy women in different reproductive states. Methods: We analyzed data from 11 younger (20–26 years), 21 perimenopausal (43–51 years) and 29 postmenopausal (58–71 years) healthy women who participated in a study on menopause, sleep and cognition. The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to assess mood. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ). Objective sleep was measured with all-night polysomnography (PSG) recordings. Perimenopausal and younger women were examined during the first days of their menstrual cycle at the follicular phase. Results: Among younger women, less arousals associated with higher BDI total scores (p = 0.026), and higher SWS percentages with more dissatisfaction (p = 0.001) and depressive-somatic symptoms (p = 0.025), but with less depressive-emotional symptoms (p = 0.001). In specific, less awakenings either from REM sleep or SWS, respectively, associated with more punishment (p = 0.005; p = 0.036), more dissatisfaction (p < 0.001; p = 0.001) and more depressive-somatic symptoms (p = 0.001; p = 0.009), but with less depressive-emotional symptoms (p = 0.002; p = 0.003). In perimenopausal women, higher BNSQ insomnia scores (p = 0.005), lower sleep efficiencies (p = 0.022) and shorter total sleep times (p = 0.024) associated with higher BDI scores, longer sleep latencies with more depressive-somatic symptoms (p = 0.032) and longer REM latencies with more dissatisfaction (p = 0.017). In postmenopausal women, higher REM percentages associated with higher BDI total scores (p = 0.019) and more depressive-somatic symptoms (p = 0.005), and longer SWS latencies with more depressive-somatic symptoms (p = 0.030). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms measured with the total BDI scores associated with sleep impairment in both perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. In younger women, specific BDI factors revealed minor associations, suggesting that the type of sleep impairment can vary in relation to different depressive features. Our data indicate that associations between sleep and depressed mood may change in conjunction with hormonal milestones. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Change in facial expression over a fixed time after a noxious stimulus is the key measure used to calculate pain scores in preterm and newborn infants. We hypothesised that the latency of facial motor responses would be longer in the youngest premature infants and that behavioural scoring methods of pain may need to take this into account. One hundred and seventy-two clinically required heel lances were performed in 95 infants from 25 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Sixty-four percentage of the heel lances evoked a change in facial expression. Change in facial expression was observed in infants across the whole age range from 25 weeks PMA and the latency to the facial expression response ranged from 1 to 17 s. Latency to facial expression change was dependent on the infants’ PMA at the time of the heel lance. Infants below 32 weeks PMA had a significantly longer latency to change in facial expression than older infants (54% increase in infants below 32 weeks; p p > 0.05 for each variable). Intravenous morphine at the time of the heel lance significantly increased the latency to facial expression response (p < 0.001) but the analysis shows that latency is highly dependent on PMA independent of morphine administration. These findings highlight developmental changes underlying infant behaviour that are critically important if pain scores are to be correctly interpreted.

N2  - Sex-specific effects in the clinical presentation and course of bipolar disorder (BD) in women have important treatment implications for the management of symptoms across the menstrual cycle and reproductive lifespan. Women differ from men in the age of onset, clinical pattern of symptoms, and rates and types of psychiatric co-morbidities. For many women with BD, periods of hormonal fluctuation appear to present a unique risk for affective symptoms, thus making treatment challenging. Women with BD compared to without are particularly vulnerable to premenstrual mood symptoms, menstrual abnormalities, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Treatments may involve both psychotropic and gynecological expertise, and patients benefit from collaborative care among their specialist providers. Management of BD in the perinatal period entails many complex decisions. The postpartum period in particular is a time of greatly elevated risk for mood episodes. Use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy and lactation requires a careful risk-benefit analysis for each patient. While maintenance of mood stability is the primary goal, medications must be carefully selected to minimize risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. Behavioural and social interventions should be targeted to minimize stress and prioritize optimal sleep and regular habits. Lastly, women with BD may be at risk for a worsening illness course during the menopausal transition. Pharmacological approaches to mood stabilization are not greatly different in this population, but the elevated risk for sleep impairments should be recognized and any disruption promptly treated.

N2  - Combining historical, juridical and ethnographic analysis, my dissertation traces a history of evidence of reproductive bodies and the not-yet born in the Maghrib over the course of the last century through a case study of a regional phenomenon known as the "sleeping baby in the mother's womb" ( al-raqid; l-raged; bu mergud). Women with sleeping babies experience pregnancies that can last for years beyond the standard nine months accepted in Western law and medicine. According to the belief in the sleeping baby, a sudden traumatic experience or the return of menstrual blood can arrest the development of a fetus in the womb. The fetus will then "sleep" in the womb---"neither living nor dead"---for an indefinite period of time until it is awoken by another traumatic shock, sexual intercourse, or spiritual and herbal treatments. As a legal doctrine in Islamic law, the sleeping baby admitted protracted pregnancies lasting up to five, and in some cases seven, years after conception. Prior to the codification of Islamic family law between 1957-9, which banished the sleeping baby from official law, the sleeping baby phenomenon and discourse addressed the intersection of the psycho-biological and socio-legal aspects of human reproduction. The biological aspects include false or "hysterical" pregnancies (i.e., pseudocyesis), abortion induced by the mother, ectopic pregnancies, and various kinds of miscarriages--both those that are expelled from the mother's uterus and those that are retained--as well as viable, full-term pregnancies in which women give birth to a living baby. The socio-legal aspects include claims to paternity, contestations of paternity, inheritance disputes, spousal and child maintenance claims, adultery, and the status of the children of slave mothers (um walad), and free mothers based on their marital situation. The discourse of the sleeping baby enabled women to express any of the various contingent combinations that could arise from these biological and social contingencies. The dissertation knits together detailed archival analysis of selected published and unpublished family and criminal law cases in French and Arabic from the colonial and postcolonial periods, with ethnographic data gathered from participant observation and extensive interviewing in courts and a public maternity hospital in urban Morocco. In my analysis, I track and examine the diverse forms of evidence in colonial Islamic law (1912-1959) and post-colonial state family law (1959-present) that have taken reproductive bodies and the not-yet born as objects of legal knowledge---a process I term "legal embodiment." By legal embodiment, I mean how human reproductive bodies and their bodily materials emerge in and from historical forms of law, as viable evidentiary objects carrying signifying force. Legal embodiments indicate how reproductive bodies interact with, emerge from and are given value by particular geo-historically circumscribed knowledge, authority and technologies. From women's testimony about their own bodies and midwives' sensory expertise in colonial Islamic courts, to visualizing biomedical technology and DNA testing in postcolonial state family law courts---the diverse set of bodily evidence reveals how diverse legalities that regulate women's reproduction intersect with knowledge, technologies and authority under colonial and post-colonial political-economic power. By tracing legal embodiments, I show how evidence and expertise in Moroccan law have transformed women with sleeping babies from legally-viable reproductive bodies to extra-legal unproductive bodies. Extra-legal embodiment indexes historically minor discourses and practices that law does not value as evidence, and which are deemed irrelevant in law's bodily valuations.

N2  - The 2007 Sleep in America™ poll, a random-sample telephone survey, provided data for this study of sleep in community-dwelling women aged 40 to 60 years. The majority of the respondents were post- or perimenopausal, overweight, married or living with someone, and reported good health. A subsample (20%) reported sleepiness that consistently interfered with daily life; the sleepy subsample reported more symptoms of insomnia, restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, depression and anxiety, as well as more problems with health-promoting behaviors, drowsy driving, job performance, household duties, and personal relationships. Hierarchal regression showed that sleepiness along with depressive symptoms, medical comorbidities, obesity, and lower education were associated with poor self-rated health, whereas menopause status (pre-, peri- or post-) was not. These results suggest that sleep disruptions and daytime sleepiness negatively affect the daily life of midlife women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Ghrelin increases non-REM sleep and decreases REM sleep in young men but does not affect sleep in young women. In both sexes, ghrelin stimulates the activity of the somatotropic and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, as indicated by increased growth hormone (GH) and cortisol plasma levels. These two endocrine axes are crucially involved in sleep regulation. As various endocrine effects are age-dependent, aim was to study ghrelin's effect on sleep and secretion of GH and cortisol in elderly humans. Sleep-EEGs (2300-0700 h) and secretion profiles of GH and cortisol (2000-0700 h) were determined in 10 elderly men (64.0 ± 2.2 years) and 10 elderly, postmenopausal women (63.0 ± 2.9 years) twice, receiving 50 mg ghrelin or placebo at 2200, 2300, 0000, and 0100 h, in this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study. In men, ghrelin compared to placebo was associated with significantly more stage 2 sleep (placebo: 183.3 ± 6.1; ghrelin: 221.0 ± 12.2 min), slow wave sleep (placebo: 33.4 ± 5.1; ghrelin: 44.3 ± 7.7 min) and non-REM sleep (placebo: 272.6 ± 12.8; ghrelin: 318.2 ± 11.0 min). Stage 1 sleep (placebo: 56.9 ± 8.7; ghrelin: 50.9 ± 7.6 min) and REM sleep (placebo: 71.9 ± 9.1; ghrelin: 52.5 ± 5.9 min) were significantly reduced. Furthermore, delta power in men was significantly higher and alpha power and beta power were significantly lower after ghrelin than after placebo injection during the first half of night. In women, no effects on sleep were observed. In both sexes, ghrelin caused comparable increases and secretion patterns of GH and cortisol. In conclusion, ghrelin affects sleep in elderly men but not women resembling findings in young subjects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Context: The loss of progesterone during menopause is linked to sleep complaints of the affected women. Previously we demonstrated sleep promoting effects of oral progesterone replacement in postmenopausal women. The oral administration of progesterone, however, is compromised by individual differences in bioavailability and metabolism of the steroid. Objective: We compared the sleep-endocrine effects after intranasal progesterone (MPP22), zolpidem and placebo in healthy postmenopausal women. Design: This was a randomized double-blind cross-over study. Setting: German monocentric study Participants: Participants were 12 healthy postmenopausal women. Interventions: Subjects received in randomized order four treatments, 2 doses of intranasal progesterone (4.5 mg and 9 mg of MPP22), 10 mg of zolpidem and placebo. Outcome measures: Main outcome were conventional and quantitative sleep-EEG variables. Secondary outcomes were the subjective sleep variables and the sleep related concentrations of cortisol, growth hormone (GH), melatonin and progesterone. Results: Sleep promoting effects were found after the higher dosage of MPP22 and after zolpidem. Zolpidem prompted benzodiazepine-like effects on quantitative sleep EEG as expected, whereas no such changes were found after the two dosages of MP22. Nocturnal progesterone levels increased after 9.0 mg MPP22. No other changes of hormone secretion were found. Conclusions: Our study shows sleep promoting effects after intranasal progesterone. The spectral signature of intranasal progesterone did not resemble the sleep-EEG alterations induced by GABA active compounds. Progesterone levels were elevated after 9.0 mg MPP22. No other endocrine effects were observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep disturbances increase in prevalence during the menopausal transition, with the most common complaint being night time awakenings. Sleep disturbances impact health-related quality of life, work productivity, and health care utilization and can have long-term effects on health and well-being across several years of the menopausal transition. Here, the authors aim to provide an overview of sleep disturbances in the context of the menopausal transition, considering self-reported and objectively measured indicators of sleep. The authors also consider factors that could mediate sleep disturbance, including female sex steroids, vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flashes and sweating), aging, and stressful life events. Finally, they provide an overview of potential treatment options and their efficacy and highlight the need for further research. Understanding the causes as well as effective preventative and treatment strategies for menopausal sleep disturbances is essential for better health, quality of life, and work ability.

N2  - Sleep deteriorates with age. The menopause is often a turning point for women's sleep, as complaints of insomnia increase significantly thereafter. Insomnia can occur as a secondary disorder to hot flashes, mood disorders, medical conditions, psychosocial factors, underlying intrinsic sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or restless legs syndrome (RLS), or it can be a primary disorder. Since unrecognized OSA can have dramatic health-related consequences, menopausal women complaining of persisting sleep disturbances suggesting primary insomnia or intrinsic sleep disorders should be referred to a sleep specialist for a comprehensive sleep assessment. Patients suffering from primary insomnia will be preferentially treated with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin, or with cognitive behavioural therapy. Insomnia related to vasomotor symptoms can be improved with hormone replacement therapy. Gabapentin and isoflavones have also shown efficacy in small series but their precise role has yet to be established. In patients suffering from OSA, non-pharmacological therapy will be applied: continuous positive airway pressure or an oral appliance, according to the severity of the disorder. In the case of RLS, triggering factors must be avoided; dopaminergic agonists are the first-line treatment for moderate to severe disease. In conclusion, persisting sleep complaints should be addressed in menopausal women, in order to correctly diagnose the specific causal disorder and to prescribe treatments that have been shown to improve sleep quality, quality of life and long-term health status.

N2  - Background: This study sought to determine whether trazodone used in hypnotic doses, compared to the hypnotic agent zopiclone, had any specific positive effect on sexual function in non-depressive post-menopausal women with insomnia. Subjects and methods: Fifty (50) subjects participated in the study. Insomnia and sexual performance were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of hypnotic treatment. Results: At week four, both treatments improved sleep quality to a similar degree. Sexual function also improved significantly with both treatments, with no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions: In post-menopausal women, sexual problems and sleep problems may be related and solving sleep problems may help sexual functioning, independently of depression.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of obesity increases during female mid-life and although many factors have been identified, data from Latin America is lacking. Objective: To assess factors related to obesity among middle-aged women and determine the association with depressive symptoms, sedentary lifestyle and other factors. Methods: A total of 6079 women aged 40–59 years of 11 Latin American countries were asked to fill out the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Menopause Rating Scale, the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a general questionnaire containing personal socio-demographic data, anthropometric measures and lifestyle information. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30kg/m². Results: Obesity was observed in 18.5% and sedentary lifestyle in 63.9%. A 55.5% presented vasomotor symptoms, 12.2% had severe menopausal symptoms and 13.2% used hormone therapy for the menopause. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was 46.5% and anxiety 59.7%. Our logistic regression model found that significant factors associated to obesity included: arterial hypertension (OR: 1.87), depressive symptoms (OR: 1.57), sedentary lifestyle (OR: 1.50) diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.34), higher number of individuals living at home (OR: 1.31), sleep problems (OR:1.22), anxiety (OR: 1.21), having a stable partner (OR: 1.20), parity (OR: 1.16) and vasomotor symptoms (OR:1.14). A lower risk for obesity was found among women using hormonal contraceptives (OR: 0.69). Conclusion: Obesity in middle-aged women is the consequence of the interaction of multiple factors. It was associated to hypertension, depressive symptoms, sedentary lifestyle, climacteric symptoms and other factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: To generate a descriptive theory framework regarding the experiences of sleep disturbances among perimenopausal women in Taiwan. Background: Although studies show that some perimenopausal women are troubled by sleep problems, little information was found about the subjective experiences of sleep disturbances among these women. Research is required to explore women’s feelings or perceptions in dealing with their sleep problems. These understandings will be important to help alleviate perimenopausal women’s sleep problems. Design: A grounded theory research design was applied. Method: Twenty-one Taiwanese sleep disturbed women, aged 46–57 years, participated in in-depth interviews. Results: ‘Getting back a good night’s sleep’ was the core theme for describing and guiding the process of the women’s sleep disturbance experiences. During the process, ‘disturbed sleep’ was identified as the antecedent condition that included subcategories: easy awakening, difficulty falling asleep, inner worries, physical discomfort and genetic and bodily constitution. Analyses showed five categories (some with subcategories) of the sleep disturbed women: (i) worsening health status—physical exhaustion, impaired social interactions, emotional swings and decreased work performance; (ii) living with lonely nights—self-help and endurance; (iii) a search for resources to relieve sleep difficulties—doctor shopping, trying alternative therapies, exercising and seeking support; (iv) vicious cycle and (v) acceptance of insomnia. Conclusions: Women expected to relieve their sleep disturbance by finding comprehensive counselling or by their body constitution responding to treatment. Healthcare providers need to value women’s individual concerns and subjective voices. Providers must seek out sleep counselling instead of simply prescribing drugs for their sleep difficulties. Relevance to clinical practice. It is crucial to integrate perimenopausal sleep care by implementing a multidimensional approach such as sleep assessment laboratories, sleep counselling, complementary alternative medicine, sleep strategies and support groups.

N2  - Presents a case report of a 52-year-old woman who was referred for assessment for sleep apnoea in October, 2010, with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and regular waking from sleep with choking and breathlessness. She described regular events-occurring shortly after falling asleep-whereby she would suddenly wake up with a feeling of choking or being strangled for several seconds, accompanied by a sharp, central chest pain. These events were always associated with a feeling of dyspnoea and anxiety, lasting 1–2 min. Her birth, childhood, and developmental history were unremarkable. She had a background of mild asthma. There was no family history of epilepsy. Physical examination was normal. Standard overnight poly somnography demonstrated fragmented sleep and an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 5·4/h. An MRI scan of the brain was normal. A further full-montage overnight sleep EEG, and separate sleep-deprived wake EEG, showed brief focal bursts of irregular theta activity over the left temporal area during frequent awakenings from stage N2 sleep. Initiation of oral levetiracetam, escalated to a dose of 1500 mg nightly, resulted in suppression of almost all the patient’s seizures, with great improvement in sleep quality and daytime functioning. At last follow-up in September, 2013, she was experiencing only very occasional attacks of much reduced severity, which would occur only in the few days preceding her menses.

N2  - Objective: To explore the direct measure of EEG amplitude (range EEG, rEEG) for detection of interburst intervals (IBIs) and bursts in neonates. Methods: Previously described 177 two-channel EEG recordings 3–6 h long from 26 preterm infants (median gestational age of 26 weeks) at 23–38 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) without major abnormalities were used to test four definitions of IBI detection algorithms with various settings of the parameters. Results: As the basis for all four algorithms we developed the aggregation of rEEG signal over the channels by taking its maximum, and method of EEG trace selection at different phases of sleep–wake cycle (with different degree of discontinuity). The two less restrictive algorithms—with one and two amplitude thresholds—turned to be the most promising definitions. There were enough IBI detections for analysis, with no substantial difference in mean and maximum values of intervals. The longest IBI were measured at the location of greater discontinuity. Values of bursts and IBI indices as well as association with PMA were close to the published normative values derived manually. Conclusions: rEEG as a direct measure of EEG amplitude can be used for detection of bursts and IBI. Significance: The automatic measurement of IBI based on rEEG provides a basis for improvements in neonatal brain monitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Salivary steroids are widely used in endocrine research and clinic. In previous studies we have analyzed the dynamics of salivary estradiol and progesterone in men. There is no published information on infradian cyclic patterns of salivary estradiol and progesterone in women. Saliva samples were collected from 17 young healthy women over 30 consecutive days. Concentrations were measured using radioimmunoassay. The data were statistically analyzed using analysis of rhythmic variance (ANORVA) II method for the presence of cyclic patterns with a potential period length between 3 and 15 days. No significant cyclic patterns were found. The inter-individual variability was higher for progesterone (coefficient of variation, CV = 45%) than for estradiol (CV = 30%). The intra-individual variability was even higher for both estradiol (CV = 67%) and progesterone (CV = 87%). These findings show that single time point measurements of these salivary steroids have low informative value and must be taken with caution. Sources of variability beyond the menstrual cycle should be analyzed in further studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - More than 60 percent of American women have trouble sleeping—which isn't surprising, as they have a higher risk of developing sleeping problems. But addressing this issue is more nuanced for women than for men; pregnancy and menopause are just two factors that add complexity to an already difficult problem. At the risk of jeopardizing work, parenting, relationships, or overall health, no woman can afford to deal with sleep deprivation on her own. The author of this book, a nationally recognized leader in the field of sleep medicine, gives readers hope—whether one has occasional restless nights, chronic insomnia, or anything in between. She outlines several methods to overcome sleep issues and improve physical and emotional well-being. From medical sleep aids to non-medical approaches, the book looks beyond the basics of sleep hygiene, helping women to retrain their bodies and minds for a good night's sleep every night. The book addresses the biological changes that may influence women's sleep patterns over time. Women struggle with so many changes during their lives that impact their bodies and their minds; worrying about "doing it all" on a regular basis usually leaves little time for self-care. The main focus of this book is treatment for insomnia, while also helping one, the female reader, understand what one can and can't change about our sleep. Just simply picking up this book and thumbing through it is a major first step in acknowledging that one might want to make some changes to our sleep and overall health. Although there are varying ways to treat insomnia—from over-the-counter herbal remedies and pharmacological interventions to nondrug treatments—this book outlines a very effective insomnia treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.

N2  - Understanding sleep complaints among menopausal women is an emerging area of clinical and research interest. Several recent reviews have focused on mechanisms of menopausal insomnia and symptoms. In this review, we present a discussion on the most relevant and recent publications on the treatment of sleep disorders for menopausal women, with a focus on menopause-related insomnia, insomnia symptoms, and obstructive sleep apnea. We discuss both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), complementary and alternative medicine, hormone replacement therapy, sedative hypnotics, antidepressants, and continuous positive airway pressure. In addition, we briefly discuss methods and considerations of assessment of sleep disorders in menopausal women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The Impact of Chronic Perceived Stress on Perceived Health Status and Symptom Experience in Pre- and Post-Menopausal Women Holly J. Jones Abstract Chronic stress has been recognized as a precursor to poor health outcomes and health disparity. The purpose of this dissertation research study was to evaluate the impact of chronic perceived stress on perceived health status and symptom experience in women before and after menopause. The theory of allostasis was used as the framework for this study and proposes that chronic perceived stress will result in symptom expression or illness if a person in unable to adapt effectively to a stressor(s). In an effort to fully explore this phenomenon, this study was comprised of two parts: 1) secondary analyses of retrospective data exploring symptom experience in a cohort of midlife women who participated in the UCSF Midlife Women's Health Study prior to menopause and, 2) mixed-methods analysis of current data exploring perceived stress and its long-term effects using a smaller sample of the women who participated in the parent study and are now post menopause. Bladder and sleep symptoms were found to be prevalent in the sample. Reproductive status was a significant contributor to the variance in experiencing nocturia. Sleep quality and sleep hours were associated with several determinants of adverse health outcomes: perceived stress, body mass index, and race. Mixed methods analysis found perceived stress scores to be consistent over time in the subsample of African American women and six stress-related themes were identified. Finally, multiple physiological, psychosocial, and demographic factors were investigated to determine their unique contributions to the variance in leukocyte telomere length. Telomere length is recognized as a measure of aging and chronic stress. Despite the small sample size, income, age, perceived stress, and diastolic blood pressure were noted to be influential to having shorter telomere length. The combination of data from a cohort of contemporary women before and after menopause provided a better understanding of the stressors endured over time, symptom experience, coping strategies, and associations with genetic biomarkers. Results from this study should be used to identify vulnerable midlife women and formulate individualized care plans in an effort to decrease morbidity and health disparity.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the most prevalent chronic disease in the aging population. Older women are at greatest risk for CVD, higher than their male counterparts. Disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CVD and CVD risk factors in older women, suggest that current prevention strategies are not effective for these populations. Research shows that post-menopausal women experience difficulty adapting to age-related changes in sleep. Considering 1/3 of the day is spent sleeping, sleep duration is a potential modifiable CVD lifestyle risk factor worthy of greater exploration. Aging research to date has included a focus on the cardiometabolic associations of sleep duration, including large-scale epidemiological studies and meta-analyses concluding that inadequate sleep duration and poor sleep quality are associated with increased development, progression, and severity of CVD and CVD comorbidities. Research, however, has mostly employed self-reported sleep measures, focused on Caucasian populations and has not considered sleep as part of the 24 hour day. There is a need for research to examine the relationship between sleep duration and CVD risk in an older population of women, and to determine if insufficient sleep duration, short or long, is a CVD risk factor worthy of further examination. Methods: This dissertation leverages data from the unique "Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health" (OPACH) study among 6489 women, ages 63 -99, recruited from a Women's Health Initiative cohort. Women wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip for 24 hours per day and completed a daily sleep log over a 7-day period. In addition to accelerometer-measured 24-hour activity data, the OPACH study includes measures of physical functioning, lifestyle questionnaires, and clinical biomarkers. Participants were contacted yearly to provide updated medical history including self-report of CVD events with follow-up up to 5 years. Sleep data were scored according to a standard protocol using sleep logs. Chapter 1 assessed if sleep duration, measured with accelerometers, is associated with numerous cardiometabolic markers, including measures of insulin resistance, inflammation and body composition in older women. Chapter 2 was an examination of the relationship between sleep duration and the Reynolds Risk Score, a clinically relevant composite CVD risk score. In Chapter 3, the relationship between cardiovascular events over 3-5 years of follow-up and self-reported sleep duration and accelerometer-measured sleep duration was examined. Results: Chapter 1 found significant associations between sleep duration and markers of cardiometabolic health. Several of these relationships suggested the relationship was u-shaped, with short and long sleep associated with higher cardiometabolic values. Chapter 2 further explored this relationship and demonstrated that sleep duration is non-linearly associated with 10-year estimated CVD risk among older women. In Chapter 3, there was no significant increase in CVD risk for short or long sleep durations over the 5-year period, measured by self-report or accelerometer. Discussion: The results of this analysis demonstrate sleep duration is related to markers of cardiometabolic health and intermediate CVD risk, but that sleep duration does not independently predict incident CVD. These findings may be explained by the interdependence of 24-hour activities, including sleep duration, and their relationship to cardiometabolic health. While results do not support sleep duration as a risk factor for CVD, they do support sleep duration as a lifestyle behavior worth targeting for cardiometabolic risk reduction in older women. To better understand how sleep relates to cardiometabolic health, we must better understand the interdependence and interrelationships of activities throughout the 24-hour day.

N2  - Chronotype is the behavioral manifestation of an individual’s underlying circadian rhythm, generally characterized by one’s propensity to sleep at a particular time during the 24 hour cycle. Evening chronotypes (“night owls”) generally suffer from worse physical and mental health compared to morning chronotypes (“morning larks”) – for reasons that have yet to be explained. One hypothesis is that evening chronotypes may be more susceptible to circadian disruption, a condition where the coordinated timing of biologic processes breaks down. The role of chronotype as an independent or modifying risk factor for cancer has not been widely explored. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with chronotype in a case-control study nested within the California Teachers Study (CTS) cohort. The study population consisted of 39686 post-menopausal CTS participants who provided information on chronotype by completing a questionnaire in 2012–2013. 2719 cases of primary invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1995/1996 through completion of the chronotype questionnaire were identified by linkage of the CTS to the California Cancer Registry. 36967 CTS participants who had remained cancer-free during this same time period served as controls. Chronotype was ascertained by responses to an abbreviated version of the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and was characterized into five categories: definite morning, more morning than evening, neither morning or evening, more evening than morning, definite evening. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for each of the chronotypes, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had an increased risk of breast cancer with elevated ORs that were statistically significant in both the crude (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10–1.40) and fully-adjusted models (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06–1.35). The risk estimates in the fully-adjusted model for all other chronotypes did not significantly differ from one. These results suggest that evening chronotype may be an independent risk factor for breast cancer among a population of women who are not known to have engaged in any substantial night shift work. Further research in other populations of non-shift workers is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence of migraine was found to be more than three-fold higher in women as compared with men, and in addition to differences in prevalence rates, the characteristics and associated features might also differ between the sexes. The aim of this study was to compare sex-specific features of migraine and demographic parameters in a nationwide population-based study in Turkey. Methods: Among 5323 subjects, a total of 871 patients who were diagnosed as having definite migraine according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders-III (ICHD-III) were included in our study. The demographic characteristics, associated features, and triggers of migraine were examined with regard to sex. Results: The study group comprised 640 women (73.5%) and 231 men (26.5%), with a female to male ratio of 2.8:1. Attack duration, mean migraine disability assessment scores (MIDAS), frequencies of nausea, vomiting, osmophobia, vertigo/dizziness, and allodynia were found significantly different between women and men. When we compared these parameters between men and postmenopausal women, all these parameters were still significant except nausea. Odor was statistically more frequent as a reported trigger in women, whereas excessive sleep was a statistically more frequent triggering factor in men. The rates of depression and allergy were significantly higher in women when compared with men. Conclusion: Longer attack duration, higher MIDAS scores, and the frequencies of nausea, vomiting, osmophobia, vertigo/dizziness, and allodynia were more significant in women and this variance in sex persisted after menopause. Also, some trigger factors and comorbidities differed between the sexes. These findings might result from complex genetic factors besides sociocultural influences, biologic, and sociocultural roles. Future studies should continue to explore biologic and genetic factors with respect to sex in migraine. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - AbstractWe conducted latent class analyses to identify women with homogeneous combinations of lifestyle and behavioral variables and tested whether latent classes were prospectively associated with diabetes incidence for women with or without baseline obesity. A total of 64,710 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years without prevalent diabetes at baseline (years 1993–1998) were followed until 2018 with a mean follow-up of 14.6 years (sd = 6.4). Lifestyle variables included smoking, diet quality, physical activity, and sleep quality. Psychosocial variables included social support, depression, and optimism. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models tested associations between latent classes and diabetes incidence controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and education. During follow-up, 8076 (12.4%) women developed diabetes. For women without baseline obesity, five latent classes were identified. Compared with a lower risk referent, diabetes incidence was higher in classes characterized by high probability of multiple lifestyle and psychosocial risks (HR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.28, 1.64), poor diet and exercise (HR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.13, 1.33), and psychosocial risks alone (HR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.12, 1.29). For women with baseline obesity, four latent classes were identified. Compared with a lower risk referent, diabetes incidence was higher for women with obesity in classes characterized by high probability of multiple lifestyle and psychosocial risks (HR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.32, 1.66), poor diet and exercise (HR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.19, 1.47), and intermediate probabilities of multiple risks (HR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.05, 1.30). Diabetes prevention efforts that focus on diet and exercise may benefit from attention to how lifestyle behaviors interact with psychosocial variables to increase diabetes risks, and conversely, how psychological or social resources may be leveraged with lifestyle changes to reduce the risk for women with and without obesity.

N2  - Subjective, disabling fatigue is a common complaint and a key feature of numerous medical conditions, and is a transdiagnostic feature of psychiatric disorders. Despite physical and mental fatigue being associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life, little is understood about its underlying mechanisms or modulating factors. Women commonly experience exacerbation of other (non-fatigue related) psychiatric symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and report greater fatigue prevalence compared to men. It is therefore plausible that subjective fatigue may similarly fluctuate across the menstrual cycle. Here we compared physical and mental fatigue in the early-follicular (lower ovarian hormones) and mid-luteal (higher ovarian hormones) phases of a single menstrual cycle, while controlling for sleep disruption, in women with (n = 18) and without (non-anxious; n = 20) generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). As expected, women with GAD reported greater physical and mental fatigue than healthy women. Further, although there were no changes in physical fatigue from the early-follicular to mid-luteal phases in both groups, mental fatigue in non-anxious women increased to levels equivalent to those experienced by their GAD counterparts in the mid-luteal phase. Although salivary levels of estradiol and progesterone increased from the early-follicular to mid-luteal phase, hormones did not significantly predict fatigue in either phase. These findings are consistent with the exacerbations of state anxiety and mood disturbance recognised to occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. We speculate that increased mental fatigue in the luteal phase may represent a vulnerable period for the development and maintenance of psychiatric disorders, potentially via compromised emotional regulation.

N2  - Objective: To study the temporal association between growth hormone (GH) and slow wave sleep (SWS) in middle-aged women. Methods: Seventeen premenopausal and 18 postmenopausal women were studied using all-night polygraphic sleep recordings and blood sampling at 20-min intervals. The postmenopausal women were re-studied after six months on hormone therapy (HT) according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Results: The total sleep time (premenopausal 361.9 ± 81.5 min, postmenopausal 358 ± 67.7 min) and the percentages of the sleep stages did not differ between pre- and postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women the first GH peak after sleep onset occurred later and with a more variable time interval compared to premenopausal women. The percentage of SWS was highest 40–20 min prior to the first GH peak after sleep onset in both groups with a higher SWS proportion in premenopausal women (p = 0.048), although the total SWS percent for night did not differ. HT did not affect the distribution of SWS in postmenopausal women. Conclusions: The temporal relationship between GH and SWS in premenopausal women is less robust after menopause and is not improved with HT.

N2  - Aims and objectives: To examine the characteristics of hypertension-related factors in female family caregivers in Japan who provide care in the home, in comparison with general community non-caregivers. Background: Hypertension is more frequently encountered in female caregivers than in non-caregivers. Lifestyle factors including sleep and eating habits differ in Japanese female caregivers and the general population. Therefore, hypertension-related factors in caregivers may also differ from those in the general population. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The subjects were 150 female caregivers (aged 62·4, SD 12·2 years) who provided home care for persons with physical impairments and/or dementia and 154 female controls (aged 62·7, SD 2·2 years) who did not provide home care. Persons with a history of ischaemic heart disease or cerebral stroke were excluded. Subjects were examined using a self-reporting questionnaire that included a food frequency questionnaire and the tri-axial coping scale. Urine examinations and blood pressure measurements were also done. Logistic regression analysis was conducted for each group with the same variables as explanatory variables. Results: Hypertension was present in 46·7% of caregivers and 34·4% of controls (p < 0·05). Menopause was a factor related to hypertension in both the caregivers and controls. In the caregiver group, hypertension was associated with the estimated 24-h Na excretion in urine and the carbohydrate-energy ratio for nutriti. BMI was associated with hypertension in the control group, but not in the caregiver group. Conclusions: Hypertension was associated with nutritional factors, such as greater Na excretion in urine and higher carbohydrate energy ratio, in Japanese female caregivers and with obesity in non-caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice: To prevent hypertension, it is necessary to carefully monitor salt intake and nutritional balance in female caregivers in Japan.

N2  - Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become the cornerstone of treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer. However, treatments are associated with a number of adverse effects that collectively are referred to as andropause syndrome, or the male menopause. Objective: This study explored the experience and impact of andropause symptoms, particularly hot flashes, among men undergoing ADT for metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: Twenty-one men receiving ADT for metastatic prostate cancer underwent a qualitative interview focusing on the adverse effects of ADT and the impact of these symptoms on daily living and coping strategies. Results: The most frequently mentioned adverse effects were hot flashes and night sweats, gynecomastia, cognitive decline, and changes in sexual function. Hot flashes did impact on everyday functioning, and night sweats regularly disturbed sleep patterns and led to participants feeling tired and irritable. Participants reported a lack of control over their hot flashes and night sweats. There was reluctance among our sample to disclose the type of symptoms experienced to others. Conclusion: The occurrence of andropause symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats, was common among this sample. Participants reported a range of cognitive and behavioral responses to these symptoms. There was some reluctance about discussing a prostate cancer diagnosis or the occurrence of symptoms with others. Implications for Practice: The findings have implications for a range of individual and couple interventions to manage the impact of this constellation of symptoms.

N2  - A comparative analysis of melatonin circadian rhythms in Caucasian (incoming population) and Asian (indigenous population) menopausal women with/without sleep disorders depending on the genotype of Clock 3111T/C gene polymorphism was realized.The melatonin level in the saliva was determined four times a day (6:00–7:00, 12:00–13:00, 18:00–19:00, 23:00–00:00 h). The Caucasian women—carriers of the TT-genotype with insomnia as compared to control group—had a higher morning melatonin level and a lower night melatonin level. The Asian women with TT-genotype and insomnia had a lower levels of melatonin as compared to control at daytime, evening and night. A significantly higher melatonin level in the early morning hours was detected in the Caucasian women—carriers of the TT-genotype with insomnia as compared to group womencarriers of the minor 3111C-allele. There were no statistically significant differences in the circadian rhythms of melatonin in the Asian women depending on the genotype of the Clock 3111T/C polymorphism. An assumption with respect to the protective role of the minor allele 3111C in the development of insomnia associated with the displacement of melatonin circadian rhythms in the representatives of the incoming population was made.

N2  - Comments on an article by B. A. Prairie et al. (see record 2015-07600-003). Prairie et al. investigated the co-occurrence of a triad of these symptoms: sleep disorders, depressed mood, and sexual dysfunction. This study is timely, as the authors found, in a representative sample, the co-occurrence of 5% of the mentioned triad. Whether these symptoms were due to hormonal imbalances or age or that they simply co-occur remains to be investigated. There is a lack of information to understand the detrimental effects of a pathological state of humor changes at menopause as well as how much the intensity of symptoms can negatively affect the emotional health of midlife women. Prairie et al. reported that more than a third of their sample referred insomnia complaints, and from these, a higher number referred sexual dysfunction. The commentators point out that indeed, the dyad of symptoms depicts a strong association between sleep quality and its duration and sexual function in women. The Prairie et al. sample was relatively young and older women may have different responses. With an aging population, the expectation is that women live a third of their lives in a postmenopausal stage and therefore this issue needs to be well researched and treated properly. Menopause symptom clusters are relevant to clinical practice (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Group and Self-Help forms of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) are effective treatment options for women with problematic menopausal hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS). However, some women are unable to attend face-to-face sessions. This study investigates whether Self-Help CBT for HF/NS is as effective when rolled out to women living at a distance with minimal telephone guidance. Study design: Forty-seven women completed a Self-Help CBT intervention (booklet and relaxation/paced breathing CD) during a 4-week period. They also received one ‘guiding’ telephone call from a clinical psychologist two weeks into treatment to provide support and discuss individual treatment goals. Questionnaires were collected at baseline, 6 weeks (post-treatment) and 3 months (follow-up) after the end of the intervention. Main outcome measures: HF/NS problem rating. Secondary outcome measures: HF/NS frequency, HF/NS beliefs and behaviours, sleep, anxiety and depressed mood. Results: There was a significant reduction in HF/NS problem-rating following the intervention which was maintained at follow-up. Moreover, women reported less frequent HF/NS along with further improvements in sleep quality, mood and HF/NS beliefs and behaviours. Conclusions: Telephone-guided Self-Help interventions might provide an effective way of widening access to CBT treatment for HF/NS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of B., a 15-year-old Asian-American girl named referred by her outpatient psychiatrist for refusing to attend school, increasing social isolation, poor appetite, low energy, medication nonadherence, and excessive Internet gaming. She was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric service with a plan for transition to longer-term treatment. B. had no perinatal exposures and was the product of a normal vaginal delivery. B. had no previous medical illnesses, surgery, or medical hospitalizations; she does not have any allergies. B. had menarche at age 13 and has had regular menstrual cycles. All laboratory studies were within normal limits, and there were no thyroid or metabolic abnormalities. In summary, B. is a 15-year-old Asian-American girl with history of a suicide attempt, medication nonadherence, and evidence of major depressive disorder manifested by anhedonia, decreased appetite, decreased energy, sleep disturbance, poor concentration, and social withdrawal. B.’s treatment course was characterized by hospitalization for suicidality, aggression, social withdrawal, and symptoms of depression. B.’s negativism, low energy, and disorganization, and the treatment resulted in significant functional improvement. This is an interesting case of a difficult to treat severe mood disorder in an adolescent, for whom a stimulant served as a beneficial adjunct to treatment.

N2  - Chronotype reflects time of day preferences for performing daily activities. Previous research within Asian and European cohorts indicates evening chronotype is associated with elevated cardiometabolic risk. However, evidence is limited from population-based US cohorts, particularly among women in whom evening chronotype prevalence may become higher after middle-age, coinciding with life stages associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This cross-sectional study evaluated associations of chronotype with overall cardiovascular health (CVH), health behaviors, and cardiometabolic risk factors among 506 women (mean age = 37 ± 16y, 62% racial/ethnic minority) in the American Heart Association (AHA)’s Go Red for Women Strategically-Focused Research Network cohort at Columbia University (New York City, NY, USA). Chronotype was assessed using the validated Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and categorized as “evening”, “intermediate”, and “morning” chronotypes. Health behaviors (diet, physical activity, and sleep) were assessed using validated questionnaires. Anthropometrics, clinical blood pressure, and blood biomarkers were assessed at the clinic visit. CVH was evaluated using the AHA Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) metrics; LS7 scores of 0–8 and 9–14 were considered indicative of poor and moderate-to-high CVH, respectively. Linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, and menopausal status were used to examine associations of MEQ scores and chronotype categories with overall CVH, clinical cardiometabolic risk factors, and health behaviors. Overall, 13% of women identified as evening chronotypes, while 55% and 32% reported being intermediate and morning types. In linear models, higher MEQ scores were associated with higher AHA LS7 scores (β(SE) = 0.02(0.01); p = .014), indicative of more favorable CVH, and with health behaviors not included in the LS7. Higher MEQ scores were also associated with lower Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, i.e. better sleep quality, (β(SE) = −0.07(0.02), p p p = .044), and less sedentary time (β(SE) = −0.11(0.03), p = .001). In logistic regression models, evening chronotype, compared to intermediate/morning type, was associated with higher odds of having poor CVH (OR(95%CI):2.41(1.20–4.85)), not meeting AHA diet (OR(95%CI):2.89(1.59–5.23)) and physical activity guidelines (OR(95%CI):1.78(1.03–3.07)), and having short sleep (OR(95%CI):2.15(1.24–3.73)) or insomnia (OR(95%CI):2.69(1.53–4.75)). The evening type compared to morning type was also associated with being a current smoker (OR(95%CI):2.14(1.02–4.52)) and having poor sleep quality (OR(95%CI:2.35(1.27–4.37)) and long sleep onset latency (OR(95%CI:1.89(1.00–3.56)). In our cohort of women, evening chronotype was related to poor CVH, likely driven by its influence on health behaviors. These findings, although warranting confirmation prospectively in other populations, suggest chronotype is an important factor to consider and possibly target when designing lifestyle interventions for CVD prevention.

N2  - Background: This study evaluated pre-defined aspects of content validity of the 18-item NCCN FACT-Ovarian Symptom Index (NFOSI-18) and its Disease-Related Symptoms-Physical (DRS-P) subscale, as clinical trial outcome tools for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Methods: Twenty-one women (mean age 59.5 years) diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer completed the NFOSI-18 and participated in a cognitive interview to explore: (1) whether ‘pain’ and ‘cramps’ are considered redundant; (2) whether ‘fatigue’ and ‘lack of energy’ are overlapping concepts; (3) whether patients consider severity when responding to the item “I am bothered by constipation;” and (4) factors considered when responding to the item “I am sleeping well.” Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively. Results: Pain was associated with discomfort, hurt, and life interference; ‘cramps’ was associated with pain, muscle tightening, and menstrual or digestive issues. Most (81%) considered the items “I have pain” and “I have cramps in my stomach area” to be more different than similar. Participants associated ‘fatigue’ with intense tiredness and ‘lack of energy’ with motivation and capability to complete daily activities. Item comparisons revealed a majority (65%) considered the items to be more different than similar. When responding to “I am bothered by constipation,” patients indicated constipation severity was related to bother. Finally, patients considered disease, treatment, and other factors when responding to “I am sleeping well.” Conclusions: Findings support content validity of the NFOSI-18 and its DRS-P as originally constructed. We propose an alternative scoring option that excludes the item “I am sleeping well” from the DRS-P when used as a symptomfocused index for clinical research in a regulatory context.

N2  - Testosterone (T) and other androgens are incorporated into an increasingly wide array of human sexuality research, but there are a number of issues that can affect or confound research outcomes. This review addresses various methodological issues relevant to research design in human studies with T; unaddressed, these issues may introduce unwanted noise, error, or conceptual barriers to interpreting results. Topics covered are (1) social and demographic factors (gender and sex; sexual orientations and sexual diversity; social/familial connections and processes; social location variables), (2) biological rhythms (diurnal variation; seasonality; menstrual cycles; aging and menopause), (3) sample collection, handling, and storage (saliva vs. blood; sialogogues, saliva, and tubes; sampling frequency, timing, and context; shipping samples), (4) health, medical issues, and the body (hormonal contraceptives; medications and nicotine; health conditions and stress; body composition, weight, and exercise), and (5) incorporating multiple hormones. Detailing a comprehensive set of important issues and relevant empirical evidence, this review provides a starting point for best practices in human sexuality research with T and other androgens that may be especially useful for those new to hormone research.

N2  - This editorial presents an overview of the articles found in this issue of the Journal. These include featured articles on menopause that examine menopause in specific cultural contexts and consider its adverse impact on women. Our authors’ work gives us access to the experiences of women from different cultures— Iran, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. In Iran, the law requires women to wear head-scarves, and like this covering, issues relevant to Iranian women may not be as visible. Similarly, in other cultures women’s experiences around the issue of menopause and the resulting effects may be shrouded. This issue takes up the important task of generating knowledge about cultural perspectives on aspects of menopause, including: the onset of menopause (“Childhood Disadvantages and the Timing of the Onset of Natural Menopause in Latin America and the Caribbean”); its impact of sexual functioning (“Quality of Life and Sexual Function in Postmenopausal Women”); and on women’s emotional well-being (“The Effectiveness of a Group-Based Educational Program on the Self-Efficacy and Self-Acceptance of Menopausal Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial”). I applaud the diversity of research approaches and measures this issue employs in its attention to an experience central to most women—cross-sectional, randomized control trial; the PRECEDE-PROCEED model; and the Cox proportional hazard model. For emerging and more established researchers interested in exploring the experiences of aging women, this issue provides a rich collection of research measures, such as The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire and a quality of life measure such as the WHO Quality of Life–BREF.

N2  - Background: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been associated with decrements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The objective of this study was to assess whether real acupuncture (RA), compared with sham acupuncture (SA), improves PROs in patients with breast cancer who are receiving an adjuvant AI. Methods: Postmenopausal women with a stage 0 through III breast cancer who received an AI and had treatment-associated musculoskeletal symptoms were randomized to receive 8 weekly RA versus SA in a dual-center, randomized controlled trial. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) menopausal symptoms questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the hot flash daily diary, the Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDI), and the European quality-of-life survey (EuroQol) were used to assess PROs at baseline and at 4weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis included 23 patients in the RA arm and 24 patients in the SA arm. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. Compared with baseline, scores in the RA arm improved significantly at week 8 on the CESD (P = .022), hot flash severity (P = .006), hot flash frequency (P = .011), the HFRDI (P = .014), and NSABP menopausal symptoms (P = .022); scores in the SA arm improved significantly on the EuroQol (P = .022), the HFRDI (P = .043), and NSABP menopausal symptoms (P = .005). Post-hoc analysis indicated that African American patients (n = 9) benefited more from RA than SA compared with non-African American patients (n = 38) in reducing hot flash severity (P P < .001) scores. Conclusions: Both RA and SA were associated with improvement in PROs among patients with breast cancer who were receiving AIs, and no significant difference was detected between arms. Racial differences in response to acupuncture warrant further study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Our study objectives were to evaluate the age-related changes in actigraphy measures of sleep duration, continuity, and timing across 12 years in midlife women as they traversed the menopause, and to take into account factors affecting women’s sleep that also change with age. Black, white, and Chinese women were recruited from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to participate in an ancillary sleep study on two occasions over 3 years apart and a third assessment 12 years after the first (N = 300, mean ages, 52, 55, and 64 at the three assessments). Women had at least four consecutive nights of actigraphy (95% with 7 nights) and sleep diaries, and self-reported sleep complaints measured at each time point. Partial correlations adjusted for time between assessments across the 12 years were significant and moderate in size (r’s = .33–.58). PROC MIXED/GLIMMIX multivariate models showed that sleep duration increased over time; wake after sleep onset (WASO) declined, midpoint of sleep interval increased, and sleep latency and number of sleep complaints did not change between the first and third assessments. Blacks and whites had a greater increase in sleep duration than Chinese. Taken together, the results of this longitudinal study suggest that sleep may not worsen, in general, in midlife women. Perhaps, the expected negative effect of aging in midlife into early old age on sleep is overstated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: This study investigated the effect of a brief, simple, home-based yoga program on body pain and health status in child-care workers. Design: This was a randomized, controlled trial comparing a home-based yoga group and a control group. Participants: The trial comprised 98 healthy female nursery school and kindergarten teachers. Interventions: A DVD of a simple home-based yoga program was provided for a period of 2 weeks. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the reported change in body pain at 2 weeks (after intervention) and 4 weeks (follow-up). The secondary outcome measure was the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ30) score and physical function. Results: The 67 yoga group participants reported improved menstrual pain at 4 weeks; menstrual pain was reduced from 57.0 ± 27.8 to 37.8 ± 26.7 in the yoga group, versus 52.4 ± 36.5 to 46.9 ± 32.1 in the control group (change from baseline in the yoga group versus change from baseline in the control group, - 15.3 points; p = 0.044). The total GHQ30 score and the GHQ subscale scores ("sleep disturbance" and "anxiety and dysphoria") improved significantly at 4 weeks in the yoga group, but not in the control group. In the good-adherence group, low back pain improved during the intervention (p = 0.006) and follow-up (p = 0.001) periods. Menstrual pain was also improved (p = 0.044). No adverse events were observed. Conclusions: A home-based simple yoga program may improve the health status of child-care workers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Flight attendants (FAs) may experience circadian disruption due to travel during normal sleep hours and through multiple time zones. This study investigated whether FAs are at higher risk for sleep disturbance compared to teachers, as assessed by questionnaire, diary, and activity monitors. Methods: Sleep/wake cycles of 45 FAs and 25 teachers were studied. For one menstrual cycle, participants wore an activity monitor and kept a daily diary. Sleep metrics included total sleep in the main sleep period (MSP), sleep efficiency (proportion of MSP spent sleeping), and nocturnal sleep fraction (proportion of sleep between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. home time). Relationships between sleep metrics and occupation were analyzed with mixed and generalized linear models. Results: Both actigraph and diary data suggest that FAs sleep longer than teachers. However, several actigraph indices of sleep disturbance indicated that FAs incurred significant impairment of sleep compared to teachers. FAs were more likely than teachers to have poor sleep efficiency [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for lowest quartile of sleep efficiency = 1.9,95% Confidence Interval (Cl) 1.2 - 3.0] and to have a smaller proportion of their sleep between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. home time (adjusted OR for lowest quartile of nocturnal sleep fraction = 3.1, Cl 1.1 -9.0). Discussion: Study FAs experienced increased sleep disturbance compared to teachers, which may indicate circadian disruption. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Depression, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms are common in breast cancer survivors (BCS), especially in younger women diagnosed before menopause. Risk factors and mechanisms for depression in this population are relatively unexplored. In 163 young BCS, vasomotor symptoms were significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms (β = 0.26, p = 0.001) and 64 % of the total effect was mediated through sleep disturbance (beta for specific indirect effect = 1.296, 95 % CI 0.591–2.212). Treatments reducing vasomotor symptoms might alleviate sleep disturbance and depression in this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Jean Arnaud Murat was a physician at the Medical School of Montpellier in France. In 1806 he published his outstanding book “De L’Influence de la Nuit sur les Maladies ou Traité des Maladies Nocturne”. In his book he concentrated on the following questions:1. Does the night has an influence on a disease? 2. Are there diseases in which this is more or less obvious? 3. What is the physical background of this influence?Murat described in detail certain diseases which dominate at night and he concluded that the most evident motivation for his observations is the constant and periodic movement of the earth around its axis, resulting in a period of about 24 h, and the elliptic rotation around the sun. Most important Murat presented for the first time data that the menstrual cycle is not governed by the lunar cycle. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - To date, very little is known about the psychosocial predictors of depression among women with breast cancer (BCA). Even less is known about the psychosocial risk factors for depression across the maturational spectrum. Although premenstrual and postmenstrual women diagnosed with BCA share a substantially elevated risk of developing a major depression; coping resources, life challenges, and cancer impact may differ markedly for younger and older women. The current study examined coping styles, social support quality, stressful life events, sleep quality, and sexual functioning in 122 women, ages 27 to 71, who had completed treatment for BCA within the previous four years. Women (n = 122) were sampled from across the U.S. and U.K. and completed study measures via United States Postal Services. Consistent with previous reports, BCA staging and age were inversely and significantly related (r = −.23,  p = .01) with younger women (p ≤ .017. Sleep quality was also impaired across the sample. The disruption of sleep deprivation on daily activities and depressive symptoms were positively and significantly associated ( r = .33, p ≤ .001). The preferential use of emotion-focused coping strategies increased the risk of depression independently of the number or subjective impact of negative life events. The more that participants utilized emotion-focused coping to deal with high levels of negative life events, the more depressive symptoms they endorsed (mean BDI-II score = 19.95, SD = 7.89). Participants who utilized problem-focused coping when dealing with high levels of negative life events reported comparably lower levels of depressive symptoms (mean BDI-II score = 16.31, SD = 6.67). The current sample preferred emotional support predominately (89%) with very few women preferring tangible support, information or guidance. The discrepancy between social support wanted and that actually received was not significantly correlated with BDI-II scores (r = .145, p = .114). Lastly, sexual functioning, as measured by the Fallowfield Sexual Activity Questionnaire, and depression were significantly and inversely correlated. However, when controlling for age only the Pleasure index was found to be significantly and inversely correlated with depression for younger women (r = −.271, p ≤ .025). For older women, the Habit index (frequency) approached, but did not reach significance (r = −.313, p = .059). In conclusion, younger breast cancer survivors report higher levels of depressive symptoms than older women following breast cancer treatment. Poor coping skills, lack of adequate preferred social support, disruption of sleep quality, and difficulties related to sexually functioning increase the risk of depression for breast cancer survivors. The identification of age-related risk factors for depression may inform early detection, intervention and prevention efforts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The objective of this study was to adapt the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) to women who speak Turkish and are from the Turkish culture, and to assess the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the scale. A convenience sample of women undergoing the menopausal transition or in the postmenopausal period was recruited at one primary health care center in Erzurum, Turkey. The researchers selected consecutive women who applied to the center for health care services. Three hundred sixty-six women were asked to participate in the study and to complete the WHQ during their appointment at the health care center in 2010. In the assessment of construct validity, nine factors were identified: depressed mood; menstrual symptoms; somatic symptoms; anxiety/fears; attractiveness; sexual behaviour; vasomotor symptoms; memory; and sleep problems. The nine factors explained 56.5% of the total variance. The overall internal reliability coefficient of this scale was 0.80. Evidence of the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the questionnaire was provided in this study. The Turkish version of the questionnaire is easy to understand and allows evaluation of women's quality of life for various purposes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To compare clinical manifestations and polysomnographic data of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in younger (less than 30years old) versus older premenopausal women. Methods: A cohort of 420 premenopausal women diagnosed with SDB in a university sleep clinic during a 5-year period underwent systematic collection of clinical and polysomnographic variables. Results: One-hundred and fifteen (27.4%) women were younger than 30 (mean 24.5 ± 3.5 years), while 305 (72.6%) were older than 30 (mean 39.5 ± 5.7 years). The younger premenopausal women had less severe SDB with a trend towards upper-airway resistance syndrome. Despite similar daytime consequences, snoring was less common in the younger group. Both groups of premenopausal women frequently had insomnia and nasal abnormalities or craniofacial-deficiency. Conclusion: Recognizing the different clinical features and understanding the different polysomnographic presentation of SDB in young premenopausal women are crucial to detecting and treating this syndrome.

N2  - In this chapter I will splice together the recent work of the biological anthropologist Sarah Hrdy on cooperative breeding with the insights of gender theory to address the feedback loop between biology and culture—and more specifically the radically altered role of the reproductive clock in the postindustrial era. Hrdy argues that the intricate social dynamics implicit in cooperative breeding (flexibility, strategic investment, "helpers at the nest") were the evolutionary lever of "big brains" in Homo sapiens (Hrdy, 2009). I will focus on the relevant correlates of that evolutionary narrative—postmenopausal (PM) life spans and the hormonally mediated glue that draws myriad adults other than the mother (including surviving grandmothers) to the care of the young. In the first part, I argue that the gendered reproductive clock—which most likely evolved in the Pleistocene along with an inordinately long childhood (Konner, 2010)—has tacitly served to stabilize patriarchal norms and institutions. In the last half-century, however, maternal delay,—amplified by biomedicalization and postindustrialization—has been correlated with what I call the "disestablishment of the biological clock." In the second part, I will argue that the clock is being disestablished as a barometer of values, with implications for the stages of life, the relationship of female to male bodies, and the use-value of offspring. As a result of this disestablishment, professional Western women now strategically "consume" maternity decades past their prime fertile years, when their forebears might have had a last child, or been grandmothers several times over. This biological backstory—and the ongoing feedback loop between biology and culture—has been neglected in more ideologically motivated feminist narrative.

N2  - Background: Menstrual pain is a common problem in women of reproductive age and often interferes with the ability to work and with general well-being. Because painful conditions frequently affect sleep, we investigated the impact of this menstrual disorder on sleep patterns in adult women. Additionally, we examined whether medications used to alleviate menstrual pain promoted changes in sleep. Methods: According to their hormone profiles and menstrual histories, a total sample of 24 women (25–48 years old) who were experiencing their menstrual periods on the day of the polysomnogram (PSG) were included in the study. All of the participants answered questions regarding the presence of menstrual pain and use of medication. Results: Menstrual pain was reported by 66.6% of the women on the night of the PSG. No marked effects were observed on the sleep pattern of these subjects compared with women without menstrual pain. The use of medication did not promote significant changes in the sleep pattern. None of the women were taking oral contraceptives. Conclusions: The presence of menstrual pain or the use of medication to alleviate pain did not significantly alter sleep patterns. Thus, the results suggest that the presence of self-described menstrual pain does not affect sleep patterns in adult women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by Wendy M. Troxel et al. (see record 2010-13854-018). Troxel and colleagues investigate data from the longitudinal Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) on sleep quality in a multi-ethnic menopausal female population. Building on prior work that identifies relationship quality and happiness as independent predictors of good sleep, the authors seek to understand the associations between relationship history (as an improvement on the crude cross-sectional measure of relationship status) and a range of objective and subjective sleep outcomes. They find that a stable relationship history over the preceding 8 years is associated with better sleep quality and continuity, even after adjustment for a range of social and behavioral factors. While this research does not prove causality, the findings suggest that having an enduring relationship has meaningful positive implications for sleep. Relationships may also affect sleep through improved health behaviors, more routine schedules, and greater financial security. Troxel and colleagues offer additional support for the notion that the underlying causes of sleep disorders are socially determined, and are part of a causal chain between social experience and health. Studying sleep through a social epidemiological perspective may create opportunities to design treatments, policies, and interventions that may simultaneously improve population sleep and health.

N2  - Sleep problems and depression are both common and have a high impact on quality of life. They are also strongly associated and commonly occur together. During the reproductive age, both sleep problems and depression are almost twice as common in women than men. Epidemiological studies show that women experience more sleep problems and depressive symptoms around times when sex hormones change, such as puberty and menopause, but it is unclear what effect sex hormones have on sleep problems and depression. This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate studies that investigated the relationship between sex hormones, sleep and depression. Systematic search resulted in 2895 articles, of which 13 met inclusion criteria. Depressed patients showed worse sleep than controls, but no significant difference in endogenous hormone levels was found. Additionally, higher endogenous estrogen was associated with better sleep in controls, but associations between endogenous sex hormones and depressive symptoms were inconclusive. More research on the effect of sex hormones on sleep and depression is necessary. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - While human infants can display distinctive behavioural and physiological spinal cord and brainstem responses to noxious stimulation, it is not known whether cortical neurons are specifically activated by noxious stimuli in newborns. Here, using a novel approach to time-lock an EEG recording to a clinically required heel lance, we show the presence of a distinct nociceptive-specific potential in newborn infants (35–39 weeks postmenstrual age). The potential can be observed in single trials in the central electrodes (Cz and CPz) and using principal component analysis is characterised by a positivity that occurs at approximately 560 ms post-stimulus (N420–P560; P, positive; N, negative). The magnitude of the nociceptive- specific potential is not dependent on sleep state, whereas an earlier potential (N150–P260– N430), which is sleep-state dependent, is evoked by both noxious and non-noxious stimulation. These results provide the first direct evidence of specific noxious-evoked neural activity in the infant brain and suggest that newborn infants are capable of the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain experience.

N2  - The timing of the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which occurs on the evening of proestrus in female mice, is determined by the circadian system. The identity of cells that control the phase of the LH surge is unclear: evidence supports a role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but it is not known whether vasopressinergic neurons are necessary or sufficient to account for circadian control of ovulation. Among other cell types, evidence also suggests important roles of circadian function of kisspeptin cells of the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AvPV) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons of the preoptic area (POA), whose discharge is immediately responsible for the discharge of LH from the anterior pituitary. The present studies used an ovariectomized, estradiol-treated preparation to determine critical cell types whose clock function is critical to the timing of LH secretion. As expected, the LH surge occurred at or shortly after ZT12 in control mice. In further confirmation of circadian control, the surge was advanced by 2 h in tau mutant animals. The timing of the surge was altered to varying degrees by conditional deletion of Bmal1 in AVPCre, KissCreBAC, and GnRHCreBAC mice. Excision of the mutant Cnsk1e (tau) allele in AVP neurons resulted in a reversion of the surge to the ZT12. Conditional deletion of Bmal1 in Kiss1 or GnRH neurons had no noticeable effect on locomotor rhythms, but targeting of AVP neurons produced variable effects on circadian period that did not always correspond to changes in the phase of LH secretion. The results indicate that circadian function in multiple cell types is necessary for proper timing of the LH surge. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The present study aims to compare 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) secretion patterns and levels of cortisol and sex hormones (estradiol, progesterone, DHEA, DHEAS, and testosterone) among rotating night-shift workers and day-shift workers. We performed a cross-sectional study in Cantabria (northern Spain) including 136 women (73 day-shift workers and 63 rotating night-shift workers). Blood and urine samples were obtained after two consecutive working days. Differences in means were estimated using ANCOVA, stratified by menopausal status, ovulation phase, and adjusted for season, age, body mass index, consumption of cigarettes in the last 24 h. aMT6s circadian rhythm was analyzed using the cosinor analysis. The present study showed that rotating night-shift workers had lower excretion of aMT6s than day-shift workers (mesor = 50.26 ng aMT6s/mg creatinine in women with rotating night shift versus 88.79 ng aMT6s/mg creatinine in women with day shift), lower fluctuation (amplitude = 45.24 ng aMT6s/mg creatinine in rotating night-shift workers versus 79.71 ng aMT6s/mg creatinine in day-shift workers), and a later acrophase (aMT6s peak time: 08:31 in rotating night-shift workers versus 07:13 h in day-shift workers). Additionally, women with rotating night shift had higher estradiol and progesterone levels, compared to day workers, especially in the follicular phase on the menstrual cycle.

N2  - Study Objectives: To evaluate the associations between sedentary time, total (total-PA), light (light-PA), moderate (MOD-PA), and vigorous (VIG-PA) physical activity with indices of sleep in postmenopausal women. Methods: Baseline self-reported data from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study (n = 75 074) were used in this cross-sectional analysis. Total-PA, light-PA, MOD-PA, and VIG-PA were categorized by metabolic equivalents of the activity (MET-hour [hr]/week [wk]) and were estimated using validated questionnaires. Sedentary time was categorized by hr/day and was estimated via questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between these variables and short sleep (≤6 hr/night), long sleep (≥ 10 hr/night), poor sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms after adjustment for age, race, socioeconomic status, body mass index, health status, depressive symptoms, smoking status, alcohol use, hormone therapy, and comorbidities. Results: Higher sedentary time (>11 hr/day) was associated with higher odds of short sleep (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72–1.88), poor sleep quality (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.74–1.97), and insomnia symptoms (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.49–1.64). Light-PA (> 0 MET-hr/wk) was associated with lower odds of short sleep (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92–1.00), and higher amounts of total-PA (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84–0.97), light-PA (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–1.00), and MOD-PA (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86–0.97) were associated with lower odds of poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher levels of light and moderate intensity physical activity are associated with better sleep quality, whereas higher amounts of sedentary time are associated with short sleep and lower quality sleep. Future studies should investigate the directionality of these associations and potential causal pathways. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - During the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and breast-feeding periods, as well as in menopausal and post-menopausal periods, the physiological and psychological processes that change according to the hormonal fluctuations influence every women similarly and each one differently. These physiological processes are controlled by neuroendocrine sequences, of which the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis are the most important ones. The hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis affects mood, anxiety, cognition and pain. The interaction of these hormones with mood and behavior is bidirectional. The differences in phenomenology and epidemiology of mood disorders with regards to gender can be explained with the effects of hormones. All of the periods mentioned above are related with mood disorders at terms of risk factors, disease symptoms, progress of disease and response to treatment. Epidemiologic data supports the relationship between the mood disorders and reproductive processes. The prevalence of major depression increases in women with the menarche and ceases in post- menopausal period. Similarly, the initial symptoms of bipolar disorder begins around the menarche period in 50% of the cases. Despite proper treatment, some female patients with major depression experience recurrence during the premenstrual period of their menstrual cycles. The conformity and change in a woman’s brain during pregnancy is controlled dominantly by the neuroendocrine systems, while it is controlled by the external stimuli actively related to the baby during nursing period. The changes that occur are closely related to postpartum mood disorders. Again, all the changes and suspension of medication during this procedure are risk factors for early depressive and dysphoric situations. Variables of a wide range, from follicle stimulating hormone, melatonin, and sleep to body mass index interact with mood disorders in menopausal and post-menopausal periods. Interest on the effects of gonadal steroids on the central nervous system has grown parallel with our increasing knowledge. In the last decade, the place of hormonal treatments in the treatment of mood disorders have been discussed continuously. During this period, along with the anti-depressant efficacy of estrogen, anti-manic efficacy of tamoxifen was also demonstrated in several studies. In this paper, the complex relationship between the physiological changes and the mood disorders during a menstrual cycle, pregnancy, nursing, menopausal and post-menopausal periods are briefly reviewed and discussed over the reproductive hormones in the context of etiology, phenomenology and treatment.

N2  - Due to the adverse effects of medication we decided to provide a safe, economic, and easy intervention to decrease sleep problems in menopausal women. This trial aimed to determine the effect of footbath on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women. One hundred menopausal women were randomly stratified using a permuted block randomization procedure by Random Allocation Software, and assigned to one of two study groups: control (without intervention, n = 50) and intervention (footbath, n = 50). The footbath group was asked to lie their feet into the warm water for 20 min in a container with a depth of 10 cm one hour before the usual sleeping time for 6 weeks. To assess sleep quality, we used the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). To evaluate severity of menopause symptoms, the Greene scale was applied. Before the intervention, 96% of the subjects in the footbath group and 94% in the control group were poor sleepers. The results of analysis of covariance showed significant improvement in sleep quality and decrease in severity of menopause signs in the footbath group compared to the control group. At the baseline, there was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of menopause signs and the global score of PSQI in all study individuals (p ≤ .001, r = .464). The present study findings showed that footbath intervention enhanced sleep quality in menopausal women. Thus, footbath as a safe, simple, and non‐pharmacological application can improve quality of life in postmenopausal women and inhibit problems due to inadequate sleep quality.

N2  - Objective: We aimed to assess the involvement of peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity in the ventilatory pattern during sleep in preterm neonates exposed in utero to maternal smoking. Patients and Methods: Peripheral chemoreceptor activity was measured at thermoneutrality in neonates (postmenstrual age: 36.1 ± 1.2 weeks) born to nonsmoking (n = 21) or smoking (n = 16) mothers by performing a 30-second hyperoxic test during active and quiet sleep. Blood oxygen saturation, baseline ventilatory parameters, and central apnea were monitored. Results: Prenatal smoking exposure did not modify baseline ventilation. It was interesting to note that prenatal smoking exposure decreased the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity during active sleep and increased the response time during quiet sleep. These changes could explain the increase in the time spent in apnea (both with and without blood oxygen desaturation) and in the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation found in neonates exposed to smoking in utero. The involvement of a change in the chemoreceptor function is supported by the fact that the peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity was negatively correlated with the mean duration of apneic episodes with desaturation in the control group only. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that prenatal smoking exposure does not directly modify baseline ventilatory parameters in the neonate but has a negative impact on peripheral chemoreceptor tonic activity. These alterations may increase the risk of sleep respiratory disorders, especially via apnea with desaturation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Insomnia is a frequent postmenopausal symptom and may be due to hormonal changes, depressive states related to this period of life, hot flashes or nocturia. Chiropractic care has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of these symptoms. Objectives: The aim of this study was to review chiropractic interventions in postmenopausal women as a possible management approach to menopausal symptoms and insomnia. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by cross-referencing the key words insomnia, sleep, and menopause with chiropractic. The search used an end date of January 2014 and retrieved 17 articles. Results: Three articles were eligible for the study. All epidemiological data from large surveys demonstrated a lack of evidence for chiropractic intervention as a complementary and alternative therapeutic method in the management of menopausal symptoms and insomnia. Conclusions: There is no evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic intervention as a complementary and alternative therapy for menopausal symptoms and insomnia. Further studies with proper methodological designs are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Disturbed sleep is a core feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized in part by decreased delta power sleep that may result from stress-related alterations in corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) regulation and glucocorticoid signaling. Overnight HPA axis response mediating sleep disturbances in men and women with PTSD was examined using a metyrapone challenge. Metyrapone blocks cortisol synthesis, removing negative feedback, and increases the release of hypothalamic CRF and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Laboratory-based polysomnography was used to monitor the sleep of 66 medically healthy, medication-free men and pre-menopausal follicular phase women including 33 with chronic PTSD (16 women and 17 men) and 33 age- and sex-matched controls (14 women and 19 men) over 3 consecutive nights. Participants completed an overnight metyrapone challenge after an adaptation and baseline night of sleep and ACTH was obtained by repeated blood sampling. Metyrapone resulted in a greater increase in ACTH and greater decreases in cortisol and delta spectral power sleep in PTSD subjects compared to controls, and a greater increase in ACTH in women compared to men. There was no sex difference in metyrapone effects on delta power sleep, and no significant metyrapone by PTSD by sex interactions with either ACTH or delta power sleep. Regression analyses indicated that a greater increase in ACTH response was associated with a greater decrease in delta power sleep response in PTSD subjects, but no such relationship was found in controls. The PTSD group difference was similar in men and women. These results suggest that stress-related alterations of the HPA axis in PTSD may contribute to sleep difficulties. Therapeutics that target the HPA axis may offer promise as a potential future treatment for PTSD and related sleep difficulties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by C. E. Kline et al. (see record 2014-49332-002). The core of the article by Kline et al. relates to sleep hygiene behaviors in midlife women. It is a great contribution to the medical literature since it touches an issue important in the treatment of sleep disorders. The population chosen by the researchers is highly appropriate, as of the participants all sought help related to sleep disorders such as insomnia. Indeed, insomnia is a prevalent disorder and one of the major complaints of midlife women. Commentator's previously noticed that the sleep efficiency is decreased in women of similar demographics as in Kline’s study, and there is an increase in the frequency of insomnia after menopause: 4.3 to 3.5 occurrences per week through the first year post-menopause, and up to 5 times per week after 20 years. Kline et al support a relationship between a mindful attitude and poor sleep hygiene. This is consistent with results from own center, where authors have observed that women who suffer insomnia rated themselves less mindful than women without insomnia in two different mindfulness scales. The commentators invite Kline et al. to include in future studies an analysis on terminal insomnia, since other studies have reported that 20.4% of postmenopausal women have difficulty maintaining sleep at the end of the night, thus waking up earlier than needed.

N2  - A hallmark of biology is the cyclical nature of organismal physiology driven by networks of biological, including circadian, rhythms. Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - To evaluate the effectiveness of a structured education program on lifestyle habits, which is also incorporating teaching on deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided visualization, in the control of various components of the climacteric symptomatology in peri- and postmenopausal women. Sixty-one women aged 40–65 years with varying climacteric and stress symptoms were included in this study. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group (31) or the control group (30). The intervention group followed an 8-week stress management program. The following parameters were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 8-week follow-up period in both groups: climacteric symptoms (Green Climacteric Scale (GCS)), sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), mood status (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale), and health-related control (health locus of control (HLC)). A mixed-model ANOVA showed significant time × group × GCS interaction (within subjects: F = 23.830, p value<0.001; between subjects: F = 39.078, p value<0.001). With regard to HLC, there was a non-significant between subjects but a significant within-subjects effect (HLC × group × time, F = 3.848, p value = 0.024). Regarding DASS scores, there was a significant between-subjects’ effect (F = 10.258, p value = 0.003) but a non-significant within-subjects’ effect. With regard to PSQI, the analysis showed significant within-subjects’ effects (PSQI × group × time: F = 4.691, p value = 0.003) and non-significant between-subjects’ effects (F = 0.022, p = 0.883). Finally, regarding RSS, there was a significant within-subjects’ (RSS × group × time, F = 4.183, p value = 0.029) but non-significant between-subjects’ effect (F = 1.582, p value = 0.213). Stress management may offer an alternative approach to the management of climacteric symptoms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Sleep disorders and sleep-apnea/hypopnea syndromes are very frequent in women, being misdiagnosed in many cases. The menopause, regardless of age, is associated to poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness that can lead to impaired quality of life, and reduced productivity and functioning. Objective: To assess daytime sleepiness and related risk factors among middle aged Ecuadorian women using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study 149 women aged 40–59 years were assessed for hot flush presence and intensity using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and requested to fill out the ESS and a questionnaire containing personal and partner data. Results: Mean age of surveyed women was 47.6 ± 5.5 years, with 67.8% having less than 12 years of schooling, 33.6% being postmenopausal, and 2.7% on hormone therapy. A 10.1% were current smokers and 20.8% were sedentary. According to the MRS (item 1) 51.7% presented hot flushes, which were graded as severe–very severe in 42.8% of cases. Regarding the partner (n = 132), erectile dysfunction was present in 10.6%, premature ejaculation 6.1% and 17.4% abused alcohol. Mean total ESS score was 8 ± 4.4 (median 8), with 33.6% considered having some degree of daytime sleepiness (ESS score ≥10). Logistic regression analysis determined that postmenopausal status (OR 6.58, CI 95% [2.51–17.23], p = 0.001), sedentarism (OR 3.43, CI 95% [1.14–10.26], p = 0.02) and hot flush presence (OR 2.61, CI 95% [1.02–6.65], p = 0.04) among women were risk factors for increased daytime sleepiness (ESS total score ≥10) whereas partner faithfulness decreased this risk (OR 0.47, CI 95% [0.24–0.90], p = 0.02). Conclusion: Increased daytime sleepiness in this middle aged series was related to female (hormonal status and sedentarism) and partner factors; several which are susceptible of intervention.

N2  - Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences. Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism.

In the original article, there were errors in the sentences on page 1401, 1402 and table 5. The corrected sentences and table 5 are present in the current erratum.] In a large observational general practice study (the Standardized Study with Almotriptan in Early Treatment of Migraine [START]), 12.5 mg almotriptan administered within 1 h of pain onset and when pain was mild significantly improved pain-related outcomes, compared with later treatment or when pain was more severe. Migraine triggers at baseline and during treatment were recorded, and it was examined whether trigger factors could affect almotriptan-induced headache improvement. More than 400 patients were enrolled, and 1174 attacks were assessed. At baseline, patients reported a mean of 2.6 types of triggers related to the start of their previous migraine attacks. During the trial, a mean of 1.5 trigger factors for each attack was recorded. The most frequent trigger during the study was stress (37% of migraine attacks), with poor sleep (34%), fatigue (32%) and menses (19%) also being widely reported. Stress and fatigue and/or poor sleep were the most frequent trigger combinations. Early treatment with almotriptan improved clinical outcomes, regardless of the trigger factors involved. Similar results were observed for nonearly administration, although this was less efficacious than early intervention. An exception in the nonearly group was that migraines triggered by poor sleep had better responses than attacks in which sleep disorder was not a factor. Almotriptan maintained its efficacy irrespective of trigger factors in migraine patients treated in everyday clinical practice and, as shown in other studies, it was most effective in reducing pain-free rates when administered early, when pain was still mild.

N2  - Women are twice as likely as men to experience sleep disruptions and insomnia throughout their lifespan. The reason for this sex difference in sleep is unknown. In females, findings from clinical and basic research studies strongly implicate a role for gonadal steroids in sleep modulation. Sleep disruptions and complaints in women typically coincide with marked changes in the gonadal steroidal profile during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Likewise, fluctuations in the ovarian hormonal milieu across the estrous cycle in female rodents correlate with changes in sleep and wakefulness, such that when estradiol levels are elevated sleep is suppressed. In male rodents, sleep remains relatively unchanged following changes in testosterone levels. Here, we sought to address the mechanism by which gonadal steroids selectively suppress sleep in females. Using a rat model, we found that sex differences in sleep resulted from activational effects of estradiol on sexually differentiated brain circuitry. Sexual differentiation of the brain organized the sleep circuitry, specifically the ventrolateral peroptic area (VLPO) and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN). We found that estrogen receptor alpha expression in the MnPN was higher in females compared to males, making this nucleus an ideal target for estradiol's actions on sleep. In females, antagonism of estrogen receptors within the MnPN attenuated the estradiol-mediated suppression of sleep. Furthermore, direct infusion of estradiol into the MnPN induced wakefulness and suppressed sleep. The orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus are regulated by MnPN activity and orexin is a key neuropeptide involved in arousal and suppression of sleep. We hypothesized that estradiol action in the MnPN would release the inhibitory tone on orexin but antagonism of orexin receptors did not completely block estradiol's suppressive effects on sleep. We also found a sex difference in the sleep-promoting effect of the dual orexin receptor antagonists, such that females experienced prolonged wake suppression compared to males. Together, these data begin to address major gaps in our knowledge regarding sex differences and hormonal modulation of sleep. Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying hormonal modulation of sleep is imperative for better treatment of sleep disruption in women.

N2  - Objectives: In sleep laboratory studies, the new environment is generally considered to disturb sleep during the first night. However, older women have rarely been studied. Although menopause and hormone therapy affect sleep, their impact on the first-night effect is virtually unknown. Participants: Four groups of women with no sleep laboratory experience: young on hormonal contraceptives (n = 11, 23.1 [0.5] years), perimenopausal (n = 15, 48.0 [0.4] years), postmenopausal without hormone therapy (HT; off-HT, n = 22, 63.4 [0.8] years) and postmenopausal with HT (n = 16, 63.1 [0.9] years). Procedure: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Polysomnography was performed over two consecutive nights and the first-night effect and group differences were evaluated. Questionnaire-based insomnia and sleepiness scores were correlated to sleep variables and their between-night changes. Results: Although sleep in young women was deeper and less fragmented than in the other groups, first-night effect was similar in all study groups. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and S1 and S2 sleep increased, and wake after sleep onset, awakenings per hour of sleep, S2 and REM latencies, and percentage of SWS decreased from the first to the second night. Perimenopausal women had more insomnia complaints than other women. Insomnia complaints were associated with more disturbed sleep but not with the first-night effect. Conclusions: A first night in a sleep laboratory elicits a marked interference of sleep architecture in women of all ages, with a carryover effect of lighter sleep on the second study night. Menopausal state, HT use, or insomnia complaints do not modify this effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Previous work shows a relationship between measures of morning or evening preference (e.g., morningness–eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) scores) and melatonin and sleep timing, body mass index (BMI) and mood. This study explores the relationship of these factors to atypical depression (ATD) symptoms, particularly increased appetite and hypersomnia, in depressed and non-depressed peri- and post-menopausal women. Participants were 19 normal control subjects and 10 depressed patients, 46–72 years of age. In a university hospital setting, we administered the MEQ and Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders (SIGH-SAD version), which includes a measure of ATD, 3–5 weeks before obtaining nighttime polysomnography and overnight plasma melatonin in dim light (<30 lx). Scores on SIGH-SAD appetite-related items were significantly correlated with MEQ, dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) time and midsleep time (MST); BMI was related to MST, sleep end time, phase-angle differences between sleep and melatonin timing, and appetite measures. Results suggest that relative to women with earlier DLMOs and MSTs, depressed peri- and post-menopausal women whose DLMOs and MSTs are phase-delayed may experience increases in appetite, hypersomnia, and BMI. These symptoms might be relieved by sleep or light manipulations that advance melatonin and sleep timing parameters. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by Oleg Zaslavsky et al. (see record 2015-13561-013). The findings of the study by Zaslavsky and colleagues are likely robust for several reasons. First, their analyses are amply powered by a large, well-characterized, diverse population. Second, the prospective design enables an examination of the sequential development of insomnia in tandem with both physical and mental health issues. Third, unlike most epidemiological studies, Zaslavsky and colleagues utilize a well-validated measure of insomnia. This said, a more systematic assessment of insomnia disorder, along with specific indices of emotional and physical impairment, are warranted. As the population of older women increases, it may also be prudent to measure insomnia disorder in the context of other characteristics, such as neurocognitive health (Alzheimer's disease, dementia), polypharmacy, and role/transitions. Lastly, identification of the underlying pathophysiology and theoretical mechanisms by which insomnia signifies, contributes to, and/or produces the new onset or exacerbation of common physical and emotional impairment that has yet to be delineated. These findings reiterate the importance of carefully assessing insomnia in public health research, especially as women mature. Insomnia is a modifiable risk factor. The cognitive–behavioral treatments known to alleviate insomnia symptoms may have far-reaching implications, not only for women’s proximal emotional and physical health, but also potentially for their longevity. In the context of the multiple challenges that women are likely to face as they age, protecting sleep and preventing insomnia may be key to their well-being.

N2  - Although sleep is of paramount importance for preterm neonates, care of the latter in a neonatal intensive care unit does not favour sleep. Given that several studies in adults have described a ‘vegetative preparedness to sleep’ (in which distal skin vasodilation before lights‐out promotes rapid sleep onset), we looked at whether or not this process operates in preterm neonates. Sleep propensity was assessed in terms of the duration of a spontaneous episode of wakefulness (W). Skin temperatures at six body sites (the abdomen, pectoral region, eye, hand, thigh and foot) were measured (using infrared thermography) during nocturnal polysomnography in 29 9‐day‐old preterm neonates (postmenstrual age: 209 ± 9 days). We then determined whether the duration of the W episode depended upon the local skin temperatures measured at the start, during and end of the episode. The W episode was shorter when distal skin temperatures (thigh, hand and foot) and the pectoral temperature were higher at the end of the episode (i.e. at sleep onset). The relationship with the duration of the W episode was not significant for temperatures measured at the start of the W episode. We observed gradual distal vasodilation at the pectoral region, the thigh, hand and foot (i.e. affecting most of the body's skin surface) during W episodes. Our results constitute initial evidence to show that distal vasodilation may have a key role in facilitating sleep onset in very preterm neonates.

N2  - Rationale and objective: Estradiol decline has been associated with depression and anxiety in post-menopausal women. Agomelatine (Ago) is an agonist of the melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptors and an antagonist of the serotonergic 5-HT2c receptors. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of combining Ago with 17β-estradiol (E2) on ovariectomy (OVX)-induced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in young adult female rats. Methods: OVX rats were treated with Ago (40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 10 days starting 1 week after surgery alone or combined with two doses of E2 (40 μg/kg/day, s.c.) given before behavioral testing. Results: Co-administration of E2 enhanced the anti-depressant and anxiolytics effects of Ago as evidenced by decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test, as well as increased time spent in the open arms and number of entries to open arms in the elevated plus-maze. In parallel, Ago increased hippocampal norepinephrine, dopamine, melatonin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Meanwhile, Ago-treated rats exhibited reduced hippocampal nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) P65 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine level. Ago upregulated estrogen receptor (ER α and β) mRNA expression in the hippocampus of OVX rats and elevated serum estradiol levels. Co-administration of E2 with Ago synergistically decreased NF-kB P65 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased BDNF levels. Conclusion: E2 augmented the neuroprotective effect of Ago in OVX rats via its anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects. The combined treatment of E2 and Ago should be further investigated as a treatment of choice for depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances associated with menopause.

N2  - reactive protein (CRP) levels. Design: Cross-sectional cohort. Setting: The Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort. Participants: 454 untreated OSA patients (380 males and 74 females), mean ± standard deviation age 54.4 ± 10.6 yr. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Participants underwent a sleep study, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging to measure total abdominal and visceral fat volume, and had fasting morning IL-6 and CRP levels measured in serum. A significantly higher correlation was found for BMI than visceral fat volume with CRP and IL-6 levels. Oxygen desaturation index, hypoxia time, and minimum oxygen saturation (SaO2) significantly correlated with IL-6 and CRP levels, but apnea-hypopnea index did not. When stratified by body mass index (BMI) category, OSA severity was associated with IL-6 levels in obese participants only (BMI > 30 kg/m²). A multiple linear regression model with interaction terms showed an independent association of OSA severity with IL-6 levels and an interaction between OSA severity and BMI, i.e., degree of obesity altered the relationship between OSA and IL-6 levels. An independent association of OSA severity with CRP levels was found for minimum SaO₂ only. A similar interaction of OSA severity and BMI on CRP levels was found for males and postmenopausal women. Conclusions: OSA severity is an independent predictor of levels of IL-6 and CRP but interacts with obesity such that this association is found only in obese patients.

N2  - Objective: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is currently considered as a unique condition, but it has been suggested that the prevalence, clinical presentation, and associated conditions may differ by sex or by menopausal status in women. We aimed to assess the prevalence of SDB and associated comorbidities in pre- and postmenopausal women compared with men. Methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort study underwent polysomnography in their home environment and had extensive phenotyping for diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and depression. Results: A total of 2121 subjects (age 40–85 [59 ± 11] years, body mass index 25.6 ± 4.1 kg/m², 1024 men and 1097 women [769 postmenopausal]) were included. SDB prevalence based on an apnea−hypopnea index of > 5/h, > 15/h, > 20/h, and ≥ 30/h, respectively, was 83.8%, 49.7%, 37.5%, and 22.0% in men; 35.1%, 8.6%, 3.3%, and 1.3% in premenopausal women; and 71.6%, 29.4%, 20.7%, and 10.1% in postmenopausal women. In multivariable models, SDB severity was significantly associated with hypertension in women (p = 0.007) (mainly in postmenopausal women) but not in men (p = 0.065), with diabetes in men (p = 0.021) but not in women overall (p = 0.853) or in postmenopausal women (p = 0.725), with metabolic syndrome in men (p = 0.002) and women (p p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.853). Conclusion: SDB prevalence in this middle-aged to-older population was high, particularly in men and postmenopausal women. SDB was associated with hypertension and depression exclusively in women, whereas an association with diabetes was present only in men. These findings suggest that the SDB definition and management recommendations may need to be adapted to these groups' specificities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by S. Alvisi et al. (see record 2014-21494-001). This commentary letter is written in response to the study by Alvisi and colleagues published recently in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, one of the leading journals in the field of sexual medicine. The authors sought to examine the influence of metabolic syndrome and psychopathological variables on sexual function in sexually active premenopausal women. An increased prevalence of female sexual dysfunction in women with metabolic syndrome was reported compared with healthy subjects, indicating that this pathological condition makes a major contribution to impaired sexual response in these women. The number of cardiovascular risk factors for metabolic syndrome was inversely correlated with the Female Sexual Function Index score. Moreover, metabolic syndrome was associated with a reduction in desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm. As the authors pointed out, in fact, genital vascular blood flow impairs some domains of female sexual response in a scenario of endothelial dysfunction found in cardiometabolic risk conditions. The authors to consider including sleep questionnaires such as the Insomnia Severity Index, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to evaluate insomnia, sleep quality, and somnolence in future research. Women with metabolic syndrome will certainly appreciate additional care and clinical interventions to improve their sexual lives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Helena Hachul et al. (see record 2014-54476-022) on the original article (see record 2014-21494-001). The author would like to thank the authors for their letter regarding our recently published paper in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Their comments were appropriate and highlight the complexity of women’s sexuality as well the fact that there are factors other than metabolic disorders that can affect the female sexual response. As pointed out by the authors, besides metabolic syndrome, poor sleep quality and sleep disorders can also deeply affect a woman’s well-being. Indeed, growing evidence suggests a direct link between sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and poor sexual function in women. In light of this evidence, we welcome the suggestions made and intend to include an evaluation of sleep quality in future studies. This will surely lead to better knowledge of the factors influencing women’s sexuality together with improved clinical assistance and tailored treatments aimed at restoring women’s well-being.

N2  - Summary The menopausal period is associated with several complications in women. One of these complications is sleep disorders including insomnia disorder that can affect all aspects of personal life. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I) on insomnia severity and sleep quality among postmenopausal women. This was a randomised clinical trial in which 46 women were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups, one receiving CBT‐I and a control group. The CBT‐I group received six sessions of training, while the control group received only usual care. A demographic questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were used to collect the data. The ISI and PSQI were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks after intervention, and in a 4‐week follow‐up. The Independent t test, the chi‐square test, generalised estimating equation models, and Bonferroni correction were applied to analyse the data. According to our results, in the CBT‐I group compared to the control group, the mean ISI, PSQI, sleep onset latency, sleep time, and sleep quality score reduced continuously from baseline to week 3 and from week 3 to week 6, and remained constant from week 6 to week 10. The mean sleep efficiency score improved significantly from baseline to week 3 in the CBT‐I group and remained unchanged until the end of the study. CBT‐I could significantly improve insomnia severity and sleep quality in postmenopausal women. Therefore, using this method is recommended for menopausal women with insomnia.

N2  - Our objective was to report the co-occurrence of seizures during sleep and epilepsy during the menstrual period in a patient. We observed a 22-year-old woman with seizures during sleep; the seizures were related to menstruation. The episodes were of partial onset and secondarily generalized. She was under drug control. The patient’s neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. Hormonal determination was within normal range for progesterone and estrogens. The polysomongraphy-electroencephalogram (PSG-EEG) disclosed discharges in the left fronto-temporal area. Based on our observations, we recommend serial PSG-EEG to identify discharges in patients with catamenial-sleep epilepsy for a more comprehensive diagnosis.

N2  - Reports an error in "Hypothalamic orexin’s role in exacerbated cutaneous vasodilation responses to an anxiogenic stimulus in a surgical menopause model" by Lauren M. Federici, Izabela Facco Caliman, Andrei I. Molosh, Stephanie D. Fitz, William A. Truitt, Pascal Bonaventure, Janet S. Carpenter, Anantha Shekhar and Philip L. Johnson (Psychoneuroendocrinology, 2016[Mar], Vol 65, 127-137). In the original article, there were some errors in the abstract and the 4th paragraph of the discussion section. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-07435-017). Distressing symptoms such as hot flashes and sleep disturbances affect over 70% of women approaching menopause for an average of 4–7 years, and recent large cohort studies have shown that anxiety and stress are strongly associated with more severe and persistent hot flashes and can induce hot flashes. Although high estrogen doses alleviate symptoms, extended use increases health risks, and current non-hormonal therapies are marginally better than placebo. The lack of effective non-hormonal treatments is largely due to the limited understanding of the mechanisms that underlie menopausal symptoms. One mechanistic pathway that has not been explored is the wake-promoting orexin neuropeptide system. Orexin is exclusively synthesized in the estrogen receptor rich perifornical hypothalamic region, and has an emerging role in anxiety and thermoregulation. In female rodents, estrogens tonically inhibit expression of orexin, and estrogen replacement normalizes severely elevated central orexin levels in postmenopausal women. Using an ovariectomy menopause model, we demonstrated that an anxiogenic compound elicited exacerbated hot flash-associated increases in tail skin temperature (TST, that is blocked with estrogen), and cellular responses in orexin neurons and efferent targets. Furthermore, systemic administration of centrally active, selective orexin 1 or 2 and dual receptor antagonists attenuated or blocked TST responses, respectively. This included the reformulated Suvorexant, which was recently FDA-approved for treating insomnia. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that dramatic loss of estrogen tone during menopausal states leads to a hyperactive orexin system that contributes to symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and more severe hot flashes. Additionally, orexin receptor antagonists may represent a novel non-hormonal therapy for treating menopausal symptoms, with minimal side effects.

N2  - Early nutritional compromise after preterm birth is shown to affect long-term neurodevelopment, however, there has been a lack of early functional measures of nutritional effects. Recent progress in computational electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has provided means to measure the early maturation of cortical activity. Our study aimed to explore whether computational metrics of early sequential EEG recordings could reflect early nutritional care measured by energy and macronutrient intake in the first week of life. A higher energy or macronutrient intake was assumed to associate with improved development of the cortical activity. We analyzed multichannel EEG recorded at 32 weeks (32.4 ± 0.7) and 36 weeks (36.6 ± 0.9) of postmenstrual age in a cohort of 28 preterm infants born before 32 weeks of postmenstrual age (range: 24.3–32 weeks). We computed several quantitative EEG measures from epochs of quiet sleep (QS): (i) spectral power; (ii) continuity; (iii) interhemispheric synchrony, as well as (iv) the recently developed estimate of maturational age. Parenteral nutritional intake from day 1 to day 7 was monitored and clinical factors collected. Lower calories and carbohydrates were found to correlate with a higher reduction of spectral amplitude in the delta band. Lower protein amount associated with higher discontinuity. Both higher proteins and lipids intake correlated with a more developmental increase in interhemispheric synchrony as well as with better progress in the estimate of EEG maturational age (EMA). Our study shows that early nutritional balance after preterm birth may influence subsequent maturation of brain activity in a way that can be observed with several intuitively reasoned and transparent computational EEG metrics. Such measures could become early functional biomarkers that hold promise for benchmarking in the future development of therapeutic interventions.

N2  - The development of pain is common in midlife, resulting in increased health care utilization and costs. The aim of this study was to determine the longitudinal trajectory of overall bodily pain among women during the transition between the reproductive years and menopause. We conducted analyses on a community-based, longitudinal cohort of women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. One thousand four hundred ninety-five women met inclusion criteria, including: 1) defined date of the final menstrual period (FMP), and 2) complete data on Short Form-36 bodily pain. The primary exposure was time to/from the FMP. The primary outcome was the rate of change in Short Form-36 bodily pain, measured on a scale of 0 to 100 with 100 being the most severe pain. We performed within-person trajectory analyses using piecewise regression following nonparametric modeling of functional forms. Mean bodily pain score at the time of the FMP was 29. Mean bodily pain increased at a rate of .26 per year during the transmenopause (the interval spanning 4.5 years before the FMP through .5 years after the FMP), and decreased at a rate of .23 per year after that. Depression and sleep problems were associated with greater increases in pain during the late reproductive years, whereas abdominal cramps at baseline predicted greater decreases in pain during the late reproductive years.

N2  - Maintenance of core temperature is a major component of 24-h energy expenditure, and its dysregulation could contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity. The relationship among temperature, sex, and BMI, however, has not been fully elucidated in humans. This study investigated core temperature in obese and lean individuals at rest, during 20-min exercise, during sleep, and after food consumption. Twelve lean (18.5-24.9 kg/m²) and twelve obese (30.0- 39.9 kg/m²) healthy participants, ages 25-40 years old, were admitted overnight in a clinical research unit. Females were measured in the follicular menstrual phase. Core temperature was measured every minute for 24 h using the CorTemp system, a pill-sized sensor that measures core temperature while in the gastrointestinal tract and delivers the measurement via a radio signal to an external recorder. Core temperature did not differ significantly between the obese and lean individuals at rest, postmeals, during exercise, or during sleep (P > 0.5), but core temperature averaged over the entire study was significantly higher (0.1-0.2°C) in the obese (P = 0.023). Each individual's temperature varied considerably during the study, but at all times, and across the entire study, women were ∼0.4°C warmer than men (P < 0.0001). These data indicate that obesity is not associated with a lower core temperature but that women have a higher core temperature than men at rest, during sleep, during exercise, and after meals.

N2  - Little is known about the regulation of temporal variations of progesterone over the 24-hr span in young cycling women as well as in postmenopausal women. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationships between diurnal variations of progesterone and diurnal variations of hormones of the gonadotropic and corticotropic axes, and to provide further information on the source of progesterone secretion under physiological conditions. Twenty-four-hour hormonal profiles were explored under well-controlled laboratory conditions in 10 healthy women (21–36 yr old) with normal ovulatory cycles during early-mid follicular and late luteal phases, and in 8 healthy postmenopausal women (48–74 yr old). In young cycling women, significant positive relationships were found between progesterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)—but not luteinizing hormone (LH) – profiles during late luteal phase. Conversely, during follicular phase, significant positive relationships were evidenced between progesterone and cortisol profiles, but not between progesterone and FSH or LH. In postmenopausal women, strong positive correlations were found between progesterone and corticotropin (ACTH) or cortisol profiles. The present results indicate that during late luteal phase, temporal progesterone profiles are associated with FSH rather than with LH profiles. They also provide evidence that adrenal cortex is a major—or possibly the only—source of progesterone production during the follicular phase of the normal ovulatory cycle, and probably the only source after menopause.

N2  - Global life expectancy has increased substantially over the last century. For women, this means that they now live nearly one-third of their lives in the climacteric period with the undesirable effects of hypoestrogenism. The consequences of this decrease in estrogen may occur in the short or long term. Among the early manifestations, the most important are vasomotor symptoms, insomnia, increased irritability, anxiety, depression, and loss of memory. Hormonal changes can be responsible for insomnia in the menopause transition and postmenopause, but it can also be caused by biopsychological changes that often happen in women's lives. Many women retire during this time, and may pass through social and health changes. Women can develop "empty nest syndrome," when their children leave home. These changes can lead to depression, a factor which is closely linked to insomnia. In addition, other consequences of hypoestrogenism, such as genital atrophy, nocturia, body pain, and other changes, can lead to sleep fragmentation. The aim of this chapter is not only to review the current literature on the subject but also to describe the pathophysiology of insomnia in postmenopause and the care that can be given by a multidisciplinary team. We highlight the importance of evaluating the patient as a whole, in an individualized and personalized manner. In our view, looking at both the body and the mind, from a hormonal to a biopsychosocial context, is the best approach to effective treatment.

N2  - Primates appear unusual among mammals in the expression of female colorful ornaments in the absence of sex role reversal. Most studies of female ornamentation in primates have focused on the sexual signaling function of female exaggerated ano-genital swellings in female-female competition and male attraction, but other female colorful ornaments, such as red skin coloration, may also contain information about reproductive status and individual characteristics. We analyzed variation in facial and hindquarter coloration (redness and luminance) according to the timing of the fertile phase (intra-cycle variation), the cycle number, whether the cycle was conceptive or non-conceptive (inter-cycle variation), and in relation to individual characteristics (social rank, parity, and body mass) in 12 captive female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). While facial and hindquarter coloration did not accurately indicate the timing of the fertile phase, variation in hindquarter luminance signaled perceptible differences between pre- and post-ovulation stages. Hindquarters became less red, and faces were lighter as the number of consecutive cycles increased. Hindquarters were redder during non-conceptive cycles compared with conceptive ones. Individual variation in skin redness and luminance appeared perceptible under good light conditions. Higher-ranking females had darker hindquarters. We also found that variation in female skin coloration may contain information about differences in body mass but not in parity. Female skin coloration in Japanese macaques may thus be more indicative of inter-cycle variation and various specific female characteristics than the timing of the fertile phase. Our study provides insight into the potential information content of this signal and demonstrates the characteristics that males might be selecting for should males prefer redder females.

N2  - Objective/Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), an independent risk factor for stroke, is associated with worse post-stroke outcomes. Differences in the relationship between SDB and stroke may exist for women versus men. In this population-based study, we compared the prevalence of both pre- and post-stroke SDB by sex. We also explored whether menopausal status is related to post-stroke SDB. Patients/Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of subjects enrolled in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Each subject (n = 1815) underwent a baseline interview including the Berlin Questionnaire to assess pre-stroke SDB risk and, if relevant, questions regarding menopausal status. Subjects were offered overnight SDB screening with a validated portable respiratory device (n = 832 with complete data). Log Poisson and linear regression models were used to assess the differences in SDB between men and women with adjustment for demographics, stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and other potential confounders. Results: Women were less likely than men to be at high risk for pre-stroke SDB (56.6% versus 61.9%) (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.87 for women; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.95). A lower proportion of women than men (50.8% versus 70.2%) had post-stroke SDB by respiratory monitoring (PR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63–0.80). SDB severity was higher for men than for women (mean difference in respiratory event index [REI] 6.5; 95% CI, 4.3–8.7). No significant association existed between post-stroke SDB and either menopausal status or age at menopause. Conclusions: After acute ischemic stroke, SDB was more prevalent and more severe in men than in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The menopause transition is a time when women experience an increased risk for new onset depression, as well as relapse of depression. While there are overlapping symptoms between major depression and depression during menopause, differences suggest ‘perimenopausal depression’ may be a unique subtype of depression associated with characteristic symptoms. There is currently no validated scale designed to measure perimenopausal depression. The aim of the current study was to develop and validate the ‘Meno-D’, a self-reporting or clinician rated questionnaire, designed to rate the severity of symptoms of perimenopausal depression. The development phase of the Meno-D involved literature review, clinical observation, and focus groups. A 12-item questionnaire was developed and clinically reviewed for face validity for content. The Meno-D was administered to women experiencing symptoms of perimenopausal depression as part of a larger baseline assessment battery. Validation involved confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The development of the Meno-D resulted in 12 items. A total of 93 participants with perimenopausal depression were involved in the baseline assessments, 82 completed the Meno-D. Factor analysis identified five subscales of the Meno-D “somatic; cognitive; self; sleep; sexual” with high-internal consistency; discriminant validity and a good construct and convergent validity. The Meno-D provides a unique tool for clinicians and researchers to measure the presence of perimenopausal depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Reproductive function is essential to the survival of all species. In mammals and other vertebrates, the control of reproduction relies on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, with the primary driving force provided by hypothalamic GnRH neurons. In the median eminence, the decapeptide GnRH are released in a unique pattern from GnRH neuroterminals into the portal capillary system as part of reproductive cycle. During aging, the biological rhythms of GnRH release are altered in a species-specific manner, with a reduction of GnRH pulsatility and surge in aging female rats resulting in reproductive senescence, which happens much earlier than gonadal failure in rats. Relatively few studies have focused on regulation of GnRH release at the neuroterminal level in the median eminence during reproductive aging. Therefore, the aims of this dissertation are to 1) Study the regulation of GnRH secretion at the neuroterminal level, focusing on glutamate transmission; 2) Ascertain the interaction between GnRH neuroterminals and their surrounding microenvironment focused on glial cells and the portal capillary system in the median eminence; and 3) Analyze age and hormone effects on GnRH neuroterminals and their microenvironment. An aging ovariectomized female rat model was used to study the effects of age and hormones on GnRH neuroterminal system. Fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used in conjunction with several imaging analysis tools. I mastered the use of cryo-embedding multi-probe immunogold labeling electron microscopy, which was essential to visualize and quantify the ultrastructral changes in GnRH neuroterminals. I combined the serial electron microscopy with cryo-embedding immunogold electron microscopy preparation and developed a new technique to examine biological markers with a three-dimensional perspective at the cellular level. Results from a series of four research projects showed: 1) There is a novel glutermatergic pathway in GnRH neuroterminals, which may regulate GnRH secretion; 2) There are dramatic age related morphological changes in the GnRH neuroterminal /glia/ portal capillary system of the median eminence that may be involved in reproductive senescence and other neuroendocrine system impairments with age; 3) Serial electron microscopy combined with immunogold labeling technique is a useful method to study the regulation of neuronal signaling pathway. Although my studies were performed on a rat model, it seems reasonable to predict that some of these changes in the median eminence with age may apply to other species, including humans, relevant to some of the menopausal symptoms in women.

N2  - Osteoporosis is an important public health problem worldwide. Although a number of factors that affect bone structure have been described; thus far, the current knowledge of occupational factors that may have an influence on bone tissue metabolism is strongly limited. Published studies indicate night shift work and the related circadian rhythm disruption may be considered as plausible underlying factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential association between night shift work and bone mineral density (BMD) among female blue-collar workers in Poland. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 194 female blue-collar workers >40 years of age employed in industrial plants. The operating system of work consisted of three work shifts clockwise rotation: morning (06:00–14:00 h), afternoon (14:00–22:00 h), and night (22:00–06:00 h), with five consecutive shifts per week followed by a free weekend. A questionnaire survey, based on a Polish version of The European vertebral osteoporosis study (EVOS) questionnaire, a validated instrument, was administered. Data on current job characteristics, job seniority, and lifetime duration of night shift work were also collected. BMD of the lumbar spine and hip (both total femur and femoral neck) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Multivariate linear regression models were run, with bone mineralization parameters as dependent variables, as well as night work characteristics and important confounders. Statistical analysis was performed separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The analyses adjusted for confounders did not reveal any significant differences between current or lifetime experience of night shift work and BMD among both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, the outcomes supported the well-established correlation with factors, such as age, BMI, and menopausal status. BMD at the three sites measured was significantly associated with BMI (p p p < .001). The study findings indicate that in the population of Polish female blue-collar workers, the system of work does not seem to be associated with the development of osteoporosis.

N2  - Increased sensitivity to light-induced melatonin suppression characterizes some, but not all, patients with bipolar illness or seasonal affective disorder. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), categorized as a depressive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), have altered sensitivity to 200 lux light during mid-follicular (MF) and late-luteal (LL) menstrual cycle phases compared with normal control (NC) women. As an extension of a pilot study in which the authors administered 500 lux to 8 PMDD and 5 NC subjects, in the present study the authors administered 200 lux to 10 PMDD and 13 NC subjects during MF and LL menstrual cycle phases. Subjects were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) in dim light (p = .040), and was significantly greater in PMDD in the MF (30.8%) than in the LL (-0.15%) phase (p = .047). Additionally, in the LL (but not the MF) phase, % suppression after 200 lux light was significantly positively correlated with serum estradiol level (p = .007) in PMDD patients, but not in NC subjects (p > .05).

N2  - Objective: The association between sleep and the menstrual cycle in the adolescent population has been scarcely studied. This study aimed to investigate the association between sleep duration and menstrual cycle irregularity among female adolescents using nationwide representative data from the South Korean population. Methods: This population-based, cross-sectional study used the data collected from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010–2012, and the data from 801 female adolescents were analyzed. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk of menstrual cycle irregularity in relation to sleep duration. Results: Subjects with menstrual cycle irregularity accounted for 15% (N = 120). The mean sleep duration in subjects with menstrual cycle irregularity was significantly shorter than that in those without (p = 0.003). Menstrual cycle irregularity prevalence tended to decrease as sleep duration increased (p for trend = 0.004), which was significantly different based on sleep duration and presence of depressive mood (p = 0.011). Sleep duration ≤ 5 h per day was significantly associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity compared with that in the subjects whose sleep duration is ≥ 8 h per day even after adjusting for confounding variables. The odds ratios of menstrual cycle irregularity tended to increase for shorter sleep duration in all adjusted models. Conclusion: This study found a significant inverse association between sleep duration and menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adolescents. Increasing sleep duration is required to improve the reproductive health of female adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Men and women differ in sleep duration and timing of sleeping. Men sleep shorter and are later chronotypes, thus go to bed and get up later than women. This sexual dimorphism in chronotype is most striking between the beginning of puberty and beginning of menopause indicating the possibility of a sexually selected trait. Sleep duration, however, is different between the sexes already before and after the reproductive phase, suggesting a trait that is not under sexual section. In men, the most influential predictor of mating success was extraversion, followed by age, propensity to stay out late and evening orientation. This was confirmed by structural equation modeling showing both, an indirect and a direct fitness benefit of eveningness even when imposing extraversion and age as important predictor variables. As eveningness is related to an array of problematic behaviors, we suggest that it can be viewed as a kind of handicap. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sex and gender differences occur during normal sleep and at sleep-wake transitions and may influence the prevalence and presentation of sleep disorders across the lifespan. These differences are influenced by neuroanatomy, hormones, and chronobiological and psychosocial factors. Fluctuations in reproductive hormones influence women's sleep during puberty, across menstrual cycles, and throughout pregnancy and menopause (Paul, Turek, & Kryger, 2008). Levels of testosterone change more slowly over the male lifespan, but they also have an influence on sleep. Although understudied, stress, social roles, and other psychosocial issues also influence sleep and may partially explain some of the observed gender differences; and gender differences in sleep or underlying sleep mechanisms may contribute to disorders such as depression that are more prevalent in women. Understanding gender-related differences in sleep and factors that contribute to these differences and their consequences is necessary to guide gender-specific care related to sleep promotion and prevention and management of sleep disorders. The purpose of this chapter is to describe sex and gender differences in normal sleep throughout the lifespan and hormonal changes that affect sleep in women and men that may underlie risk for the development of sleep disorders. In this chapter, gender refers to gender identity within the context of relationships to the society and culture that may evolve over time. The term "sex" is defined by genetic sex, gonadal sex, and phenotypic sex (Paul et al., 2008). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Co-morbidities in men and women with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) were compared retrospectively to an age-standardized, general Finnish population. The prevalence of diseases was based on the reimbursement refunds of medications. Methods: Two hundred thirty-three age- and BMI-matched male–female pairs and 368 consecutive women identified from our sleep recording database were included. Data on medication were gathered from the National Agency for Medicines and Social Insurance Institution database. Results: Men with SDB had three-fold prevalence of reimbursed medication for diabetes and two-fold prevalence of reimbursed medication for chronic arrhythmia. Women with SDB had three-fold prevalence of reimbursed medication for thyroid insufficiency, and postmenopausal women had two-fold prevalence of reimbursed medication for psychosis. BMI and age did not explain prevalence of reimbursed medications for chronic arrhythmia or psychosis. In both genders with SDB, prevalence of reimbursed medications compared to the general population was two-fold for hypertension and seven-fold for asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Partial upper airway obstruction was associated with three-fold prevalence of reimbursed medication for asthma and/or COPD in both genders and 60% reduced prevalence of reimbursed medication for hypertension in females matched for age and BMI. Conclusions: Co-morbidity profile differed between genders. Our results emphasize the importance of diagnosis and treatment of co-morbidities and partial upper airway obstruction.

N2  - Aims and objectives: To examine the psychometric properties of the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale. Background: Sleep disturbances are an extensive and common problem among menopausal women. However, no unique and specific scale has yet been developed to detect the inductive symptoms distresses that cause poor sleep quality for menopausal women. Design: A cross‐sectional design. Methods: The Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale was based on in‐depth interviews with menopausal women and literature review. Convenience sampling was employed. One hundred and fifty three women participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis, concurrent validity and contrasting group validity were used to examine the validity of the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale. Cronbach's α was conducted to test the reliability. The accuracy of the scale was analysed with the receiver operating characteristic from MED CALC version 10.4.8.0 software. The scale's sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were analysed to locate the best cut‐off point. Results: One factor was generated by Exploratory factor analysis, and this factor explained 49·07% of total variance. In addition, the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale had significant positive correlations with the Greene Climacteric Scale and the self‐evaluation of menopausal symptoms scale. Cronbach's α of the Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale was 0·89. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy probability of the scale's receiver operating characteristic curve was 0·85. The best cut‐off point was three with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 87%. Conclusions: The Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale had good reliability and validity, as well as refined indicators for assessing the tool's accuracy. Relevance to clinical Practice: The Menopausal Symptoms Distress Affecting Sleep Quality Scale is easy to use, can quickly detect the sleep conditions of menopausal women who suffer from menopausal symptom distress, and provide efficient nursing interventions to relieve menopausal symptom distresses, and then improve sleep quality.

N2  - Menstrual symptoms may have a significant impact on women’s lives. Many women experience menses-related health problems, such as menstrual pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and premenstrual syndrome, during their reproductively fertile years. Circadian misalignment in shift workers has been reported to contribute to menstrual cycle irregularity and/or painful menstruation. However, the relationship between social jetlag (SJL) and menstrual symptoms/menstrual cycle has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to elucidate this relationship among female university students. One-hundred and fifty female university students (mean [SD]: 18.8 [0.71]-years old) completed self-reported questionnaires consisting of menstrual symptoms and menstrual cycle, sleep quality and sleep habits, quality of life, and demographic variables. The average menstrual cycle was 32.0 [5.4] days. The percentage of students who showed menstrual cycle irregularity, having less than 25 days or more than 39 days of menstrual cycle during the previous four menstrual cycles, was 60.6%. SJL, the difference between mid-sleep time on free days and mid-sleep time on school days, was categorized into small (absolute SJL < 1 h) or large (≥ 1 h). Overall, 78.0% of participants had SJL ≥ 1 h. Among the menstrual symptoms, pain, behavioral change, and water retention subscale scores were significantly higher in the SJL ≥ 1 h group than in the SJL < 1 h group. However, no significant differences were found in concentration, autonomic reaction, or negative affect subscale scores between the two groups. The menstrual cycle was 31.2 [5.5] days in the SJL < 1 h group and 32.2 [5.4] days in the SJL ≥ 1 h group, without significant difference. Logistic regression analysis showed that more than 1 h of SJL was a significant associated factor with severe menstrual symptom, independently of sleep duration and late chronotype. This study indicated that SJL was a significant factor associated with severe menstrual symptoms, suggesting the possibilities of association between circadian system and reproductive function among humans.

N2  - Introduction: Major depression is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk. We have previously shown that severe insomnia, a core symptom of major depression episode (MDE), is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, a component of metabolic syndrome, in women but not in men with major depression. Since insomnia is related to cardiovascular morbidity in the general population and major depression also, our objective was to assess the link between insomnia and metabolic syndrome, a marker syndrome of cardiovascular risk, during MDE, in women and in men. Methods: In 624 patients with a current MDE cohort, both insomnia and metabolic syndrome were assessed in women and men. Insomnia was rated from 0 to 6 based on the HDRS corresponding items, severe insomnia being defined by a total insomnia score ≥ 4. Results: severe insomnia was associated with metabolic syndrome in women but not in men. In multivariate logistic regressions, these results in women were independent from age, educational level, major depressive disorder duration and current smoking. These results were only significant in women aged ≥ 50 years, a cut-off age for menopausal status but not in women under 50 years. Conclusion: Women aged ≥ 50 years with a severe insomnia during MDE have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Severe insomnia may be a clinical marker of metabolic risk in this population. They should be particularly monitored for metabolic syndrome and may benefit from sleep recommendations and cardiovascular prevention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To describe the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among women during perimenopause and to examine differences in self-reported insomnia symptoms at different stages of perimenopause over 10 years. Design: Secondary analysis of self-reported sleep symptoms and clinical variables using 10 years of publicly available data from the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN). Setting: The data set of women’s insomnia symptoms was obtained from publicly available data from the SWAN. The parent study settings included Detroit, Michigan; Northern New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants: Multiethnic midlife women with a mean age of 46 years (N = 3,302) categorized as pre- and perimenopausal at baseline. Methods: Dependent variables included self-reported insomnia symptoms: difficulty falling asleep (sleep latency), wake after sleep onset, early morning awakenings, and sleep quality. Descriptive analysis was completed for each 1-year study interval. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to identify whether insomnia symptoms changed over time by stage of perimenopause. Results: Insomnia symptoms were present in 31% to 42% of perimenopausal women at any 1-year study interval. Insomnia symptoms were more prevalent in the late stage of perimenopause than the early stage (p p < .001). Conclusion: Insomnia symptoms are prevalent in women transitioning to menopause, and stage of perimenopause may heighten the risk to develop symptoms of insomnia disorder, which is associated with negative cardiometabolic outcomes.

N2  - The key to species survival depends on the ability to reproduce. In mammals ovulation requires a precisely timed luteinizing hormone (LH)-surge on the afternoon of proestrus. It is thought that this LH-surge requires the convergence of two signals one being a hormonal signal (i.e. the positive feedback of estrogen) and the other being a neural signal (i.e. a circadian signal). The circadian clock is known to be involved in regulating numerous biological functions, such as sleep/wake cycles, food intake, body temperature, hormonal regulation, etc. It does this through a series of transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving various clock genes (i.e. Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, reverbα, etc.). CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to noncanonical E-boxes in the promoters of clock driven genes, which activates their own transcription and subsequent translation. PER and CRY are then translocated back into the nucleus to inhibit their own transcription and that of other E-box driven genes. There have been various published reports on clock mutant animals having impaired fecundity. Mammalian reproduction occurs through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis where GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) neurons, located in the hypothalamus, release GnRH in a pulsatile fashion. GnRH acts on the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) on the surface of anterior pituitary cells called gonadotropes. The GnRHR triggers the synthesis and release of LH and FSH, which act on the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen then feeds back on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. In the present studies whole rat pituitaries were used to assess clock gene and protein expression at diestrus a.m./p.m. and proestrus a.m./p.m. It was found that mPer1 increased during the evening of both days, but peaked on the evening of proestrus. It was surprising that PER1 protein was also high during the morning of proestrus, which was not seen in mPer1 mRNA. Since LH is synthesized and secreted only in gonadotropes, which make up 3-5% of the entire pituitary, enriched primary gonadotropes were used to study clock gene expression. Using enriched primary gonadotropes it was seen that mPer1 is indeed expressed in these cells in a rhythmic fashion and also that GnRH induces mPer1 as well as LHβ. Because GnRH induces both mPer1 and LHβ, experiments were performed to determine whether the signaling pathway involved in the GnRH induction of mPer1 correlates to that of the GnRH induction of LHβ. Using various pharmacological approaches it was demonstrated that GnRH induces  mPer1 and LHβ through the PKC/MAPK pathways. It has also been shown that the GnRH induction of LHβ requires the early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1). To ascertain the importance of Egr-1 in mPer1 expression, analysis of the mPer1 promoter was performed and an Egr-1 binding site was found. Using various techniques it was determined that Egr-1 is involved in the GnRH induction of mPer1 expression. GnRHR expression fluctuates in accordance with the frequency of GnRH pulses. Little is known about how this change in GnRHR expression occurs. E-boxes are required for circadian regulation of a gene. Through examination of the GnRHR promoter, seven noncanonical E-boxes were found proximal to the transcriptional start site (tss). Analysis of the putative clock gene regulation of the GnRHR was performed and it was found that clock genes are indeed important factors in controlling GnRHR expression. To reach the critical LH-surge, LHβ must be synthesized and released from the gonadotropes. To further the understanding of clock gene involvement in the HPG axis, the LHβ promoter was also examined and six noncanonical E-boxes were found proximal to the tss. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed, and it was… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Women have a significantly higher risk for developing mood disorders with a lifetime prevalence that is approximately twice that of men. Sex difference in the rates of depression begins to appear in adolescence. Although reasons for this gender difference are not fully understood, the changing level in reproductive hormones throughout a woman's life may be playing a direct or indirect effect on her mood. Studies on bipolar disorder suggest that women are more likely than men to be rapid cyclers, which is attributed to the increased occurrence of hypothyroidism and menstrual cycle irregularities in women. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are considered to be vulnerable times in a woman's life with significant increase and drop in reproductive hormones and increased risk of psychiatric symptoms. Oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and menopause dampen the cyclicily of ovarian function and can cause mood symptoms. Reproductive hormones modulate neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and circadian rhythms, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorder. Changes or variability in reproductive hormones rather than absolute level increases the risk for symptoms in vulnerable individuals. Depression occurring in association with the reproductive cycle may sensitize a woman lo future depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by Q. Regestein et al. (see record 2015-35062-009). The recent article by Regestein et al. searched for a correlation among hot flashes, affect, cognitive test performance and sleep disturbances. Their study was well designed, and they took care to assess self-reported hot flashes using five different measures and evaluated the participants’ sleep daily. Some additional comments could be added to their findings based on studies performed at our institution. In these studies, there was no correlation between insomnia and hot flashes. In addition, estrogen and/or progesterone treatment did not significantly improve objective sleep. Nevertheless, the sleep efficiency was higher in women with insomnia who underwent isoflavone treatment compared to placebo. Furthermore, they had fewer complaints of insomnia, milder hot flashes and benefits in their central executive function. This suggests that objective resources may fail to “measure” sleep quality, as well as menopausal symptoms. This study contributes to medicine because it covers topics that are recurring complaints in medical practice and interfere with the quality of life for many women. It is important to perform joint analyses of subjective and objective measures, as well as to understand the biopsychosocial context in order to investigate the effects of hot flashes in mid-life women.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine levels of awareness and knowledge regarding male climacteric or andropause in Japanese women. We also examined whether there are differences in these levels between nurses as a health profession group and office workers as a general population group. Methods: Two thousand and eight hundred female registered nurses and women with office-related general occupations aged 20–65 years in Japan completed health questionnaires regarding awareness and knowledge of male climacteric, including male menopausal symptoms and treatments. Results: The proportion in women who had heard of the term male climacteric in nurses was significantly higher than that in office workers. Nurses with past or current experience of menopausal symptoms were likely to recognize male climacteric. Nurses also had a higher level of knowledge than did office workers regarding male menopausal symptoms. High proportions of both nurses and office workers acknowledged depressed mood, irritability, nervousness and sleep problems as male menopausal symptoms. The proportions of women with sympathy for men with male climacteric were high in women with experience of past or current menopausal symptoms and in women who were close to men who suffered from menopausal symptoms. Conclusions: Nurses with past or current experience of menopausal symptoms had high levels of awareness and knowledge of male climacteric. To spread more information and knowledge regarding male climacteric, provision of education for these nurses may be needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Data were collected using socio-demographic questionnaire, Women’s Health Questionnaire (domains of depressed mood-DEP, anxiety-ANX, memory-MEM and sleep-SLE) and Short Form-36 (Mental Composite Score) for assessment of health-related QOL. Factors associated with poorer DEP, ANX, MEM and SLE were examined using adjusted linear regression models.Results: In premenopausal women, lower household monthly income (p = .046) was associated with higher level of DEP; higher body mass index (p = .045) was associated with higher ANX; having gynecological illnesses (p = .017) and menopause-related symptoms (p = .039) were associated with poorer MEM; being married (p = .036), drinking alcohol (p = .036) and having more physical activity (p = .041) was associated with better SLE. In postmenopausal women, worse DEP was more likely among women residing in city outskirts (p = .009), who are not married (p = .038) and with sedentary occupations (p = .049); lower education level (p = .030) was associated with more ANX; lower education level (p = .045) and having menopause-related symptoms (p = .044) were associated with poorer MEM; not engaging in regular recreation (p = .031) was associated with better SLE.Conclusions: To improve QOL, pre- and postmenopausal women should not only be supported in the management of menopause-specific symptoms. Women should also receive recommendations as to the behavioral and personal changes when approaching the midlife period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To systematically review the peer-reviewed literature regarding the effects of self-administered mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms. Methods: To identify qualifying studies, we searched 10 scientific databases and scanned bibliographies of relevant review papers and all identified articles. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed systematically using predefined criteria. Results: Twenty-one papers representing 18 clinical trials from 6 countries met our inclusion criteria, including 12 randomized controlled trials (N = 719), 1 non-randomized controlled trial (N= 58), and 5 uncontrolled trials (N = 105). Interventions included yoga and/or meditation-based programs, tai chi, and other relaxation practices, including muscle relaxation and breath-based techniques, relaxation response training, and low-frequency sound-wave therapy. Eight of the nine studies of yoga, tai chi, and meditation-based programs reported improvement in overall menopausal and vasomotor symptoms; six of seven trials indicated improvement in mood and sleep with yoga-based programs, and four studies reported reduced musculoskeletal pain. Results from the remaining nine trials suggest that breath-based and other relaxation therapies also show promise for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms, although intergroup findings were mixed. Most studies reviewed suffered methodological or other limitations, complicating interpretation of findings. Conclusions: Collectively, findings of these studies suggest that yoga-based and certain other mind-body therapies may be beneficial for alleviating specific menopausal symptoms. However, the limitations characterizing most studies hinder interpretation of findings and preclude firm conclusions regarding efficacy. Additional large, methodologically sound trials are needed to determine the effects of specific mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms, examine long-term outcomes, and investigate underlying mechanisms.

N2  - Background: Long and short sleep duration are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, evidence is inconsistent. We sought to identify whether self-reported sleep duration and insomnia, based on a validated questionnaire, are associated with increased incident CUD and CVD among postmenopausal women. Methods: Women's Health Initiative Observational Study Participants (N = 86,329; 50-79 years) who reported on sleep at baseline were followed for incident CVD events. Associations of sleep duration and insomnia with incident CHD and CVD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models over 10.3 years. Results: Women with high insonmia scores had elevated risk of CHD (38%) and CVD (27%) after adjustment for age and race, and in fully adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.30; 1.11 95% CI 1.03-2.00). Shorter (≤ 5 hours) and longer (≥ 10 hours) sleep duration demonstrated significantly higher incident CHD (25%) and CVD (19%) in age- and race-adjusted models, but this was not significant Ln fully adjusted models. Formal tests for interaction indicated significant interactions between sleep duration and insomnia for risk of CHD (p p = 0.02). Women with high insomnia scores and long sleep demonstrated the greatest risk of incident CHD compared to midrange sleep duration (HR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.06-3.51) in fully adjusted models. Conclusions: Sleep duration and insomnia are associated with CHD and CVD risk, and may interact to cause almost double the risk of CHD and CVD. Additional research is needed to understand how sleep quality modifies the association between prolonged sleep and cardiovascular outcomes.

N2  - Hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS) are commonly experienced by mid-aged women during the menopause transition. They affect approximately 70% of women but are regarded as problematic for 15–20% largely due to physical discomfort, distress, social embarrassment, and sleep disturbance. There is a need for effective and acceptable nonmedical treatments for menopausal symptoms due to the declining use of hormone therapy (HT) following publication of the Women's Health Initiative and other prospective studies which associated HT use with increased risk of stroke and breast cancer. HF/NS are an example of a physiological process embedded within, and moderated by, psychological processes, as evidenced by discrepancies between subjective experiences and physiologically measured symptoms. We describe a cognitive model of menopausal hot flushes that can explain symptom perception, cognitive appraisal, and behavioral reactions to symptoms. Theoretically, the model draws on symptom perception theory, self-regulation theory, and cognitive behavioral theories. The model can be used to identify the variables to target in psychological interventions for HF/NS and to aid understanding of possible mediating factors. As part of Phase II intervention development, we describe a cognitive behavioral treatment which links the bio-psycho-social processes specified in the model to components of the intervention.

N2  - Background: Preterm birth impairs the infant's stress response due to interruption of autonomic nervous system (ANS) development. Preterm infants demonstrate a prolonged and aberrant sympathetic response to stressors. ANS development may be promoted by massage therapy (MT), which has been shown to improve stress response in preterm infants. Aims: The aim of this study was to compare preterm infant ANS function and stress response during sleep and caregiving epochs, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV), after two weeks of twice-daily MT. Study design: A subset of participants from a larger randomized, masked, controlled trial was used. Subjects: Twenty-one infants (8 males and 13 females) from a larger study of 37 medically stable preterm infants were studied. The infants were receiving full volume enteral feedings with a mean post-menstrual age of 31.4 (MT) and 30.9 (control) weeks. Outcome measures: Low to high frequency (LF:HF) ratio of HRV was the outcome of interest. Results: There was a significant group × time × sex interaction effect (p < .05). Male control infants demonstrated a significant decline in LF:HF ratio from baseline to the second caregiving epoch, suggesting decreased mobilization of sympathetic nervous system response when exposed to stressors. Male MT infants demonstrated increased LF:HF ratio during caregiving and decreased LF:HF ratio during sleep epochs, suggesting improved ANS function, although this was not statistically significant. LF:HF ratio was similar in female MT and female control infants during caregiving and sleep. Conclusions: Control males had decreased HRV compared to MT males. There was no difference in HRV between MT and control females. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of a 54-year-old woman, who had no psychiatric history until her early 40s, when she underwent unsuccessful in-vitro fertilization (IVF). In that context, she developed an episode of major depression, treated with escitalopram 20 mg/d. Her episode resolved and she continued escitalopram, which was maintained during her perimenopausal years. At age 50 years, she developed a complex seizure and hemiplegic migraine disorder. This required various medications with incomplete relief. At age 54 years, she had a hospitalization for IV valproate and initiation of oral flunarizine 5 mg daily and topiramate 100 mg bid. Her migraine symptoms were thereafter well controlled. However, her migraine symptoms recurred and she restarted flunarizine 4 days later, with subsequent control of her migraine symptoms. Her mood continued to be improved on her new medication regimen and she had no further suicidal ideation. On post-discharge follow-up at 1 week and, subsequently, at 1 month her mood continued to improve, while sleep, appetite and energy normalized. Escitalopram was discontinued and mirtazapine was continued. Under direction of her neurologist, flunarizine and topiramate were continued with close monitoring of symptom (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The “biological clock” serves as a powerful metaphor that reflects the constraints posed by female reproductive biology. The biological clock refers to the progression of time from puberty to menopause, marking the period during which women can conceive children. Findings from two experiments suggest that priming the passage of time through the sound of a ticking clock influenced various aspects of women’s (but not men’s) reproductive timing. Moreover, consistent with recent research from the domain of life history theory, those effects depended on women’s childhood socioeconomic status (SES). The subtle sound of a ticking clock led low (but not high) SES women to reduce the age at which they sought to get married and have their first child (Study 1), as well as the priority they placed on the social status and long-term earning potential of potential romantic partners (Study 2). Findings suggest that early developmental sensitization processes can interact with subtle environmental stimuli to affect reproductive timing during adulthood.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the migraine triggers in consecutive patients and correlate these with demographic and clinical variables. Design: A prospective study. Setting: Tertiary care teaching hospital. Subject and Methods: A total of 182 patients with migraine were included whose age ranged between 14 to 58 years and 131 were females. Duration of migraine ranged between 6 and 260 months. Endogenous and exogenous migraine triggers were inquired using a questionnaire. Severity of migraine, associated symptoms, and functional disability were recorded. Presence of trigger was correlated with various demographic and clinical variables. Results: Migraine triggers were present in 160 (87.9%) patients and included emotional stress in 70%, fasting in 46.3%, physical exhaustion or traveling in 52.5%, sleep deprivation in 44.4%, menstruation in 12.8%, and weather changes in 10.1% patients. Multiple triggers (>2) were present in 34.4% patients. Conclusion: The triggers in the Indian migraine patients are similar to other populations but for dietary factors.

N2  - The authors previously observed blunted phase-shift responses to morning bright light in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The aim of this study was to determine if these findings could be replicated using a higher-intensity, shorter-duration light pulse and to compare these results with the effects of an evening bright-light pulse. In 17 PMDD patients and 14 normal control (NC) subjects, the authors measured plasma melatonin at 30-min intervals from 18:00 to 10:00 h in dim (<30 lux) or dark conditions the night before (Night 1) and after (Night 3) a bright-light pulse (administered on Night 2) in both follicular and luteal menstrual cycle phases. The bright light (either 3000 lux for 6 h or 6000 lux for 3 h) was given either in the morning (AM light), 7 h after the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) measured the previous month, or in the evening (PM light), 3 h after the DLMO. In the luteal, but not in the follicular, phase, AM light advanced melatonin offset between Night 1 and Night 3 significantly less in PMDD than in NC subjects. The effects of PM light were not significant, nor were there significant effects of the light pulse on melatonin measures of onset, duration, peak, or area under the curve. These findings replicated the authors’ previous finding of a blunted phase-shift response to morning bright light in the luteal, but not the follicular, menstrual cycle phase in PMDD compared with NC women, using a brighter (6000 vs. 3000 lux) light pulse for a shorter duration (3 vs. 6 h). As the effect of PM bright light on melatonin phase-shift responses did not differ between groups or significantly alter other melatonin measures, these results suggest that in PMDD there is a luteal-phase subsensitivity or an increased resistance to morning bright-light cues that are critical in synchronizing human biological rhythms. The resulting circadian rhythm malsynchonization may contribute to the occurrence of luteal phase depressive symptoms in women with PMDD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: Determine effects of low-dose estradiol and low-dose venlafaxine on self-reported sleep measures in menopausal women with hot flashes. Design: 3-arm double-blind randomized trial. Participants assigned in a 2:2:3 ratio to 17β estradiol 0.5 mg/day (n = 97), venlafaxine XR 75 mg/day (n = 96), or placebo (n = 146) for 8 weeks. Setting: Academic research centers. Participants: 339 community-dwelling perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with ≥ 2 bothersome hot flashes per day. Measurements and Results: Insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) at baseline, week 4 and 8; 325 women (96%) provided ISI data and 312 women (92%) provided PSQI data at baseline and follow-up. At baseline, mean (SD) hot flash frequency was 8.1/day (5.3), mean ISI was 11.1 (6.0), and mean PSQI was 7.5 (3.4). Mean (95% CI) change from baseline in ISI at week 8 was −4.1 points (−5.3 to −3.0) with estradiol, −5.0 points (−6.1 to −3.9) with venlafaxine, and −3.0 points (−3.8 to −2.3) with placebo (P overall treatment effect vs. placebo 0.09 for estradiol and 0.007 for venlafaxine). Mean (95% CI) change from baseline in PSQI at week 8 was −2.2 points (−2.8 to −1.6) with estradiol, −2.3 points (−2.9 to −1.6) with venlafaxine, and −1.2 points (−1.7 to −0.8) with placebo (P overall treatment effect vs. placebo 0.04 for estradiol and 0.06 for venlafaxine). Conclusions: Among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with hot flashes, both low dose oral estradiol and low-dose venlafaxine compared with placebo modestly reduced insomnia symptoms and improved subjective sleep quality.

N2  - Depression during midlife years may lead to significant sleep disturbances and adversely impact quality of life (QOL). In this report, we examined the effects of treatment with quetiapine extended release (XR), 150–300 mg/day, on sleep and QOL in 23 midlife women with major depressive disorder (MDD). Quetiapine XR improved subjective sleep distress, overall sleep parameters, and sleep-related QOL, ultimately leading to significant improvement in menopause-related QOL. While larger, controlled trials are still awaited, these preliminary results are encouraging and suggest that quetiapine XR may be a useful tool in treating symptomatic midlife women with MDD.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of and identify factors associated with poor sleep quality and short sleep duration among women with noncancerous gynecologic conditions. Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 838 pre-menopausal women aged 31– 54 who enrolled in a study of pelvic problems, hysterectomy and intervention alternatives in 2003/2004. Primary outcomes were poor sleep quality and short sleep duration (six or less hours on average) in the four weeks preceding the interview; hypothesized correlates included sociodemographic characteristics, pelvic problem impact, measured by the Pelvic Problem Impact Questionnaire (PPIQ), and depression, measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Results: One-third (33.7%) of the participants reported having poor sleep quality and nearly half (46.8%) reported short sleep duration. In multivariable models, women with major depressive disorder were more likely than those who were not depressed to experience poor sleep quality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36–7.28, p50.001). Women with higher PPIQ scores also were more likely to experience poor sleep quality (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.27–1.98, p  0.001) and short sleep duration (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11–1.69, p  0.003). Finally, women who self-identified as African-American (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.83–4.32, p  0.001) or Asian/ Pacific Islander (aOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.32–4.09, p  0.003) were more likely than White women to have short sleep duration. Conclusions: Sleep problems are prevalent among women with noncancerous gynecologic conditions, and are associated with depression and high pelvic problem impact. Providers should be proactive in inquiring about and offering solutions for sleep difficulties experienced by their patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Hormonal fluctuations associated with female reproductive life events may precipitate or worsen affective episodes in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Previous studies have shown that women with BD report higher rates of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) than controls. Further, bipolar women who report premenstrual worsening of mood display a worse course of their bipolar illness. Despite this, the neural correlates of comorbid BD and PMDD have not been investigated. Methodology: Eighty-five [CTRL, n = 25; PMDD, n = 20; BD, n = 21; BD with comorbid PMDD (BDPMDD), n = 19], regularly cycling women, not on hormonal contraception, underwent two MRI scans: during their mid-follicular and late luteal menstrual phases. We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (Rs-FC), cortical thickness, and subcortical volumes of brain regions associated with the pathophysiology of BD and PMDD between groups, in the mid-follicular and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. All BD subjects were euthymic for at least 2 months prior to study entry. Results Women in the BDPMDD group displayed greater disruption in biological rhythms and more subthreshold depressive and anxious symptoms through the menstrual cycle compared to other groups. Rs-FC was increased between the L-hippocampus and R-frontal cortex and decreased between the R-hippocampus and R-premotor cortex in BDPMDD vs. BD (FDR-corrected, p pCORR < 0.05). Conclusion: Women with BD and comorbid PMDD display a distinct clinical and neurobiological phenotype of BD, which suggests differential sensitivity to endogenous hormones.

N2  - Background: Although fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety are associated with pain in breast cancer patients, it is unknown whether acupuncture can decrease these comorbid symptoms in cancer patients with pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress in breast cancer survivors who experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Methods: The authors performed a randomized controlled trial of an 8‐week course of EA compared with a waitlist control (WLC) group and a sham acupuncture (SA) group in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who self‐reported joint pain attributable to AIs. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression were measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The effects of EA and SA versus WLC on these outcomes were evaluated using mixed‐effects models. Results: Of the 67 randomly assigned patients, baseline pain interference was associated with fatigue (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.75; P r = 0.38; P = .0026), and depression (r = 0.58; P P = .0095), anxiety (P = .044), and depression (P=.015) and a nonsignificant improvement in sleep disturbance (P = .058) during the 12‐week intervention and follow‐up period. In contrast, SA did not produce significant reductions in fatigue or anxiety symptoms but did produce a significant improvement in depression compared with the WLC condition (P = .0088). Conclusions: Compared with usual care, EA produced significant improvements in fatigue, anxiety, and depression; whereas SA improved only depression in women experiencing AI‐related arthralgia.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in children and adolescents with autistic disorders. Methods: In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5–17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg/day for those weighing 20 to < 45 kg, and 1.75 mg/day for those weighing ≥ 45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone’s safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point. Results: Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common ( ≥ 5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n = 9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n = 7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n = 6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n = 5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n = 4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11–15%) and body mass index (5–10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase. One potentially prolactin-related AE (irregular menstruation) was reported. The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale (24.6). All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE. Conclusions: During this OLE, safety findings with risperidone treatment (maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg/day or 1.75 mg/day)were consistent with those observed in the DB phase, and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders. Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: This study used a randomized controlled trial model to determine the effect of progressive relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene training given to postmenopausal women with insomnia. Methods: A total of 161 postmenopausal women with insomnia were recruited and randomly assigned to experimental (n = 81) and control (n = 80) groups. The experimental group received sleep hygiene and progressive relaxation exercise training, but the control group only received routine health care. The relaxation exercise training was repeated once a week for 8 weeks. The study determined the effect of the intervention on insomnia symptoms. The data were collected between 15 June and 15 September 2015 and evaluated using descriptive statistics, independent samples t‐test, chi‐squared test, and Cronbach alpha analysis. Results: The mean (SD) score of the experimental group on the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale was 14.03 (3.4) pretest and 7.09 (3.4) posttest. The difference between the pretest and posttest scores was statistically significant (P P < .001). Conclusion: The findings of study suggest that nurses teaching progressive relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene would benefit postmenopausal women who suffer from insomnia.

N2  - Purpose: After cancer treatment, it is desirable to maintain or regain a high quality of life (QoL) and the ability to accomplish everyday tasks well. Therefore, we substantiated the scarce knowledge regarding long-term QoL after breast cancer, burdensome problems, and unmet needs for more support. Methods: Disease-free breast cancer survivors (n = 190) who had participated in two randomized controlled exercise trials during primary treatment were followed up to 5 years post-diagnosis. QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQ scores were compared with age-matched normative values from the general population in Germany. Results: QoL-related functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatment were worse compared to healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet, cognitive function and sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-year follow-up. Other common long-term problems included sexual issues (45% of survivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy (21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue having the strongest impact on global QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for menopausal disorders (43%), physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), arthralgia (37%), cognitive problems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue (31%). Conclusions: While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years post-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, still many survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need for ongoing screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive problems, arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.

N2  - Study Objectives: To investigate sex differences in the effect of sleep deprivation on performance, accounting for menstrual phase in women. Methods: We examined alertness data from 124 healthy women and men (40 women, 84 men; aged 18–30 years) who maintained wakefulness for at least 30 hr in a laboratory setting using a constant routine protocol. Objective alertness was assessed every 2 hr using a 10 min psychomotor vigilance task. Subjective alertness was assessed every hour via the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Results: Women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle demonstrated the poorest level of performance. This poor performance was most pronounced at times corresponding to the typical sleep episode, demonstrating a window of vulnerability at night during this menstrual phase. At 24 hr awake, over 60 per cent of their responses were lapses of >500 ms and over one-third of their responses were longer lapses of at least 3 s in duration. Women in the luteal phase, however, were relatively protected from alertness failure, performing similar or better than both follicular-phase women and men. Conclusions: These results have important implications for education and intervention programs for shift workers, specifically during times of vulnerability to attentional failure that increase risk of injury.

N2  - The menstrual cycle is an example of a human infradian rhythm, but an altered sleep–wake cycle or a disrupted circadian rhythm can change the regularity of the menstrual cycle. In this study, we investigated whether an irregular menstrual cycle is associated with polymorphisms in the CLOCK (3111T > C) and/or PER3 (variable number tandem repeat, VNTR) genes, which are known to have an impact on the circadian rhythm. One hundred ninety-seven postmenarchal, adolescent girls from two girls’ high schools in Seoul, Korea, were studied. All participants were requested to complete the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess the emotional distress that might cause menstrual irregularity. Every participant donated a blood sample from which DNA was extracted and genotyped for the CLOCK 3111T > C and PER3 VNTR polymorphisms. A significant association was found between the CLOCK 3111T > C genotype and irregular menstrual cycles. Subjects with the 3111T > C genotype had a high risk of an irregular menstrual cycle compared with 3111T/T homozygous subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26–6.55). When multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for age, PSS, STAI, BDI and BMI, subjects with the 3111T > C polymorphism showed a significantly increased OR for irregular menstrual cycles (OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.32–7.21). There was no significant association between the PER3 VNTR polymorphism and the irregularity of the menstrual cycle (p > 0.05). The results of this study suggest that the CLOCK 3111T > C polymorphism could be an independent risk factor for irregular menstrual cycles, irrespective of psychological distress and endocrine or metabolic conditions, and could be used as a molecular marker for gynecological studies on this aspect.

N2  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named “mixed)”, and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

Participants: 343 African American, Caucasian, and Chinese women; ages 48-58 years; pre-, peri- or post-menopausal; participating in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation Sleep Study (SWAN Sleep Study). Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Measures included PSG-assessed sleep duration, continuity, and architecture, delta sleep ratio (DSR) computed from automated counts of delta wave activity, daily diary-assessed vasomotor symptoms (VMS), questionnaires to collect mood (depression, anxiety) symptoms, medication, and lifestyle information, and menopausal status using bleeding criteria. Sleep outcomes were modeled using linear regression. Nocturnal VMS were associated with longer sleep time. Higher anxiety symptom scores were associated with longer sleep latency and lower sleep efficiency, but only in women reporting nocturnal VMS. Contrary to expectations, VMS and mood symptoms were unrelated to either DSR or REM latency. Conclusions: Vasomotor symptoms moderated associations of anxiety with EEG sleep measures of sleep latency and sleep efficiency and was associated with longer sleep duration in this multi-ethnic sample of midlife women.

N2  - The aim of this study is to compare sleep characteristics between women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and a control group. The data were extracted from an epidemiologic survey conducted in Sao Paulo (EPISONO), Brazil, which used subjective assessments and objective polysomnography records to analyze subjects’ sleep pattern. Subjective questionnaires used in this study were Women's Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth sleepiness scale, Insomnia Severity Index and the general sleep questionnaire. The presence of PMS was obtained by a direct question in the Women's Questionnaire. The survey included 230 women, of whom 72.6% reported PMS. The PMS group had poorer sleep quality, a higher perception of unrefreshing sleep and more subthreshold insomnia. Participants with PMS had an increased total sleep time recorded by polysomnography and a lower saturation of peripheral oxygen. It is still unkown the mechanism behind PMS and the sleep-wake cycle. In the other hand, it is clear that PMS play a role in sleep, since women with this disorder has a poor quality of sleep and it is not refreshing. Better knowledge about this syndrome and its outcomes can help to improve their well-being and develop more precise therapeutic approaches.

N2  - Memory formation can be influenced by sleep and sex hormones in both men and women, and by the menstrual cycle in women. Though many studies have shown that sleep benefits the consolidation of memories, it is not clear whether this effect differs between men and women in general or according to menstrual phase in women. The present study investigated the effect of sex and menstrual cycle on memory consolidation of face-name associations (FNA) following a daytime nap. Recognition memory was tested using a face-name paired associates task with a polysomnographic nap between morning and evening testing. Seventeen healthy women (age: 20.75 (1.98) years) were studied at two time points of their menstrual cycles, defined from self-report and separated by 2 weeks (perimenses: −5 days to +6 days from the start of menses, and non-perimenses: outside of the perimenses phase), and compared with eighteen healthy men (age: 22.01 (2.91) years). Regardless of menstrual phase, women had better pre-nap performance than men. Further, menstrual phase affected post-nap memory consolidation, with women showing greater forgetting in their perimenses phase compared with their non-perimenses phase and men. Interestingly, post-nap performance correlated with electrophysiological events during sleep (slow oscillations, spindles, and temporal coupling between the two), however, these correlations differed according to menstrual phase and sex. Men’s performance improvement was associated with the temporal coupling of spindles and slow oscillations (i.e., spindle/SO coincidence) as well as spindles. Women, however, showed an association with slow oscillations during non-perimenses, whereas when they were in their perimenses phase of their cycle, women appeared to show an association only with sleep spindle events for consolidation. These findings add to the growing literature demonstrating sex and menstrual phase effects on memory formation during sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Early intervention significantly decreases the impact of bipolar disorder. However, there is little research investigating triggers that may be unique precipitants of manic/hypomanic episodes, and how these may differ from triggers specific to bipolar depression, in young adults with the disorder. Methods: Individuals aged 18 to 30 years who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (n = 198) completed an online survey to identify triggers unique to mania/hypomania and depression, as well as triggers which were common to both. Respondents rated how frequently a series of situations and behaviours had precipitated either a manic/hypomanic episode or a depressive episode in the past. Survey data was supplemented by in-depth face-to-face interviews (n = 11). Results: Triggers specifically associated with the onset of manic/hypomanic episodes included falling in love, recreational stimulant use, starting a creative project, late night partying, going on vacation and listening to loud music. Triggers associated with depressive episodes included stressful life events, general stress, fatigue, sleep deprivation, physical injury or illness, menstruation and decreases in physical exercise. A further set of triggers were identified as being common to both manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes. Consistent themes arose from the analysis of face-to-face interviews, which extended and illuminated the findings of the survey data. Conclusions: Identification of a unique set of triggers for mania/hypomania and a unique set for depression in young adults with bipolar disorder may allow for earlier identification of episodes, thus increasing opportunities for early intervention.

N2  - Purpose: Dysmenorrhea refers to the experience of pelvic pain/cramps experienced by women around or during menstruation. A literature review indicated that no existing patient-reported outcome measure was adequate to support labeling claims in dysmenorrhea. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a new measure that could be used as a primary end point in dysmenorrhea clinical trials. Methods: Open-ended interviews were conducted with 52 dysmenorrhea patients, including a subset of 12 women with a comorbid pelvic pain condition (PPC). Verbatim transcripts were analyzed thematically. The findings were used to generate draft items for an electronic diary (eDiary). A further 24 dysmenorrhea patients pilot-tested the eDiary for 1–5 weeks and completed cognitive interviews to assess content validity. Revisions to the eDiary were implemented based on the findings. Results: In the first set of interviews, 51 women (98 %) spontaneously reported pain/cramps in or around the pelvic region (abdomen, lower back, legs/upper thighs, and vaginal area). Pain experiences reported were similar across dysmenorrhea and dysmenorrhea plus PPC subgroups, except that the pelvic pain among PPC patients occurred throughout the month, not only during menstruation. All participants described the detrimental impact of dysmenorrhea on health-related quality of life. Conclusions: The eDiary was conceptually comprehensive and easy to complete/understand during cognitive debriefing. The resulting nine-item diary included assessment of: menstrual bleeding severity; pain severity; use of analgesics; impact on work/school, physical activities, social and leisure activities, and sleep. Psychometric validation is ongoing and will assess the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the eDiary as a comprehensive dysmenorrhea assessment.

N2  - Sleep consolidates newly acquired memories. Beyond stabilizing memories, sleep is thought to reorganize memory representations such that invariant structures, statistical regularities and even new explicit knowledge are extracted. Whereas increasing evidence suggests that the stabilization of memories during sleep can be facilitated by cueing with learning-associated stimuli, the effect of cueing on memory reorganization is less well understood. Here we asked whether olfactory cueing during sleep enhances the generation of explicit knowledge about an implicitly learned procedural memory task. Subjects were trained on a serial reaction time task (SRTT) containing a hidden 12-element sequence in the presence of an odor. During subsequent sleep, half of the subjects were re-exposed to the odor during periods of slow wave sleep (SWS), while the other half received odorless vehicle. In the next morning, subjects were tested on their explicit knowledge about the underlying sequence in a free recall test and a generation task. Although odor cueing did not significantly affect overall explicit knowledge, differential effects were evident when analyzing male and female subjects separately. Explicit sequence knowledge, both in free recall and the generation task, was enhanced by odor cueing in men, whereas women showed no cueing effect. Procedural skill in the SRTT was not affected by cueing, neither in men nor in women. These findings suggest that olfactory memory reactivation can increase explicit knowledge about implicitly learned information, but only in men. Hormonal differences due to menstrual cycle phase and/or hormonal contraceptives might explain the lacking effect in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Characteristic preterm EEG patterns of “Delta-brushes” (DBs) have been reported in the temporal cortex following auditory stimuli, but their spatio-temporal dynamics remains elusive. Using 32-electrode EEG recordings and co-registration of electrodes’ position to 3D-MRI of age-matched neonates, we explored the cortical auditory-evoked responses (AERs) after ‘click’ stimuli in 30 healthy neonates aged 30–38 post-menstrual weeks (PMW). (1) We visually identified auditory-evoked DBs within AERs in all the babies between 30 and 33 PMW and a decreasing response rate afterwards. (2) The AERs showed an increase in EEG power from delta to gamma frequency bands over the middle and posterior temporal regions with higher values in quiet sleep and on the right. (3) Time–frequency and averaging analyses showed that the delta component of DBs, which negatively peaked around 550 and 750 ms over the middle and posterior temporal regions, respectively, was superimposed with fast (alpha–gamma) oscillations and corresponded to the late part of the cortical auditory-evoked potential (CAEP), a feature missed when using classical CAEP processing. As evoked DBs rate and AERs delta to alpha frequency power decreased until full term, auditory-evoked DBs are thus associated with the prenatal development of auditory processing and may suggest an early emerging hemispheric specialization.

N2  - Background: Menstrual migraine is a highly prevalent disorder among adult women, resulting in disability and loss of quality of life. Some studies have reported menstrual cycle synchrony among women living together. No study has reported whether there may also be a higher prevalence of menstrual migraine among these women. Thus, they reported here the prevalence of menstrual migraine in a group of women living together compared with a control group of women living alone, and discussed the possible factors involved. Methods: The study was conducted on female university students aged 18‐30 years with a diagnosis of migraine according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders III, beta appendix criteria. The subjects were divided into a group of women who lived together with two or more other students and a control group of age‐matched students who lived alone, interviewed with a specific questionnaire and assessed for 3 months by means of a paper pain diary. The data evaluated included frequency of headache, presence of menstrual migraine, intensity of headache, medications used including contraceptives, and triggering factors such as diet, sleep deprivation, and stress. The menstrual data and data related to migraine were also investigated in the roommates. Results: A higher occurrence of menstrual migraine among women living together (9, 50%) compared with women living alone (3, 16.7%) (P = .03) was detected. After binary logistic regression analysis, this finding was not related to the main influencing factors detected, that is, use of a contraceptive, test stress, or sleep deprivation (P = .03, adjusted odds ratio: 7.87; 1.23‐50.36). These women also showed menstrual cycle synchrony with their roommates (8, 44.4%) and the presence of headache crises during the menstruation of their colleagues (11, 61.1%). Conclusion: The present study detected a higher occurrence of menstrual migraine among women who lived together. Since there was no previous description of this topic in the literature, it was believed that the present study could represent a step toward more elaborate investigations of this complex topic.

N2  - Study Objectives: Describe the severity of getting to sleep, nighttime awakening, and early morning awakening across the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopause (PM) and their relationship to age, menopausal transition factors, symptoms, stress-related factors, and health related factors. Design: Cohort Setting: community Participants: 286 women from the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study cohort Measurements: Participants completed annual menstrual calendars for MT staging, diaries in which they rated their symptoms, stress levels, and perceived health multiple times per year from 1990-2007 and provided first morning urine samples assayed for E1G, FSH, Cortisol, and catecholamines. Multilevel modeling (R program) was used for data analysis. Results: Severity of self-reported problems going to sleep was associated with all symptoms, perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, perceived health (-), alcohol use (-) (all P < 0.001), and lower Cortisol (P = 0.009), but not E1G or FSH. Severity of nighttime awakening was significantly associated with age, late MT stage, and early PM, FSH, E1G (-), hot flashes, depressed mood, anxiety, joint pain, backache, perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, perceived health (-), and alcohol use (-) (all P < 0.001, except E1G for which P = 0.030). Severity of early morning awakening was significantly associated with age, hot flashes, depressed mood anxiety, joint pain, backache, perceived stress, history of sexual abuse, perceived health (-) (all P ≤ 0.001, except E1G for which P = 0.02 and epinephrine (P = 0.038), but not MT stages or FSH. Multivariate models for each symptom included hot flashes, depressed mood, and perceived health. Conclusion: Sleep symptoms during the MT may be amenable to symptom management strategies that take into account the symptom clusters and promote women's general health rather than focusing only on the MT.

N2  - Introduction: During the past decades early detection and effective cancer treatments have produced an increase in the number of cancer survivors. This represents a large group of patients susceptible to psychological, physical and social impairments after cancer treatment. Objective: To review the literature on the effects of psychological therapies in the management of psychological and / or somatic symptoms of cancer survivors. Method: A review of the literature reported in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and MedicLatina Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection in the period January 2009 to December 2013 was conducted. Results: 24 articles were identified. Only 22 met the selection criteria; in 2 cases no access to the full articles was obtained, so only 19 were included. Statistically significant effects were identified in sleep difficulties, emotional symptoms, fatigue, quality of life, and post menopausal symptoms. Effect sizes were mostly small to moderate ranging from 0.00 - 1.40. Conclusions: The effects of most psychological interventions were positive whether independent or in combination with other treatment modalities. Interventions via telephone and online therapeutic modalities also showed positive results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Psychosocial and health-related risk factors for depressive symptoms are known. It is unclear if these are associated with depressive symptom patterns over time. We identified trajectories of depressive symptoms and their risk factors among midlife women followed over 15 years. Methods: Participants were 3300 multiracial/ethnic women enrolled in a multisite longitudinal menopause and aging study, Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Biological, psychosocial, and depressive symptom data were collected approximately annually. Group-based trajectory modeling identified women with similar longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms. Trajectory groups were compared on time-invariant and varying characteristics using multivariable multinomial analyses and pairwise comparisons. Results: Five symptom trajectories were compared (50% very low; 29% low; 5% increasing; 11% decreasing; 5% high). Relative to whites, blacks were less likely to be in the increasing trajectory and more likely to be in the decreasing symptom trajectory and Hispanics were more likely to have a high symptom trajectory than an increasing trajectory. Psychosocial/health factors varied between groups. A rise in sleep problems was associated with higher odds of having an increasing trajectory and a rise in social support was associated with lower odds. Women with low role functioning for 50% or more visits had three times the odds of being in the increasing symptom group. Conclusions: Changes in psychosocial and health characteristics were related to changing depressive symptom trajectories. Health care providers need to evaluate women's sleep quality, social support, life events, and role functioning repeatedly during midlife to monitor changes in these and depressive symptoms.

N2  - The call for increased attention to the biopsychosocial perspective in social work practice is now decades old in the USA. And yet the challenge of teaching and learning from this perspective for those with limited background in biology calls for more inter-disciplinary examples to assist students with the process of engaging in theory-informed practice. In addition to identifying the key elements of human biology, this review of the literature focuses on four examples of client behaviors that receive little or no attention in most current textbooks on the inter-disciplinary nature of human behavior in the social environment; namely, the psychobiology of sleep, the sociobiology of eating, the neurobiology of post-partum depression, and the behavioral endocrinology of menopause. This review concludes with implications for practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The human menopause transition and aging are each associated with an increase in a variety of health risk factors including, but not limited to, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, stroke, sexual dysfunction, affective disorders, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline. It is challenging to systematically evaluate the biological underpinnings associated with the menopause transition in the human population. For this reason, rodent models have been invaluable tools for studying the impact of gonadal hormone fluctuations and eventual decline on a variety of body systems. While it is essential to keep in mind that some of the mechanisms associated with aging and the transition into a reproductively senescent state can differ when translating from one species to another, animal models provide researchers with opportunities to gain a fundamental understanding of the key elements underlying reproduction and aging processes, paving the way to explore novel pathways for intervention associated with known health risks. Here, we discuss the utility of several rodent models used in the laboratory for translational menopause research, examining the benefits and drawbacks in helping us to better understand aging and the menopause transition in women. The rodent models discussed are ovary-intact, ovariectomy, and 4-vinylcylohexene diepoxide for the menopause transition. We then describe how these models may be implemented in the laboratory, particularly in the context of cognition. Ultimately, we aim to use these animal models to elucidate novel perspectives and interventions for maintaining a high quality of life in women, and to potentially prevent or postpone the onset of negative health consequences associated with these significant life changes during aging.

N2  - Aim: The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of prone or supine position on sleep states and on withdrawal and approach reactions of preterm infants. Methods: Thirty-two preterm infants from Meir Medical Center, Israel, mean post menstrual age 30.37±2.57, mean birth weight 1250g±313.86, participated in the study. Infants were studied during 48h. Positions (prone and supine) were alternated every 3–4h after feedings. Sleep states were assessed by Actigraph measurement and by two daily 30-min Naturalistic Observations of Newborn Behavior (NONB) to confirm sleep states and for recording the behavioral reactions (approach and withdrawal). Results: In the prone position there were more approach reactions as compared to withdrawal reactions (p <.001) while in the supine position, the approach and withdrawal reactions were comparable. In the prone position more sleep patterns (deep sleep, light sleep, drowsy) were observed as opposed to more awake patterns (quiet awake, active awake and agitated fussy) that were seen in the supine position. Conclusions: Clinical implications encourage placing the preterm infant in the prone position while in the NICU. This enables important achievements such as longer periods of quality sleep, and production of adaptive self-regulatory reactions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Steroids, including estrogens, participate in sleep regulation. For example estrogen replacement therapy improved sleep quality in postmenopausal women. Patients, who undergo a cross-gender hormone therapy, receive high doses of estrogens. The effects of this treatment on sleep are unknown. To clarify this issue, we examined seven male to female transsexual patients (age range 31—44 years, mean ± SD 35.9 ± 4.2 years). The patients spent two nights on 2 separate occasions in our sleep laboratory. The first night of each session served for adaptation to laboratory conditions. In the second night sleep electroencephalogram [EEG] was recorded from 2300 h to 0700 h. The first examination was performed before and the second about 3 months after initiation of cross-gender hormone therapy with a dose of 80—100 mg estrogen applied every 2 weeks. Additionally patients were treated with a starting dose of the anti-androgen cyproteronacetate of 100 mg/day and after about 6 weeks with a maintenance therapy of 50 mg/d in order to suppress androgenic effects. Statistical analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon rank test. Under this estrogen therapy we found a significant increase in stage 1 sleep during the whole night (at baseline [b]: 33.29 ± 9.94 min; treatment [t]: 51.57 ± 24.26 min; p p = 0.02) during hormone therapy compared to before treatment. Other sleep EEG parameters showed no significant changes. Administration of estrogen and anti-androgens in male to female transsexual patients had only a small influence on sleep EEG, with an increase in the duration of shallow sleep.

N2  - Background: Many women experience both vasomotor menopausal symptoms (VMS) and depressed mood at midlife, but little is known regarding the prospective bi-directional relationships between VMS and depressed mood and the role of sleep difficulties in both directions. Methods: A pooled analysis was conducted using data from 21 312 women (median: 50 years, interquartile range 49−51) in eight studies from the InterLACE consortium. The degree of VMS, sleep difficulties, and depressed mood was self-reported and categorised as never, rarely, sometimes, and often (if reporting frequency) or never, mild, moderate, and severe (if reporting severity). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the bi-directional associations adjusted for within-study correlation. Results: At baseline, the prevalence of VMS (40%, range 13–62%) and depressed mood (26%, 8–41%) varied substantially across studies, and a strong dose-dependent association between VMS and likelihood of depressed mood was found. Over 3 years of follow-up, women with often/severe VMS at baseline were more likely to have subsequent depressed mood compared with those without VMS (odds ratios (OR) 1.56, 1.27–1.92). Women with often/severe depressed mood at baseline were also more likely to have subsequent VMS than those without depressed mood (OR 1.89, 1.47–2.44). With further adjustment for the degree of sleep difficulties at baseline, the OR of having a subsequent depressed mood associated with often/severe VMS was attenuated and no longer significant (OR 1.13, 0.90–1.40). Conversely, often/severe depressed mood remained significantly associated with subsequent VMS (OR 1.80, 1.38–2.34). Conclusions: Difficulty in sleeping largely explained the relationship between VMS and subsequent depressed mood, but it had little impact on the relationship between depressed mood and subsequent VMS.

N2  - The Melatonin Osteoporosis Prevention Study (MOPS) demonstrated that nightly melatonin resulted in a time‐dependent decrease in equilibrium ratios of serum osteoclasts and osteoblasts in perimenopausal women. This study examines mechanisms related to the ratios of osteoblasts and osteoclasts using coculture models (transwell or layered) of human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs). Human MSC/PBMC cocultures exposed to melatonin in osteogenic (OS+) medium for 21 days induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization; however, only in layered cocultures did melatonin inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Melatonin effects were mediated through MT2 melatonin receptors, MEK1/2, and MEK5. In layered but not transwell cocultures, melatonin increased OPG:RANKL ratios by inhibiting RANKL, suggesting that contact with osteoclasts during osteoblastogenesis inhibits RANKL secretion. Melatonin modulated expression of ERK1/2, ERK5, β1 integrin, GLUT4, and IRβ that was dependent upon the type of coculture; however, in both cultures, melatonin increased RUNX2 and decreased PPARγ expression, indicating a role for metabolic processes that control osteogenic vs adipogenic cell fates of MSCs. Furthermore, melatonin also has osteoblast‐inducing effects on human adipose‐derived MSCs. In vivo, one‐year nightly melatonin (15 mg/L) given to neu female mice in their drinking water increased pErk1/2, pErk5, Runx2, and Opg and Rankl levels in bone consistent with melatonin's already reported bone‐enhancing effects. Finally, analysis of daily logs from the MOPS demonstrated a significant improvement in mood and perhaps sleep quality in women receiving melatonin vs placebo. The osteoblast‐inducing, bone‐enhancing effects of melatonin and improvement in quality of life suggest that melatonin is a safe and effective bone loss therapy.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although inflammatory markers may mediate this association, it is unknown the influence of gender in this mechanism. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the interaction effects between OSA and gender on metabolic and inflammatory profile in a population sample. This study is part of EPISONO cohort, in which 1042 participants underwent polysomnography, answered questionnaires, and had their blood collected for analysis of fasting glucose, total cholesterol and fractions, leptin, ghrelin, liver transaminases, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein. The results showed that men with OSA had higher leptin levels, shorter sleep latency and lower N3 sleep stage compared to men control (CTRL). They also presented higher apnea index and number of central apneas compared to both CTRL men and OSA women. In women, OSA was related to longer REM sleep latency, higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during REM sleep and increased TNF-α levels compared to CTRL women. A multivariate model showed that male gender, ghrelin and total cholesterol were negatively associated with TNF-α, while IL-6, triglycerides and hypopnea index were positively associated (R² = 0.21). Additionally, gender (men), body mass index, ghrelin, apnea index and smoking were positive predictors of leptin levels (R² = 0.55). Of note, postmenopause was associated with changes observed in both TNF-α and AHI during REM sleep in women with OSA. Taken together, our study suggests that OSA consequences may differ between genders and this could indicate a need for different OSA management in women according to their reproductive life’s stage.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Recent decades have seen significant advances in the knowledge of pathogenesis of mood disorders, as well as of other conditions directly or indirectly related to such diseases. Such progress has led to the emergence of new treatments, such as bright light therapy, based on the discovery of the therapeutic effects of exposure to bright light with the so-called seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a DSM seasonal pattern specifier linked to major depression and bipolar disorder recurrent describing the course of illness during seasons. The goal of the present work is to review the potential clinical applications of phototherapy, including SAD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia, premenstrual syndrome, non seasonal major depression, sleep disorders, jet-lag, dementia, normal populations and in primary care. Methods: A systematic review of the literature about this matter since the early Rosenthal's group observations has been carried out. Results: A considerable number of studies has been published about this therapeutic approach, pointing that not only depression but also other pathologies that may follow a seasonal pattern could benefit from phototherapy integrated with more standard treatments, as well as other disorders directly or indirectly related to mood, and even another conditions without a seasonal pattern. Conclusions: The data about the different uses of this treatment neither confirm nor dismiss its efficacy, stating that the therapy should still be regarded as experimental. Future studies should continue investigating to draw reliable conclusions about the usefulness of bright light therapy on mood disorders and other conditions to provide an alternative to standard treatments almost exclusively based on psychoactive drugs.

N2  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with adverse medical consequences, including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Patients with MDD may be classified as having melancholic, atypical, or undifferentiated features. The goal of the present study was to assess whether these clinical subtypes of depression have different endocrine and metabolic features and consequently, varying medical outcomes. Methods: Premenopausal women, ages 21 to 45 years, with MDD (N = 89) and healthy controls (N = 44) were recruited for a prospective study of bone turnover. Women with MDD were classified as having melancholic (N = 51), atypical (N = 16), or undifferentiated (N = 22) features. Outcome measures included: metabolic parameters, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), and 24 hourly sampling of plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, and leptin. Results: Compared with control subjects, women with undifferentiated and atypical features of MDD exhibited greater BMI, waist/hip ratio, and whole body and abdominal fat mass. Women with undifferentiated MDD characteristics also had higher lipid and fasting glucose levels in addition to a greater prevalence of low BMD at the femoral neck compared to controls. Elevated ACTH levels were demonstrated in women with atypical features of depression, whereas higher mean 24-hour leptin levels were observed in the melancholic subgroup. Conclusions: Pre-menopausal women with various features of MDD exhibit metabolic, endocrine, and BMD features that may be associated with different health consequences.

N2  - The benefit of sleep in general for memory consolidation is well known. The relevance of sleep characteristics and the influence of hormones are not well studied. We explored the effects of a nap on memory consolidation of motor (finger-tapping-task) and verbal (associated-word-pairs) tasks in following settings: A: young, healthy males and females during early-follicular phase (n = 40) and B: females during mid-luteal and early-follicular phase in the menstrual cycle (n = 15). We found a sex and in women a menstrual cycle effect on memory performance following a nap. Men performed significantly better after a nap and women did so only in the mid-luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. Only the men and the women in their mid-luteal phase experienced a significant increase in spindle activity after learning. Furthermore, in women estrogen correlated significantly with the offline change in declarative learning and progesterone with motor learning. The ratio of the 2nd and 4th digit, which has been associated to fetal sex hormones and cognitive sex differences, significantly predicted the average performance of the female subjects in the learning tasks. Our results demonstrate that sleep-related memory consolidation has a higher complexity and more influencing factors than previously assumed. There is a sex and menstrual cycle effect, which seems to be mediated by female hormones and sleep spindles. Further, contrary to previous reports, consolidation of a simple motor task can be induced by a 45 min NREM sleep nap, thus not dependent on REM sleep.

N2  - Epidemiologic and clinic data have unequivocally supported the notion that women experience more psychiatric problems at some point in their lives compared with men, particularly mood and anxiety symptoms and sleep problems. It is also known that, for some women, such increased risk might be associated with reproductive cycle events such as the postpartum period or the menopausal transition. These periods are not only marked by substantial hormone variations but also quite often accompanied by stressful events and changes in personal, family and professional responsibilities. The complexity of these reproductive-related ‘windows of vulnerability’ poses a challenge to physicians and other professionals dedicated to women’s health across the lifespan. The menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years constitute a characteristic example; during this period in life, dynamic changes in sex hormones and reproductive function co-occur with modifications in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviours and overall health, sometimes affecting a woman’s quality of life and overall functioning. For most women, however, this transition has little or no significant impact on their mental wellness. A prior depressive episode—particularly if related to reproductive events—is the strongest predictor of mood symptoms or depression during menopausal years. Also, the presence and severity of vasomotor symptoms and other health-related issues appear to modulate the risk for depression in midlife women. Mechanistically, estrogen plays an important modulatory role in mood and cognitive regulation, hence the effects noted when midlife women are exposed to significant estrogen fluctuations or to estrogen-based therapies (use or withdrawal). Transdermal estradiol, as well as serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants, have shown efficacy in the management of depression in this population. Other evidence-based treatment options (hormonal, pharmacological, behavioural) are available to clinicians and health professionals who care for this population.

N2  - Background: Advances in breast cancer therapies have given rise to a growing number of patient survivors. Nevertheless, these women deal with long-term sequelae that impair their quality of life and that are lacking satisfactory assessment and expeditious management. Importantly, a new era is raising in the oncology field, namely, survivorship. Methods: A search for English-language articles on Medline was undertaken covering the last 15 years, using the terms “cancer survivorship”, “quality of life”, “fatigue”, “insomnia”, “sleep disturbances”, “depression”, “cognitive dysfunction”, “chemofog”, “peripheral neuropathy”, “fertility”, “sexual behaviour”, “menopause”, “lymphedema”, “physical activity” and “breast neoplasms”. Selection was limited to systematic reviews and meta-analysis, but their reference list was examined to include papers of potential interest. Results: We found the most common symptoms affecting breast cancer survivors were fatigue, insomnia, depression, cognitive dysfunction, reproductive and menopausal symptoms and lymphoedema. Conclusion: Some of these symptoms have even been the objective of randomised controlled trials, but consistent data are missing. The available interventions include pharmacological, behavioural therapies and complementary and alternative medicine approaches and will mostly depend on the type of symptom.

N2  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a musculoskeletal chronic pain syndrome with various concomitant symptoms like sleep disorders. FM patients are mainly women and menopause might play an important role in the altered processing of somatosensory information. Adverse effects and moderated efficacy of drugs promote treatment discontinuation by patients. Animal models of FM report pain and depression-like behaviors, but none of them have explored sleep disturbance as possible marker in the preclinic diagnostic. The aim of this study was to investigate alterations of the sleep architecture in the reserpine (RES)-induced FM model in ovarectomized (OVX) rats. The behavioral thresholds of nociceptive response in the experimental FM were analyzed in a first block using muscle pressure, tactile response and allodynia to cold stimulus. In a second block, the sleep-wake cycle was examined in a polysomnographic study. Groups (n = 8) consisted in: (a) no treatment, (b) RES vehicle, (c) RES alone, (d) RES + vehicle of fluoxetine (FLX, antidepressant reference drug), and (e) RES + FLX. Our results demonstrated that RES induced pain-related behavior (50–70%) in OVX rats and altered sleep architecture by the increase of total wake time (38%), diminution of the no-REM stage (SWS-I 33% and SWS-II 76%), and abolition of the REM sleep, effects that were partially reverted in the presence of FLX. In conclusion, our results support the face validity of the RES-induced pain-related behavior as FM model showing nociceptive behavioral responses associated to sleep alterations observed as symptoms in FM patients; thus, these evidences substantiate its usefulness to look for alternatives of treatment for FM symptoms.

N2  - The perimenopausal transition at middle age is often associated with hot flashes and sleep disruptions, metabolic changes, and other symptoms. Whereas the mechanisms for these processes are incompletely understood, both aging (AG) and a loss of ovarian estrogens play contributing roles. Furthermore, the timing of when estradiol (E) treatment should commence and for how long are key clinical questions in the management of symptoms. Using a rat model of surgical menopause, we determined the effects of regimens of E treatment with differing time at onset and duration of treatment on diurnal rhythms of activity and core temperature and on food intake and body weight. Reproductively mature (MAT, ∼4 months) or AG (∼11 months) female rats were ovariectomized, implanted intraperitoneally with a telemetry device, and given either a vehicle (V) or E subcutaneous capsule implantation. Rats were remotely recorded for 10 days per month for 3 (MAT) or 6 (AG) months. To ascertain whether delayed onset of treatment affected rhythms, a subset of AG-V rats had their capsules switched to E at the end of 3 months. Another set of AG-E rats had their capsules removed at 3 months to determine whether beneficial effects of E would persist. Overall, activity and temperature mesor, robustness, and amplitude declined with AG. Compared to V treatment, E-treated rats showed (1) better maintenance of body weight and food intake; (2) higher, more consolidated activity and temperature rhythms; and (3) higher activity and temperature robustness and amplitude. In the AG arm of the study, switching treatment from V to E or E to V quickly reversed these patterns. Thus, the presence of E was the dominant factor in determining stability and amplitude of locomotor activity and temperature rhythms. As a whole, the results show benefits of E treatment, even with a delay, on biological rhythms and physiological functions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Depression increases during menopause, and subclinical depressive symptoms increase risk for major depression. Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)—a single component of CBTI—is equally efficacious. Materials and methods: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34 ± 5.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. Results: CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects. Conclusions: CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI. Name: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes.

N2  - Sleep disturbance is a common complaint for women going through the menopausal transition. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies showed a small but significant relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance and menopausal stage and highlighted a possible influence of culture. However, the longitudinal relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance and menopausal transition has not been explored. This paper aimed to review literature on the longitudinal relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance and menopausal transition among community dwelling midlife women. Multiple electronic databases were systematically searched. Literature published prior to 2013 was reviewed. A narrative synthesis was used to analyse the results due to high level of heterogeneity across the included studies. Overall, review of eligible studies showed a small increased risk of self-reported sleep disturbance as women go through the menopausal transition after adjustment of potential confounders. Although the methodological quality of the majority of included studies was classified as high, the impact of culture on this relationship could not be explored, as all of the included studies were conducted in western countries. Like vasomotor symptoms, self-reported sleep disturbance is one of the core menopausal symptoms. Management strategies should be put in place to help women manage sleep disturbance to prevent complications and to improve health related quality of life.

N2  - Although cross-sectional studies suggest that cognitive aging starts in midlife, few longitudinal studies have documented within-individual declines in cognitive performance before the seventh decade. Learning from repeat testing, or practice effects, can mask the decline in younger cohorts. In women, the menopause transition also affects test performance and can confound estimates of underlying decline. We designed this study to determine if, after controlling for practice effects, the menopause transition, and the symptoms associated with it, there is evidence of cognitive aging in midlife women. We used data from a longitudinal observational study in 2,124 participants from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Outcomes examined were scores on annual tests of processing speed, verbal episodic memory (immediate and delayed), and working memory. To reduce the impact of practice effects and of the menopause transition, we used the third cognition testing visit as the baseline. Average age at this baseline was 54 years, and the majority of the women were postmenopausal; half the cohort was 2 or more years beyond the final menstrual period. There were 7,185 cognition assessments with median follow-up time of 6.5 years. In mixed effects regression, adjusted for practice effects, retention, menopause symtoms (depressive, anxiety, vasomotor, and sleep disturbance), and covariates, scores on 2 of 4 cognition tests declined. Mean decline in cognitive speed was 0.28 per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20 to 0.36) or 4.9% in 10 years, and mean decline in verbal episodic memory (delayed testing) was 0.02 per year (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.03) or 2% in 10 years. Our results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive aging in midlife women, with substantial within-woman declines in processing speed and memory. Further research is needed to identify factors that influence decline rates and to develop interventions that slow cognitive aging. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background and purpose: Identification of the trigger factors of headache could be an important aspect of preventive management, but the characteristics of primary headache triggers in China are unknown. This study was performed to estimate the frequencies of the putative headache triggers, which are endorsed by patients with migraine and tension-type headache (TTH). Methods: From July 2011 to December 2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the neurological clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Chongqing. All consecutive patients with the chief complaint of headache were interviewed by a board-certified headache specialist. The diagnoses were made according to International Classification of Headache Disorders–2nd edition. Patients with migraine and TTH were recruited. Results: The number of investigated patients was 1219, of whom 394 were migraine and 344 were TTH; and 80.2% migraineurs and 67.4% TTH patients reported trigger factors. The most common triggers for both migraine and TTH were sleep disturbance, negative affect and sunlight. Menstrual cycle (OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.2, 11.2), change of the weather (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.9, 4.8), noise (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1, 4.4) and alcohol (OR 1.8, 95%CI 0.7, 1.8) were more associated with migraineurs. Negative affect was more associated with TTH (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.3, 2.9). Conclusions: Trigger factors were frequent among both migraine and TTH patients. Avoidance of all headache triggers is impractical. Learning to cope with triggers is important to headache prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Female sexual hormones have known hypnogenic effects and the use of hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women leads to improvement in sleep quality. However, the effects of hormonal contraceptives in women of reproductive age are still scarcely understood. This study sought to evaluate the impact of hormonal contraceptive use on subjective self‐reports of sleep through a web‐based cross‐sectional survey. A total of 2,055 women between 18 and 40 years old participated by answering an online questionnaire evaluating hormonal contraceptive use, sleep‐related characteristics and related features. Sleep assessment tools comprised the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Statistical comparisons were performed between hormonal contraceptive users and those who reported no current use. Analyses were repeated to compare users of combined contraceptives with users of progestagens only, as well as to compare users of different generations of contraceptives. Among the total sample, 1,286 participants met the inclusion criteria (918 of them were currently taking a hormonal contraceptive). Contraceptive users reported more frequent sleep complaints and had higher scores on ESS and ISI, which means increased excessive daytime sleepiness and more insomnia symptoms. Women using progestagen‐only therapies reported lower total sleep duration compared with combined therapy. Users of third‐generation contraceptives showed lower total sleep time and higher ISI score when compared with non‐users. In conclusion, contraceptive users have more insomnia symptoms and increased excessive daytime sleepiness when compared with women who do not use any hormonal contraceptive method, and progestagen‐only therapy was associated with lower sleep duration.

N2  - Study Objectives: The individual prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), short sleep duration, and obesity is high and increasing. The study aimed to investigate potential associations between SDB, objective sleep duration, obesity, diabetes and hypertension across genders, and the effect of pre- or post-menopausal status. Methods: A cross-sectional study evaluated 7051 community participants with wrist actigraphy for a week, and nocturnal oximetry ≥ 2 nights. SDB was assessed by 3 per cent oxygen desaturation index (ODI) corrected for sleep duration obtained from wrist actigraphy. Moderate-to-severe SDB was defined as ODI3% levels ≥ 15 per hour. Results: Both logODI3% and body mass index showed independent negative associations with sleep duration (β = −0.16, pp p p p = 0.119). Moderate-to-severe SDB was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in men (OR 3.11; 95%CI 2.23–4.33; p p = 0.008), and postmenopausal women (OR 1.96; 95%CI 1.46–2.63; p < 0.001). Short sleep duration was not associated with diabetes or hypertension. The associations of obesity with diabetes or hypertension were indirectly mediated by SDB (24.0% and 21.5%, respectively), with possible sex differences emerging (men/women; 15.3/27.8% and 27.0/16.9%, respectively). Conclusions: Notwithstanding the cross-sectional design, SDB and obesity, but not short sleep duration, were independently associated with diabetes and hypertension, with gender and menopausal status–related differences in risk emerging.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in a sample comprising women of mostly Hispanic descent and low socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: Demographic data and symptoms related to sexuality were analyzed from 102 women who consecutively came to the Women's Life Center at Hartford Hospital (2004–2008). FSD was defined as decreased sexual desire, dyspareunia, or vaginal dryness; depression as one positive response to a validated three-question screening instrument; and anxiety as a positive response to whether the patient experiences anxiety sometimes or often. Results: The cohort was 52.9±6.8 years of age (mean±standard deviation [SD]) and 80.0% Hispanic, and 47.8% were unemployed. The majority (92.8%) earned p=0.01) and that of anxiety was 76.6% vs. 45.7% (p=0.01) among women with vs. without a decrease in sexual desire. The prevalence of depression was 83.3% vs. 55.9% (p=0.03) and that of anxiety was 76.7% vs. 52.9% (p=0.07) among women who reported dyspareunia vs. those who did not. Problems sleeping was the only variable associated with a statistically higher likelihood of FSD (odds ratio [OR] 5.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22–25.33, p=0.03). No significant differences were seen when comparing FSD between Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Conclusions: This sample of predominantly Hispanic women of low SES had a high prevalence of FSD. These data also suggest that poor sleep is significantly associated with FSD and that women of low SES with FSD may have a significantly higher prevalence of depression and anxiety.

N2  - With salivary assessment of steroid hormones increasing, more work is needed to address fundamental properties of steroid hormone levels in humans. Using a test–retest design and radioimmunoassay assessment of salivary steroids, we tested the reliability of testosterone, cortisol, and progesterone levels across two weeks, as well as the effects of oral contraceptives, menstrual cycle phase, and time of day on steroid hormone levels. Testosterone and cortisol were found to be highly reliable in both sexes. Progesterone was found to be reliable after collapsing across sex. Oral contraceptive use was associated with lower levels of testosterone, but did not affect cortisol. Contrary to expectations, oral contraceptives also did not affect progesterone. Menstrual cycle was found to affect levels of progesterone, but not testosterone or cortisol. Time of day had an effect on cortisol, on progesterone only at one testing time, and no effect on testosterone. We explored the interhormone correlations among testosterone, progesterone, and cortisol. All three hormones were positively correlated with one another in men. In women, progesterone was positively correlated with testosterone and cortisol, but testosterone and cortisol were uncorrelated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background and objective: Raloxifene has been used as therapy for osteoporosis and ER+ breast cancer prevention in menopausal women. However, its effects on cognition and climacteric syndrome are controversial. This study reviews the relevant studies and reaches a comprehensive conclusion. Methods: We retrieved thirteen electronic databases, read the titles and abstracts to exclude ineligible articles, and then read the full text and references to form a basis for decisions using the inclusion criteria. If full text was not available, we asked the author for a copy of the article. After the data were extracted and recorded, the research quality was evaluated by two authors using the Jadad score and Cochrane handbook. Results: We found seven eligible studies. The design, evaluated items, questionnaires and scales were heterogeneous. The design quality was fair as evaluated by the Cochrane Handbook. We found that 60 mg/day raloxifene could improve verbal memory, and 120 mg/day raloxifene produced a 33% decrease in the risk of mild cognitive impairment and also lowered the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. There was not enough evidence to state if raloxifene had any effect on depression, anxiety, sleep, sexual function, vasomotor symptoms, but significantly worsened menstrual symptoms. Conclusion: Raloxifene may have some benefit for cognition, but it is not significant effect on anxiety, depression, sleep, sexual function, vasomotor symptoms and worsens menstrual symptoms. This drug is safe for treating osteoporosis and preventing breast cancer in menopausal women, but it is not suitable for patients who have any arterial stenosis or thrombophilia.

N2  - Study Objectives: Menstrual problems and daytime sleepiness are prevalent in adolescent girls. Little is known about the associations between age at menarche, menstrual problems, and daytime sleepiness. This study aimed to examine the associations of age at menarche and menstrual problems with daytime sleepiness among Chinese adolescent girls. Methods: Of 11,831 adolescents who participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort (SABHC), 5,813 were girls and included for the analysis. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information about menstrual problems, sleep, mental health, and demographics. Daytime sleepiness was measured by the Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale (CADSS). Results: The mean age of the girls was 15.02 (SD = 1.44) years. The prevalence rates of mild, moderate, and severe daytime sleepiness were 20.5%, 16.7%, and 5.5%, respectively. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates (age, body mass index, physical health, physical exercise, sleep duration, sleep problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, and family social economic status), sometimes irregular (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.52), often irregular menstruation (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.17 to 2.12), moderate (OR=1.39, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.72), and severe (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.04) menstrual pain were significantly associated with increased risk of daytime sleepiness. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that menstrual irregularity and menstrual pain are associated with increased risk of daytime sleepiness. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating and intervening menstrual problems for preventing daytime sleepiness in adolescent girls.

N2  - Background: Psychosocial and inflammatory factors have been associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors. Nevertheless, the relative contribution and/or interaction of these factors with cancer-related fatigue have not been well documented. Method: This cross-sectional study enrolled 111 stage 0–III breast cancer patients treated with breast surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy. Fatigue was measured by the total score of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20. Potential risk factors included inflammatory markers (plasma cytokines and their receptors and C-reactive protein; CRP), depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self Reported), sleep (as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and perceived stress (as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale) as well as age, race, marital status, smoking history, menopause status, endocrine treatment, chemotherapy and cancer stage. Linear regression modeling was employed to examine risk factors of fatigue. Only risk factors with a significance level post-hoc mediation model using PROCESS SPSS was conducted to examine the association among depressive symptoms, sleep problems, stress, inflammation and fatigue. Results: At 1 year post-radiotherapy, depressive symptoms (p p = 0.015; interleukin-1 receptor antagonist: p = 0.014; soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2: p = 0.009 in separate models) were independent risk factors of fatigue. Mediation analysis showed that depressive symptoms also mediated the associations of fatigue with sleep and stress. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and inflammation were independent risk factors for cancer-related fatigue at 1 year post-radiotherapy, and thus represent independent treatment targets for this debilitating symptom.

N2  - Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been suggested as a potential mechanism linking sleep and cardiometabolic disorders. However, the associations of two primary outputs of the HPA axis, cortisol and its antagonist dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), with sleep are less well studied. In the Nurses' Health Study II, 233 postmenopausal women provided five timed saliva samples over one day (immediately upon waking, 45 min, 4 h, and 10 h after waking, and prior to going to sleep) to measure cortisol and DHEA. Of these, 209 completed assessment of their habitual sleep patterns using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We used piecewise linear mixed models to compare cross-sectional associations of slopes reflecting diurnal cortisol and DHEA rhythms with overall sleep quality and with seven sub-components. Overall, we observed no differences in the diurnal patterns of cortisol or DHEA between good versus poor sleepers as assessed by the global PSQI score. However, longer sleep latency was associated with significantly reduced cortisol awakening rise (p = 0.02). Poorer subjective sleep quality (p = 0.02), shorter sleep duration (p = 0.02), and lower sleep efficiency (p = 0.03) were associated with slower rate of cortisol decline later in the day. Women reporting daytime dysfunction had a sharper cortisol decline early in the day (p = 0.03) but a flattened decline later in the day (p = 0.01). The differences in diurnal patterns of DHEA between good versus poor sleepers, though less pronounced, were similar in direction to those of cortisol. Self-reported sleep duration, efficiency, latency and daytime dysfunction were associated with altered diurnal rhythms of cortisol and, to a lesser extent, DHEA. These findings provide support for the interplay between sleep and the HPA axis that may contribute to cardiometabolic disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: EEG is a valuable tool for evaluation of brain maturation in preterm babies. Preterm EEG constitutes of high voltage burst activities and more suppressed episodes, called interburst intervals (IBIs). Evolution of background characteristics provides information on brain maturation and helps in prediction of neurological outcome. The aim is to develop a method for automated burst detection. Methods: Thirteen polysomnography recordings were used, collected at preterm postmenstrual age of 31.4 (26.1–34.4)weeks. We developed a burst detection algorithm based on the feature line length and compared it with manual scorings of clinical experts and other published methods. Results: The line length–based algorithm is robust (84.27% accuracy, 84.00% sensitivity, 85.70% specificity). It is not critically dependent on the number of measurement channels, because two channels still provide 82% accuracy. Furthermore, it approximates well clinically relevant features, such as median IBI duration 5.45 (4.00–7.11)s, maximum IBI duration 14.02 (8.73–18.80)s and burst percentage 48.89 (35.45–60.12)%, with a median deviation of respectively 0.65s, 1.96s and 6.55%. Conclusion: Automated assessment of long-term preterm EEG is possible and its use will optimize EEG interpretation in the NICU. Significance: This study takes a first step towards fully automatic analysis of the preterm brain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Mania in bipolar disorder (BD) and partial (focal) seizures (PS) arising from the temporal lobes, have a number of similarities. Typically, a chronic course of the disorders is punctuated by acute illness episodes. Common features of episodes may include sensory, perceptual, cognitive and affective changes. Both respond to anticonvulsant treatment. Common mechanisms imputed include neurotransmitters and kindling processes. Further investigation may improve understanding of the occurrence of both mania and PS, casting light on the relevance of temporal lobe mediated processes and pathology. One avenue of investigation is to compare aetiological factors and determine the extent of overlap which may indicate shared brain localization or pathophysiology. Aetiology includes predisposing, precipitating or perpetuating factors. This paper examines the literature on precipitating factors of mania, first or subsequent episode, and of PS in diagnosed epilepsy, which is the second or subsequent seizure, to identify the extent and nature of their overlap. Method: Narrative review based on a literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: Precipitating factors for both mania and PS were stress, sleep deprivation, antidepressant medication and, tentatively, emotion. For mania alone, goal-attainment events, spring and summer season, postpartum, and drugs include steroids and stimulants. For PS alone, winter season, menstruation and specific triggers in complex reflex epilepsies. Those not substantiated include lunar phase and menopause. A wide range of chemicals may provoke isolated seizures but by definition epilepsy requires at least two seizures. Conclusions: The overlap of precipitating factors in mania and PS imply that common brain processes may contribute to both, consistent with findings from neuroscience research.

N2  - Objective: To improve mechanistic understanding, this pilot randomized controlled trial examined mediators of an exercise intervention effects on sleep in breast cancer survivors (BCS). Methods: Forty‐six postmenopausal BCS (≤Stage II, off primary treatment) were randomized to a 3‐month exercise intervention or control group. Intervention included 160 min/week of moderate intensity aerobic walking, twice weekly resistance training (resistance bands), and six discussion groups (to improve adherence). Blinded assessments at baseline and post‐intervention included sleep disturbance (PSQI and PROMIS®), objective sleep quality (accelerometer), serum cytokines, accelerometer physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, fatigue, and psychosocial factors. Mediation was tested using Freedman–Schatzkin difference‐in‐coefficients tests. Results: When compared with control, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in PSQI sleep duration (i.e., fewer hours of sleep/night) (d = 0.73, p = .03). Medium to large but non‐significant standardized effect sizes were noted for PSQI daytime somnolence (d = −0.63, p = .05) and accelerometer latency (d = −0.49, p = .14). No statistically significant mediators were detected for PSQI sleep duration score or accelerometer latency. Daytime somnolence was mediated by tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (mediated 23% of intervention effect, p p p p < .05). Mediating or enhancing relationships for several of the sleep outcomes were noted for accelerometer physical activity, PROMIS® fatigue, exercise social support, and/or physical activity enjoyment. Conclusions: Inflammation and psychosocial factors may mediate or enhance sleep response to our exercise intervention. Further study is warranted to confirm our results and translate our findings into more effective interventions aimed at improving sleep quality in BCS.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Sleep hygiene is one factor that contributes to poor sleep in breast cancer survivors but is poorly measured. The purposes of this study were to (a) evaluate the psychometric properties of the Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale (SHAPS) and (b) compare SHAPS scores between midlife women with and without breast cancer. Methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive data from a single-blinded, controlled hot flash intervention trial. Results: 194 women (88 breast cancer survivors; 106 menopausal women). Reliability of the three sections of the SHAPS was inadequate with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.23 to 0.67. Sleep hygiene practices were modestly correlated with global sleep quality in both groups. Conclusions: Findings suggest the SHAPS would need to be revised to be a psychometrically sound measure of sleep hygiene awareness and practice.

N2  - Introduction: Midlife, which encompasses the menopause transition in women, can be a time of disrupted sleep and accelerated atherosclerosis accumulation. Short or poor sleep quality has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; few studies have investigated relations among midlife women. We tested whether shorter actigraphy sleep time or poorer subjective sleep quality was associated with carotid atherosclerosis among midlife women. Aims and Methods: Two hundred fifty-six peri- and postmenopausal women aged 40–60 years completed 3 days of wrist actigraphy, hot flash monitoring, questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], Berlin), a blood draw, and carotid ultrasound [intima media thickness (IMT), plaque]. Associations of objective (actigraphy) and subjective (PSQI) sleep with IMT/plaque were tested in regression models (covariates: age, race, education, body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, insulin resistance, medications, snoring, depressive symptoms, sleep hot flashes, and estradiol). Results: Shorter objective sleep time was associated with higher odds of carotid plaque (for each hour shorter sleep, plaque score ≥ 2, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.58 [1.11–2.27], p = .01; plaque score = 1, OR [95% CI] = 0.95 [0.68–1.32], p = .75, vs. no plaque, multivariable). Poorer subjective sleep quality was associated with higher mean IMT [β, b (standard error, SE) = 0.004 (0.002), p = .03], maximal IMT [b (SE) = 0.009 (0.003), p = .005], and plaque [plaque score ≥ 2, OR (95% CI) = 1.23 (1.09–1.40), p = .001; score = 1, OR (95% CI) = 1.06 (0.93–1.21), p = .37, vs. no plaque] in multivariable models. Findings persisted additionally adjusting for sleep hot flashes and estradiol. Conclusions: Shorter actigraphy-assessed sleep time and poorer subjective sleep quality were associated with increased carotid atherosclerosis among midlife women. Associations persisted adjusting for CVD risk factors, hot flashes, and estradiol. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Diurnal and nocturnal animals differ with respect to the time of day at which the ovulatory surge in luteinizing hormone occurs. In some species this is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the primary circadian clock, via cells that contain vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and vasopressin (AVP). Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that chronotype differences in the timing of the luteinizing hormone surge are associated with rhythms in expression of the genes that encode these neuropeptides. Diurnal grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) were housed in a 12 12-h light dark cycle and killed at one of six times of day (Zeitgeber time 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21; ZT 0 = lights-on). In-situ hybridization was used to compare levels of vip, avp and VIP receptor mRNA (vipr2) in the SCN of intact females, ovariectomized females, ovariectomized females given estradiol and intact males. We found a sex difference in vip rhythms with a peak occurring at ZT 13 in males and ZT 5 in intact females. In all groups avp mRNA rhythms peaked during the day, from ZT 5 to ZT 9, and had a trough in the dark at ZT 21. There was a modest rhythm and sex difference in the pattern of vipr2. Most importantly, the patterns of each of these SCN rhythms relative to the light dark cycle resembled those seen in nocturnal rodents. Chronotype differences in timing of neuroendocrine events associated with ovulation are thus likely to be generated downstream of the SCN. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: Insomnia is a significant public health concern known to particularly impact women and the veteran population; however, rates of insomnia disorder among women veterans are not known. Method:Women veterans who had received health care at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System between 2008 and 2010 and resided within 25 miles of the facility were sent a postal survey assessing sleep, demographics, and other related patient characteristics. Results: A total of 660 women (43.1% of potential responders) returned the postal survey and provided sufficient information for insomnia diagnosis. On average, women reported 6.2 hours of sleep per night. The prevalence of insomnia, determined according to diagnostic criteria from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2, was 52.3%. Women with insomnia reported more severely disturbed sleep, and more pain, menopausal symptoms, stress/worries, and nightmares compared with women without insomnia. There was a quadratic relationship between age and insomnia with women in their mid-40s, most likely to have insomnia. Conclusions: This survey study found that insomnia symptoms were endorsed by more than one-half of the women veterans in this sample of VA users, highlighting the critical need for enhanced clinical identification and intervention. Further research is needed to establish national rates of insomnia among women veterans and to improve access to evidence-based treatment of insomnia disorder.

N2  - The cellular mechanisms governing the impact of the central circadian clock on neuronal networks are incompletely understood. We examine here the influence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus output neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) on the activity of preoptic area kisspeptin neurons. These cells integrate circadian and hormonal signals within the neuronal network that regulates fertility in females. Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices from kisspeptin-GFP mice showed that AVP dose-dependently increased the firing rate of most kisspeptin neurons. These actions were mediated directly at the kisspeptin neuron. Experiments in mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP3 in kisspeptin neurons enabled simultaneous monitoring of intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2+]i) in multiple cells and revealed that AVP increased [Ca2+]i in > 80%of diestrous kisspeptin neurons via a mechanism involving voltage-gated calcium channels. We next examined whether AVP signaling in kisspeptin neurons was time and ovarian cycle dependent. AVP exerted the same effects on diestrous and proestrous days of the ovarian cycle, whether hours before [zeitgeber time 4 (ZT4)–ZT6] or just before (ZT10) the expected time of the proestrous preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge. Remarkably, however, AVP signaling was critically dependent on circulating ovarian steroids as AVP no longer excited preoptic kisspeptin neurons in ovariectomized mice, an effect that was fully restored by estradiol treatment. Together, these studies show that AVP exerts a potent and direct stimulatory influence upon the electrical activity and [Ca2+]i of most preoptic kisspeptin neurons. Unexpectedly, estrogen is found to permit circadian AVP signaling at preoptic kisspeptin neurons rather than dynamically modulate its activity throughout the estrous cycle.

N2  - Objective: Sleep disturbance and hot flashes are common during menopause, but their association is not well understood. We sought to understand the associations among sleep disturbance and the frequency, bothersomeness, and interference of hot flashes in mid-life women. Study design: STRIDE is a study of women ages 40–65 years at varied menopausal stages. We examined the cross-sectional associations of sleep disturbance with the frequency and bothersomeness of hot flashes, and interference of hot flashes with work, social, and leisure activities during the 2nd year of STRIDE. Main outcome measure: Self-reported sleep disturbance. Results: Of the 623 women with complete data, 370 (59%) reported having hot flashes. Bivariate analyses showed that reporting hot flashes with bother, but not hot flashes alone, was associated with sleep disturbance (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.8 [2.0–4.0] and 1.3 [0.7–2.5], respectively). In multivariable models, women reporting bothersome hot flashes were more likely to report sleep disturbance (OR [95% CI]: 2.1 [1.4–3.2]) compared to women who reported no hot flashes. When the perceived interference of hot flashes with work, social activities, and leisure activities were included in the model, the relationships between bothersome hot flashes and sleep disturbance disappeared. Conclusions: Hot flashes are not associated with sleep disturbance, unless they are bothersome. Mid-life patients should routinely be queried about the bothersomeness of their hot flashes.

N2  - Objective: Recent research suggests nicotine metabolism may be influenced by sex hormones. Thus, we hypothesized that circadian smoking patterns would vary by menstrual phase. Methods: Healthy female smokers (n = 31) between the ages of 18 and 40 with regular menstrual cycles, and not using hormones or psychotropic medications, were recruited for a randomized clinical study. Subjects recorded the time of each cigarette smoked and their menstrual phase with daily diaries prospectively for one complete menstrual cycle of ad libitum smoking. Analyses included Poisson regression to assess variations in the rate of smoking during waking hours (i.e., 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 midnight) and circadian smoking patterns by menstrual phase. Results: Participants were 29.61 ± 5.44 years of age and smoked 16.93 ± 5.37 cigarettes per day. Participants had a lower rate of smoking during waking hours in the follicular phase as compared to the menses phase. There were no significant menstrual phase differences in the circadian smoking patterns. Conclusions: These results offer further support for the influence of sex hormones on smoking behavior, but not on circadian patterns of smoking. Additional research is needed to study the direct relationship between nicotine metabolism, sex hormones, menstrual phase, and smoking behavior.

N2  - Sleep disturbance is a prevalent health problem that increases with age and occurs more frequently in women than in men. In women, insomnia increases particularly as women approach and pass through menopause. The aims of our study were to investigate the differences in sleep and awakening between untreated insomniac postmenopausal syndrome patients and normal controls as well as to compare the effects of continuous combined administration of 2 mg estradiol valerate plus 3 mg dienogest 2/3; regimen A) with those of estradiol valerate alone and placebo in a first double-blind, controlled phase. This was followed by an open-label phase, in which all patients were treated with a combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate plus 2 mg dienogest, to allow a stratified comparison of the 2/2 mg preparation vs. placebo or vs. the 2/3 mg preparation (A).

N2  - Menopausal women frequently report unsatisfactory sleep. Persistent insomnia in a midlife woman is not a single entity but comprises a wide spectrum of conditions, which may arise from a combination of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. Etiologies other than menopause should also be considered and investigated. An individual woman's insomnia may be multifactorial. Comprehensive history and appropriate physical examination combined with specific diagnostic tools such as polysomnography (PSG) or cardiorespiratory polygraphy form the basis for correct diagnosis and successful therapeutic interventions. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy (HT), hypnotic agents, and behavioral interventions as well as specifically targeted medication for depression, anxiety or other psychiatric disorders, or restless legs syndrome (RLS) or appropriate treatment for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Optimization of treatment of medical conditions has to be considered. Effective therapies are available to treat insomnia of different etiologies in midlife women. Once a specific diagnosis is made, an affected woman deserves appropriate treatment because marked improvements in quality of life and health outcomes can be achieved.

N2  - Supraphysiologic-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with physiologic, cognitive, and brain abnormalities similar to those found in people at risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease and its related dementias (AD/ADRD), which are associated with high brain β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (tau-P) protein levels. Supraphysiologic-dose AAS induces androgen abnormalities and excess oxidative stress, which have been linked to increased and decreased expression or activity of proteins that synthesize and eliminate, respectively, Aβ and tau-P. Aβ and tau-P accumulation may begin soon after initiating supraphysiologic-dose AAS use, which typically occurs in the early 20s, and their accumulation may be accelerated by other psychoactive substance use, which is common among non-medical AAS users. Accordingly, the widespread use of supraphysiologic-dose AAS may increase the numbers of people who develop dementia. Early diagnosis and correction of sex-steroid level abnormalities and excess oxidative stress could attenuate risk for developing AD/ADRD in supraphysiologic-dose AAS users, in people with other substance use disorders, and in people with low sex-steroid levels or excess oxidative stress associated with aging.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this research was to analyze gabapentin’s effect on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores in menopausal women. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from a cohort of menopausal women participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin 300mg three times daily (TID) for hot flashes. The outcomes of interest were PSQI global and factor scores at weeks 4 and 12. Results: Subjects randomized to gabapentin demonstrated improvement in the sleep quality factor score, compared to placebo-treated subjects, at 4 and 12 weeks ( p < 0.03). There was also gabapentin-associated improvement in the global PSQI score ( p = 0.004) and the sleep efficiency factor score ( p = 0.05) at 4 weeks. There was no significant effect of gabapentin on the daily disturbance factor score. Conclusions: Gabapentin may improve sleep quality in menopausal women with hot flashes. These results warrant further prospective investigation, with an emphasis on measuring subjective sleep quality and maintenance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Women are at a higher risk than men of developing depression and anxiety and such increased risk might be particularly associated with reproductive cycle events. Recent evidence suggests that the transition to menopause may constitute a window of vulnerability for some women for the development of new onset and recurrent depression. Several biological and environmental factors seem to be independent predictors or modulating factors for the occurrence of depression in menopausal women; they include the presence and severity of hot flushes, sleep disturbances, history of severe premenstrual syndrome or postpartum blues, stressful life events, history of depression, socioeconomic status, and use of hormones and psychotropic agents. The regulation of monoaminergic systems by ovarian hormones might explain, at least in part, the emergence of depressive symptoms and/or anxiety in biologically predisposed subpopulations. The use of transdermal estradiol, as well as serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants, is an efficacious strategy in the treatment of depression and vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic women in midlife. In this review, the authors discuss the existing evidence of a greater risk for the development of depression during the menopausal transition and the putative underlying mechanisms contributing to this window of vulnerability. Hormonal and nonhormonal treatment strategies for depression and anxiety in this particular population are critically examined, although more tailored treatment options are still needed.

N2  - Importance: Indoor nighttime light exposure influences sleep and circadian rhythms and is known to affect mood-associated brain circuits in animals. However, little is known about the association between levels of nighttime outdoor light and sleep and mental health in the population, especially among adolescents. Objective: To estimate associations of outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) with sleep patterns and past-year mental disorder among US adolescents. Design, setting, and participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study of US adolescents used the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted from February 2001 through January 2004. A probability sample of adolescents aged 13 to 18 years was included. Analyses were conducted between February 2019 and April 2020. Exposures: Levels of outdoor ALAN, measured by satellite, with means calculated within census block groups. ALAN values were transformed into units of radiance (nW/cm2/sr). Main outcomes and measures: Self-reported habitual sleep patterns (weeknight bedtime, weeknight sleep duration, weekend bedtime delay, and weekend oversleep) and past-year mood, anxiety, behavior, and substance use disorders, measured via an in-person structured diagnostic interview. Parent-reported information was included in behavior disorder diagnoses. Results: Among 10 123 adolescents (4953 boys [51.3%]; mean [SE] age, 15.2 [0.06] years [weighted]; 6483 for behavior disorder outcomes), ALAN was positively associated with indicators of social disadvantage, such as racial/ethnic minority status (median [IQR] ALAN: white adolescents, 12.96 [30.51] nW/cm²/sr; Hispanic adolescents: 38.54 [47.84] nW/cm²/sr; non-Hispanic black adolescents: 37.39 [51.88] nW/cm²/sr; adolescents of other races/ethnicities: 30.94 [49.93] nW/cm²/sr; P6: 21.46 [34.38] nW/cm2/sr; P = .005). After adjustment for several sociodemographic characteristics, as well as area-level population density and socioeconomic status, this study found that higher ALAN levels were associated with later weeknight bedtime, and those in the lowest quartile of ALAN reported the longest weeknight sleep duration. Those in the highest quartile of ALAN went to bed 29 (95% CI, 15-43) minutes later and reported 11 (95% CI, 19-2) fewer minutes of sleep than those in the lowest quartile. ALAN was also positively associated with prevalence of past-year mood and anxiety disorder: each median absolute deviation increase in ALAN was associated with 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00-1.14) times the odds of mood disorder and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.16) times the odds of anxiety disorder. Further analyses revealed associations with bipolar disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.35]), specific phobias (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.11-1.26]), and major depressive disorder or dysthymia (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.15]). Among adolescent girls, differences in weeknight bedtime by ALAN (third and fourth quartiles vs first quartile) were greater with increasing years since menarche (F₃, 8.15; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: In this study, area-level outdoor ALAN was associated with less favorable sleep patterns and mood and anxiety disorder in adolescents. Future studies should elucidate whether interventions to reduce exposure to ALAN may positively affect mental and sleep health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Hot flashes, hormones, and psychosocial factors contribute to insomnia risk in the context of the menopausal transition. Stress is a well-recognized factor implicated in the pathophysiology of insomnia; however the impact of stress on sleep and sleep-related processes in perimenopausal women remains largely unknown. We investigated the effect of an acute experimental stress (impending Trier Social Stress Task in the morning) on pre-sleep measures of cortisol and autonomic arousal in perimenopausal women with and without insomnia that developed in the context of the menopausal transition. In addition, we assessed the macro- and micro-structure of sleep and autonomic functioning during sleep. Following adaptation to the laboratory, twenty two women with (age: 50.4 ± 3.2 years) and eighteen women without (age: 48.5 ± 2.3 years) insomnia had two randomized in-lab overnight recordings: baseline and stress nights. Anticipation of the task resulted in higher pre-sleep salivary cortisol levels and perceived tension, faster heart rate and lower vagal activity, based on heart rate variability measures, in both groups of women. The effect of the stress manipulation on the autonomic nervous system extended into the first 4h of the night in both groups. However, vagal tone recovered 4–6h into the stress night in controls but not in the insomnia group. Sleep macrostructure was largely unaltered by the stress, apart from a delayed latency to REM sleep in both groups. Quantitative analysis of non-rapid eye movement sleep microstructure revealed greater electroencephalographic (EEG) power in the beta1 range (15–≤ 23 Hz), reflecting greater EEG arousal during sleep, on the stress night compared to baseline, in the insomnia group. Hot flash frequency remained similar on both nights for both groups. These results show that pre-sleep stress impacts autonomic nervous system functioning before and during sleep in perimenopausal women with and without insomnia. Findings also indicate that women with insomnia had increased EEG arousal and lacked recovery in vagal activity across the stress night suggesting a greater sensitivity to stress in this group.

N2  - This study aimed to examine whether the characteristics of mental health and sleep duration, alone or in combination, are associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. This population-based, cross-sectional study analyzed the data from 4445 women aged 19–49 years, who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010–2012. A structured questionnaire was used to assess mental health characteristics, sleep duration, and menstrual cycle irregularity. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. High stress, depressive mood, and suicidal ideation were associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity after adjusting for confounding variables (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.33 [1.07–1.65], 1.56 [1.17–2.07], and 1.37 [1.01–1.87], respectively). Short sleep duration (≤ 5 h a day) was significantly associated with higher odds of severe menstrual cycle irregularity with menstrual interval of greater than 3 months (2.67 [1.35–5.27]). Participants with sleep duration of ≤ 5 h a day with psychological stress, depressive mood, or suicidal ideation had higher odds of menstrual cycle irregularity (1.96 [1.26–3.05], 2.86 [1.50–5.44], and 2.25 [1.18–4.29]). This study suggests positive associations of mental health problems and short sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adults. Therefore, strategies to deal with psychological stress, depressive mood, and sleep duration are needed for improving the reproductive health of women suffering from menstrual disturbances.

N2  - The first descriptions of patients with recurrent episodes of sleepiness and pathologic hunger date back to Kleine in Germany, Lewis and Levin in the USA. In 1936, Levin rewrote his original case report, and made for the first time specific mention of "a syndrome of periodic somnolence and morbid hunger" as a new entity in pathology. Six years later, Critchley and Hoffman reported two more cases of periodic somnolence and morbid hunger and coined the term Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS). Classification of Sleep Disorders introduced the term "recurrent hypersomnia" (including KLS and menstrual-related hypersomnia (MRH)) with the following diagnostic criteria: A) The patient experiences recurrent episodes of excessive sleepiness of 2 days to 4 weeks' duration; B) Episodes recur at least once a year; C) The patient has normal alertness, cognitive functioning and behavior between attacks; D) The hypersomnia is not better explained by another sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. Diagnostic criteria are not provided for KLS and MRH, but it is indicated that "a diagnostic of KLS should be reserved for cases in which recurrent episodes of hypersomnia are clearly associated with behavioral abnormalities. These may include binge eating; hypersexuality; abnormal behavior such as irritability, aggression, and odd behavior; and cognitive abnormalities such as feeling of unreality, confusion, and hallucinations." This is a more comprehensive definition of KLS, moving away from Critchley's definition, as binge eating is not compulsory for the diagnosis. As for MRH, "recurrent episodes of sleepiness that occur in association with the menstrual cycle may be indicative of it.". In this chapter we review the genetics of Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) and menstrual-related hypersomnia (MRH)) including familial aspects, twin studies, ethnicity, the susceptibility genes and the autoimmune hypothesis.

N2  - The role of gender and menopause in obstructive sleep apnoea is well known; however, no study has reported the impact of gender on the clinical presentation and the nocturnal respiratory events in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Therefore, this study prospectively evaluated differences in the clinical characteristics of women and men with obesity hypoventilation syndrome in a large cohort of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. During the study period, a total of 1973 patients were referred to the sleep clinic with clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnoea. All patients underwent overnight polysomnography, during which time spirometry, arterial blood samples and thyroid tests were routinely obtained. Among 1973 consecutive patients, 1693 (617 women) were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea, among whom 144 suffered from obesity hypoventilation syndrome (96 women). The prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome among women and men was 15.6% and 4.5%, respectively (P P P < 0001). HCO₃ and duration of SpO₂ < 90% were the only independent predictors of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. In conclusion, this study reported that among subjects referred to the sleep disorders clinic for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnoea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome is more prevalent in women than men, and that women with obesity hypoventilation syndrome suffer from significantly more co‐morbidities. Post‐menopausal women with obstructive sleep apnoea have the highest prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Evidence is accumulating that aldosterone may exert central actions and influence mental functions. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that major depressive disorder affects the diurnal variation of salivary aldosterone and that aldosterone concentrations reflect the duration and severity of the depressive episode in a sex dependent manner. The sample consisted of 60 patients (37 postmenopausal women, 23 men) with major depressive disorder. Patients were examined two times, in acute depressive episode (admission to the hospital) and after reaching clinical remission (discharge). The samples of saliva were taken by the patients themselves twice a day (8.00-9.00 h in the morning and in the evening). Aldosterone concentrations were significantly higher in women compared to men and were significantly higher at the time of admission to the hospital compared to those at the discharge. Morning but not evening salivary aldosterone concentrations reflected the length of the depressive episode in women as well as the severity of the disorder in both sexes. Moreover, the patients with depression failed to exert known daily rhythmicity of aldosterone release. The present study brings several pieces of evidence suggesting the association of aldosterone with the pathophysiology of depression. Salivary aldosterone concentrations appear to reflect the outcome, the duration and the severity of the depressive episode in a sex dependent manner.

N2  - The effect of menstrual cycle phase on sleep has been studied for decades; however, individual differences in the associations between sleep and menstrual phase have not been well studied. In addition, the associations between changes in sleep and other physiological and psychological factors that vary as a function of menstrual phase have not been thoroughly assessed. This study explored individual differences in daily self-reports of difficulty sleeping across the menstrual cycle, as well as associations between daily changes in difficulty sleeping and psychological/vegetative and somatic symptoms. Participants (n = 213 females, mean age = 21.29 ± 4.01 years) completed daily online questionnaires assessing` sleep, psychological and physical symptoms for two menstrual cycles. Two patterns of menstrual cycle-related self-reported difficulty sleeping emerged in addition to women who showed no cyclical change in self-reported difficulty sleeping: a perimenstrual increase and a mid-cycle increase. All psychological/vegetative symptoms and some of the somatic symptoms showed significant associations with self-reported difficulty sleeping. These findings highlight the importance of examining individual differences in sleep across the menstrual cycle and the significant contribution of a wide range of menstrual cycle-related psychological/vegetative and somatic symptoms.

N2  - Women with severe premenstrual syndrome report sleep‐related complaints in the late‐luteal phase, but few studies have characterized sleep disturbances prospectively. This study evaluated sleep quality subjectively and objectively using polysomnographic and quantitative electroencephalographic measures in women with severe premenstrual syndrome. Eighteen women with severe premenstrual syndrome (30.5 ± 7.6 years) and 18 women with minimal symptoms (controls, 29.2 ± 7.3 years) had polysomnographic recordings on one night in each of the follicular and late‐luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Women with premenstrual syndrome reported poorer subjective sleep quality when symptomatic in the late‐luteal phase compared with the follicular phase (P P P r = −0.64, P = 0.005) and more perceived nighttime awakenings (r = −0.50, P = 0.03). Our findings show that women with premenstrual syndrome perceive their sleep quality to be poorer in the absence of polysomnographically defined poor sleep. Anxiety has a strong impact on sleep quality ratings, suggesting that better control of mood symptoms in women with severe premenstrual syndrome may lead to better subjective sleep quality.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance is one of the common complaints in menopause. This study investigated the relationship between menopausal symptoms and sleep quality in middle-aged women. Method: This cross-sectional observational study involved 634 women aged 44−56 years attending a healthcare center at Kangbuk Samsung Hospitals. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between Menopause-specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) scores and PSQI scores and Menopause-specific Quality of Life (MENQOL)scores. Results: The mean PSQI score was 3.6 ± 2.3, and the rates of poor sleep quality(PSQI score > 5) in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women were 14.4%, 18.2%, and 30.2%, respectively. Total PSQI score, specifically the sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances scores, were significantly increased in postmenopausal women. Multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, marital status, family income, education, employment status, parity, physical activity, depression symptoms, perceived stress and menopausal status showed that higher PSQI score was positively correlated with higher vasomotor(β = 0.240, P = 0.020)and physical(β = 0.572, P < 0.001) scores. Conclusions: Vasomotor and physical menopause symptoms was related to poor sleep quality. Effective management strategies aimed at reducing menopausal symptoms may improve sleep quality among women around the time of menopause. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate ethnic differences in the associations of nighttime sleep and daytime napping durations with prevalent type 2 diabetes. Methods: Samples of White (n = 908), Filipina (n = 330), and Black (n = 371) community-dwelling, postmenopausal women aged 50–86 years were evaluated with cross-sectional data obtained during 1992–1999 including self-reported duration of nighttime sleep and daytime napping, behaviors, medical history, and medication use. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was evaluated with a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Results: Overall, 10.9% of White, 37.8% of Filipina, and 17.8% of Black women had type 2 diabetes. Average sleep durations were 7.3, 6.3, and 6.6 h and napping durations were 16.8, 31.7, and 25.9 min for White, Filipina, and Black women, respectively. Sleep duration showed a significant (p < 0.01) nonlinear association with type 2 diabetes in Filipina women, with increased odds of diabetes at both low and high sleep durations independent of age, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, hypertension, and daytime napping duration. Daytime napping duration was associated with type 2 diabetes only among White women; those napping ≥ 30 min/day had 74% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 10%, 175%) higher odds of diabetes compared to non-nappers independent of covariates including nighttime sleep duration. Conclusions: Results suggest ethnic-specific associations of nighttime sleep and daytime napping durations with type 2 diabetes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: The effect of total sleep deprivation on heart rate variability (HRV) in groups of postmenopausal women on oral hormone therapy (HT) (on-HT, n = 10, 64.2 (1.4) years), postmenopausal women without HT (off-HT, n = 10, 64.6 (1.4) years) and young women (n = 11, 23.1 (0.5) years) was studied using a prospective case–control setup. Methods: Polysomnography was performed over an adaptation night, a baseline night, and a recovery night after 40 h of total sleep deprivation. Time and frequency domain and nonlinear HRV from overnight electrocardiogram recordings were compared between groups during baseline and recovery nights. Further, the changes in HRV from baseline to recovery were analysed and compared between groups. Finally, correlations of HRV to percentages of sleep stages and measures of sleep fragmentation were analysed during baseline and recovery. Results: Young women had higher HRV than older women; the most marked difference was between young and on-HT postmenopausal women. Sleep deprivation induced a decrease in frequency domain HRV in young and in off-HT women, an increase in α2 in off-HT women, and an increase in mean heart rate in on-HT women. The sleep deprivation effect was mainly uncorrelated to changes in sleep parameters. Conclusions: Acute total sleep deprivation has a deleterious effect on the autonomic nervous system in young women, but an even more pronounced effect in postmenopausal women. Hormone therapy use in late postmenopause does not give protection against these changes. These harmful effects may partly explain the increased cardiovascular morbidity and overall mortality associated with sleep loss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Persistent pain conditions, including low back pain (LBP), are often accompanied by alterations in pronociceptive and antinociceptive mechanisms, as quantified by temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). It remains unclear whether altered pain sensitivity, CPM, and/or TSP are a consequence of pain presence or determine the degree of pain development. Pressure pain sensitivity, TSP, and CPM were assessed across an episode of exercise-induced LBP maintained for several days. Thirty healthy individuals participated in 3 experimental sessions: before (day 0), 2 days after fatiguing back muscle exercise with exercise-induced LBP present (day 2), and after pain resolution (day 7). Both handheld and cuff pressure–pain thresholds, along with TSP (10-cuff pain stimuli at .5 Hz) and CPM (cuff pain detection threshold prior versus during painful pressure conditioning) were assessed, alongside questionnaires pertaining to pain, disability, mood, sleep, menstruation, physical activity, and catastrophizing. The exercise-induced LBP model produced mild pain and disability, and reductions in pressure pain thresholds over both the lumbar and distant testing sites (p p > .44) or CPM (p > .17). The baseline TSP was associated with the peak pain intensity of the exercise-induced LBP (p < .003). Perspective: Pressure–pain sensitivity was impacted by the presence of exercise-induced LBP, whereas TSP seemed to be more stable and was instead associated with the intensity of pain developed. No significant pain-related changes or associations were observed for CPM, suggesting this measure may have less usefulness in mild musculoskeletal pain conditions.

N2  - This study assessed whether premenstrual symptomatology and/or sleep characteristics explain increased luteal phase psychophysiological reactivity to laboratory stressors.We hypothesized that: (1) premenstrual symptoms and sleep characteristics would explain greater luteal versus follicular phase psychophysiological reactivity, (2) symptoms and sleep characteristics would differentially predict psychophysiological reactivity within each cycle phase, and (3) symptoms and sleep characteristics would interact to affect luteal but not follicular reactivity. Freely cycling women (N = 87) completed two laboratory sessions, one follicular (cycle days 5–9) and one luteal (days 7–10 post-ovulation). We employed two stressors: one physical (cold pressor task) and the other cognitive in nature (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task). During testing, electrocardiography monitored heart rate (HR) while a timed and auto-inflatable sphygmomanometer assessed blood pressure (BP). Participants also completed a one-time self-report measure of sleep characteristics and premenstrual symptomatology as well as a measure of state anxiety pre-post stressor. Results revealed greater luteal HR and systolic BP reactivity compared to follicular reactivity (p  0.001 for both analyses), however neither premenstrual symptoms nor sleep characteristics explained this luteal increase. Within cycle analyses revealed that symptoms and sleep characteristics interacted to affect luteal phase state anxiety reactivity (R² = .32, p = .002) with negative affect being associated with more reactivity when sleep hours were low (β = .333, p = .04). Overall, significant relationships existed during the luteal phase only. Findings are discussed in terms of clinical utility and methodological challenges related to performing laboratory stress testing in women.

N2  - The Women’s Health Clinic (WHC) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, has provided consultative care to women with menopausal and sexual health concerns since 2005. Clinical information on the 8688 women seen in the WHC through May 2017 who gave consent for the use of their medical records in research is contained in the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and Sexuality (DREAMS). Initially, DREAMS was created to improve the clinical care of women, but it has become a valuable research tool. About 25% of the DREAMS women have been seen in the WHC 2 or more times, allowing for passive longitudinal follow-up. Additionally, about 25% of the DREAMS women live in the 27-county region included in the expanded Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system, providing additional information on those women. The cohort has been used to investigate associations between: caffeine intake and vasomotor symptom bother; recent abuse (physical, sexual, verbal, and emotional) and menopausal symptoms; specific menopausal symptoms and self-reported view of menopause; and obstructive sleep apnea risk and vasomotor symptom severity and the experience of vasomotor symptoms in women older than 60 years. A study nearing completion describes a clinical series of over 3500 women presenting for sexual health consultation by sexual function domain and by decade of life. Other studies under way are determining correlates with sexual health and dysfunction. Planned studies will investigate associations between the experience with menopause and the risk of disease.

N2  - Up to 25% of ovulating women suffer from primary dysmenorrhea, a condition associated with pain and transient-reduced quality of life, along with greater irritability and impaired sleep. In the present study, we asked whether and if so to what extent melatonin and meloxicam can improve subjective and objective sleep and reduce pain among women with primary dysmenorrhea (PD). To this end, we conducted a double-blind cross-over clinical trial lasting for three menstrual cycles. A total of 14 women (mean age M = 27.5 years) with primary dysmenorrhea took part in the study. At baseline, that is, during the first menstruation, they completed a visual analogue scale to rate pain; sleep continuity was assessed via actigraphs, and overall sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Next, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either melatonin during the second, and meloxicam during the third menstruation, or meloxicam during the second, and melatonin during the third menstruation. Neither participants nor investigators were aware of participants’ study assignment. During the second and third menstruations, the assessments described above were repeated. At baseline, sleep assessed both objectively and subjectively was impaired, and pain was high. Subjective sleep improved and pain decreased during the second and third menstruations irrespective of whether melatonin or meloxicam was administered first or second. Likewise, objective sleep efficiency increased and objective sleep latency shortened. The efficacy of melatonin was superior to that of meloxicam. The present pattern of results suggests that both melatonin and meloxicam are suitable to treat pain and PD-related sleep complaints among women with primary dysmenorrhea.

N2  - Study Objectives: The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health network conducted three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing six interventions treating vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and also collected self-reported sleep outcomes. A fourth RCT assessed an intervention for insomnia symptoms among women with VMS. We describe these seven interventions’ effects relative to control in women with comparably severe insomnia symptoms and VMS. Methods: We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 546 peri- and postmenopausal women with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) ≥ 12, and ≥14 bothersome VMS/week across the four RCTs. Interventions included the following: escitalopram 10–20 mg/day; yoga; aerobic exercise; 1.8 g/day omega-3 fatty acids; oral 17-beta-estradiol 0.5-mg/day; venlafaxine XR 75-mg/day; and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Outcome measures were ISI and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) over 8–12 weeks of treatment. Results: CBT-I produced the greatest reduction in ISI from baseline relative to control at −5.2 points (95% CI −7.0 to −3.4). Effects on ISI were similar for exercise at −2.1 and venlafaxine at −2.3 points. Comparably small decreases in ISI were observed with escitalopram, yoga, and estradiol. The largest reduction in PSQI from baseline was with CBT-I at −2.7 points (−3.9 to −1.5), although PSQI decreases of 1.2 to 1.6 points were significantly better than control with escitalopram, exercise, yoga, estradiol, and venlafaxine. Omega-3 supplements did not improve insomnia symptoms. Conclusions: This study’s findings support current recommendations for CBT-I as a first line treatment in healthy midlife women with insomnia symptoms and moderately bothersome VMS.

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of live and recorded lullabies on physiological and behavioural state outcomes of stable preterm infants. We conducted a prospective, repeated measures crossover study, involving 35 stable infants of less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Each infant received a different intervention for three consecutive days (live lullabies, recorded lullabies, and no-music sessions). The infant was observed every 5 min for 30 min before, 20 min during, and 30 min after the intervention. The results revealed that the infants’ heart rate (HR) decreased significantly for the live and recorded lullabies conditions but not for the control condition (p = .02). The findings also suggest that the live lullabies condition resulted in a deeper sleep than the recorded lullabies condition (p = .02) and the control condition (p = .006). No changes were observed in oxygen saturation level. The results of this study show that lullabies effectively reduce the HR of preterm infants less than 32 weeks postmenstrual age, and live lullabies have a greater beneficial impact on their sleep state than recorded lullabies.

N2  - Many aspects of female reproduction often require intricate timing, ranging from the temporal regulation of reproductive hormone secretion to the precise timing of sexual behaviour. In particular, in rodents and other species, ovulation is triggered by a surge in pituitary luteinising hormone (LH) secretion that is governed by a complex interaction between circadian signals arising in the hypothalamus and ovarian-derived oestradiol signals acting on multiple brain circuitries. These circadian and hormonal pathways converge to stimulate a precisely-timed surge in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release (i.e. positive-feedback), thereby triggering the preovulatory LH surge. Reflecting its control by afferent circadian signals, the preovulatory LH surge occurs at a specific time of day, typically late afternoon in nocturnal rodents. Although the specific mechanisms mediating the hormonal and circadian regulation of GnRH/LH release have remained poorly understood, recent findings now suggest that oestradiol and circadian signals govern specific reproductive neuropeptide circuits in the hypothalamus, including the newly-identified kisspeptin and RFamide-related peptide (RFRP)-3 neuronal populations. Neurones producing kisspeptin, the protein product of the Kiss1 gene, and RFRP-3 have been shown to provide excitatory and inhibitory input to GnRH neurones, respectively, and are also influenced by sex steroid and circadian signals. In the present review, we integrate classic and recent findings to form a new working model for the neuroendocrine regulation of the circadian-timed preovulatory LH surge in rodents. This model proposes kisspeptin and RFRP-3 neuronal populations as key nodal points for integrating and transducing circadian and hormonal signals to the reproductive axis, thereby governing the precisely-timed LH surge.

N2  - Context: Mounting evidence suggests that many cancer patients suffer from sleep difficulty, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the prevalence and predictors of this adverse symptom. Objectives: The present study investigated the prevalence and predictors of clinically significant sleep difficulty in women with primary breast cancer. Methods: Danish women (n = 3343) with primary breast cancer completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) along with measures of depression, anxiety, physical activity/functioning, and health behaviors three to four months postsurgery. Data on disease status, treatment, and comorbidity were obtained from the Danish Cancer Cooperative Group and surgical departments, and information on sociodemographic factors and psychiatric history was obtained from Danish national longitudinal registries. Results: More than half (57.9%) of the women reported clinically significant sleep difficulty (PSQI >5). Multiple logistic regression identified seven significant predictors of sleep difficulty in the full sample. In order of strength, these were the following: more depressive symptoms, poorer physical functioning, older age, higher levels of trait anxiety, consuming more cigarettes, having undergone lumpectomy, and lower levels of physical activity. Subgroup analysis found that more depressive symptoms and poorer physical functioning were the only two predictors that were significant in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Conclusion: These findings indicate that a high proportion of women with breast cancer experience sleep difficulty. Depression and poorer physical functioning appear to be robust predictors of sleep difficulty, whereas other predictors may depend on sample characteristics, including menopausal status.

N2  - Study Objectives: Little is known about the association between menstruation and sleep disturbance in adolescent girls. This study examined sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality in relation to age at menarche and menstrual problems in a large sample of Chinese adolescent girls. Methods: This report represents the baseline data of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort in Shandong, China. A total of 5800 girls aged 12–18 years (mean age = 15.0, standard deviation = 1.4) participated in the baseline survey. A structured questionnaire was used to assess participants’ age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, period irregularity, period pain, body weight and height, and demographics. Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured by the Youth-Self Report of Child Behavioral Checklist. Sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality were assessed by the items adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: After adjusting for age, school, body mass index, internalizing and externalizing problems, and family covariates, irregular periods (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–2.02), period pain (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.44–2.76), and menstrual flow length ≥7 days (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.00–1.48) were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms. Irregular periods (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.30–2.27) and period pain (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.34–2.37) were significantly associated with poor sleep quality. Age at menarche ≤11 years (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.05–2.50) was significantly associated with insomnia symptoms in 12- to 14-year-old girls. Conclusions: Our results suggest that irregular periods and period pain appear to be associated with sleep disturbance and that early menarche may have short-term impact on sleep in adolescent girls.

N2  - One of the most frequent symptoms in postmenopausal women is sleep disturbance. This study aimed to determine the relationship between sleep quality and lifestyle factors in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (n = 252) in Ahvaz, Iran with an age range of 45–55 years, were enrolled from April to December 2015. The study tools included the Lifestyle Questionnaire (LSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The LSQ contains 10 lifestyle factors: physical health, physical activity, weight control and nutrition, psychological health, spiritual health, social health, medications and narcotics avoidance, illness prevention, accident prevention, and environmental health. Data were analyzed using, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficients, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regressions. In unadjusted analyses, physical health, physical activity, nutrition, mental health, spiritual health, social health, and medication and narcotics avoidance scores were significantly higher in women without sleep disruption than in those with light and moderate sleep disruption (p < .001). Adjusting for confounding factors, sleep disruption was directly related to duration since the final menstrual period (p < .001), and inversely related to physical health (p = .04) and spiritual health (p = .028). Lifestyle factors were related to sleep disruption in postmenopausal women. Policymakers should consider education on healthy lifestyles for women.

N2  - Comments on an article by J. Y. Ko et al. (see record 2012-21336-003) & J. L. Payne (see record 2012-21336-002). The recent articles by Ko et al. and Payne are fascinating and important. Both discusses that in the setting of care by obstetricians and gynecologists, screening is low for psychiatric disorders, which are often under diagnosed. Furthermore, the diagnosis of depression may be missed because of the overlap of pregnancy side effects with symptoms consistent with mood disorder, including sleep disorder and changes in energy, appetite, and concentration. These interesting articles by Ko et al. and Payne highlight the ongoing problem of women suffering from depression, which is not recognized and, therefore, not treated. The issue of unrecognized and untreated depression is significant, however, among all women regardless of age or whether or not they are pregnant. Symptoms of depression, as discussed, can mimic common changes during pregnancy. In older women, they can also mimic angina, and vice versa. In addition, depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and, therefore, is important to recognize in women. Postmenopausal women are at high risk for depression as well as coronary ischemia. The recently published articles by Ko et al. and by Payne are significant in highlighting that women should be screened and treated for depression.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of a fertility awareness-based method supported by a mobile-based application to prevent unwanted pregnancies as a method of natural birth control. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, the application’s efficiency as a contraceptive method was examined on data from 4054 women who used the application as contraception for a total of 2085 woman-years. Results: The number of identified unplanned pregnancies was 143 during 2053 woman-years, giving a Pearl Index of 7.0 for typical use. Ten of the pregnancies were due to the application falsely attributing a safe day within the fertile window, producing a perfect-use Pearl Index of 0.5. Calculating the cumulative pregnancy probability by life-table analysis resulted in a pregnancy rate of 7.5% per year (95% confidence interval 5.9%, 9.1% per year). Conclusions: The application appears to improve the effectiveness of fertility awareness-based methods and can be used to prevent pregnancies if couples consistently protect themselves on fertile days.

N2  - Reply by the current author to the comments made by Glaury Coelho et al. (see record 2015-51635-015) on the original article (see record 2015-07600-003). The authors agree that continued investigation into symptom clusters will further elucidate the menopausal experience and lead to more effective symptom management. Likewise, the authors concur that the rates of sleep disturbance and sexual problems in the sample are consistent with previously reported literature, despite the relatively young age of the participants. It remains to be seen whether the dyadic association of sleep with sexual function may be more important than the triad we posited, which also includes depressed mood. Mood symptoms impact both sleep and sexual function, and sleep disturbances may presage the onset of depressed symptoms, making depressed mood an important consideration in symptom clusters. The authors continue to think that any examination of sleep and sexual function across the menopausal transition and into early menopause requires accounting for depressed mood and would further add that vasomotor symptoms may also be an important component in symptom clusters. Better understanding the clustering of menopausal symptoms may facilitate ongoing investigation into their underlying etiologies and optimal treatment.

N2  - Sleep disturbance is a key behavioral risk factor for chronic medical conditions observed at high rates among overweight and obese individuals. Systemic inflammation, including that induced by stress, may serve as a common biological mechanism linking sleep, adiposity, and disease risk. To investigate these relationships, 48 postmenopausal women (mean age = 61.8) completed a standardized laboratory stress task during which time blood was collected at baseline and 30, 50 and 90+ min after stressor onset to assess circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-6/IL-10 ratio. Self-reported global sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) while adiposity was estimated by body mass index. Sagittal diameter was obtained in clinic to estimate visceral abdominal adiposity. Multi-level growth curve models revealed that poorer self-reported sleep quality was associated with greater stressinduced increases in IL-6/IL-10 ratio. In terms of adiposity, higher sagittal diameter, but not BMI, was associated with greater IL-6 reactivity ( p’s < 0.05). Further, associations between sleep quality and cytokine reactivity varied as a function of sagittal diameter. Among poor sleepers (1 SD above mean of PSQI score), stress-induced increases in IL-6 and IL-6/IL-10 ratio were significantly steeper in those with high visceral adiposity (1 SD above the mean of sagittal diameter) compared to those with low visceral adiposity (1 SD below the mean of sagittal diameter). In sum, poorer sleep quality and greater visceral adiposity, separately and especially in combination, are associated with greater stress-related increases in systemic inflammation. This research may help elucidate the complex link between sleep, obesity and inflammatory disease risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Beginning in their late twenties, women face the unique adaptive problem of declining fertility eventually terminating at menopause. We hypothesize women have evolved a reproduction expediting psychological adaptation designed to capitalize on their remaining fertility. The present study tested predictions based on this hypothesis—these women will experience increased sexual motivations and sexual behaviors compared to women not facing a similar fertility decline. Results from college and community samples (N = 827) indicated women with declining fertility think more about sex, have more frequent and intense sexual fantasies, are more willing to engage in sexual intercourse, and report actually engaging in sexual intercourse more frequently than women of other age groups. These findings suggest women’s “biological clock” may function to shift psychological motivations and actual behaviors to facilitate utilizing remaining fertility.

N2  - Introduction: Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic medical condition experienced by many postmenopausal women. Symptoms include dyspareunia (pain with intercourse), vaginal dryness, and irritation and may affect sexual activities, relationships, and activities of daily life. Aim: The aim of this study is to characterize postmenopausal women’s experience with and perception of VVA symptoms, interactions with healthcare professionals (HCPs), and available treatment options. Methods: An online survey was conducted in the United States in women from KnowledgePanel®, a 56,000-member probability-selected Internet panel projectable to the overall US population. Altogether, 3,046 postmenopausal women with VVA symptoms (the largest US cohort of recent surveys) responded to questions about their knowledge of VVA, impact of symptoms on their activities, communication with HCPs, and use of available treatments. Main Outcome Measures: Percent is calculated as the ratio of response over total responding for each question for all and stratified participants. Results: The most common VVA symptoms were dryness (55% of participants), dyspareunia (44%), and irritation (37%). VVA symptoms affected enjoyment of sex in 59% of participants. Additionally, interference with sleep, general enjoyment of life, and temperament were reported by 24%, 23%, and 23% of participants, respectively. Few women attributed symptoms to menopause (24%) or hormonal changes (12%). Of all participants, 56% had ever discussed VVA symptoms with an HCP and 40% currently used VVA-specific topical treatments (vaginal over-the-counter [OTC] products [29%] and vaginal prescription therapies [11%]). Of those who had discussed symptoms with an HCP, 62% used OTC products. Insufficient symptom relief and inconvenience were cited as major limitations of OTC products and concerns about side effects and cancer risk limited use of topical vaginal prescription therapies. Conclusions: VVA symptoms are common in postmenopausal women. Significant barriers to treatment include lack of knowledge about VVA, reluctance to discuss symptoms with HCPs, safety concerns, inconvenience, and inadequate symptom relief from available treatments.

N2  - There is extensive evidence that sleep restriction alters endocrine function in healthy young men, increasing afternoon cortisol levels and modifying levels of other hormones that regulate metabolism. Recent studies have confirmed these effects in young women, but have not investigated whether menstrual cycle phase influences these responses. The effects on cortisol levels of limiting sleep to 3 h for one night were assessed in two groups of women at different points in their menstrual cycles: mid-follicular and mid-luteal. Eighteen healthy, young women, not taking oral contraceptives (age: 21.8 ± 0.53; BMI: 22.5 ± 0.58 [mean ± SEM]), were studied. Baseline sleep durations, eating habits and menstrual cycles were monitored. Salivary samples were collected at six times of day (08:00, 08:30, 11:00, 14:00, 17:00, 20:00) during two consecutive days: first after a 10 h overnight sleep opportunity (Baseline) and then after a night with a 3h sleep opportunity (Post-sleep restriction). All were awakened at the same time of day. Women in the follicular phase showed a significant decrease (p = 0.004) in their cortisol awakening responses (CAR) after sleep restriction and a sustained elevation in afternoon/evening cortisol levels (p = 0.008), as has been reported for men. Women in the luteal phase showed neither a depressed CAR, nor an increase in afternoon/evening cortisol levels. Secondary analyses examined the impact of sleep restriction on self-reported hunger and mood. Menstrual cycle phase dramatically altered the cortisol responses of healthy, young women to a single night of sleep restriction, implicating effects of spontaneous changes in endocrine status on adrenal responses to sleep loss.

N2  - Objective: This research was conducted to investigate the premenstrual syndrome symptoms in university students, the factors affecting premenstrual syndrome and the relation between premenstrual syndrome and somatization. Methods: The research was performed on 890 students who study at Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University and accepted to take part in the research. Data were collected by a Descriptive Information Form developed by the researchers, the Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PSS) and the Somatization Scale. In the analysis of the data Student t test, ANOVA and Pearson correlation analysis was used. Results: Premenstrual syndrome was detected in 57.2% of the students. Somatization score significantly higher in students with premenstrual syndrome. There were significant relations between the subscale scores of PSS (pain, sleep changes, fatigue, depressive thoughts, anxiety, depressed mood, irritability, and bloating and appetite changes) and somatization score of the students. PSS total mean scores were significantly higher in students who smoke and drink alcohol, who have long menstruation process and menstrual cycles, who have pain in menstruation process, who affect daily life, school attendance and school performance because of menstrual problems, who have a negative perception about menstruation, who have problems related to menstruation in other women in their families and who have admit to doctor because of menstrual problems. Conclusion: Our study shows that PMS is common among university students. Somatization tendency of students with premenstrual syndrome was higher than non-premenstrual syndrome students. Premenstrual syndrome should be addressed through a holistic approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Abnormal sleep duration, either long or short, is associated with disease risk and mortality. Little information is available on sleep duration and its correlates among Chinese women. Methods: Using information collected from 68,832 women who participated in the Shanghai Women’s Health Study (SWHS), we evaluated sleep duration and its correlations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, health status, and anthropometric measurements and their indexes using polynomial logistic regression. Results: The mean age of the study population was 59.6 years (SD = 9.0; range: 44.6–79.9 years) at time of sleep duration assessment. Approximately 80% of women reported sleeping 6–8 h/day, 11.5% slept 5 h or less, and 8.7% slept 9 h or more. As expected, age was the strongest predictor for sleep duration and was negatively correlated with sleep duration. In general, sleep duration was positively associated with energy intake, intakes of total meat and fruits, body mass index (BMI), waist–hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC) after adjustment for age and other factors. Both short and long sleep duration were negatively associated with education level, family income, and leisure-time physical activity and positively associated with number of live births, history of night shift work, and certain chronic diseases, compared to sleep duration around 7 h/day (6.5–7.4 h/day). Short sleep duration was related to tea consumption and passive smoking. Long sleep duration was related to menopausal status and marital status. Conclusions: In this large, population-based study, we found that sleep duration among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women was associated with several sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and with disease status. The main limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design that does not allow us to draw any causal inference. However, this study provides information for future investigation into the nature of these associations so that recommendations can be developed to reduce sleep problems in middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. It also provides important information on potential confounders for investigation of sleep duration on health outcomes in this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Nighttime traffic noise is associated with sleep disturbances, but sleep fragmentation and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have not been demonstrated in individuals living near busy roads. Methods: We asked 1383 participants to answer a health questionnaire and to undergo 24-h electrocardiogram (ECG). Nocturnal ECG records were used to calculate the very low frequency index (VLFI) interval, a surrogate marker of sleep fragmentation. Distances of participants’ addresses to roadways were calculated using the VECTOR25© Swisstopo roads classification, a traffic noise proxy. Distances of homes within 100 or 50m of major roads defined proximity to busy roads. Adjusted multivariate logistic regressions analyzed associations between the distance of home to main roads and VLFI or self-reported SDB. Results: Distance of participants’ homes to main roads was significantly associated with the VLFI in women (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [confidence interval {CI}, 1.03–2.42]; P =.038) but not in men (OR, 1.35 [CI, 0.77–2.35]; P =.295). Women under hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) were at higher risk for increased VLFI when living close to main roads (OR, 2.10 [CI, 1.20–3.68]; P =.01) than untreated women (P =.584). Associations with self-reported SDB were not statistically relevant. Conclusions: In our large population, women living close to main roads were at significantly higher risk for sleep fragmentation than men. The 2-fold higher risk for menopausal women under HRT underscores the vulnerability of this group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Recent studies have shown associations between maternal obesity at pre- or early pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopment in children, suggesting in utero effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain development. In this study, we examined whether brain functional connectivity to the prefrontal lobe network is different in newborns from normal-weight or obese mothers. Thirty-four full-term healthy infants from uncomplicated pregnancies were included, with 18 born to normal-weight and 16 born to obese mothers. Two weeks after delivery, the infants underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during natural sleep, which included structural imaging and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Independent component analysis was used to identify the prefrontal lobe network, and dual regression was used to compare functional connectivity between groups. Infants born to normal-weight mothers had higher recruiting (P P in utero may be associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the newborn offspring’s brain.

N2  - Men sleep shorter and go to bed and get up later than women, thus they are later chronotypes. This difference between the sexes is most pronounced between puberty and menopause indicating the possibility that morningness is subject to sexual dimorphism related to reproductive aspects. The objective of the study was to compare the sleep-wake behavior of women with their actual partners and with their preferred partners. As a hypothesis, we expect some assortment in mating concerning chronotype (with the actual partner), but we also expect a higher synchronization with a preferred ideal partner. 167 women were analyzed in this study (mean age: 23.0 ± 2.57 (SD) years). Mated women were earlier chronotypes than their partners (t = –2.051, p = .042, d = .34) but the difference was small (11:02 min ± 1:04 min). The results of the present study showed women preferring a partner synchronized to their own sleep-wake-rhythm more than their actual partners were. The above result was true either for single facets of the sleep-wake rhythm (e.g. bed time, sleep onset) or for midpoint of sleep on free days—an indicator of actual chronotype: women’s and their partners’ correlation of midpoint of sleep was lower (r = .513) than women’s and their ideal partners’ correlation (r = .855). Amongst various sleep-wake measures, women particularly preferred a partner going to bed at the same time. Assortative mating according to sleep-wake rhythm exists, but women for long-term pair-bonds would like their partners far more synchronized.

N2  - Objective: The most common cognitive problem is attentional impairment in fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS]. We aimed to evaluate the physical, mental and psychological symptoms and to determine the predictor[s] of attentional impairment in premenopausal women with two chronic painful diseases [FMS and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]] and to compare them with healthy pain-free controls [HNCs]. Methods: This study was designed to involve patients with FMS or RA. Healthy normal controls [HNC] were recruited for comparison. Stroop color and word interference test was selected as cognitive measure. Questionnaires regarding FMS symptoms [100mm visual analog scale], quality of life [Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire], sleep disorders [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index] and anxiety and depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] were also applied to all groups. Results: Ninety-eight age- and education-matched premenopausal female patients were recruited. The evaluation groups were FMS [n = 40, mean age: 36.2 ± 7.3 years], RA [n = 28, mean age: 37.3 ± 6.0 years] and HNCs [n = 30, mean age: 33.7 ± 8.0 years]. Scores of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were worse in FMS than in RA and in HNCs [p = 0.001]. The completion times of the Stroop test were similar in patients with FMS and RA but both were worse than with HNCs [p = 0.035]. After the adjustment for age, education level and possible related factors, the Stroop test data were found to correlate with pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, dizziness, forgetfulness and sleeplessness [p  0.05]. Fatigue was the predictor of attentional impairment in stepwise regression analysis. Conclusion: Because of predictive role of fatigue on cognitive functioning, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions should be investigated to increase physical and mental endurance in FMS.

N2  - Objective: Weight, physical activity, and sleep are modifiable lifestyle factors that impact cognitive functioning in noncancer populations but have yet to be examined in cancer survivors. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship of obesity, physical activity, and sleep, with cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Participants were 136 early‐stage postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who completed an assessment of neuropsychological testing, height, weight, physical activity, and sleep. Linear regression models examined the associations of the seven neuropsychological domains with obesity, physical activity, and sleep. Logistic regression models examined odd of impairment in each domain. All models controlled for breast cancer treatment variables and relevant demographic and clinical variables. Results: Obese participants had significantly worse performance (β = −5.04, standard error (SE) = 2.53) and were almost three times more likely to be impaired (odds ratio (OR) = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.02–8.10) on the Information processing domain. The highest tertile of physical activity was significantly related to better performance on the executive functioning domain (β = 5.13, SE = 2.42) and attention domain (β = 4.26, SE = 2.07). The middle tertile of physical activity was significantly related to better performance (β = 9.00, SE = 3.09) and decreased odds of impairment (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.07–0.91) on the visual–spatial domain. More hours of sleep per night was significantly associated with better performance (β = 2.69, SE = 0.98) and decreased odds of impairment (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33–0.82) on the verbal functioning domain. Conclusions: These findings suggest that obesity, physical activity, and sleep are related to cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivors and have potential to be intervention targets to improve cognitive functioning.

N2  - To investigate the influence of menstrual cycle phase and the presence of severe premenstrual symptoms on cardiac autonomic control during sleep, we performed heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during stable non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep in 12 women with severe premenstrual syndrome and 14 controls in the mid-follicular, mid-luteal, and late-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Heart rate was higher, along with lower high frequency (HF) power, reflecting reduced vagal activity, and a higher ratio of low frequency (LF) to high frequency power, reflecting a shift to sympathetic dominance, in REM sleep compared with NREM sleep in both groups of women. Both groups of women had higher heart rate during NREM and REM sleep in the luteal phase recordings compared with the mid-follicular phase. HF power in REM sleep was lowest in the mid-luteal phase, when progesterone was highest, in both groups of women. The mid-luteal phase reduction in HF power was also evident in NREM sleep in control women but not in women with PMS, suggesting some impact of premenstrual syndrome on autonomic responses to the hormone environment of the mid-luteal phase. In addition, mid-luteal phase progesterone levels correlated positively with HF power and negatively with LF/HF ratio in control women in NREM sleep and with the LF/HF ratio during REM sleep in both groups of women. Our findings suggest the involvement of female reproductive steroids in cardiac autonomic control during sleep in women with and without premenstrual syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been found to reduce the impact of menopausal symptoms, hot flushes and night sweats. This study investigates the moderators and mediators of CBT for women who had problematic menopausal symptoms following breast cancer treatment. Study design: Analysis of 96 patients with breast cancer induced menopausal symptoms recruited to the MENOS1 trial; 47 were randomly assigned to Group CBT and 49 to usual care. Questionnaires were completed at baseline, 9 and 26 weeks post randomisation. Potential moderators and mediators, including sociodemographic, clinical and psychological factors, of the treatment effect on the primary outcome were examined. Main outcome measure: Hot Flush Problem Rating. Results: CBT was effective at reducing problem rating at 9 weeks regardless of age, BMI, time since breast cancer diagnosis, menopausal status at time of diagnosis, or type of cancer treatment (radiotherapy or chemotherapy or endocrine treatment). The treatment effect was significantly greater in women not receiving chemotherapy, those with higher levels of psychological distress at baseline and for non-white women. Beliefs about control/coping with hot flushes were the main mediators of improvement in problem rating following CBT. Beliefs about hot flushes in a social context, depressed mood and sleep problems were also identified as mediators. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CBT is widely applicable for breast cancer patients who are experiencing treatment related menopausal symptoms, and that CBT works mainly by changing beliefs and improving mood and sleep.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to characterize perceived consistent triggers of migraine with aura (MA). Method: Questionnaires specifically designed to characterize various trigger factors were sent to 181 participants identified in an earlier study. All participants had formerly identified at least one factor that often or always triggered an MA attack. They only answered questions regarding this or these factor(s). Results: The response rate to the questionnaire was 70% (126/179). A number of subtype triggers were mentioned by a high proportion of patients: too much work (under the stress category 54/64), reflected sunlight (under the light category 35/44), too little sleep (under the sleep category 19/24), red wine (under the alcohol category 20/22), passive smoking (under the smoke category 11/11), menstruation (under the menstruation or break from the pill category 12/14) and perfume (under the fumes/heavy scents category 12/15). Hormones, light and stress were reported to cause at least 50 % of MA attacks in 62%, 47% and 42% of participants, respectively. No participants reported alcohol to be the trigger of 50% or more of their attacks. In the groups of participants with "light", "fumes/heavy scents", "smoke" or "physical effort" as triggers, nearly all patients reported that an exposure time to the trigger of less than 3 hours (90–100% of patients) was necessary to trigger an attack and a latency to onset of attack of less than 3 hours (90–100% of patients). Conclusion: Our study has provided new knowledge about factors that in particular patients consistently trigger MA. In daily routine practice this information should be helpful in identifying factors to avoid. Patients with trigger factors that always or usually trigger attacks of MA will be highly useful for imaging and other experimental studies.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the temporal relationship of subjective sleep quality to menstrual cycle phase in a community (non help-seeking) sample of adult women over six months. Previous work has produced contradictory results and often used student samples. Participants/Methods: Patients/Methods: This was a cohort study, using daily electronic data collection in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada; 76 women aged 18–42 years recruited by random digit telephone dialing, recorded mood, sleep quality, and other health variables on a daily basis for 24 weeks. Results: Using linear mixed models, we assessed the relationship between subjective sleep quality and three menstrual cycle phases (menses, premenstrual and midcycle) over 395 cycles. Premenstrual sleep quality was poorer than during the rest of the cycle, with a mean difference of 1.32 between premenstrual and midcycle reference phase, on a 1–100 quality scale (higher score denotes poorer quality). This difference held when the independent variables of daily exercise and physical health were added to the model; it became non-significant when perceived stress and later, social support were also added to the model. Conclusions: Sleep quality in adult non-help seeking women is statistically poorer in the premenstruum but the size of the difference is of little clinical significance and was no longer statistically significant with inclusion of the potentially confounding variables, perceived stress and social support.

N2  - An integrated questionnaire was administered to a total of 4142 (2137 women, 2005 men; answer rate: 94.4%) university students and medical training schools students aged 18–40 years. The survey was carried out between May and October, 2004–2013. This questionnaire consisted of assessment of diurnal type, questions on sleep habits, mental health (upset emotionally, irritated, angered by small triggers, and suppressed), frequency of watching TV at night, use of mobile phone and playing TV games between 21:00 and 03:00 h, and questions on lighting conditions during the daytime and night. Sleep length in evening-type students (E-type; diurnal-type scores = 7–12) was shorter than in intermediate-types (I-type; diurnal-type scale (DTS) = 13–16) and morning-types (M-type; DTS = 17–28) on weekdays (p p p p p = 0.001). With regard to lighting conditions in the room in the afternoon, a slightly lower, but significantly so, percentage of the E-type students used the sunlight coming through the window than did the other types (p p p = 0.002). Lighting conditions throughout the 24 h and at breakfast can act as a strong zeitgeber for students and exert a great influence on their mental and physical health and can also affect PMS in women students.

N2  - Aim: Depressive disorders and symptoms are common among middle-aged women. The effects of hormones on depression remain unclear. This review aims to clarify the nature of depressive disorders during the menopause transition as well as their links with climacteric syndrome, sexuality, cardiovascular risk and cognitive function. Material and methods: The recent literature on depressive disorders and menopause is reviewed. Results and conclusions: Women are more vulnerable than men to depressive disorders. Endocrine influences have been postulated but differences in, for example, coping style and response to stress may also contribute to the gender difference in the prevalence of depressive disorders. Gender differences in socialization may lead to higher rates of depression in women. There are data top suggest that menopause and depression are associated, although there is not a common clear causative factor. Women with climacteric symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia) are more likely to report anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Bothersome vasomotor symptoms could be associated with sleep disturbances, which in turn can increase reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Biopsychosocial and partner factors have a significant influence on middle-aged women’s sexuality and depressive disorders, and most antidepressants can have a negative effect on sexual response. Lastly, studies have consistently shown that women with high levels of depressive symptoms are at greater cardiovascular risk and have poorer cognitive function than non-depressed women. At present, a direct relationship between psychiatric symptoms and hormonal changes such as estrogen decrease has not been clearly found. Stress, educational level, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and partner status may influence the prevalence and clinical course of both menopause symptoms and depressive disorders. Since in many cases depression is a lifelong condition, and is associated with severe comorbid conditions, further studies are needed to improve the early diagnosis of depression; it may be advisable to monitor a woman’s mental health during the menopause transition to prevent a depressive disorder having long-term negative consequences.

N2  - Background: Sleep and mood disturbances in women have often been linked to the menstrual cycle, implying an ovarian hormonal causation. However, most studies in this area have used self-reported menstrual cycle phase rather than direct measurement of ovarian hormone concentrations. Further, many studies have focused primarily on peri- and postmenopausal populations reporting clinical sleep difficulty. In this study, we examined the associations among sleep quality, mood, and ovarian hormone concentration in a random sample of community-dwelling, nonclinical women of reproductive age. Methods: Our sample consisted of 19 non-help-seeking women aged 18–43 years, each contributing an average of 39.5 nights of data. Over the 42 days of the study, we collected self-reported and actigraphic sleep-quality data, concentrations of urinary estrogen and progesterone metabolites (estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G) and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide [PdG], respectively), and daily mood ratings. Linear-mixed models were used to estimate associations, clustering longitudinal observations by the participant. Results: We found a significant positive association between Sleep Efficiency and E1G, and a significant negative association between Sleep Efficiency and PdG. Otherwise, the self-reported and actigraphic sleep measures were not associated with ovarian hormone concentrations. Self-reported sleep was strongly associated with mood, whereas actigraphic sleep was associated with only two of the 11 individual mood items, “Feeling on Top of Things” and “Difficulty Coping.” Conclusions: In this community sample of women of reproductive age, ovarian hormones play little, if any, role in day-to-day sleep quality. Our findings additionally highlight the different associations that self-reported and actigraphic sleep show with hormones and mood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are orchestrated by a master biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Circadian oscillations are a cellular property, with ‘clock’ genes and their protein products forming transcription-translation feedback loops that maintain 24-hour rhythmicity. Although the expression of clock genes is thought to be ubiquitous, the function of local, extra-SCN timing mechanisms remains elusive. We hypothesized that extra-SCN clock genes control local temporal sensitivity to upstream modulatory signals, allowing system-specific processes to be carried out during individual, optimal times of day. To test this possibility, we examined changes in the sensitivity of immortalized GnRH neurons, GT1–7 cells, to timed stimulation by two key neuropeptides thought to trigger ovulation on the afternoon of proestrus, kisspeptin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). We noted a prominent daily rhythm of clock gene expression in this cell line. GT1–7 cells also exhibited daily changes in cellular peptide expression and GnRH secretion in response to kisspeptin and VIP stimulation. These responses occurred without changes in GnRH transcription. These findings are consistent with the notion that GnRH cells are capable of intrinsic circadian cycles that may be fundamental for coordinating daily changes in sensitivity to signals impacting the reproductive axis.

N2  - Background: Menstrual cycle irregularity is common among adolescents and can induce mental health problems such as stress, depression, and suicidal ideation. We examined the association between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study was on 808 female adolescents (12–18 years of age) participating in the 2010–2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Psychological stress, depressive mood, suicidal ideations, suicide attempts, and psychological counseling were assessed through questionnaires and surveys, and hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The risk of menstrual cycle irregularity tended to increase, as the number of mental health problems increased (P for trend = 0.016). High stress levels, depressive mood, and psychological counseling were associated with increased risks of menstrual cycle irregularity (odd ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.88 [1.1–3.21], 2.01 [1.01–4.03], and 2.92 [1.16–7.34], respectively) even after adjusting for age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, hemoglobin level, monthly household income, weight loss attempts, age at menarche, and sleep duration. Suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. Limitations: Menstrual irregularity was evaluated based solely on subjects’ self-reports, which are subject to their subjective perceptions and appraisal. Cross-sectional design and retrospective data could not draw causal relationship. Conclusions: Positive associations were observed between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls. More attention should be paid towards mental health, to improve menstrual cycle regularity and help prevent related chronic diseases later in life.

N2  - Kristen is a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome (DS) who was seen urgently with concerns of cognitive and developmental regression including loss of language, social, and toileting skills. The evaluation in the DS clinic focused on potential medical diagnoses including atlantoaxial joint instability, vitamin deficiency, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and seizures. A comprehensive medical evaluation yielded only a finding of moderate OSA. A reactive depression was considered in association with several psychosocial factors including moving homes, entering puberty/onset of menses, and classroom change from an integrated setting to a self-contained classroom comprising unfamiliar peers with behavior challenges. Urgent referrals for psychological and psychiatric evaluations were initiated. Neuropsychological testing did not suggest true regression in cognitive, language, and academic skills, although decreases in motivation and performance were noted with a reaction to stress and multiple environmental changes as a potential causative factor. Psychiatry consultation supported this finding in that psychosocial stress temporally correlated with Kristen’s regression in skills. Working collaboratively, the team determined that Kristen’s presentation was consistent with a reactive form of depression (DSM-IV-TR: depressive disorder, not otherwise specified). Kristen’s presentation was exacerbated by salient environmental stress and sleep apnea, rather than a cognitive regression associated with a medical cause. Treatment consisted of an antidepressant medication, continuous positive airway pressure for OSA, and increased psychosocial supports. Her school initiated a change in classroom placement. With this multimodal approach to evaluation and intervention, Kristen steadily improved and she returned to her baseline function. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The relationship between depression and estrogen withdrawal remains controversial. The authors examined the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist-induced ovarian suppression on mood, sleep, sexual function, and nighttime hot flushes. They focused on whether participating women experienced clinically significant depressive symptoms and whether specific symptoms associated with hypogonadism (nighttime hot flushes and disturbed sleep) increased susceptibility to depression. Method: Participants were 72 healthy premenopausal women, ages 19–52 years, with no current or past axis I psychiatric diagnosis or gynecological or other medical illness. After 2 months of baseline screening, women received monthly injections of leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg) for 2–3 months. Outcomes were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and a daily rating scale measuring the severity of several affective and behavioral symptoms. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance using PROC MIXED (for mixed models). Results: BDI scores ≥10 were reported in four of the 72 women (5.6%). Relative to baseline, induced hypogonadism was associated with significantly decreased sexual interest, disturbed sleep, and more severe nighttime hot flushes, but no significant change in any mood-related symptom score. Hot flush severity was significantly correlated with disturbed sleep. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that clinically significant depressive symptoms were rare accompaniments of short-term estradiol withdrawal and induced hypogonadism in healthy premenopausal women. Additionally, neither nighttime hot flushes nor disturbed sleep were sufficient to cause depressive symptoms in hypogonadal women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Prior to the publication of findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002, estrogen-containing hormone therapy (HT) was used to prevent age-related disease, especially cardiovascular disease, and to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and sleep disruptions. Some observational studies of HT in midlife and aging women suggested that HT might also benefit cognitive function, but randomized clinical trials have produced mixed findings in terms of health and cognitive outcomes. This review focuses on hormone effects on cognition and risk for dementia in naturally menopausal women as well as surgically induced menopause, and highlights findings from the large-scale WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) which, contrary to expectation, showed increased dementia risk and poorer cognitive outcomes in older postmenopausal women randomized to HT versus placebo. We consider the ‘critical window hypothesis’, which suggests that a window of opportunity may exist shortly after menopause during which estrogen treatments are most effective. In addition, we highlight emerging evidence that potential adverse effects of HT on cognition are most pronounced in women who have other health risks, such as lower global cognition or diabetes. Lastly, we point towards implications for future research and clinical treatments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Chronotype describes preferences for functioning at different times of the day. At the onset of puberty, a sharp shift towards eveningness starts, reaching its peak at the end of adolescence, followed by a steady shift towards morningness as the ageing process occurs. Puberty is also the time when sex differences appear, with men being more inclined to eveningness than women, which diminishes around menopause; the described pattern of changes in chronotype leads to the hypothesis that reproductive hormones may be the driving factor behind this conversion. In the present study, we aimed to verify this hypothesis by analysing participants’ testosterone, progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels in the three months, as indicated by assays in 3-cm hair strands from the scalp. Participants (n = 239) of both sexes also completed the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. The results showed that in men higher testosterone levels were related to eveningness and less sleep loss, whereas greater sleep loss was associated with lower levels of DHEA. In women, no associations between chronotype and levels of the analysed hormones were found. The results support the hypothesis that testosterone levels play a role in shaping eveningness. We further hypothesised that a possible cause of the higher secretion level of testosterone in men with the evening chronotype is a mechanism to offset the negative consequences of sleep loss.

N2  - Objectives: There is a global trend of increasing numbers of older women in the workforce. However, limited information is available regarding the relationship between the menopause transition and work, especially in developing countries. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between experience of the menopause transition and work and to examine the factors affecting how women cope, including the extent to which women disclosed their menopausal status. Methods: Using a cross-sectional single group design, 131 middle-aged female medical teaching staff working in Zagazig Faculty of Medicine completed questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results: Participants, particularly those who were postmenopausal, reported high average scores on depressed mood, memory/concentration, sleep problems, vasomotor symptoms, and sexual behavior subscales of the Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Women reported that poor working environment and work policies and conditions, functioning as sources of work stress, aggravated their menopausal symptoms. Disclosure of their menopausal status was uncommon; limited time and socio-cultural barriers were the most commonly reported reasons for non-disclosure. Conclusion: It could be concluded that the menopause transition is an important occupational health issue especially for women in developing countries. Implementing health promotion programs, improving working environment and work policies, and raising awareness of menopause are recommended to help women to cope with the menopause transition and to maintain well-being and productivity at work.

N2  - Objective: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that was categorized as a mood disorder in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders. In addition to a history of PMS, a PMDD diagnosis requires prospective symptom assessment for 2 consecutive menstrual periods. Although the effects of some oxidants–antioxidants were previously studied in PMS, their possible effects in PMDD remain unknown. Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is a new high-density lipoprotein-associated enzyme with many antioxidative effects. We hypothesized that assessing serum total oxidant–antioxidant and PON-1 levels could clarify the role of oxidant–antioxidant system in PMDD. Methods: All participants (n = 50) were assessed by an experienced psychiatrist for PMDD by using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), Premenstrual Assessment Form and Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)-Short Form or possible psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Serum estrogen, progesterone, total oxidant–antioxidant, and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) levels were measured in the serum of 20 participants with PMDD and 30 asymptomatic controls during the follicular and luteal phases of two consecutive menstrual cycles. Sleep quality, depression, and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), respectively. Results: There were no significant intergroup differences in estrogen, progesterone, oxidant–antioxidant, or PON-1 levels or PSQI scores. However, the mean HDRS and HARS scores were statistically significantly higher for patients with PMDD than for controls. Levels of estrogen, progesterone, and total oxidant–antioxidant were not correlated with HDRS, HARS, or PSQI scores. Conclusions: Considering the lack of differences in hormonal and biochemical levels between the two groups, it may be more efficient and discriminative to longitudinally assess biochemical and cellular stress-related parameters in subjects with PMDD.

N2  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity. Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

N2  - Preterm infants have maturational delays in several neurobehavioral systems. This study assesses the impact of the Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the maturation of autonomic regulation of preterm infants. Preterm infants born at 26–34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) were assigned to groups receiving either standard care (SC) or SC plus FNI, using a randomized controlled trial design. At two collection time points, approximately 35 weeks and 41 weeks PMA, electrocardiograms (ECG) were monitored for approximately 1 hour during sleep. Heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were quantified from the ECG. Across the two time points, the FNI group exhibited greater increases in RSA (Cohen's d = 0.35) and slope between RSA and heart rate, as a measure of vagal efficiency (Cohen's d = 0.62). These results document that FNI resulted in enhanced autonomic regulation consistent with greater maturation of cardiac function. These and previous findings strongly suggest that facilitating early nurturing interactions and emotional connection between preterm infants and their mothers is a practicable and effective means of optimizing postnatal development in preterm infants. Interpretation of these autonomic function results also enriches our understanding of the potential long‐term beneficial outcomes of FNI by drawing upon polyvagal theory, which explains how autonomic state provides a neurophysiological platform for optimal co‐regulation between infant and caregiver, and by drawing upon calming cycle theory, which provides a model for understanding how repeated mother/infant calming interactions positively condition autonomic state and reinforce approach, prosocial behaviors.

N2  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy‐four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory‐II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger‐hostility, depression, tension‐anxiety, fatigue‐inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tension‐anxiety, and increased levels of anger‐hostility, fatigue‐inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbances are common during female mid-life. Nevertheless, there is limited available information linking sleep characteristics to the menopause and the metabolic syndrome (METS). Objective: To assess insomnia prevalence and related risk factors in postmenopausal women screened for the METS. Methods: In this cross sectional study 204 natural postmenopausal women participating in a METS screening program filled out the Athens insomnia scale (AIS), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and a general socio-demographic questionnaire. Criteria of the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) were used to define the METS. Results: Median age of the whole sample was 56 years. A 50.5% of women had the METS, 57.4% hot flushes, 58.3% were abdominally obese, 51.5% hypertension, 25.0% hyperglycemia, 15.7% depressed mood and 29.9% anxiety. A 33.8% presented insomnia according to the AIS (scores 6 or more). The AIS displayed a high internal consistency as computed Cronbach’s alpha was determined to be 0.86. Multiple linear regression analysis determined that male premature ejaculation, female psychotropic drug use, hot flush intensity, mood morbidity (higher total HADS scores) and higher parity positively and significantly correlated to higher AIS scores (more insomnia). Conclusion: In this postmenopausal sample insomnia was not related to the METS or its components yet to other psycho-somatic female and partner issues.

N2  - Background: Although sleep disturbances are common during female mid-life, few studies have described in detail the prevalence of this problem and related risk factors. Objective: To determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances in mid-aged women using validated tools. Assessment of determinants capable of influencing the prevalence of insomnia and poor sleep quality was also performed. Methods: A total of 6079 women aged 40–59 of 11 Latin American countries were invited to fill out the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), the Brief Scale of Abnormal Drinking and a general socio-demographic questionnaire. Results: Overall, 56.6% of surveyed women suffered of either insomnia, poor sleep quality, or both. Specifically, 43.6% and 46.2% presented insomnia and poor sleep quality in accordance to the AIS and the PSQI respectively. The prevalence of insomnia increased with female age (from 39.7% in those aged 40–44 to 45.2% in those aged 55–59, p p < 0.0001). “Awakening during the night” (AIS: Item 2) was the most highly rated of all items and contributing in a higher degree (mean 16%) to the total score of the scale in all menopausal phases. Sleep quality also worsened with age and menopausal status, impairment particularly affecting sleep efficiency and latency and the increased use of hypnotics. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), depressive mood and anxiety were associated to sleep disturbances. Women presenting sleep disturbances displayed a 2-fold increase in the severity of menopausal symptoms (higher total MRS scores) which was translated into a 6–8 times higher risk of impaired quality of life. Logistic regression analysis determined that female age, the presence of chronic disease, troublesome drinking, anxiety, depression, VMS, drug use (hypnotics and hormone therapy) were significant risk factors related to the presence of sleep disturbances. Higher educational level related to less insomnia and better sleep quality. Conclusion: Insomnia and poor sleep quality were highly prevalent in this mid-aged female sample in which the influence of age and the menopause was only modest and rather linked to menopausal symptoms already occurring since the premenopause.

N2  - Insomnia is considered a hyperarousal disorder, in which several psychophysiological domains including the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are over-activated, potentially contributing to increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease. Here, we aimed to determine whether insomnia that develops in the context of the transition to menopause (menopausal transition insomnia, MTI) is similarly characterized by autonomic arousal. We also took into account modulation of the ANS by the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle, a factor that has not previously been considered in studies on insomnia. Twenty one women with insomnia (49.0 ± 3y) and 25 controls (48.8 ± 2.6 y), also in the menopausal transition, had overnight laboratory-based polysomnographic recordings, including electrocardiograph, during the follicular and/or luteal (progesterone ≥3 ng ml−1) phases of the menstrual cycle, with 21 women having recordings in both phases. Nocturnal time and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) measures were calculated. Heart rate (HR) was significantly elevated (by ∼4 bpm) in MTI compared to controls in both follicular and luteal phases, across hours of the night, including during undisturbed periods of NREM and REM sleep (p < 0.05). A higher HR tended to be associated with lower frequency- and time-domain vagal HRV indices in MTI compared with controls. In both groups, HR was significantly higher and total and high frequency HRV measures were lower in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase (p < 0.05). In addition, REM compared to NREM sleep was characterized by increased HR coupled with decreased vagal modulation and increased sympathovagal balance (p < 0.01). Insomnia in the menopausal transition is characterized by nocturnal autonomic hyperarousal during both follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, which could be a factor in the etiology of MTI as well as a potential CV risk factor.

N2  - The aims of this study were to: (i) assess gender differences of objective sleep patterns in a general population sample; (ii) evaluate the effects of menopause and hormone treatment (HT) on the sleep of the same cohort; and (iii) examine gender differences in sleep resilience towards external stressors. The participants were (i) 1324 subjects without sleep complaints, recruited from the general population of Central Pennsylvania that spent one night in the sleep laboratory and (ii) 66 young, healthy volunteers whose sleep was disturbed during night four by an external stressor, i.e. 24-h blood drawing (average of nights 2 and 3 versus night 4). Women compared with men in the general population sample had significantly higher percentage of sleep time, lower percentage of stage 1, and higher percentage of slow wave sleep. Also, menopause, in the absence of HT, was associated with prolonged sleep latency and decreased deep sleep. Finally, young, healthy women compared with men experienced less sleep disturbance because of blood draws as indicated by a significantly smaller change in per cent sleep time, and percentage of stage 1 sleep. These findings suggest that women without sleep complaints sleep objectively better across age than men and the sleep of young women is more resistant to external stressors. Also, gonadal hormones exert a beneficial effect on women's sleep. This gender dimorphism in sleep regulation may have been to protect women from the demands of infant and child care, and in part, might contribute to women's lower cardiovascular risks and greater longevity.

N2  - Study Objectives: Inflammation and pro-coagulation biomarkers may be a link between sleep characteristics and risk for cardiometabolic disorders. We tested the hypothesis that worse sleep characteristics would be associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, factor Vllc, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 in a multi-ethnic subsample of mid-life women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health across the Nation. Design: Cross-sectional. Measurements and Results: African American, Chinese, and Caucasian women (N = 340) participated in 3 days of in-home polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring and had measures of inflammation and coagulation. Regression analyses revealed that each of the biomarkers were associated with indicators of sleep disordered breathing after adjusting for age, duration between sleep study and blood draw, site, menopausal status, ethnicity, residualized body mass index, smoking status, and medications that affect sleep or biomarkers. Among African American women, those who had higher levels of CRP had shorter PSG-sleep duration and those who had higher levels of fibrinogen had less efficient sleep in multivariate models. Conclusions: These results suggest that inflammation and pro-coagulation processes may be an important pathway connecting sleep disordered breathing and cardiometabolic disorders in women of these ethnic groups and that inflammation may be a particularly important pathway in African Americans.

N2  - Study Objectives: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological disorder that disrupts daytime functioning and nighttime sleep quality. We determined the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium, compared to placebo, in alleviating nighttime pain and restoring sleep architecture in women with primary dysmenorrhea. Design: Randomized, double-blind, crossover study Setting: Sleep laboratory Participants: Ten healthy women (21 ± 1 years) with a history of primary dysmenorrhea. Interventions: Placebo or diclofenac potassium (150 mg per day) for menstrual pain. Measurements and results: We assessed objective measures of sleep (polysomnography) and subjective measures of sleep quality, mood, and intensity of menstrual pain. Compared to a pain-free phase of the menstrual cycle (mid-follicular), women receiving placebo for their menstrual pain had a poorer mood (P < 0.01), decreased sleep efficiency (P < 0.05), less REM sleep (P < 0.05), more stage 1 sleep (P < 0.01), and more sleep stage changes per hour of sleep during the night. Administration of diclofenac potassium compared to placebo not only attenuated the women's menstrual pain (P < 0.05), but also increased sleep efficiency (P < 0.05) and percentage of REM sleep (P < 0.01), decreased percentage of stage 1 sleep (P < 0.05) and number of sleep stage changes per hour of sleep (P < 0.05), and improved subjective ratings of sleep quality and morning vigilance (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Diclofenac potassium effectively attenuates nighttime dysmenorrheic pain and restores subjective and objective measures of sleep quality to values recorded in a pain-free phase of the menstrual cycle.

N2  - Objective: To assess sleep disturbance and related factors among mid-aged women. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which 288 women (40–59 years) were requested to complete the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and a general socio-demographic questionnaire containing female and partner data. Results: Median [interquartile range] age of the whole sample was 47 [8] years. A 62.2% of women were rural residents, 21.2% were postmenopausal, 20.1% were receiving psychotropic drugs, 64.2% had abdominal obesity (waist≥88cm), and 9.7% reported intimate violence. A 12.8% had an abnormal GHQ-12 score (total score≥3) whereas 14.2% had severe menopause-related symptoms (total MRS score≥17). The prevalence of disturbed sleep (JSS score≥12) was 37.5%. JSS scores displayed significant differences in relation to menopausal status, presence of stress urinary incontinence, use of psychiatric treatment, intimate partner violence, self-perception of healthiness, and partner factors (perception of healthiness, educational level, and regular exercise). Higher JSS scores (disturbed sleep) positively correlated with GHQ-12 and MRS scores, number of co-morbid conditions, body mass index, and female and partner age. Multiple linear regression analysis found that JSS scores correlated positively with somatic MRS scores and with intimate violence, and inversely with partner educational level (r 2 =0.375, p <0.05). Conclusion: In this mid-aged female sample, disturbed sleep was related to somatic menopause-related symptoms, intimate violence and partner educational level.

N2  - Periodic ovulation in rats, mice and hamsters is the result of a surge in luteinising hormone (LH) that depends on circadian gating signals emerging from the master circadian clock within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and rising ovarian oestrogen levels. These two signals converge into the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and lead to the release of kisspeptin, which is responsible for surges of gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone and, in turn, of LH release. How the AVPV integrates circadian and reproductive signals remains unclear. In the present study, we show that the female rat AVPV itself shows circadian oscillations in the expression of the clock genes PER1 and BMAL1, which lie at the core circadian clockwork of mammals. In ovariectomised females treated with oestradiol (E₂), these oscillations are in synchrony with the AVPV rhythmic expression of the KISS1 gene and the gene that codes for the arginine‐vasopressin (AVP) receptor AVPr1a. Although clock gene oscillations are independent of oestrogen levels, circadian expression of Kiss1 and Avpr1a (also referred to as V1a) mRNA is blunted and absent, respectively, in ovariectomised animals without E₂ replacement. Because AVP is considered to be a critical SCN transmitter to gate the LH surge, our data suggest that there is a circadian oscillator located in the AVPV, and that such a putative oscillator could, in an oestrogen‐dependent manner, time the sensitivity to circadian signals emerging from the SCN and the release of kisspeptin.

N2  - Objective: To describe which dietary nutrient variables are related to subjective and objective habitual sleep and subjective and objective napping. Methods: Participants were 459 post-menopausal women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative. Objective sleep was estimated using one week of actigraphy. Subjective sleep was prospectively estimated with a daily sleep diary. Dietary nutrients were calculated from food frequency questionnaires. Results: The most significant correlations were with subjective napping, including (from strongest to weakest): total fat, calories, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, trans fat, water, proline, serine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, valine, cholesterol, leucine, glutamic acid, ash, isoleucine, histidine, sodium, tryptophan, protein, threonine, cystine, methionine, phosphorous, polyunsaturated fat, animal protein, aspartic acid, arginine, lysine, alanine, caffeine, riboflavin, gamma-tocopherol, glycine, retinol, delta-tocopherol, Vitamin D, and selenium. Actigraphic nocturnal sleep duration was negatively associated with total fat, monounsaturated fat, trans fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, calories, gamma-tocopherol, cholesterol, and alpha-tocopherol-eq. Conclusions: Actigraphic total sleep time was negatively associated with intake of fats. Subjective napping, which may be a proxy for subjective sleepiness, was significantly related to fat intake as well as intake of meat. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The menopausal transition is frequently accompanied by adverse physical and emotional changes that can significantly impact a woman’s quality of life. Hormone replacement therapy has been the most commonly used menopause-related treatment to date, particularly for the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms; recent studies, however, have questioned its long-term safety for some women. We aimed to develop a cognitive–behavioral group treatment (CBGT) program as an alternative or complementary treatment option for reducing the frequency and intensity of debilitating menopausal symptoms in midlife women. Eight subjects participated in two, 10-week pilot groups (n = 4 participants per group) with participants being drawn from referrals through the Women’s Health Concerns Clinic and community advertising efforts. This pilot study confirmed a reduction in the frequency and interference associated with vasomotor symptoms, less depression and general anxiety, and an overall improvement in quality of life. Participants also reported high levels of satisfaction with this type of treatment for menopausal symptoms. Furthermore, there was a trend towards a reduction in sleep difficulties and sexual concerns over the course of treatment. This pilot CBGT program appears to be a promising alternative or complementary treatment for both the physical and emotional symptoms experienced during menopause. Further studies are needed on its efficacy through larger, controlled trials. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Age-related changes in sleep and circadian regulation occur as early as the middle years of life. Research also suggests that sleep and circadian rhythms are regulated differently between women and men. However, does sleep and circadian rhythms regulation age similarly in men and women? In this review, we present the mechanisms underlying age-related differences in sleep and the current state of knowledge on how they interact with sex. We also address how testosterone, estrogens, and progesterone fluctuations across adulthood interact with sleep and circadian regulation. Finally, we will propose research avenues to unravel the mechanisms underlying sex differences in age-related effects on sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study examined the relationship between dysmenorrhea and insomnia, as well as variability in sleep across the menstrual cycle. Participants were 89 women, ages 18 to 24 (M = 18.63, SD = 0.93), who completed daily surveys for five weeks. On the second day of menses, they completed a questionnaire regarding dysmenorrhea. Participants having insomnia rated their dysmenorrhea as being more severe and causing more interference with daily activities than did participants without insomnia. Insomnia severity was directly associated with dysmenorrhea severity and interference. Sleep onset latency was longer and sleep efficiency was lower in participants with severe dysmenorrhea than in those with mild dysmenorrhea. Further, participants with mild dysmenorrhea reported significantly better sleep quality than did those having moderate or severe dysmenorrhea. Additionally, wake time after sleep onset was shortest and number of awakenings was lowest around the time of ovulation. Future research should examine whether treating dysmenorrhea or insomnia alone results in improvements in the other condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between Morningness/Eveningness (M/E; a measure of sleep–wake preference) and alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use as well as the interaction of M/E and pubertal timing. The data represent baseline measures from a longitudinal study examining the association of psychological functioning and smoking with reproductive and bone health in 262 adolescent girls (11–17years). The primary measures used for this study were pubertal timing (measured by age at menarche), the Morningness/Eveningness scale, and substance use (alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana). Multiple group path modeling showed that there was a significant interaction between pubertal timing and M/E on cigarette use. The direction of the parameter estimates indicated that for the early and on-time groups, Evening preference was associated with more cigarette use. For the late timing group the association was not significant. The results point to the need to consider sleep preference as a characteristic that may increase risk for substance use in adolescents.

N2  - The purpose of this double-blind study was to assess the effects of nightly melatonin supplementation on bone health and quality of life in perimenopausal women. A total of 18 women (ages 45–54) were randomized to receive melatonin (3 mg, p.o., n = 13) or placebo (n = 5) nightly for 6 months. Bone density was measured by calcaneal ultrasound. Bone turnover marker (osteocalcin, OC for bone formation and NTX for bone resorption) levels were measured bimonthly in serum. Participants completed Menopause-Specific Quality of Life-Intervention (MENQOL) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires before and after treatment. Subjects also kept daily diaries recording menstrual cycling, wellbeing, and sleep patterns. The results from this study showed no significant change (6-month-baseline) in bone density, NTX, or OC between groups; however, the ratio of NTX:OC trended downward over time toward a ratio of 1:1 in the melatonin group. Melatonin had no effect on vasomotor, psychosocial, or sexual MENQOL domain scores; however, it did improve physical domain scores compared to placebo (mean change melatonin: )0.6 versus placebo: 0.1, P P P < 0.05). No differences in duration of menses occurred between groups. The overall PSQI score and average number of hours slept were similar between groups. These findings show that melatonin supplementation was well tolerated, improved physical symptoms associated with perimenopause, and may restore imbalances in bone remodeling to prevent bone loss. Further investigation is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Testosterone (T) is lower among fathers and men in committed relationships, suggesting that the hormone mediates the trade-off between mating and parenting effort. The function of T in women and responses of the hormone to relationships or motherhood are less well understood. Here we report relationships between T and pairbonding and motherhood in a random sample of 67 women (20.9 to 22.4 years old) participating in a population-based birth cohort study in the Philippines. Testosterone was measured in saliva collected at bedtime and at waking the following morning to capture circadian dynamics. Compared to non-mothers and non-pairbonded women, mothers and pairbonded women had 32% (p <0.0001) and 23% (p <0.004) lower waking T, respectively, but similar evening T. The lower waking T in mothers largely reflected reduced T in mothers of young offspring (<2 years), with mothers of older offspring (2+ years) having intermediate T. These differences were independent of measures of breastfeeding, contraceptive pill use, menstrual cycle, sleep quality, education, employment, and socioeconomic status. Our findings highlight a similar relationship between parenting and committed relationships and T in women as documented in men and suggest that caregiving of dependent young may modulate female T. Future research should clarify whether this cross-sectional association reflects a suppressive effect of motherhood on T, whether these relationships vary across cultures, and the role of T within the endocrine architecture regulating female reproductive and caregiving strategies.

N2  - Background: Many breast cancer survivors experience fatigue, mood, and sleep disturbances. Purpose: This study aims to compare a meditative movement practice, Qigong/Tai Chi Easy (QG/TCE) with sham Qigong (SQG), testing effects of meditation/breath aspects of QG/TCE on breast cancer survivors’ persistent fatigue and other symptoms. Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial tested 12 weeks of QG/TCE versus SQG on fatigue, depression, and sleep among 87 postmenopausal, fatigued breast cancer survivors, stages 0–III, age 40–75. Results: Fatigue decreased significantly in the QG/TCE group compared to control at post-intervention (p = 0.005) and 3 months follow-up (p = 0.024), but not depression and sleep quality. Improvement occurred over time for both interventions in depression and sleep quality (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: QG/TCE showed significant improvement over time compared to SQG for fatigue, but not depression or sleep. Both QG/TCE and SQG showed improvement for two prevalent symptoms among breast cancer survivors, depression and sleep dysfunction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study quantifies sex differences in the diurnal and circadian variation of sleep and waking while controlling for menstrual cycle phase and hormonal contraceptive use. We compared the diurnal and circadian variation of sleep and alertness of 8 women studied during two phases of the menstrual cycle and 3 women studied during their midfollicular phase with that of 15 men. Participants underwent an ultradian sleep–wake cycle (USW) procedure consisting of 36 cycles of 60-min wake episodes alternating with 60-min nap opportunities. Core body temperature (CBT), salivary melatonin, subjective alertness, and polysomnographically recorded sleep were measured throughout this procedure. All analyzed measures showed a significant diurnal and circadian variation throughout the USW procedure. Compared with men, women demonstrated a significant phase advance of the CBT but not melatonin rhythms, as well as an advance in the diurnal and circadian variation of sleep measures and subjective alertness. Furthermore, women experienced an increased amplitude of the diurnal and circadian variation of alertness, mainly due to a larger decline in the nocturnal nadir. Our results indicate that women are likely initiating sleep at a later circadian phase than men, which may be one factor contributing to the increased susceptibility to sleep disturbances reported in women. Lower nighttime alertness is also observed, suggesting a physiological basis for a greater susceptibility to maladaptation to night shift work in women.

N2  - Kleine-Levin syndrome and menstrual-related hypersomnia are rare idiopathic sleep disorders occurring primarily in adolescence. They are characterized by intermittent periods of excessive sleepiness, cognitive disturbances, and behavioral abnormalities. In both, the etiology remains unknown but autoinmune, hormonal, infectious, and inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed. The authors describe, for the first time, the association of Kleine-Levin syndrome and menstrual-related hypersomnia in 2 adolescent siblings who shared the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci DQB1*0501. The same haplotype has been associated with sleepwalking and with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. This gender differences in the manifestation of a probably genetic influenced sleep disorder suggests that hormonal mechanisms could be implicated in the phenotypical expression of this sleep disorder. The male sibling with Kleine-Levin syndrome was easily controlled with carbamazepine in low doses, but his sister could be only efficaciously treated with oral contraceptives.

N2  - Aim: This paper is a report of a study of the factors that influence sleep quality and quality of life among shift-working nurses and the relationship between their sleep quality and quality of life. Background: Although shift-working nurses strive to adapt their life schedules to shift rotations, they tend to suffer from severe sleep disturbances and increased rates of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, digestive disease and irregular menstrual cycles. Poor sleep is also associated with medical errors and occupational injuries. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 with a convenience sample of 435 female nurses from five regional hospitals in Taiwan. Data were collected on sleep quality and quality of life using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-BREF Taiwan version respectively. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, analysis of variance and Pearson correlations. Findings: The majority of female shift workers (57%) had global sleep-quality scores ≥5, indicating poor sleep and all mean scores in four domains of the quality-of-life measure were statistically significantly lower than those of females in Taiwan's general population. Scores for poor sleep quality and quality of life were related to premenstrual dysphoria, occupational injury, illness and medication use. In addition, the associations between scores on the sleep-quality and quality-of-life scales were statistically significantly inversely correlated. Conclusion: Advice should be included in both undergraduate programmes and continuing education to help nurses to recognize and improve their own sleep quality and life quality managers should create a supportive environment to encourage shift-working nurses to engage in healthy behaviours.

N2  - Study Objectives: Menopausal transition is associated with increased dissatisfaction with sleep, but the effects on sleep architecture are conflicting. This prospective 6-year follow-up study was designed to evaluate the changes in sleep stages and sleep continuity that occur in women during menopausal transition. Methods: Sixty women (mean age 46.0 years, SD 0.9) participated. All women were premenopausal at baseline, and at the 6-year follow-up, women were in different stages of menopausal transition. Polysomnography was used to study sleep architecture at baseline and follow-up. The effects of aging and menopause (assessed as change in serum follicle-stimulating hormone [S-FSH]) on sleep architecture were evaluated using linear regression models. Results: After controlling for body mass index, vasomotor, and depressive symptoms, aging of 6 years resulted in shorter total sleep time (B −37.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] −71.5 to (−3.3)), lower sleep efficiency (B −6.5, 95%CI −12.7 to (−0.2)), as well as in increased transitions from slow-wave sleep (SWS) to wakefulness (B 1.0, 95%CI 0.1 to 1.9), wake after sleep onset (B 37.7, 95%CI 12.5 to 63.0), awakenings per hour (B 1.8, 95%CI 0.8 to 2.8), and arousal index (B 2.3, 95%CI 0.1 to 4.4). Higher S-FSH concentration in menopausal transition was associated with increased SWS (B 0.09, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.16) after controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions: A significant deterioration in sleep continuity occurs when women age from 46 to 52 years, but change from premenopausal to menopausal state restores some SWS.

N2  - Study Objectives: Women report increasing sleep difficulties during menopause, but polysomnographic measures do not detect sleep disturbances. We examined whether two spectral analysis sleep measures, delta and beta power, were related to menopausal status. Design: The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Sleep Study compared cross-sectionally spectral sleep measures in women in different stages of menopause. Setting: Sleep EEG was recorded in the participants’ homes with ambulatory recorders. Participants: A multi-ethnic cohort of premenopausal and early perimenopausal (n = 189), late perimenopausal (n = 73), and postmenopausal (n = 59) women. Measurements: EEG power in the delta and beta frequency bands was calculated for all night NREM and all night REM sleep. Physical, medical, psychological, and socioeconomic data were collected from questionnaires and diaries. Results: Beta EEG power in NREM and REM sleep in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exceeded that in pre- and early perimenopausal women. Neither all night delta power nor the trend in delta power across the night differed by menopausal status. In a multivariate model that controlled for the physical, demographic, behavioral, psychological, and health-related changes that accompany menopause, beta power in both NREM and REM sleep EEG was significantly related to menopausal status. The frequency of hot flashes explained part but not all of the relation of beta power to menopausal status. Conclusions: Elevated beta EEG power in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women provides an objective measure of disturbed sleep quality in these women. Elevated beta EEG activity suggests that arousal level during sleep is higher in these women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: Kangaroo care (KC) and maternal singing benefit preterm infants, and we investigated whether combining these benefitted infants and mothers. Methods: A prospective randomised, within‐subject, crossover, repeated‐measures study design was used, with participants acting as their own controls. We evaluated the heart rate variability (HRV) of stable preterm infants receiving KC, with and without maternal singing. This included low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and the LF/HF ratio during baseline (10 min), singing or quiet phases (20 min) and recovery (10 min). Physiological parameters, maternal anxiety and the infants’ behavioural state were measured. Results: We included 86 stable preterm infants, with a postmenstrual age of 32–36 weeks. A significant change in LF and HF, and lower LF/HF ratio, was observed during KC with maternal singing during the intervention and recovery phases, compared with just KC and baseline (all p‐values < 0.05). Maternal anxiety was lower during singing than just KC (p = 0.04). No differences in the infants’ behavioural states or physiological parameters were found, with or without singing. Conclusion: Maternal singing during KC reduces maternal anxiety and leads to autonomic stability in stable preterm infants. This effect is not detected in behavioural state or physiological parameters commonly used to monitor preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Concussion literature and treatment guidelines are inconclusive regarding the role of sex in symptom reporting at baseline and post-concussion. Although empirical evidence is lacking, it is generally regarded that females have a more severe symptomatic presentation than males at all time-points on the concussion spectrum. Objectives: Our objective was to determine whether differences exist between males and females at baseline (pre-season/before concussion) or post-concussion for self-reported (1) prevalence of individual symptoms and (2) total symptom scores in high school and college athletes. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies; level of evidence, 1. Methods: A computerized search of the PubMed, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Scopus databases was performed. Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed. Criteria for inclusion were (1) self-report of symptoms at any time within the concussion spectrum, including baseline and after concussion, (2) study sample included high school and/or collegiate athletes aged 12–26 years, (3) concussions occurred during participation in sport, and (4) symptom reporting was separated by sex. The Quality Assessment Tool for Cohort Studies, Q-Coh, was utilized for quality assessment. Results: Twenty-one studies met the criteria for inclusion: seventeen had good quality and four, acceptable quality. At baseline, females had significantly higher odds than males of reporting the individual symptoms of vision/hearing problems, headache/migraine, difficulty concentrating, energy/sleep disturbances, and emotional disturbances. Post-concussion, only one symptom demonstrated significant differences between males and females, with females demonstrating lower odds of reporting confusion than males. Statistically, at baseline and post-concussion, females had significantly higher total symptom scores on the Post-Concussion Scale (PCS) and the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2), but when the standard mean difference was interpreted after back-transformation, these results were clinically insignificant. Conclusions: The symptomatic presentation of males and females, most notably the prevalence of specific symptoms, is very divergent. Females had higher total symptom scores at baseline and post-concussion, however, clinically this cannot be interpreted as a meaningful difference. It is possible that these differences can be explained by normal hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle. The implications of these findings are that symptomatic presentation during an individual female’s menstrual cycle needs to be taken into consideration post-concussion when making return-to-play decisions, as returning to a completely asymptomatic level may not be a reasonable expectation.

N2  - A marital status of divorced or separated, as opposed to married, predicts increased risk of health problems, but not for all persons. Focusing on one established health risk that has been linked with divorce—poor subjective sleep quality—the present cross-sectional study examined whether a history of physical intimate partner victimization (IPV) helps identify divorced women at potentially greater risk of health problems. Community midlife women with divorce histories, all of whom were free of current IPV, reported on their past month sleep quality and lifetime IPV. The predicted odds of poor sleep quality were significantly greater for women with, versus without, IPV histories. This held after adjusting for socioemotional, medical, or sociodemographic risks. A dose–response relationship between IPV chronicity and poor quality sleep was observed. IPV history may help identify divorced women at increased risk of poor quality sleep and, more broadly, poor health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: To examine the differences in depressive symptoms and anxiety between (a) normal weight and overweight, and (b) morning type and evening type (sleep chronotype) adolescent girls. The interaction of sleep chronotype and weight and depressive symptoms and anxiety were also examined. Method: The design consisted of a cross-sectional study of 264 adolescent females (mean age = 14.9 ± 2.2, range 11–17 years). Sleep chronotype, depressive symptoms, and anxiety were obtained by self-report questionnaire. The mean of three measurements of height and weight was used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). BMI was plotted on the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts to obtain percentile ranking. Participants were categorized into two groups according to BMI percentile: normal weight (p p < .05). Evening chronotype was associated with more depressive symptoms in both normal-weight and overweight females. However, the association was stronger in overweight females. Conclusions: Individually, sleep and weight impact physical and mental health during adolescence. The combination of evening chronotype and overweight appears to have the strongest association on the emotional health of adolescent females. Further investigations are needed to provide potential biological mechanisms for this relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: Insomnia is a leading cause of disability in postmenopausal women. Multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is a firstline treatment for chronic insomnia, but support for its efficacy in treating menopause-related insomnia is scarce. The present study evaluated whether CBTI is an efficacious treatment for menopause-related chronic insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)—a single component of CBTI—is equally efficacious compared with CBTI. Methods: In a single-site, randomized controlled trial, 150 postmenopausal women (56.44 ± 5.64 years) with chronic DSM-5 insomnia disorder related to menopause were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education (SHE), SRT, or CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep diaries served as primary outcomes. Results: From baseline to posttreatment, ISI decreased 7.70 points in the CBTI group (p p p = .01). Although average sleep duration increased in all groups by 6 month follow-up, CBTI patients obtained 40–43 more minutes of nightly sleep than those who received SHE or SRT. Remission rates in the CBTI (54%–84%) and SRT (38%–57%) groups were higher than SHE patients (4%–33%) at posttreatment and 6 month follow-up. CBTI patients were generally more likely to remit than SRT patients. Conclusions: CBTI and SRT effectively treat menopause-related insomnia disorder and are superior to SHE. Response to CBTI and SRT is similar, but CBTI outperforms SRT in improving sleep maintenance, which may increase likelihood of remission. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Bright-light therapy (BLT) is established as the treatment of choice for seasonal affective disorder/winter type (SAD). In the last two decades, the use of BLT has expanded beyond SAD: there is evidence for efficacy in chronic depression, antepartum depression, premenstrual depression, bipolar depression and disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle. Data on the usefulness of BLT in non-seasonal depression are promising; however, further systematic studies are still warranted. In this review, the authors present a comprehensive overview of the literature on BLT in mood disorders. The first part elucidates the neurobiology of circadian and seasonal adaptive mechanisms focusing on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the indolamines melatonin and serotonin, and the chronobiology of mood disorders. The SCN is the primary oscillator in humans. Indolamines are known to transduce light signals into cells and organisms since early in evolution, and their role in signalling change of season is still preserved in humans: melatonin is synthesized primarily in the pineal gland and is the central hormone for internal clock circuitries. The melatonin precursor serotonin is known to modulate many behaviours that vary with season. The second part discusses the pathophysiology and clinical specifiers of SAD, which can be seen as a model disorder for chronobiological disturbances and the mechanism of action of BLT. In the third part, the mode of action, application, efficacy, tolerability and safety of BLT in SAD and other mood disorders are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: Research suggests that sleep disturbances are associated with elevated levels of inflammation. Some evidence indicates that women may be particularly vulnerable; increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers with sleep disturbances are primarily observed among women. Midlife, which encompasses the menopause transition, is typically reported as a time of poor sleep. We tested whether poorer objectively measured sleep characteristics were related to a poorer inflammatory profile in midlife women. Methods: Two hundred ninety-five peri- and postmenopausal women aged 40–60 completed 3 days of wrist actigraphy, physiologic hot flash monitoring, questionnaires (e.g. Berlin sleep apnea risk questionnaire], and a blood draw for the assessment of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen. Associations of objective (actigraphy) sleep with inflammatory markers were tested in regression models. Sleep efficiency was inverse log transformed. Covariates included age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, sleep apnea risk, homeostatic model assessment (a measure of insulin resistance), systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and physical activity. Results: In separate models controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and education, lower sleep efficiency was associated with higher IL-6 [b(SE) = .02 (.10), p = .003] and VWF [b(SE) = .02 (.08), p = .002]. More minutes awake after sleep onset was associated with higher VWF [b(SE) = .12 (.06), p = .01]. Findings persisted in multivariable models. Conclusions: Lower sleep efficiency and more minutes awake after sleep onset were independently associated with higher circulating levels of VWF. Lower sleep efficiency was associated with higher circulating levels of IL-6. These findings suggest that sleep disturbances are associated with greater circulating inflammation in midlife women.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), using current clinical and epidemiological techniques, among the adult population of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This population-based survey used a probabilistic three-stage cluster sample of Sao Paulo inhabitants to represent the population according to gender, age (20–80 years), and socio-economic status. Face-to-face interviews and in-lab full-night polysomnographies using a nasal cannula were performed. The prevalence of OSAS was determined according to the criteria of the most recent International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICDS-2) from American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2005). Results: A total of 1042 volunteers underwent polysomnography (refusal rate = 5.4%). The mean age ± SD was 42 ± 14 years; 55% were women and 60% had a body mass index > 25 kg/m². OSAS was observed in 32.8% of the participants (95% CI, 29.6–36.3). A multivariate logistic regression model identified several independent and strong associations for the presence of OSAS: men had greater association than women (OR = 4.1; 95% CI, 2.9–5.8; P P P P < 0.001), and it was more frequent in the lowest class (43.1%) than either middle class (26.1%) or upper class (27.8%) women. Conclusions: This study is the first apnea survey of a large metropolitan area in South America identifying a higher prevalence of OSAS than found in other epidemiological studies. This can be explained by the use of the probabilistic sampling process achieving a very low polysomnography refusal rate, the use of current techniques and clinical criteria, inclusion of older groups, and the higher prevalence of obesity in the studied population.

N2  - Background: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in patients with breast cancer and studies show a higher frequency than in the general population but it appears to be understudied and the treatment seems to be a neglected problem. There is a growing body of evidence about the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in breast cancer survivors (BCS). The aim of this review is to examine the best available scientific evidence related to CBT-I and insomnia in patients with breast cancer and to assess the effect of CBT-I on their psychosocial functioning, sleep, quality of life, and mood. Methods: Empirical articles published in peer-reviewed journals from the earliest reports available until August 2015 were considered. The research on PubMed generated 18 papers, three of which did not meet the inclusion criteria. Another paper was retrieved by screening the reference list of the previously selected papers. Results: A total of 16 studies were found that evaluated the effects of CBT-I in breast cancer patients. CBT-I appears to be an effective therapy for insomnia in BCS, improving mood, general and physical fatigue, and global and cognitive dimensions of quality of life. CBT-I may also reduce menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweat problems, frequency of medicated nights, level of depression, and anxiety. Conclusions: CBT-I seems to be an eligible intervention for improving sleep in BCS. Improvements concerning insomnia and sleep quality are durable (usually up to 12 months) and statistically significant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, a time when women are likely to be in the paid workforce. Most women have menopausal symptoms and these may impact on daytime function and work performance. This study examines the relationship between reproductive stage, menopausal symptoms and work, and advises how employers can best support menopausal women. Methods: An online and paper-based survey was completed in 2015–16 by 1092 women (22% response rate) aged 40 years plus employed in three hospitals in metropolitan Australia. Survey questions examined demographics, health and lifestyle variables, menopausal symptom reporting, and work-related variables. Reproductive stage was determined using modified STRAW +10 principal and descriptive criteria. Results: Reproductive stage was not significantly associated with work engagement, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, work limitations and perceived supervisor support. Postmenopausal women had lower intention to leave their organizations than pre- and peri-menopausal women. While sleep problems were the most commonly reported menopausal symptom by peri-menopausal women, for postmenopausal women it was joint and muscular discomfort. Only hot flushes and vaginal dryness were significantly more frequent in peri- and post, compared to pre-menopausal women. In general, women rated their work performance as high and did not feel that menopausal symptoms impaired their work ability. Most women would appreciate greater organizational support, specifically temperature control, flexible work hours and information about menopause for employees and managers. Discussion: Most women did not believe that menopausal symptoms negatively impacted on their work. Organizational changes may reduce the burden of menopausal symptoms in the workplace (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Telomere length, a reliable predictor of disease pathogenesis, can be affected by genetics, chronic stress and health behaviors. Cross-sectionally, highly stressed postmenopausal women have shorter telomeres, but only if they are inactive. However, no studies have prospectively examined telomere length change over a short period, and if rate of attrition is affected by naturalistic factors such as stress and engagement in healthy behaviors, including diet, exercise, and sleep. Here we followed healthy women over 1 year to test if major stressors that occurred over the year predicted telomere shortening, and whether engaging in healthy behaviors during this period mitigates this effect. In 239 postmenopausal, non-smoking, disease-free women, accumulation of major life stressors across a 1-year period predicted telomere attrition over the same period—for every major life stressor that occurred during the year, there was a significantly greater decline in telomere length over the year of 35 bp (Pinteraction B = 0.19, P = 0.04). Women who maintained relatively higher levels of health behaviors (1 s.d. above the mean) appeared to be protected when exposed to stress. This finding has implications for understanding malleability of telomere length, as well as expectations for possible intervention effects. This is the first study to identify predictors of telomere length change over the short period of a year. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26–34weeks gestation). Methods: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at ∼35 and ∼40weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands between 1 and 48Hz in each of 125 electrodes. Results: Near to term age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48Hz (20% to 36% with p-values1500g). Conclusion: FNI leads to increased frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better neurobehavioral outcomes. Significance: FNI may be a practicable means of improving outcomes in preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Context: Depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances have been identified as a symptom cluster among breast cancer patients. However, few longitudinal studies have examined the temporal relations between these symptoms surrounding diagnosis and treatment. Objectives: The present study investigated the co-occurrence of and interrelations between nonsomatic depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sleep disturbances in breast cancer patients at three time points: before, after, and six to eight months following adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Methods: Separate samples of premenopausal (n = 67) and postmenopausal (n = 67) breast cancer patients completed self-report measures of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances at all three time points. Path analysis was used to explore within- and cross-symptom paths across time. Results: Depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances were correlated within each time point. Continuity paths, whereby prior levels of symptom severity tended to predict subsequent severity of the same symptom at the subsequent time point, were significant in both samples, except for depression in the premenopausal sample. Instead, significant cross-symptom paths emerged whereby baseline fatigue predicted postchemotherapy depression, and postchemotherapy fatigue predicted depression at follow-up in the premenopausal patients. No significant cross-symptom paths emerged for the postmenopausal sample. Conclusion: Findings supported the notion that depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances manifest as a symptom cluster. Fatigue may precede nonsomatic symptoms of depression among premenopausal breast cancer patients and represents a potential intervention target.

N2  - Background: Premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk for psychological and behavioral disturbances after cancer treatment. Targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group. Methods: This randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief, mindfulness‐based intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress, depression, and inflammatory activity. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6‐week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPS) intervention group (n = 39) or to a wait‐list control group (n = 32). Participants completed questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes) as well as physical symptoms, cancer‐related distress, and positive outcomes. Blood samples were collected to examine genomic and circulating markers of inflammation. Participants also completed questionnaires at a 3‐month follow‐up assessment. Results: In linear mixed models, the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress (P = .004) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms (P = .094), as well as significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression (P = .009) and inflammatory signaling (P = .001) at postintervention. Improvements in secondary outcomes included reduced fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and increased peace and meaning and positive affect (P < .05 for all). Intervention effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the 3‐month follow‐up assessment, although reductions in cancer‐related distress were observed at that assessment. Conclusions: A brief, mindfulness‐based intervention demonstrated preliminary short‐term efficacy in reducing stress, behavioral symptoms, and proinflammatory signaling in younger breast cancer survivors.

N2  - Objective: Researchers have suggested that poor sleep may play a role in the association between discrimination and health, but studies linking experiences of discrimination to sleep are limited. The authors examined associations between reports of everyday discrimination over 4 years (chronic everyday discrimination) and subjective and objective indicators of poor sleep. Method: Participants were 368 African American, Caucasian, and Chinese women from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. Everyday discrimination was assessed each year from baseline through the third follow-up exam via questionnaire with the Everyday Discrimination Scale (intraclass correlation coefficient over 4 years = .90). Subjective sleep complaints were measured beginning in Year 5 with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Objective indices of sleep continuity, duration, and architecture were assessed via in-home polysomnography, beginning in Year 5. Results: In linear regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and financial strain, chronic everyday discrimination was associated with more subjective sleep complaints (Estimate = 1.52, p < .001) and polysomnography-assessed wakefulness after sleep onset (Estimate = .19, p < .02), a marker of sleep continuity. Findings did not differ by race/ethnicity and remained significant after adjusting for menopausal status, body mass index, medication use, and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Experiences of chronic everyday discrimination are independently associated with both subjective and objective indices of poor sleep. Findings add to the growing literature linking discrimination to key markers of biobehavioral health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
