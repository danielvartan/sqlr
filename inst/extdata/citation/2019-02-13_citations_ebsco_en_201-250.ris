AB  - Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety, anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity and low birthweight among black women.

AB  - Is there an association between depression and the transition to menopause?METHODS:Design: Longitudinal prospective cohort study.Follow up period: Four years.Setting: Philadelphia County, USA; timeframe not statedPeople: 436 initially premenopausal women (218 white, 218 African American mean age at endpoint 44.6 years, range 38-52 years) with 22-35 day menstrual cycles, an intact uterus and of least one ovary. Exclusions: psychotropic or hormonal medication, pregnancy, breastfeeding, compromised ovarian function, or substance abuse. Risk factors: Data were collected during six assessments, approximately every 8 months. Trained researchers collected blood samples for hormone assays (obtained between days 2 and 6 of consecutive menstrual cycles); administered a structured interview to assess general health status and behaviour, and the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Major depressive disorder was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria. At each interview, menopausal status was determined. Outcomes: Depressive symptoms (CES-D a cut off score of >/=16 defined high depressive symptoms); MDD; menopausal status determined with the Staging System for Reproductive Aging in Women (premenopausal: regular 22-35 day menstrual cycle; early menopause: change in cycle length by more than a week for two cycles; late menopause: absence of menstruation for 3-11 months; postmenopausal: absence of menstruation for more than 12 months); predictor variables (including hot flashes, sleep pattern, employment status, history of depression, PMS severity).MAIN RESULTS:Data are presented for 76% of the original sample (332 women). 21% of women had a history of depression at baseline. At 4 years, 3% were postmenopausal, 3% in late menopause, 21% in early menopause, and 73% remained premenopausal. Depressive symptoms were more likely during early and late transition to menopause than pre or post menopause. History of depression, severe PMS, and poor sleep increased likelihood of depression in menopausal women (see http://www.ebmentalhealth.com/supplemental for table).CONCLUSIONS:Depression significantly increases in women as they reach menopause but decreases once menopause is complete.

AB  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.

AB  - Objective: The Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium is described.Methods: The LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support each clinical center's conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention. Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses and/or compared readily.Results: Numerous committees and working groups were created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials. The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery.Conclusions: A multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

AB  - The design of an early mobile health application (app) prototype to manage interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pain/discomfort in the bladder and pelvic floor, is described. The purpose of this app prototype is to help people who have IC/PBS manage and learn what triggers their symptoms. Another aim of this research was to provide an example of how sex and gender could be included into the design of a health information system. Based on a literature search of common symptoms and challenges faced by people living with IC/PBS, the researcher created an app prototype design including many features: resources for relaxation, mental health, intimacy, pregnancy, and daily life; reminders for appointments, and medication; logs for diet, activity, sleep, pain, menstruation; and a link to a public washroom locator. This prototype will later undergo usability and content evaluation.

AB  - Background: Inspiratory flow limitation is a breathing pattern during sleep caused by upper airway (UA) narrowing that occurs during snoring and various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Clinical examination of flow limitation relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological support.Methods: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical parameters.Results: We found that three features were correlated with the anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. ΔNC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.54, p = 0.04).Conclusions: Temporal features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children.

AB  - Purpose: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet few studies are currently available regarding the determinants of sleep quality among pregnant women in China. This study aimed to: (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality in pregnant women.Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Five hundred pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. Five selfreport questionnaires were used for gathering data, including information of sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)).Results: A total of 454 pregnant women participated in the study between September 2016 and April 2017. Eighty-seven percent pregnant women experienced sleep disorder (PSQI score >5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The significant contributors to sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal depression, maternal age, and gestational age.Conclusions: Sleep disorder is very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased maternal age, and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. These determinants can assist healthcare professionals in preventative intervention.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea in non-pregnant populations. We sought to evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index >= 5. Using multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics. RESULTS: Of the 114 women who participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57 (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

Methods: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40 weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep) was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests. Results: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN. Conclusions: Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.

AB  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex >or=95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight.

AB  - This paper describes the importance of diabetic retinopathy in the loss of visual function. We exposed the most important risk factors, such as diabetes duration, poor metabolic control, pregnancy, puberty, hypertension, poor control of blood lipids, renal disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of the disease, small retinal vessel microangiopathies which produce extravasation, edema and ischemia phenomena. We put special emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its pathogenic importance. They are also described the main clinical symptoms as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard and soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous disorders, formation of new vessels and diabetic macular edema (the latter being the most common cause of vision loss). Finally we describe the latest diagnostic techniques and eye treatment, with special emphasis on obesity surgery importance as more important preventive factor to eliminate the predisposing and precipitating disease symptoms.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This review aims to provide an update on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy and its effect on maternal and fetal outcomes.Recent Findings: Current OSA screening tools may not perform well in this population. There are some pieces of evidence linking poorer maternal and neonatal outcome with pregnant patients having OSA. At present, there are inadequate data on which to base fetal or maternal parameters for treatment of OSA, and no evidence that treatment in the short-term impacts maternal or neonatal outcomes.Summary: Further research is needed to help in the detection and treatment of OSA in pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This narrative review describes the differential diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, and provides an overview of the evidence for the associations between RLS and potential comorbidities. Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. Methods: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. Results and Conclusions: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the differences between primigravidae and multigravidae women in their experience of sleep efficiency, fatigue and vitality, and level of functioning in the third trimester of pregnancy and the first month postpartum. A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the hypothesis that multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased sleep efficiency and vitality than primigravidae at both phases of the study. Results indicate, however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum. Multigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the third trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no statistically significant difference in level of vitality, primigravidae experienced more fatigue (73.58 +/- 15.22) than multigravidae (64.35 +/- 18.96) at 1 month postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role 'acquisition,' experienced by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal role 'expansion.' The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase in fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that health care professionals need to provide anticipatory guidance to primigravidae to help smooth the transition from pregnancy to motherhood.

AB  - Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasingly believed to originate from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current reviews exploring the neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an inadequate proxy.Objective: We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood.Search Strategy: Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published after 1970.Selection Criteria: The analysis included studies that identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years of age.Data Collection and Analysis: Data was extracted for cognitive, behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were summarised separately for children born at <35 and ≥35 weeks gestation.Main Results: Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR children born ≥35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born <35 weeks of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone.Conclusions: IUGR increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected.Tweetable Abstract: IUGR is associated with an overall risk for neurodevelopmental delay in a range of neurodevelopmental domains.

AB  - Overweight and obesity (body mass index (BMI) â 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2) and BMI â 30 kg/m(2,) respectively are increasingly common among women of reproductive age. Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of women. To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised controlled trials (including those using a cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25 kg/m(2). Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular woman.Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems, customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions. We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently excluded. There are no included trials. We found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be made. Further research is required in this area.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing of hospital discharge, time to outpatient follow-up, and home care practices (breastfeeding initiation and continuation, tobacco smoke exposure, supine sleep position) for late-preterm (LPT; 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) and early-term (ET; 37 0/7-38/6/7 weeks) infants with term infants. METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Χ2 Analyses were used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT and ET infants compared with term infants. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants, whereas there was no difference for ET infants (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]). LPT and ET infants were more likely to have timely outpatient follow-up (1.07 [1.06-1.08]; 1.02 [1.02-1.03]), more likely to experience maternal tobacco smoke exposure (1.09 [1.05-1.14]; 1.08 [1.06-1.11]), less likely to be initially breastfed (0.95 [0.94-0.97]; 0.98 [0.97-0.98]), less likely to be breastfed for ≥10 weeks (0.88 [0.86-0.90]; 0.94 [0.93-0.96]), and less likely to be placed in a supine sleep position (0.95 [0.93-0.97]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Given that LPT and ET infants bear an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, greater efforts are needed to ensure safe and healthy posthospitalization and home care practices for these vulnerable infants.

AB  - In mammals, the vast majority of dietary tryptophan is metabolized via the kynurenine pathway (KP), which is initiated by the oxidative opening of the indole ring and eventually produces the ubiquitous enzyme cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Several neuroactive intermediates are yielded with the degradation of triptophan by this pathway, including the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid, and the NMDA and -7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. The kynurenine pathway may play a role in certain physiological functions such as behaviour, sleep, thermoregulation and pregnancy. Furthermore, the kynurenine pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cerebral diseases including the AIDS dementia complex, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer, epilepsy, Down syndrome, septicemia-related encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, malaria, and certain inflammatory brain diseases, as well as in traumatic brain injury. New pharmacological agents designed to manipulate concentrations of kynurenine pathway intermediates may prove to be new therapeutic vectors in the treatment of these disorders.

AB  - Background For a small but significant group, pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain may become persistent. While multiple factors may contribute to disability in this group, previous studies have not investigated sleep impairments, body perception or mindfulness as potential factors associated with disability post-partum. Objectives To compare women experiencing no pain post-pregnancy with those experiencing pregnancy-related persistent lumbopelvic pain (either low- or high-level disability) across multiple biopsychosocial domains. Design Cross-sectional. Methods Participants completed questionnaires for thorough profiling of factors thought to be important in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. Specific measures were the Urinary Distress Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophising Scale, The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Women where categorised into three groups; pain free (n = 26), mild disability (n = 12) and moderate disability (n = 12) (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores). Non-parametric group comparisons were used to compare groups across the profiling variables. Results Differences were identified for kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body perception (p = 0.02), sleep quantity (p < 0.01) and sleep adequacy (p = 0.02). Generally subjects in the moderate disability group had more negative findings for these variables. Conclusion Disturbances in body-perception, sleep and elevated kinesiophobia were found in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain subjects with moderate disability, factors previously linked to persistent low back pain. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for identification of directional pathways between factors. The results support the consideration of these factors in the assessment and management of pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain.

AB  - Objective: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes.Methods: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events.Results: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time (β = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher IL-6 (β = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor α (β = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressed women, interferon-γ increased risk for preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.175, p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-γ and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p < .069), and increased IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were observed.Conclusions: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships.

AB  - The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is an increased reporting of sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence implicating significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, with adverse outcomes, such as an increase in depressive symptomatology or the development postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant, and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.

AB  - Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Pregnant women ( n=217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB. Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Abnormalities of sleep and biological rhythms have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, less is known about the influence of biological rhythm disruptions across the perinatal period on postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between subjective changes in both sleep and biological rhythms and worsening of depressive symptoms from pregnancy to the postpartum period in women with and without mood disorders. Eighty-three participants (38 euthymic women with a history of a mood disorder and 45 healthy controls) were studied. Participants completed subjective assessments of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), biological rhythm disturbances (Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), and depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) prospectively at two time points: third trimester of pregnancy and at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in biological rhythms across the perinatal period predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in both groups. Moreover, women with a history of a mood disorder showed higher levels of sleep and biological rhythm disruption during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background. Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design. Cross-sectional study design. Methods. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results. The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.

AB  - Objective: A number of studies have established an association between antenatal maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts.Methods: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age.Results: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (β = .085, p < .001) in the whole sample and when limited to the Dutch/European group (β = .055, p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (β = -.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression.Conclusion: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.

AB  - Objective:The current study examined the relationship between sleep state development across the preterm and early post-term periods and subsequent growth trajectories from 1 to 27 months corrected age.Study design:Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from 111 preterm infants (⩽34 weeks gestation) who participated in a multi-site longitudinal study. Separate longitudinal parallel process models were calculated for each sleep state (active and quiet sleep) and growth (weight, length and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores) variable to estimate the associations between their developmental trajectories.Results:Significant associations were identified between the trajectories of quiet sleep and weight, active sleep and weight, quiet sleep and BMI, and active sleep and BMI. No statistically meaningful associations were identified between the trajectories of early childhood length and the preterm sleep states.Conclusion:Faster preterm period sleep development appears to predict more favorable early childhood growth trajectories, particularly for weight, indicating preterm sleep may be an important biomarker for subsequent growth outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Nocturia is more than an isolated lower urinary tract symptom, being significantly associated with dysfunction of sleep quality and duration, cardiovascular morbidity, mental health and mortality1. The medical conditions co-existing with nocturia may share central neural control areas in the brainstem2,3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improvement in one comorbid variable, in patients with nocturia, may regulate other co-morbid dysfunctions toward a more normal state. Materials and methods: A prospective, two-arm repeated measures study was performed in 2017. Participants were recruited from both Continence and Sleep Medicine Services. Inclusion criteria included: ≥40 years of age; nocturia; either urinary urgency or urge incontinence (UUI) severe enough to require pharmacotherapy or sleep disordered breathing (SDB) requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Exclusion criteria were current urinary tract infection, end-stage renal disease, bladder cancer, previous pelvic radiotherapy, pregnancy, urinary catheterisation and dementia or cognitive impairment that precluded completion of study tasks. Patients not able to complete questionnaires in English were also excluded from the study. Ethics approval: HREC number LNR/17/ MH/96 Baseline data included demographic information, overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), Nocturia-specific quality of life instrument (NQoL), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Euroquol-5D Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), 2-day bladder diary variables, actigraphy parameters and blood pressure. Study intervention was either an anticholinergic agent or beta-3 agonist (mirabegron) to treat urgency or urgency incontinence or CPAP to reduce apnoea episodes. Those with SDB were not treated for any urinary tract symptoms; UUI patients did not commenced CPAP therapy during the study. Participants were followed up regularly by their clinician as per usual care. Data were re-collected at 12 weeks. Results: Overall, 36 patients participated (20 continence, 16 sleep medicine), 58% female, mean age of 63 years (SD 12) and health status on EQ-5D of 73/100 (SD 17). Full compliance with intervention was 78% for OAB medication and 55% for CPAP worn at least 4 hours at night. Findings are presented in Table 1. As expected, the OABSS was significantly reduced (p=0.04) in the continence cohort while sleep efficiency and sleep disturbance improved in the SDB arm (p<0.001 and 0.020 respectively). In both arms OABSS and sleep parameters changed significantly, while nocturia frequency significantly reduced in the Continence group and approached a significant difference in the sleep cohort (p=0.07). Specific co-morbid dysfunctions improved. In UUI patients sleep parameters improved significant (p=0.03) and high systolic blood pressure fell (p=0.04). In patients with SDB significant improvement was noted in OABSS (p=0.01), sleep domains (total score p=0.04) night urine production (p<0.01) and nocturia-related QoL (p=0.01). A non-significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was noted. Wellbeing measures did not change in either study group. Conclusions: In a cohort of young, relatively healthy individuals, treatment targeted to the presenting dysfunction resulted in less nocturia, improved sleep quality and duration and a reduction in clinically relevant systolic blood pressure (Continence arm only). There were no significant changes in bladder storage, diuresis or nocturnal polyuria index to explain the findings. Treatment appears to have induced change toward a more normal state in non-urinary variables known to have control areas in the brainstem. Competing interest statement: None.

AB  - Background Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size. Methods We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32.6 ± 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 ± 9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size. Results A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r2 = 0.16, p = 0.11). Conclusion The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if maternal sleeping position around the time of implantation influences eventual placental implantation site. Between November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1) fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6) anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of 1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of 1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of 1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041). In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may influence the ultimate placental implantation site.

AB  - Introduction: One indicator for fetal risk of mortality is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Whether markers reflecting the impact of growth restriction on the cardiovascular system, computed from a Doppler-derived heart rate signal, would be suitable for its detection antenatally was studied.Material and Methods: We used a cardiotocography archive of 1163 IUGR cases and 1163 healthy controls, matched for gestation and gender. We assessed the discriminative power of short-term variability and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate, computed over episodes of high and low variation aiming to separate growth-restricted fetuses from controls. Metrics characterizing the sleep state distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR detection model.Results: Significant differences in the risk markers comparing growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably superior before 34 weeks of gestation. Long-term variability in active sleep was superior to short-term variability [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 72% compared with 71%]. Most predictive was the number of minutes in high variation per hour (AUC of 75%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved the AUC to 76%.Conclusion: We suggest that heart rate variability markers together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the detection of early-onset IUGR.

AB  - Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance There is limited evidence about the role of herbal and traditional medicine in pregnancy-related insomnia. Extant documents on traditional Persian medicine refer to many plants which could induce sleep and which were used by pregnant women. In Iran, local herbal shops continue to provide these herbs to pregnant women to treat insomnia. One such herb is Lactuca sativa L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lettuce seed on pregnant women for the treatment of insomnia. Methods and materials In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 100 pregnant women with insomnia aged 20–45 years were assigned to receive capsules containing 1000 mg of lettuce seed or a placebo daily for two weeks. The main outcome was the quality of sleep, which was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results Each group contained 50 participants. An improvement in the PSQI score was significantly greater in patients receiving lettuce seed than those receiving the placebo. Linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the other variables, the average sleep score of the experimental group was significantly lower than for the placebo group (p = 0.03). Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that lettuce seed decreased insomnia during pregnancy and could be recommended as a safe natural remedy for treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). DESIGN: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. SETTING: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 +/- 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 +/- 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 +/- 6.34 years). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. CONCLUSION: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

AB  - Objective. To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects. A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures. Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results. Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions. Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

AB  - Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters. To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for Plasmodium vivax. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance. Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment.For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials,, 3662 participants, high quality evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality evidence).For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence)but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes.In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar.A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants). Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Preterm infants are routinely placed in incubators immediately after birth in Taiwan. Mothers can be with their infants only during scheduled visiting times in the nursery. However, some health professionals propose that infants are at increased physiological and developmental risk if on-cue self-regulatory access to their mothers is not provided. Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care may be nurturing for medically stable, lower-risk preterm infants because it supports their efforts toward self-regulation and competent functioning (Anderson, 1999). This randomized controlled trial was done to test the hypotheses that infants given kangaroo care (KC) would have higher tympanic core temperature, less weight loss, more optimal behavioral state, and lower acuity.Thirty-four healthy preterm infants and their mothers were selected from Chung Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Maternal inclusion criteria were no pre-existing medical problems, willingness to breastfeed, and no problems that would keep the mother from the nursery. Infant inclusion criteria were 34-36 completed weeks gestation, 5-minute Apgar score <=7, stable respirations, and admission to the normal newborn or observation nursery.Eligible dyads were recruited after birth (Day 0). On Day 1 they were randomly assigned by minimization just before the first study feeding to the control (n = 17) or KC group (n = 17). Stratification variables were gender, birth weight, delivery method, and parity. On Days 1 and 2, control infants wore a shirt and diaper, were wrapped in a blanket, and held by their mothers for one hour, three times a day at scheduled feeding times; KC infants wore a diaper and were held upright skin-to-skin on their mothers' chest except during breastfeeding.Hypothesis testing was done using repeated measures analysis of variance and independent sample t-tests. KC infants compared to control infants had higher mean tympanic temperature (37.3 degrees]C vs. 37.0 degrees]C), more quiet sleep (62% vs. 22%), more inactive awake behavior (14% vs. 7%), less drowsiness (2% vs. 15%), and less crying (2% vs. 6%) all at p = .000. No significant difference was found for weight loss and acuity (length of hospital stay).These findings can be used for evidence-based nursing practice in Taiwan. This is the first randomized controlled trial to provide information about the effect of early KC on tympanic temperature, weight loss, behavioral state, and acuity for 34-36 week gestation preterm infants in Taiwan. KC as given in this study is a safe intervention.

AB  - In Hawai.i, postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence rate of 14 to 15 percent, affecting about 3,000 women annually (Hayes, Shor, & Fuddy, 2010). Postpartum depression is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) as a "Major depressive condition that occurs in the one year period following childbirth" (Grier & Geraghty, 2015, p. 110). After delivery, women with PPD experience feelings of sadness, loneliness, or inadequacies daily for at least two weeks. Additional symptoms include erratic sleep patterns, anxiety, or the inability to care for oneself or the newborn infant. In the Kaiser Permanente (KP) organization, postpartum depression screening occurs in the antepartum (third trimester) during pregnancy and repeated during the routine four to six week postpartum visit. This project implemented a validated depression-screening tool between one to three days post hospital discharge at the KP Special Delivery Program clinics. The goal was to screen for early postpartum depressive symptoms, and if detected, initiating an immediate referral to the KP Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. There is no current screening program for depressive symptoms during the early postpartum period in the KP Hawai.i region.

AB  - Background: Preterm delivery may affect the development of the upper airways resulting in a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We investigated whether children born at early term (37-38 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at an increased risk for childhood OSA as compared with those born later.Methods: In this population-based cohort analysis all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991-2013 at a single regional tertiary medical centre were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early preterm (<33 6/7 weeks' gestation), late preterm (34-36 6/7), early term, full term (39-40 6/7), late term (41-41 6/7), and post term (>42 0/7). Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A survival curve and a Cox model were used to assess the association.Results: During the study period 240 953 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA hospitalization (n = 1320) rates decreased as gestational age increased from 1.1% in the early preterm group, 0.8% in late preterm, 0.7% at early term, 0.5% in full term, 0.4% in late term, to 0.3% in post term born children. In the Cox regression, early term delivery exhibited an increased risk for paediatric OSA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.5) while late and post term deliveries were associated with significantly lower OSA risk when compared with full term (HR 0.8 95% CI 0.6, 0.9 and HR 0.6 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, respectively).Conclusions: Early term deliveries are associated with higher rates of paediatric OSA, which decrease gradually as gestational age advances.

AB  - Purpose: Black infants die from sudden infant death syndrome at twice the incidence observed among non-Hispanic white infants. Explanations for this disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers.Methods: I retrieved data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for individual characteristics and state and time trends.Results: Black mothers exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and prone placement among white mothers.Conclusions: Statewide economic decline may reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep placement.

AB  - <italic>Objectives</italic> Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic adversity. We examined whether a mother’s economic hardship in childhood (EHC) was associated with women’s hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just before pregnancy. <italic>Methods</italic> We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102 postpartum California women. EHC included respondents’ reports that during childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity, homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. <italic>Results</italic> Before adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals overlapped. <italic>Conclusions for Policy/Practice</italic> These findings link childhood economic hardship with women’s hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be considered an ACE.

AB  - Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 micro T above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 micro T during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 micro T during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.

AB  - Sleep disturbance and fatigue are frequent complaints during pregnancy and postpartum. We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum. In this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25-28 weeks gestation were recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January 2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath, Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used. Compared with the placebo group, the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups. Lavender cream with or without footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum.

AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea, a breathing disorder caused by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, results in a state of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this disease process are unknown. Design: This study was done to investigate the effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period. Results: Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight:liver-weight ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart- and brain-weight:body weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight:body weight ratios. By adulthood, body weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the liver-weight:body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during development into adults. Conclusion: These data suggest that alteration of the maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic diseases in adulthood.

AB  - Preterm infants have traditionally been considered at risk for positional deformities and delayed or atypical development. During the last decade, however, similar problems have increasingly been documented in normal infants born at term gestation, with recommendations of supine sleeping for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome often implicated as a causal factor. This article seeks to inform and educate neonatal and pediatric nurses on positional and postural influences in normal and delayed infant development, including the relationship of sleep and play positions to developmental issues. An observant nurse who understands normal development, can recognize atypical postures, and is knowledgeable about potential developmental consequences is in a position to intervene at the earliest interaction with the family. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sleep position guidelines, however, must not be compromised in the process. Current AAP rationale and guidelines for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome are summarized to facilitate nursing efforts to correctly model and teach infant caregivers. Common-sense suggestions for hospital and community-based nurses to help parents avoid preventable developmental delay while reinforcing current sleep position guidelines are presented.

AB  - Aim: The present observational study aimed to clarify the effects of sleep disorders on threatened premature delivery, especially preterm uterine contraction. Methods: The participants included 122 healthy singleton pregnant women. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was used to evaluate the quality of sleep during the previous month at the initial examination and at 16, 24, and 32 weeks of gestation; scores > 5 indicate poor sleep. Threatened premature delivery was defined as preterm uterine contraction > 6 times/h and requiring tocolytic therapy before 37 weeks of gestation. We analyzed the relationship between poor sleep and threatened premature delivery. Results: Poor sleep affected 27% (n = 33) at the initial examination, 34% (n = 41) at 16 weeks, 37% (n = 45) at 24 weeks, and 41% (n = 50) at 32 weeks of gestation. There were 23 patients (19%) with threatened premature delivery. Poor sleep affected 35% and 25% of patients with threatened and non-threatened premature delivery at the initial examination, respectively, 52% and 29% at 16 weeks, 48% and 34% at 24 weeks, and 43% and 40% at 32 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: Sleep disorders at 16 weeks of gestation were the most significantly associated with threatened premature delivery.
