N2  - The authors report on a 12-year old boy with a past history of impaired respiratory control during sleep secondary to extensive thrombosis of cerebral veins at age 6, requiring continuous ventilation during sleep, and severe psychological problems and self-destructive behaviour with onset in early childhood. Although schooling was impossible, the child was judged to have a normal intellectual level. Frequent absence seizures with atonic falls and numerous injuries occurred during a worsening of the psychological situation, triggered by the announcement by the parents of a new pregnancy and by neuroleptic treatment with fluphenazine. Clinical and polygraphic-video monitoring showed that the boy used a Valsalva maneuvre to repeatedly provoke syncopes; these were not associated with a cardiac pause, but only with a steep decline in blood pressure. After a slight bettering of the self-destructive behaviour during a hospital stay, there was a new exacerbation and the boy was found dead one evening in his bed six weeks after the evaluation.

N2  - General pharmacological profiles of OPC-13340, a novel calcium antagonist, were studied in mice, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits and cats. OPC-13340 showed inhibition of spontaneous motor activity at 30 mg/kg p.o. or more, acetic acid-induced writhing at 100 and 300 mg/kg p.o. and motor coordination at 300 mg/kg p.o. in mice. In conscious rabbits, the drug showed transient increase of the slow wave component of EEG in amygdala at 1 mg/kg i.v. and transient decrease of the amplitude of EEG in cortex and hippocampus at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg intravenously. However, OPC-13340 showed little effect on general behavior, hexobarbital-induced anesthesia and body temperature in mice at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. and sleep-wakefulness cycle in rabbits at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg intravenously. The drug did not show anti-convulsant and convulsion-inducing activities at doses up to 300 mg/kg orally. OPC-13340 showed no muscle relaxation in mice at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. and exerted no local anesthetic action in guinea-pig cornea at 0.01% and 0.03%. In anesthetized cats, the drug did not affect the neuromuscular transmission at doses up to 3 mg/kg intravenously. OPC-13340 showed little effect on the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in cats at doses up to 3 mg/kg intravenously. In the isolated smooth muscles, OPC-13340 inhibited the spontaneous movement of pregnant rat uterus at 10-8M or more and the spontaneous movement of rabbit ileum and dopamine-induced contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens at 10-7M or more. In addition, OPC-13340 showed non-competitive inhibitions of acetylcholine-, histamine- or barium chloride-induced contraction of guinea- pig ileum, serotonin-induced contraction of rat fundus, norepinephrine- or acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens and oxytocin- induced contraction of non-pregnant rat uterus at 10-8M or more. However, the drug showed no relaxation in the isolated guinea-pig trachea at doses up to 3 x 10-5M. In anesthetized rats, OPC-13340 and nicardipine caused inhibition of the spontaneous movement of non-pregnant uterus at 1 and 3 mg/kg i.v. and pregnant uterus at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.v., although the duration of inhibitory action of OPC-13340 for the uterine movement was longer than that of nicardipine. OPC-13340 inhibited the intestinal propulsion at 30 mg/kg p.o. or more in mice. In anesthetized rats, the drug inhibited intestinal movement at 0.1 mg/kg i.v. or more and gastric movement at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v. and 100 and 300 mg/kg intraduodenally. OPC-13340 decreased the gastric secretion at 3 and 10 mg/kg intraduodenally. OPC-13340 decreased the urine volume and excretion of urinary Na+, K+ and Cl- in rats at 100 and 300 mg/kg orally. OPC-13340 inhibited the carrageenin- induced paw edema at 30 mg/kg p.o. or more. However, the drug showed no effect on the blood coagulation process at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o., no hemolytic action at doses up to 10-5M or little eye irritative action at 0.01% and 0.03%. From these results, OPC-13340 was considered to have little effect on the central, somatic and autonomic nervous systems, digestive system and peripheral organs, although the drug showed several effects, which are qualitatively identical with those of other calcium antagonists or vasodilators, at doses 10-100 times higher than that of hypotensive action in vivo or vasodilatory action in vitro.

N2  - 86 women who suffered from a psychotic disorder for the first time in their life within 6 weeks after parturition, were investigated regarding sociodemographic and gynaecological parameters, time of onset and initial symptomatology, psychopathological symptoms during hospitalisation, treatment and short-term outcome of the illness. The majority of patients became ill after the first (75%), full-term normal (63%) delivery and within the first two postpartum weeks (78%). The most frequent initial symptoms were anxiety, restlessness, depressive mood, sleep disturbances, behaviour disturbances, catatonic excitement, delusions and hallucinations. By the time of follow-up investigation, 16 women had died; 61 women were investigated on average 25.6 years after onset (minimum 12, maximum 41 years), using standardised instruments of evaluation. Nearly two-thirds of the patients had suffered remanifestation of psychotic disorder during a long-term course (64%). The frequency of remanifestations of illness after additional pregnancies and deliveries was found to be 1:4, which is also known to be the expected frequency during the course of other psychotic disorders. These results do not justify the global recommendation to avoid additional pregnancies or carry out an interruption of pregnancy, if the patient has a history of postpartum psychosis. The climacteric period also seems to be a vulnerable phase for the remanifestation of illness. Nearly 3/4 of the investigated women displayed no disturbances in any of the evaluated dimensions (psychopathological, psychological, psychosocial status) at the time of follow-up.

N2  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) completes the diagnostic approach to hypertension of pregnancy, by providing a dynamic study of the blood pressure status of the pregnant woman. It corrects certain erroneous diagnoses of hypertension of pregnancy, in particular those related to the 'White coat' effect, especially common in pregnant women. ABPM enables the study of nocturnal blood pressured figures, known for their prognostic value in hypertension of pregnancy. Finally, while loss or reversal of circadian rhythm appears to be of good predictive value regarding the onset of eclampsia, it is above all blood pressure load which appears to be harmful to fetal growth and maturity. ABPM also facilitates management by improving the compliance of pregnant women with regular monitoring and with treatment, by more accurately guiding the surveillance of drug treatment.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are present during fetal life in several mammalian species. To characterize the ontogeny of the neural mechanisms that account for circadian rhythmicity in a precocious species, we studied the prenatal development of the retinohypothalamic pathway in lambs (gestation period of 147 days), using horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin as anterograde tracers. The suprachiasmatic nucleus was present as early as embryonic day 52 (E52). After E58, the suprachiasmatic nucleus reached its full number of neurons, estimated by the disector method in about 160,000 cells per nucleus at E62. The retinohypothalamic axons invaded the suprachiasmatic nucleus from E58, while neuroblasts were still migrating to the nucleus. At E62, there was a strong retinal projection that evolved until E121, when the retinal afferents established their definitive pattern of distribution in the ventral and central regions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and adjacent hypothalamic structures. The development of the retinohypothalamic pathway was delayed by about a week relative to the innervation of other subcortical visual centers. The present findings demonstrated an early prenatal development of the visual pathways in lambs, including the retinohypothalamic pathway, suggesting that the mechanisms for the visual entrainment of circadian rhythms in lambs may be functioning several weeks before birth.

N2  - Few studies regarding the effects of ozone exposure in the central nervous system (CNS), during the early stages of development have been reported. The study of sleep on newborn rats represents a model to understand the effects of this gas on the CNS. We studied the sleep organization in rats whose mothers were exposed to 1 part per million (ppm) ozone during pregnancy. We found severe sleep disturbances such as a decrease in paradoxical sleep duration and inversion of the light-dark cycle or a circadian phase-shift of vigilance states. These results suggest that ozone exposure during pregnancy may affect the generating mechanisms of paradoxical sleep, and the regulation of circadian rhythms in rats.

N2  - Many pregnant women are exposed to low frequency sounds and vibrations while at work or play. How the fetus is affected by these physical stimuli is not clearly documented. We recorded behavioral state and intrauterine sound pressure levels in eight fetal sheep previously instrumented with electrocortical, electroocular and neck electromyographic leads, and with a miniature hydrophone. Data were collected before, during and after 30 min of abdominal vibration using a belt vibrator commonly used by humans in weight reduction programs. A sudden shift in behavioral state occurred at the onset of vibration. There was a decrease in non-rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.02) and an increase in time during which the sleep state could not be determined (P < 0.03). A 63% increase in number of epochs spent in this indeterminate period was evident during vibration. During the post-stimulus period, percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep decreased as compared to the pre-stimulus period (P < 0.04), and non-rapid eye movement sleep increased as compared to the stimulus period (P < 0.01). Vibration-induced intrauterine sound pressures ranged from 131-142 dB at the fundamental frequency of 19 Hz and were 20-40 dB lower at the overtones which appeared in the spectrum between 35-200 Hz. Results indicated that environmental vibration can disrupt fetal behavioral state, induce abnormal state changes, and alter distribution of sleep states.

N2  - This study examines the extent to which altering maternal metabolism via chronic cold exposure (i.e., winter shearing) and changes in feed intake over the final month of gestation influences development changes in breathing control during non-rapid eye-movement sleep (Non-REM) of neonatal lambs. In lambs born from well-fed (100% of total energy requirement) unshorn ewes metabolic rate and breathing frequency was lower between 4-30 days of age than those born from under-fed ewes (60% of total requirements for unshorn ewes). Laryngeal braking of expiratory airflow was observed in ca 40% of breaths during non-REM sleep at 14 and 30 days of age in lambs born from well-fed ewes compared with ca 10% of breaths in the under-fed group. The combined effects of under-feeding plus chronic cold exposure (of shorn ewes) resulted in newborn lambs which possess brown adipose tissue with an increased thermogenic activity, and exhibited a higher metabolic rate and breathing frequency over the first day of neonatal life. Laryngeal braking of expiratory airflow was commonly observed in lambs born from shorn ewes between 4-30 days of age, despite maternal under-feeding ewes. It is concluded that changes in maternal metabolism can influence developmental changes in breathing control which may be linked to effects on the control of thermoregulation.

N2  - Two-hour hypobaric hypoxia of rats on day 15 of their pregnancy led to a reduction in weight gain of pups within 20 days after birth, disturbed memory in active and passive paradigms, changed adaptive behaviour in the extrapolatory water avoidance test, and impaired sleep in adult animals. Postnatal treatment with sodium hydroxybutyrate given in a dose of 50 mg/kg/day on days 8 to 20 of life normalized mnestic functions of the brain, the process of falling asleep, and physical development which had been impaired by intrauterine hypoxia.

N2  - The peripheral chemoresponses of infant twin pairs were determined using a single-breath hyperoxic stimulus. A total of 43 twin pairs of comparable gestation and birth weight were studied during sleep at a mean (SD) age of 8 wk (1.4) while alternately breathing either air or 16% oxygen in nitrogen. Infants responded to a single breath of 100% oxygen by a reduction in ventilation; the mean (SEM) reduction in air was 273 ml/min (10.6) and in 16% oxygen 560 ml/min (18.4). Within-pair variances were compared in 14 monozygotic and 28 dizygotic pairs utilizing combined responses (air + 16% oxygen) computed for measurements made in behavioral quiet sleep and in 9 monozygotic and 20 dizygotic pairs for whom data were complete in polygraphically confirmed quiet sleep. The variance of responses within dizygotic twin pairs was greater than in monozygotic pairs when expressed in ml/min: F ratio 4.11 (p = 0.005) for all data and F ratio 7.67 (p = 0.003) in quiet sleep. Expressed in ml/min/kg the difference was less significant: F ratio 1.83 (p = 0.126) for all data and F ratio 3.46 (p = 0.039) in quiet sleep. Gender, birth weight, and birth order had no effect on these findings. This closer similarity of response in monozygotic twin pairs is explained by proposing a high degree of heritability for the response.

N2  - An epidemiological analysis of 38 cases of SIDS was carried out in the Pathology Institute of the University of Milan. Those cases were collected from Milan district in four years, from 1987 to 1991. In 1991 the incidence of cot death in the same district was 0.55 per 1000 live births. This study has led to the following conclusions. Most of SIDS victims were males, mostly aged between 40 and 90 days; the totality (except one case that happened during maternal feeding) of the cases occurred during night sleep; a greater prevalence during winter months was found. We didn't find any correlation between type of feeding and cot death. The weight at birth was mostly satisfactory; often the infants showed mild infections of the upper airways during the days immediately before death. It is possible to hypothesize a correlation between cigarette smoking and between drug abuse (during pregnancy) and cot death. We didn't recognize a significant association between sleeping position of infants and their death nor between type of cushion and cot death. For each case a complete autopsy was carried out. We extended histological findings to cardiac conduction system, to brain-stem (central) and to ganglion structures (peripheric), sites of cardio-respiratory control. In 65.7% of cases we found cardiac conduction system alterations; in 10.5% of cases we observed brain-stem anomalies, sometime these alterations were associated. In one case we noticed an hypertrophy of aorto-pulmonary paraganglia structures.

N2  - Objective: Hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is associated with disturbances of pulsatile gonadotrophin secretion. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and the aim of this study was to investigate the 24-hour secretory pattern of gonadotrophins in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea. The effect of opioid blockade using naloxone infusion on LH secretory pattern was also studied. Design: The secretory patterns of LH, FSH, PRL and their responses to naloxone infusion were studied by serial blood samples collected at 10-minute intervals for 24 hours. On the following day, naloxone was infused at a dose of 1.6 mg per hour for 4 hours. Patients: Eight women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea, two women hyperprolactinaemic but with normal ovarian cycles, and nine control subjects in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle. Measurements: Concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL were measured in plasma samples obtained at 10-minute intervals for 24 hours. In one woman, concentrations of urinary oestrone glucuronide were measured daily during treatment with pulsatile GnRH. Results: The number of LH pulses per 24 hours was significantly fewer in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea than in those with hyperprolactinaemia with normal cycles or control subjects (mean ± SEM 4.5 ± 2.4 vs 13.5 ± 2.5 vs 17.3 ± 0.8, P < 0.001). The magnitude of each episode of secretion was significantly higher in the hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic women (P < 0.05) so the overall mean concentrations of LH throughout the 24-hour period was similar in the three groups (5.2 ± 1.1, 4.8 ± 0.8 and 5.2 ± 0.4 U/l respectively). In women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea there was no significant change in the pattern of LH secretion during sleep in contrast to the control women in whom there was a slowing in the LH pulse frequency during the night. There was no significant change in the mean concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL during the naloxone infusion. There were also no significant changes in the LH pulse frequency in response to naloxone infusion when compared with an equivalent period of time in the previous 24 hours. In one hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic woman, follicular development, ovulation and pregnancy were induced when gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) was infused in a pulsatile manner at a dose of 5 μg every 90 minutes. Conclusions: The suppression of normal ovarian cycles in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is due to a significant reduction in frequency of LH (GnRH) secretion which is not due to an increase in hypothalamic opioid activity. As normal ovarian cycles can occur or be induced by exogenous GnRH in hyperprolactinaemia, it is unlikely that a high level of prolactin by itself inhibits follicular development and ovulation.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of second trimester 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as a screening test for pre-eclampsia. Design: Prospective interventional study. Setting: John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital, Oxford, and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London. Subjects: One hundred and sixty-two normotensive nulliparous women recruited at hospital booking clinics. Intervention: Ambulatory blood pressure was measured at 18 and 28 weeks gestation using the TM2420 monitor. Main outcome measure: The development of pre-eclampsia. Results: Awake systolic and mean arterial pressures were significantly increased (P<0.02) at 18 weeks in those who later developed pre-eclampsia. Those differences were more apparent at 28 weeks at which time the diastolic pressure was also increased (P<0.01). At both stages of gestation the higher readings were sustained during sleep so that the awake-sleep differences were similar in relation to each outcome. The group with incipient pre-eclampsia had a significantly faster heart rate at both 18 and 28 weeks (P<0.002) The sensitivity in predicting pre-eclampsia for a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater at 28 weeks was 65%, with a positive predictive value of 31%. The sensitivity and positive predictive value for a test combining a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater and a heart rate of 90 bpm or greater were 53% and 45%, respectively. Conclusion: Although second trimester ambulatory blood pressure is significantly increased in women who later develop pre-eclampsia, the predictive values for blood pressure alone are low. The efficiency of the test is increased by combining the awake ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure measurement together. If an effective method for preventing pre-eclampsia becomes available (commencing at 28 weeks gestation), then awake ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate may have some clinical value as a screening test.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the relation between hourly fetal urine production rate (HFUPR) and behavioural states 1F and 2F (corresponding to quiet and active sleep, respectively) in normal near term fetuses. Design: An observational study. Setting: A clinic for antenatal care at a university hospital. Subjects: Nineteen healthy pregnant women examined at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation. Main outcome measures: Fetal behavioural states (1F and 2F) were assessed by means of fetal heart rate patterns (FHR A and FHR B). Using real time ultrasonography, HFUPR (ml/h) was estimated during behavioural states 1F and 2F. Results: During behavioural state 1F, HFUPR was significantly higher than during state 2F (P<0.01). HFUPR falls by 47% from 50.8 ± 24.4 ml/h in state 1F to 25.7 ± 15.0 ml/h in state 2F. Conclusions: During active sleep (state 2F) hourly fetal urine production rate is considerably reduced as compared to quiet sleep (state 1F).

N2  - Radiation doses to the family and general public from 131I therapy of outpatients were assessed for comparison with the 1990 International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) dose limits. Doses to family members of such patients, measured by previous workers, were converted to show that on average 5.6 ± 3.7 μSv MBq-1 is received by the spouse and 1.5 ± 0.87 μSv MBq-1 by other family members. It was deduced that the average dose to the spouse (D μSv MBq-1) when couples sleep apart for T days after administration is given by: D = 2.528 + 3.072e(-0.11T) if an effective half-life, T(eff), of 6.35 days is used. The cumulative effect of repeated treatments should be considered and in view of ALARA it is recommended that couples sleep apart for at least 14 days after each administration, even if this is below limits permitted by authorities. The dose to a pregnant colleague or family member other than the wife should be below 2 mSv if the total administered activity is not more than 600 MBq. If the wife is pregnant, couples should sleep apart for at least 30 days after administration.

N2  - The existing knowledge on the functional development of the fetus' central nervous system (CNS) in uncomplicated pregnancy is summarized. It is advocated that the current techniques to study normal prenatal neurology are used for testing behavioural teratogenicity in man. Any substance potentially noxious to the CNS, should ideally be subjected to this method of testing. Such a study, though extensive and time-consuming, is feasible. This is shown using diabetes mellitus as an example. Maternal diabetes poses a risk to the developing fetus. The risk for structural malformations of the CNS is increased. Abnormal functional development of the fetal nervous system exists also in diabetic pregnancy, even when well controlled. Indicative of this are a delayed emergence of fetal movement patterns in the first trimester of pregnancy, altered regulation of fetal breathing movements, delayed and/or disturbed emergence of fetal behavioural states ('sleep-wake' cycles) in the third trimester and, in the neonatal period, continuity of poor behavioural state organization, immature EEG patterns and a high incidence of periodic breathing.

N2  - Little is known about the developmental profile of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the developing human brain, despite the potential importance of such information in understanding the pathogenesis of neurological abnormalities or increased risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to nicotine in utero. In this study, we determined the distribution of [3H]nicotine binding in the developing human brainstem by quantitative tissue autoradiography. In midgestational fetuses, [3H]nicotine binding sites were heavily concentrated in tegmental nuclei related to cardiopulmonary integration, arousal, attention, rapid eye movement sleep, and somatic motor control. Over the last half of gestation, [3H]nicotine binding decreased 60-70% in the tegmental nuclei, with a significant difference in binding between midgestation and early infancy. In contrast, there was essentially no change in [3H]nicotine binding in the major cerebellar-relay nuclei (principal inferior olive and griseum pontis) between the same time-points. Tritium quenching by increasing lipid (myelin) content in tissue sections did not account for the decreases in [3H]nicotine binding in tegmental nuclei. Based upon the high levels of [3H]nicotine binding at midgestation, combined with experimental data demonstrating trophic properties for acetylcholine, we postulate that nAChRs play a role in the development of the brainstem tegmentum during this period, and that once this role is fulfilled, nicotinic cholinergic binding decreases and remains low thereafter. Alternatively, nicotinic cholinergic receptors may be critical for other developmentally related functions and/or neurotransmission in the brainstem tegmentum at midgestation. The high levels of [3H]nicotine binding in the brainstem tegmentum at midgestation and its rapidly changing profile over late gestation further suggest that mid-to-late gestation is a developmental period during which this region is likely to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nicotine in maternal cigarette smoke. The baseline information provided in this study is potentially relevant towards understanding attention deficits and risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to cigarette smoke in utero.

N2  - Chronically prepared near-term fetal lambs (129-133 days gestation) were exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and each head was rigidly connected to a stereotaxic frame. Multibarrel glass electrodes were inserted into the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) during fetal breathing (FB) in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Of a total of 223 neurons, it was possible to record only 6 neurons for which firing amplitude did not change during the transition from REM to non-REM (NREM) sleep. The burst frequency, number of spikes per breath, and association with diaphragmatic activity were variable, with phasic activity preceding FB or disappearing and reappearing during FB. During the transition from REM to NREM sleep, phasic neuronal activity ceased, became tonic, and finally ceased altogether. L-Glutamate increased the number of spikes per breath and caused previous phasic activity to reappear but in NREM sleep produced only tonic activity. We conclude that during REM sleep the fetal respiratory neurons in the region of the NTS are to a large degree influenced by nonrespiratory REM sleep factors and that quiescence of respiratory neurons during NREM sleep is due to the lack of phasic input rather than to direct inhibition. Inhibition of FB during NREM sleep must occur upstream of the NTS neuron.

N2  - In order to understand the mechanisms which regulate and control basal heart rate as well as heart rate variability in the fetus, a number of studies have been conducted in fetal animals. Information has been obtained largely from fetal sheep during the last third of gestation, although recently investigators have directed their attention to earlier gestations, such as 80-90 days, with term in the sheep being 145 days. A few studies have focused on the non-human primate fetus for additional information. A variety of techniques has been utilized experimentally to produce hypoxemia and/or acidemia in fetal animals, including umbilical cord compression, maternal hypoxemia, and uterine blood flow restrictions. Evidence to date would indicate that both chemoreceptors and baroreceptors are present and active in the late gestation sheep fetus, giving rise to acute changes in fetal heart rate (FHR) with changes in oxygenation. Factors which must be considered in interpreting alterations in both mean FHR and FHR variability in response to a decrease in oxygenation include: 1) the mechanism giving rise to decrease in oxygen delivery, 2) the duration of hypoxemia and/or asphyxia, 3) the effect of sleep states and behavioural activity, 4) gestational age, and 5) condition of the fetus prior to the decrease in oxygen delivery. Heart rate variability in fetal sheep has been studied extensively and it has been shown that accelerations in the FHR are closely associated with skeletal muscle activity much like the human fetus, suggesting similar control mechanisms in the 2 species. The late gestation sheep fetus consistently and reliably experiences an increase in heart rate variability with acute hypoxemia with and without acidemia until severe acidosis develops. In contrast, the hypoxemic human fetus, prior to labour, generally exhibits a decrease in FHR variability. The explanation for this apparent species difference remains unclear.

N2  - We examined 96 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation to determine the relationship between the duration of the active state following a single vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) and the time spent in prestimulus state 1F, i.e. quiet sleep (QS). All fetuses were observed to enter state 1F prior to testing. After remaining in this state for 3 min, each fetus was randomized into one of three groups: no stimulation (Group I, N=32); a single 1-s VAS delivered after 3-5 min of QS (Group II, N= 33); and a single 1-s VAS delivered after 18-20 min of QS (Group III, N=31). Fetuses in Groups I, II, and III were otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable. Heart rate and eye and body movements were monitored until the fetus either returned to state 1F and remained in that state for 3 min or did not return to state 1F within 60 min. Of the 64 fetuses who were stimulated, 62 responded, indicating that there was no effect of prestimulus state duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Fetuses stimulated after 18-20 min of QS behaved similarly to fetuses who entered an active period spontaneously. However, fetuses who were in QS for 3-5 min remained in a more active state for a significantly shorter length of time than did fetuses who either had been in QS for 18-20 min before VAS (17.9 min vs. 38.0 min, P=0.0002) or had entered an active period spontaneously (17.9 min vs. 41.1 min, P=0.0001); 10 (30.3%) fetuses in Group II and two (6.5%) fetuses in Group III were active for ≤3 min following VAS (P=0.015). Even when the 10 fetuses in Group II who did not make a state change were excluded from analysis, the mean duration of the active period was significantly less for Group II fetuses than for fetuses in either Groups I (P=0.0010) or III (P=0.0058). We conclude that, for fetuses who were otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable at the time of stimulation, the nature of the behavioural response following a single VAS was dependent upon the prestimulus duration of state 1F.

N2  - Use of addicting drugs among women during pregnancy exposes newborns to potentially serious disorders. A group of symptoms referred to as neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NWS) may occur in infants born to mothers addicted to certain drugs because, at birth, the infants suddenly are cut off from the drug supply. Classes of drugs that cause NWS are those that produce addiction in adults, including the opioids (heroin, methadone, morphine), barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Many of the manifestations of NWS occur regardless of the class of drug, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and failure to gain weight. The fact that these symptoms are nonspecific makes it difficult to identify NWS unless it is specifically looked for. The onset, duration, and severity of the disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used, time and amount of mother's last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from the newborn. Pharmacologic intervention may be required to control severe symptoms and signs. The most common drugs used to modify withdrawal are phenobarbital, paregoric, chlorpromazine, and diazepam. Treatment is complicated by conflicting information on the effectiveness of various agents.

N2  - In a cross-sectional epidemiological study of headache disorders information on precipitating factors, age at onset, influence of menstruation and pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives was collected. The presence of migraine and tension-type headache was ascertained by a clinical interview and examination using the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society. The prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was also analysed in relation to variables of lifestyle: physical activity, smoking, consumption of coffee, alcohol intake and sleep pattern. In both migraine and tension-type headache, the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental tension. Other common precipitants were alcohol, weather changes and menstruation. Disappearance or substantial improvement of the headache during pregnancy was more frequent in migraineurs than in tension-type headache sufferers. The age at onset of both migraine and tension-type headache differs between men and women. Female hormones may be an important factor responsible for the sex difference of headache disorders. The level of physical activity showed no association with migraine, but a significantly higher prevalence of tension-type headache in men with exclusively sedentary activity emerged. Smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption showed no significant associations with the headache disorders. Sleep pattern was significantly associated with migraine and tension-type headache in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, migraine and tension-type headache seem to be different with regard to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors.

N2  - Objective: Our aim was to perform a longitudinal cohort study of 20 normal third-trimester pregnancies to observe whether the level of long-term maternal caffeine ingestion influenced fetal behavior. Study design: By dietary history 10 normal pregnant women were categorized as 'high' caffeine consumers (> 500 mg/day, group H) and 10 as 'low' caffeine consumers (< 200mg/day, group L). Between 30 and 40 weeks biweekly 2-hour continuous ultrasonographic observations of fetal heart rate; breathing activity; and eye, trunk, and extremity movements were conducted. Maternal caffeine levels were determined at each session, and fetal states were identified and their duration quantified. Data were compared by analysis of variance by means of repeated measures or t tests. Results: When compared with group L fetuses, group H fetuses spent similar mean time in state 1F (quiet sleep), less mean time in state 2F (active sleep), and much greater mean time in state 4F (arousal). The mean time spent in no state decreased significantly in group L, was unchanged in group H, and was similar for both groups at term. Both groups had similar mean numbers of state changes at all gestational ages studied. Mean maternal serum caffeine levels in group H were always significantly higher than those in group L. Conclusion: Evolving fetal behavior may be influenced by the level of maternal caffeine consumption during the last trimester.

Study design: We measured uterine activity in 19 women divided into a control group (low risk for preterm labor, term delivery, n = 7), a group at high risk for preterm labor, term delivery (n = 6), and a group at high risk for preterm labor, preterm delivery (n = 6). Patients were hospitalized for 24 hours every 2 weeks from 26 weeks' gestation until delivery. Uterine activity was measured continuously by external tocodynamometer. Results: Patients delivering at term demonstrated a nocturnal surge (4 to 7 AM) in uterine activity the last 80 days before delivery (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). Patients delivered preterm showed an initial nocturnal surge of uterine activity similar to those delivered at term, but this disappeared 24 days before delivery (p > 0.05, analysis of variance). Conclusion: Uterine activity nocturnal surges normally precede term delivery. These surges are lost in women who deliver prematurely.

N2  - During the third trimester of pregnancy there is a gradual development of fetal behavioral states. These states are distinct and discontinuous modes of neural activity; they reflect a certain degree of maturity and or integrity of the fetal brain and are homologous with those seen in newborn infants. Abnormal state development has been found in growth retarded fetuses and in fetuses of women with type-1 diabetes. Behavioral state organization is not easily influenced by external factors and most stimuli fail to induce a state change when the fetus is in quiet sleep (state 1F). However, fetuses do react to vibro-acoustic stimulation (VAS) with an electronic artificial larynx. This stimulus induces excessive fetal movements, prolonged tachycardia, disorganization of behavioral states, and state transitions normally not seen in healthy fetuses. The backgrounds for these excessive and unusual reactions are largely unknown. For the time being, it seems better not to use this device in clinical practice. In this review paper, data on the development of behavioral states and on fetal reactions to VAS are discussed.

N2  - A carbon dioxide hypersensitivity theory of panic has been posited. We hypothesize more broadly that a physiologic misinterpretation by a suffocation monitor misfires an evolved suffocation alarm system. This produces sudden respiratory distress followed swiftly by a brief hyperventilation, panic, and the urge to flee. Carbon dioxide hypersensitivity is seen as due to the deranged suffocation alarm monitor. If other indicators of potential suffocation provoke panic, this theoretical extension is supported. We broadly pursue this theory by examining Ondine's curse as the physiologic and pharmacologic converse of panic disorder, splitting panic in terms of symptomatology and challenge studies, reevaluating the role of hyperventilation, and reinterpreting the contagiousness of sighing and yawning, as well as mass hysteria. Further, the phenomena of panic during relaxation and sleep, late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, pregnancy, childbirth, pulmonary disease, separation anxiety, and treatment are used to test and illuminate the suffocation false alarm theory.

N2  - The number of aircraft movements in our society is increasing at a rapid rate. As a consequence the airspace is becoming more crowded, in particular in the vicinity of airports. As a consequence pollution (both air pollution and noise) near the airports increases. One solution to 'rush hours' in the airspace around airports is to spread the number of flights more evenly over time. This leads to more flights in the sensitive parts of the day: evening and night. This leads to community reaction and places the potential health effects of noise in the focus of societal attention. Human functioning is affected by noise in many ways. Effects of noise become detectable at a relatively low noise level, approx. 30 dB(A). Above which noise levels and under what conditions these effects become threatening to health is still largely unknown. This holds true for cardiovascular effects, mental health, mortality rates, medicine consumption, pregnancy, delivery and physical development. On some aspects more certainty exists. Night time noise when it causes people to wake up or prevents them from falling asleep, or when it frequently disturbs the structure of sleep below the waking level, can be detrimental to health. Both for awakening reactions and for annoyance, exposure-response relations are rather well established. Reading ability is hampered by noise. For the vegetative aspects, no clear and stable exposure-response relations are known at this moment. Hopefully this conference will fill in the gap.

N2  - Conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and heart rate may be misleading because they may be influenced, among other factors, by the patient's emotional state, position, diet, and external stimuli. All of these effects depend on the stages of a (mathematical) spectrum of rhythms and trends with age. The evaluation of predictable variability in blood pressure and heart rate by (a) the use of fully ambulatory devices, and (b) chronobiologic data processing, assesses early cardiovascular disease risk, e.g., in pregnancy. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized (circadian) characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. Blood pressure and heart rate were automatically monitored, with few interruptions, at 1-h intervals, each time for at least 48 consecutive h, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each single day of measurement by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian-rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian-rhythm-adjusted mean of blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an increase in blood pressure up to the day of delivery. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

N2  - It is well known that prenatal stress induces behavioral demasculinization and/or feminization in male offspring during adulthood. In this study, four different stressors were prenatally applied to rats. Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMd), or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for masculine and feminine sexual behavior. The results corroborated the fact that immobilization induced an impairment of masculine sexual behavior and a facilitation of feminine sexual behavior. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in masculine behavior when compared to intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REMd group displayed a major impairment of masculine behavior, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. On the other hand, water immersion seems to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of masculine behavior and did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. These results strongly suggest that changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress are linked to the nature of the stressor.

N2  - The physiology of parturition, and the pathophysiology of preterm labor, is incompletely understood. Infection of gestational tissues may account for a significant proportion of women who experience preterm labor. Interleukin- 8 (IL-8), or neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-1), is a potent chemotactic and activating factor for neutrophils and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory injury to skin and lung, but has yet to be described in gestational tissues. Cultured chorion and decidual cells obtained from normal human pregnancies were used to evaluate whether these tissues produce IL-8 basally and in response to inflammatory cytokines. As measured by specific IL-8 RIA, chorion and decidual cells produce IL-8 constitutively and in response to IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor. Cotreatment of chorion cells or decidual cells with IL-1β and actinomycin D or cycloheximide abrogated IL-8 production. Northern blot analysis confirmed that IL-1β stimulation of chorion and decidual cells resulted in increased IL-8 messenger RNA expression. Our data support the concept that a complex cytokine network between maternal and fetal gestational tissues exists, and that activation of inflammatory cytokine production in these tissues, including IL-8, likely contributes to the pathophysiology of infection- induced preterm labor.

N2  - The role of the fetal circadian pacemaker in the timing of birth was examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Two groups of pregnant hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus received daily intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (25 μg) on Days 9-15 of gestation. One group was injected with melatonin in the evening and the other in the morning. After the last set of injections, the animals were observed every hour until they gave birth. The timing of birth was not significantly different in the two groups, indicating that it was not affected by the melatonin injections. In contrast, the average phases of the pups' activity rhythms at weaning were significantly different in the two groups; this difference, approximately 10 h, indicated that the prenatal melatonin injections set the phases of the pups' circadian pacemakers. These results suggest that the fetal pacemaker is not involved in the timing of birth, since the pacemaker could be set to different phases without affecting this timing. In a separate study, time of birth and length of gestation were measured for heterozygous tau mutant pups, which express a circadian rhythm with a period of approximately 22 h. The results were compared with similar measurements obtained from a previous study of wild-type pups that express a circadian rhythm with a period of approximately 24 h. In both cases, the pups had been born to wild-type mothers. The timing of birth was similar in the two groups, indicating that the tau mutation does not influence the length of gestation or the time of day when birth occurs.

N2  - Objective: The objective was to determine whether large antepartum decelerations in fetal heart rate were associated with a switch from high to low fetal heart rate variation, suggestive of a change in sleep state, and whether the variation predicted outcome. Study design: Retrospective computerized analysis of 10,272 cardiotocographic records from 3998 patients at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation from four centers in England and Italy identified 140 good-quality records with large decelerations (more than 20 lost beats in area). Results: In otherwise normal cardiotocograms a large deceleration had a 40% chance of association with a downward change in fetal heart rate variation (69% when the deceleration exceeded 100 lost beats). The change resembled that occurring naturally with behavioral states. Uterine contractions did not always precede large decelerations. When they did, the lag time (peak of contraction - trough of deceleration) increased from 28 seconds (at 20 to 29 lost beats) to >100 seconds with increase in deceleration area. Of patients with large decelerations 76% had a normal vaginal delivery. Conclusion: Large decelerations near term, present in up to 5% of patients with otherwise normal fetal heart rate and variation, are often associated with a fall in fetal heart rate variation characteristic of a change in sleep state, without ominous significance.

N2  - The study objective was to investigate whether exclusively breast-fed infants could be taught to sleep through the night (defined from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM) during the first 8 weeks of life. The design was short-term longitudinal, from the last trimester of pregnancy until the eighth week after birth. Twenty- six first-time parents and their newborn were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (13 in each group). Treatment parents were instructed to offer a 'focal feed' (between 10 PM and 12 AM) to their infants every night, to gradually lengthen intervals between middle-of-the-night feeds by carrying out alternative caretaking behaviors (eg, reswaddling, diapering, walking), and to maximize environmental differences between day and nighttime. All parents kept 72-hour diaries of their infants' feeding and sleeping patterns every week from birth to 8 weeks of age and rated their infants' temperament at birth and at 8 weeks. By 3 weeks, treatment infants showed significantly longer sleep episodes at night. By 8 weeks 100% of treatment infants were sleeping through the night compared to 23% of control infants. Treatment infants were feeding less frequently at night but compensated for the relatively long nighttime interval without a feed by consuming more milk in the early morning. Milk intake for 24-hour periods did not differ between groups. Treatment infants were rated as more predictable on Bates' Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. It is concluded that parents can have a powerful influence on the development of their infants' sleep patterns. Frequent night waking in breast-fed infants often results in early termination of lactation. Parents can teach their breast- fed infants to lengthen their nighttime sleep bouts, making the continuation of breast-feeding easier for the new mother.

N2  - Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is age-dependent being rare prior to age 10, unusual prior to age 15, with a peak in the mid 20s. It has been suggested that the manifestation of MS is dependent upon having passed through the pubertal period. In the present communication, I propose that critical changes in pineal melatonin secretion, which occur in temporal relationship to the onset of puberty, are intimately related to the timing of onset of the clinical manifestations of MS. Specifically, it is suggested that the fall in melatonin secretion during the prepubertal period, which may disrupt pineal-mediated immunomodulation, may stimulate either the reactivation of the infective agent or increase the susceptibility to infection during the pubertal period. Similarly, the rapid fall in melatonin secretion just prior to delivery may account for the frequent occurrence of relapse in MS patients during the postpartum period. In contrast, pregnancy, which is associated with high melatonin concentrations, is often accompanied by remission of symptoms. Thus, the presence of high melatonin levels may provide a protective effect, while a decline in melatonin secretion may increase the risk for the development and exacerbation of the disease. The melatonin hypothesis of MS may explain other epidemiological and clinical phenomena associated with the disease such as the low incidence of MS in the black African and American populations, the inverse correlation with sun light and geomagnetic field exposure, the occurrence of relapses in relation to seasonal changes and fluctuations in mood, and the association of MS with affective illness and malignant disease. Therapeutically, this hypothesis implies that application of bright light therapy or the use of other major synchronizers of circadian rhythms such as sleep deprivation or application of external weak magnetic fields may be beneficial in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of relapses in the disease.

N2  - Several changes in maternal physiology may profoundly alter sleep, especially during late pregnancy. Any condition that causes maternal hypoxemia will be worsened during sleep, particularly in the supine position. Although high circulating levels of progesterone increase respiratory drive during sleep, in at least some women this protective mechanism is insufficient to prevent sleep-disordered breathing and hypoxemia. The true incidence of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy remains unknown. Although many women report sleep disturbance during pregnancy, those with severe snoring, observed irregular breathing with sleep, or excessive daytime somnolence should be referred for clinical polysomnography. With few data thus far available, nasal CPAP would appear to be the treatment of choice. Given the possible consequences of sleep apnea for fetal outcome, any significant sleep-disordered breathing is probably an indication for treatment.

Study design: Sleep quality was evaluated in nine women with preeclampsia and eight women with normal term pregnancy by means of questionnaires and by recording the nocturnal body movement activity with the static charge-sensitive bed. Results: Subjective sleep complaints were similar in both groups. The total movement time and the total frequency of body movements in bed were, however, significantly increased in the preeclamptic group. Conclusion: The study suggests that sleep is impaired in preeclamptic subjects.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are already present in the fetus. At a certain stage of pre-natal hypothalamic development (around 30 weeks of gestation) the fetus becomes responsive to maternal circadian signals. Moreover, recent studies showed that the fetal biological clock is able to generate circadian rhythms, as exemplified by the rhythms of body temperature and heart rate of pre-term babies in the absence of maternal or environmental entrainment factors. Pre-term babies that are deprived of maternal entrainment and kept under constant environmental conditions (e.g., continuous light) in the neonatal intensive care unit run the risk of developing a biological clock dysfunctioning. However, the fact should be acknowledged that at least in mice the development of the circadian pacemaker (i.e., SGN) does not depend on environmental influences (Davis and Menaker, 1981), although other data suggest that severe disruption of the maternal circadian rhythm indeed abolishes the circadian rhythm of the fetal SCN (Shibata and Moore, 1988). During aging and in particular in AD circadian rhythms are disturbed. These disturbances include phase advance and reduced period and amplitude, as well as an increased intradaily variability and a decreased interdaily stability of the rhythm. Among the factors underlying these changes the loss of SCN neurons seems to play a central role. Other contributory factors may be reduced amount of light, degenerative changes in the visual system and the level of activity and decreased melatonin.

N2  - Self-reported sleep disturbances and levels of vitality and fatigue were studied in a secondary analysis of 25 pregnant and 29 postpartum employed women. Results indicate that pregnant women have problems initiating and maintaining sleep, and postpartum women have problems maintaining sleep, but not falling asleep. The primary reason for midsleep awakenings was urinary frequency among the pregnant women, and child care responsibilities among the postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women who fell asleep easily, very few who felt highly energetic at work, and most who perceived a high level of fatigue during the past week. Even with these sleep disruptions, no differences occurred in the mean scores for perception of fatigue and vitality between the two groups. Clinicians can use these findings to educate women about some changes they may anticipate and how they might manage them during pregnancy and postpartum.

N2  - The neocortical ventricular zone is composed of a desynchronized population of proliferating cells. These cells give rise to neurons in the infragranular laminae of neocortex. The present study documents a diurnal rhythmicity of cell proliferation in the ventricular zone and examines the effects of ethanol on this biological clock. Pregnant rats were fed one of 3 diets. They were provided an ethanol-containing (6.7% v/v) liquid diet ad libitum between gestational day (G) 6 and G18, pair-fed an isocaloric liquid control diet, or fed chow and water. Throughout the experiments, the rats were fed either at 08.00 h (E.S.T.) or at 17.00 h (lights on 06.00 to 18.00 h). Rats were given a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on G17 at one point during a 24 h period (03.00, 06.00, 09.00 h, etc.). The fraction of ventricular cells that incorporated the BrdU was determined using quantitative immunohistochemical methods. Pair-fed control rats (fed at 08.00 or 17.00 h) consumed their food within 4 h of presentation. The ratio of cells passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle changed diurnally; the ratio was highest during the day (0.52 ± 0.01 at 12.00 h) and lowest during the night (0.40 ± 0.02 at 03.00 h). In contrast, the ethanol-fed rats grazed on their food throughout the dark cycle regardless of when the food was presented. The mean peak blood ethanol concentration was 142 ± 13 mg/dl during the dark phase and less than 25 mg/dl during the light phase. Prenatal exposure to ethanol eliminates the fetal circadian rhythm in cell proliferation (mean labeling index of 0.45 ± 0.03). This ethanol-induced alteration demonstrates the resiliency of the developing system; its ability to compensate for traumas that alter the epigenetic control of development.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine if dexamethasone alters myometrial responsiveness to oxytocin or oxytocin secretion. STUDY DESIGN: Studies were conducted in rhesus macaques (n = 6), between 144 and 148 days' gestation (term 167 days). The first study was conducted at 9 AM and repeated 36 hours later at 9 PM. At 9 AM the following morning a continuous maternal dexamethasone infusion (15 μg/kg/hr given intravenously) was initiated, and the study was repeated at 9 PM, 60 hours later. Four doses of oxytocin (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 pg/kg/min) were administered as 1-minute pulses every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. The number of contractions per pulse (contraction/pulse ratio) was used to determine differences in myometrial responsiveness. RESULTS: Before dexamethasone infusion there was a circadian rhythm in uterine activity with peak contractile events between 8 and 10 PM (p < 0.01), whereas during infusion the rhythm was ablated. At oxytocin dose 1, the 9 AM contraction/pulse ratio (0.3 ± 0.1) was lower than that for 9 PM (0.6 ± 0.2) and for 60 hours later (0.6 ± 0.1) (mean ± SE, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed at dose 2, whereas no differences in the contraction/pulse ratio were noted at dose 3. Basal plasma oxytocin concentrations were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment, whereas plasma estradiol and cortisol concentrations were reduced compared with control values (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is a differential sensitivity to oxytocin between morning and evening and (2) the dexamethasone-induced loss of the uterine contractile rhythm is not the result of a loss of myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin or to a suppression of plasma oxytocin concentrations.

N2  - Thirteen women in late stages of pregnancy underwent a polysomnographic study. Eight women (61%) complained of mild nocturnal back pain or back discomfort. Five women (39%) did not complain of nocturnal back pain. The two groups did not differ in total bed time, total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset (WASO). A significant decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an increase in stage 2 were observed in the pain group. The same group had a statistically significant decrease in the basal O2 saturation level. The pain group also spent a longer time sleeping in the supine position. We hypothesize that a prolonged stay in the supine position leads to obstruction of the vena cava. In the presence of inadequate collateral circulation, increased pressure and venostasis in combination with a decrease in basal oxygen saturation may lead to hypoxemia, compromise the metabolic supply of the neural structures, and result in pain. It appears, therefore, that the vascular system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pain. The role played by the disturbed sleep architecture in the production of pain remains to be established. It is possible that the changes observed in sleep architecture result from pain rather than contribute to pain production.

N2  - Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much of the abuse was "submerged" until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, "It has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first." Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as "19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours." Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League "extremely helpful and supportive" during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she "did not feel safe enough" with the obstetrician and nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and "incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position." We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, "I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped."

N2  - Unlike other pituitary hormones, PRL is under tonic inhibition by the hypothalamus by way of the PRL inhibitory factor, dopamine. GAP and GABA may also be inhibitory. PRL-releasing factors include TRH and VIP and possibly others. Circulating PRL is predominantly monomeric, although some patients with hyperprolactinemia appear to have increased quantities of the less biologically active polymeric forms. PRL is secreted episodically, with an increase in the amplitude of the secretory pulses with sleep. A transitory increase also occurs in response to the protein component of meals. Basal PRL levels increase in response to the hormonal milieu of pregnancy, and suckling postpartum triggers PRL release. Pathologic increases of PRL owing to hypothalamic dysregulation occur with a variety of medications, including the neuroleptics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, methyldopa, reserpine and verapamil, abuse of opiates and cocaine, renal insufficiency, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, neurogenic stimulation, and idiopathically. Hyperprolactinemia also may occur from structural lesions of the stalk and hypothalamus, which cause disinhibition with or without maintenance of PRF activity, ectopic neoplasm production, and, most commonly, from prolactinomas. Diagnostic testing consists of routine chemistry and thyroid testing and imaging with MRI or CT. Dopamine agonists are the freatment of choice of prolactinomas of all sizes. Transsphenoidal surgery is an alternative for the patient who does not respond to medical therapy or who wishes definitive tumor removal, realizing that long-term cure is achieved in only 50% to 60% of patients with microadenomas and a much lower number in those with macroadenomas. Radiotherapy is reserved for patients who do respond to either medical or surgical treatment. Patients wishing to become pregnant usually are treated with bromocriptine, although prepregnancy surgical debulking may be advisable for those with large macroadenomas to reduce problems with tumor enlargement.

N2  - We developed a new method to monitor fetal medullary respiratory neurons utilizing a two-stage approach. At 129-133 days of gestation, sheep were anesthetized, and a window was placed over the area of the fourth ventricle. After a recovery period of 3-5 days, the fetus was exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and the head was connected rigidly to a stereotaxic frame. Microelectrodes were inserted into the area of the nucleus tractus solitarius during rapid-eye-movement sleep, and extracellular recordings of 223 respiratory neurons were analyzed: 76% were inspiratory, 9% expiratory, and 15% phase spanning, as classified by visual and computer correlation to diaphragmatic activity. More detailed analysis of 100 neurons was done to assess the respiratory component (η2) by use of a modification of the method developed by Orem and Dick (J. Neurophysiol. 50: 1098-1107, 1983). With use of cohorts of 25 breaths, fetal respiratory neurons were found to frequently change their phase relationship to diaphragmatic activity. The η2 statistic of fetal respiratory neurons was not a stable characteristic but changed over time. This could be a reflection of an immature central respiratory system before birth or the lack of major sensory inputs.

N2  - In summary, although the basic mechanisms involved in the control of breathing during fetal and neonatal life are similar to those investigated more extensively in adult subjects, there are some aspects that make this control unique at this age. First, sleep seems to have a very profound effect during this period of life, particularly in the fetus, in which breathing is allowed to occur only during REM sleep. Second, in utero breathing activity is present since early gestation and without apparent reason, since it is not responsible for gas exchange. Being the lung of the fetus, the placenta is responsible for gas exchange. The purpose of fetal breathing must therefore be discovered. Third, the discovery of fetal breathing is probably the most exciting contribution made in this area during the last 50 years. To learn why this episodic breathing in utero becomes continuous after birth is the major challenge of the moment. Trying to understand this change at birth may result in the discovery of key mediators that are at the heart of the mechanism controlling breathing in general.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to measure central nervous system insult from prenatal phenobarbital by quantified electroencephalographic evaluation of mature rat offspring. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four adult female rats were given phenobarbital as 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day subcutaneously between 9 and 10 AM for 28 days before breeding and throughout gestation. The electroencephalograms of 90-day-old offspring were sampled over 24 hours and converted to the power spectra. RESULTS: Female offspring exposed prenatally to 20 mg and males exposed prenatally to 40 mg displayed an increase in delta and a decrease in alpha and middle-beta waveform activities. Females exposed prenatally to 40 mg and males exposed prenatally to 60 mg displayed decreases in delta, theta, alpha, and middle-beta activities. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal phenobarbital exposure produced dose- and sex-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram of mature offspring consistent with a generalized deficit in the neuronal synchronization mechanisms that are critical for normal sleep and learning.

N2  - The general pharmacological profile of 7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4(1H)-quinolone (BTS 53 554, CAS 76568-68-8), the main metabolite of a new vasodilator, flosequinan (BTS 49 465), was investigated. 1. The central nervous system: BTS 53 554 at the dose of 30 mg/kg i.v. caused an increase in respiratory rate and a sedation in general behavior in rats. The drug also inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing and slightly decreased normal body temperature in mice. However, the drug at the doses up to 30 mg/kg i.v. had little effect on the spontaneous movement, hexobarbital-induced hypnosis, reserpine-induced hypothermia and motor coordination in mice. The drug showed neither anticonvulsant nor analgesic actions in mice. Furthermore, it had no effect on the spontaneous EEG, sleep-wakefulness cycle and EEG arousal response in rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg intravenously. 2. The somatic nervous system: BTS 53 554 induced no muscle relaxation in mice and exerted no local anesthetic action in guinea pigs by corneal reflex method. In addition, it had little effect on the neuromuscular transmission in cats. 3. The autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: BTS 53 554 showed no effect on the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in cats. In isolated smooth muscles, at doses up to 10-3 mol/l it showed little effect on the acetylcholine- or barium chloride-induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum, norepinephrine-induced contraction of rat vas deferens or oxytocin-induced contraction of nonpregnant rat uterus. However, it inhibited non-competitively norepinephrine-induced contraction of isolated rat aorta at 10-4 mol/l or more and serotonin-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus at 3 x 10-4 mol/l or more. In the isolated guinea-pig ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the histamine-induced maximal contraction at 10-3 mol/l. These results suggest BTS 53 554 had no specific effect on norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine or histamine. The drug relaxed isolated guinea-pig trachea at 3 x 10-5 mol/l or more and inhibited the spontaneous movement of isolated pregnant rat uterus at 10-4 mol/l or more, although these actions were extremely weaker than those of isoproterenol (isoprenaline). BTS 53 554 also showed a slight inhibition of uterus movement in anesthetized rats at 30 mg/kg intravenously. 4. The digestive system: BTS 53 554 tended to inhibit the gastrointestinal propulsion in mice and showed a slight inhibition of gastric and intestinal motilities in rats at 10 mg/kg intravenously. In isolated rabbit ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the spontaneous movement at 3 x 10-3 mol/l. For the gastric secretion in rats, BTS 53 554 at 30 mg/kg i.v. tended to inhibit the secretion, however, the drug increased the pancreatic juice secretion in dogs at 3 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. It showed no effect on the bile secretion in dogs. 5. Other properties: BTS 53 554 at 30 mg/kg i.v. decreased the urine volume and urinary excretion of electrolytes (Na+ and Cl-)in rats. However, it had little effect on the carrageenin-induced edema and the blood coagulation system and did not show hemolytic and local irritative actions. These results suggested BTS 53 554 had little effect on the central and peripheral nervous systems, digestive system and peripheral organs except for its vascular and tracheal smooth muscle relaxant actions and secreto-motor activity on pancreatic juice.

N2  - To investigate the effects of bilateral cervical vagotomy on arousal and breathing responses, we studied eight sham-operated and eight chronically instrumented unanesthetized vagotomized sheep fetuses between 136 and 144 days of gestation (term ~147 days). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, blood pressure, pH, and blood gas tensions. In a randomized order, fetal lungs were distended with four different O2 concentrations: 0 (100% N2), 21, 50, and 100% at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cmH2O via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. Under control conditions, inspiratory time and the duration of the single longest breathing episode decreased from 598 ± 99 (SD) ms and 24 ± 10 min in sham group to 393 ± 162 ms and 11.0 + 3.0 min in vagotomized group (P = 0.04 and 0.033), respectively. In response to lung distension with 100% N2, breathing time decreased from 44 ± 17 to 20 ± 18% (P = 0.045) in sham- operated fetuses, whereas it remained unchanged in the vagotomized group. In response to 100% O2, fetal arterial PO2 increased in five of eight fetuses sham-operated from 18.2 ± 5.1 to 227 + 45 Torr (P < 0.0001) and in six of eight vagotomized fetuses from 18.5 ± 4.4 to 172 ± 39 Torr (P < 0.001). Although arousal was observed in all oxygenated fetuses at the onset of breathing, the duration of arousal was markedly attenuated in vagotomized fetuses (14 ± 10 vs. 46 ± 29 min in sham group; P - 0.024). Frequency and amplitude of breathing and respiratory output (frequency x amplitude) increased only in sham group (P = 0.02, 0.004, and 0.0002, respectively). We conclude that in response to lung distension and oxygenation, arousal and stimulation of breathing during active and quiet sleep are critically dependent on intact vagal nerves.

N2  - Objective: Previous studies have shown that twins, when monitored simultaneously, show a remarkably high incidence of coincident fetal heart rate accelerations (about 58%). The current study examines synchrony of behavior patterns in twins. Study design: We examined 37 fetal monitor strips from 15 sets of twins with simultaneous fetal heart rate and fetal movement recorded by means of Doppler techniques (Toitu MT-430 fetal actocardiograph). The strips were analyzed for coincidence of fetal heart rate accelerations and fetal movement episodes and then conceptually for synchrony of fetal behavior patterns on the basis of descriptions of behavioral states by Prechtl. Results: Thirty-six percent of fetal heart rate accelerations were found to be simultaneous. Forty-three percent of movement epochs were considered simultaneous. We found that twins exhibited synchronous behavior patterns (basically sleep or awake state) 94.7% of the time. Conclusion: Twin-twin interactions are more consistently related than suspected when observation is limited to heart rate alone, and the synchrony and role of fetal behavior states must be considered when twin interactions and behavior are studied.

N2  - We conducted a longitudinal polysomnographic study in five healthy primiparous subjects, whose sleep was first recorded between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation, then every 2 months until parturition and at 1 month postpartum. The first 6 hours of sleep were used for statistical analysis. In contrast to previous studies, we found no reduction in stage 4 sleep with pregnancy. Slow-wave sleep (comprising stages 3 and 4), was significantly higher at 27-39 weeks of gestation than at 8-16 weeks, as predicted by the restorative theory of sleep. There was no significant difference in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time. When compared to a group of normal ovulating women, however, REM sleep time decreased during the last two months of pregnancy and, although there was no change in sleep onset latency, the time spent awake during the first six hours of sleep was increased. Future research into the effects of cortisol and progesterone is indicated.

N2  - Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep studies were obtained on healthy full-term and preterm infants at matched conceptional ages. Studies were recorded under environmentally controlled conditions. Eighteen healthy preterm infants were matched to 18 full-term infants based on conceptional age, sex, race and socioeconomic class. The initial 3 hours of a 12-hour recording were simultaneously recorded on paper and computer. The visually scored data based on the paper recordings for sleep architecture and continuity measures were studied. Differences in each sleep organization for the preterm infants included the following: a longer ultradian sleep cycle (70 minutes vs. 53 minutes, p = 0.02) was noted. More abundant trace alternant (34% vs. 28%, p = 0.02) and less abundant low-voltage irregular active sleep (13% vs. 17%, p = 0.05) were noted. Although no differences were observed for sleep latency and efficiency, the preterm infants had fewer numbers and shorter durations of arousals, fewer body movements and rapid eye movement (REM) (p < 0.01), particularly during quiet sleep. The extrauterine experience or the earlier birth of the preterm infant may influence specific sleep architecture and continuity measures when compared with the sleep of full-term infants who experienced a complete intrauterine gestation.

N2  - 1. This study examines the effect of chronic cold exposure during pregnancy, induced by winter shearing twin-bearing ewes 4 weeks before predicted lambing date, on O2 consumption and CO2 production during non-rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in lambs maintained for at least 1 h at warm (28-18°C) and cold (14-5°C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. This was combined with measurement of the thermogenic activity (GDP binding to uncoupling protein in mitochondrial preparations) of perirenal adipose tissue from lambs immediately after birth and at 33 days of age. 2. Lambs born from shorn (cold-exposed) ewes were 15% heavier (P < 0.01) and possessed 21% (P < 0.01) more perirenal adipose tissue that contained 40% more protein and mitochondrial protein than unshorn (P < 0.05) controls. Total GDP binding in perirenal adipose tissue was 40% greater (P < 0.05) in lambs born from shorn ewes but there was no difference in lipid content of this tissue between the two groups. 3. At 1 day of age, lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited a 16% higher (P < 0.05) rate of O2 consumption (per kilogram bodyweight) at the warm temperature and a 40% greater metabolic response to the cold ambient temperature. All lambs born from shorn ewes responded to cold exposure without shivering (i.e. via non-shivering thermogenesis) whilst shivering was measured in four out of seven lambs in the unshorn group. These differences had disappeared by 4 days of age as a result of a 25% increased (P < 0.01) rate of O2 consumption in the warm in lambs born from unshorn ewes and a 20% decrease (P < 0.05) in the response to the cold in lambs from shorn ewes. Shivering during cold exposure was measured in six out of nine lambs born from shorn ewes indicating a rapid alteration in thermoregulatory responses to cold during the first few days of life. 4. The levels of GDP binding and mitochondrial protein in perirenal adipose tissue fell by one-third in both groups of lambs during the first 33 days of life whereas lipid content either increased or was unchanged. This indicated that brown adipose tissue (BAT) was developing the characteristics of white adipose tissue. In lambs aged 33 days that were born from shorn ewes, perirenal adipose tissue weighed 88% more (P < 0.01), contained more (P < 0.05) protein and lipid, and the level of total GDP binding to mitochondrial protein was 100% greater than in lambs born from unshorn ewes. There were no differences at this age between the two groups of lambs in metabolic rate but four out of eight lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited shivering responses to a cold ambient temperature compared with seven out of eight in the unshorn group. 5. It is concluded that maternal cold exposure during late pregnancy stimulates fetal growth and the thermogenic activity of BAT in the neonatal lamb. At 1 day of age this alternation in BAT was associated with an increased metabolic response to cold achieved entirely via non-shivering thermogenesis while longer term consequences were apparent in the measurement of colonic temperature, number of lambs exhibiting shivering at cold temperatures and perirenal fat deposition.

N2  - The existence of an activatable dopamine system within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the site of a biological clock, was investigated in rats during fetal life. In situ hybridization studies revealed that D1-dopamine receptor mRNA was highly expressed in the fetal SCN and not expressed in other hypothalamic regions. Cocaine injected into pregnant rats or directly into rat fetuses on day 20 of gestation selectively activated c-fos gene expression in the fetal SCN; cocaine did not induce c- fos expression elsewhere in the fetal brain or in the maternal SCN. This cocaine-induced activation of c-fos expression in fetal SCN was mediated in part through D1-dopamine receptors, as the cocaine-induced activation was partially blocked by the D1-dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390. In addition, the selective D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 induced high levels of c-fos expression in the fetal SCN. The presence of an activatable dopamine system within the fetal SCN provides a mechanism through which maternal signals could entrain the fetal biological clock and through which maternally administered psychotropic drugs could alter normal development of the circadian timing system.

N2  - Obstetric anesthesia has been the object of public interest and patient advocacy from its introduction in the 1840s to the present. Early arguments concerned the significance of pain in childbearing and became a popular issue involving physicians, clergymen, and journalists. The first obstetric anesthesia, ether, given in the United States was administered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1847. For the next several decades general anesthesia was the only feasible means of relieving labor pain. At the turn of the century a combination of scopolamine and morphine was introduced in the United States by a popular women's magazine; the National Twilight Sleep Association was launched. After the decline of this movement, the 'natural' childbirth method came into national prominence. In spite of their differing pharmacologic characteristics, there are sociologic parallels between the patient advocacy of Twilight Sleep and that of psychoprophylaxis. This study focuses on the public perception of these movements, which were begun by physicians and subsequently endorsed by militant lay groups.

N2  - The circadian changes in serum estriol concentration in the case of gestosis (at 30-36 weeks gestation) and intra-uterine growth retardation-IUGR (at 28-36 weeks) were examined. The control group consisted of pregnant patients without placental insufficiency at 26-34 weeks gestation. No circadian rhythms of estriol secretion was found in patients with gestosis and IUGR, whereas such a rhythm was confirmed in normal pregnancies. The evaluation of circadian changes in estriol concentration in the third trimester of gestation may be useful when diagnosing chronic placenta insufficiency.

N2  - Mechanisms for the control of episodic fetal breathing movements or the onset of continuous breathing at birth remain unknown. Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce arousal and continuous breathing. To investigate 1) the threshold range of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) for the onset of arousal and breathing and 2) the graded response of breathing to various levels of PaO2, we studied 10 fetal sheep between 135 and 142 d of gestation (term = 147 ± 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions. PaO2 threshold was determined through an indwelling O2 sensor catheter. Fetal lungs were distended at a continuous positive airway pressure of 40 cm H2O with 100% N2 or with O2 ranging from 40 to 100% via an in situ endotracheal tube. At the onset of arousal (n = 10), PaO2, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and Hb O2 saturation increased from control values of 21.7 ± 0.75 torr (2.9 ± 0.09 kPa), 41.8 ± 1.1 torr (5.47 ± 0.15 kPa), and 52.9 ± 2.6% to 65.6 ± 9.6 torr (8.74 ± 1.28 kPa), 46.9 ± 1.3 torr (6.25 ± 0.17 kPa), and 92.9 ± 2.06%, respectively, whereas the pH decreased from 7.31 ± 0.006 to 7.27 ± 0.009 (mean ± SEM; p = 0.001, 0.04, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively). Seven of 10 fetuses breathed continuously. In these fetuses, PaO2 and arterial carbon dioxide tension further increased and pH decreased; however, no further significant increase in Hb O2 saturation was observed. Breathing stopped at a PaO2 of 38.5 ± 9.5 torr (5.1 ± 1.3 kPa) but could be restarted by increasing the PaO2. In response to an increase in fetal PaO2 (30-60 torr; 4-8 kPa), amplitude of breathing and total respiratory output significantly increased from the control values. Further increases in PaO2 or Hb O2 saturation did not significantly affect the respiratory output. Hb O2 saturation and arterial pH had the most confounding effects on frequency and amplitude of breathing, respectively. Among the various sleep states, arousal had the most profound effects on respiratory output. We conclude that 1) very high levels of PaO2 are not necessary to initiate arousal and continuous breathing and 2) further increments in Hb O2 saturation above the threshold level have no significant effect on breathing responses.

N2  - The development of circadian rhythms and the neuronal mechanisms underlying their generation (particularly the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus) were reviewed. Based on perinatal animal studies and data from human foetuses and/or preterm infants it was concluded that human circadian rhythms are present as early as at 30 weeks of gestation. The significance of the mother and/or the environment regarding the entrainment of the 'endogenous' foetal biological clock was emphasized.

N2  - New Zealand's high mortality rate from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prompted the development of the New Zealand Cot Death Study. A report of the analysis of the data from the first year has been published. This report now gives the major identified risk factors from the full 3 year data set. In this case-control study there were 485 infants who died from SIDS in the post-neonatal age group, and 1800 control infants, who were a representative sample of all hospital births in the study region. Obstetric records were examined and parental interviews were completed in 97.5% and 86.9% of subjects, respectively. As expected many risk factors for SIDS were confirmed including: lower socio-economic status, unmarried mother, young mother, younger school-leaving age of mother, younger age of mother at first pregnancy, late attendance at antenatal clinic, non-attendance at antenatal classes, Maori, greater number of previous pregnancies, the further south the domicile, winter, low birthweight, short gestation, male infant and admission to a special care baby unit. In addition, however, we identified four risk factors that are potentially amenable to modification. These were the prone sleeping position of the baby (odds ratio (OR) = 3.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.91, 4.70); bed sharing (OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 2.02, 3.62); maternal smoking of 1-9 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.47; 95% CI = 2.50, 4.83), 10-19 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.94; 95% CI = 2.87, 5.41) or more than 20 cigarettes per day (OR = 5.90; 95% CI = 4.20, 8.31); and not breast feeding (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.88, 3.04). After controlling for all of the above variables, the relative risks associated with prone sleeping position (OR = 4.84), sharing bed (OR = 2.02), maternal smoking (OR = 1.79) and not breast feeding (OR = 1.89) were still statistically significant. Population-attributable risk calculations suggest that these four risk factors may account for 82% of deaths from SIDS. The SIDS mortality rate may fall to less than 0.7/1000 live births if all parents stop putting their infants down to sleep in the prone position, do not sleep with their baby, do not smoke, and breast feed their infants.

N2  - Fetal exposure to cocaine is associated with increased perinatal cardiac risk. Because cocaine promotes adrenergic actions, we assessed the effects of cocaine on development of cardiac adrenergic receptors and cell signaling in the rat. Pregnant rats were given 30 mg/kg s.c. of cocaine from gestational day 8 through 20 and the ontogenetic patterns of adrenergic receptor subtypes and their linkage to control of adenylate cyclase activity were assessed from birth to adulthood. Neonatal overexpression of α2-receptors is required for maintenance of cardiac conduction during the hypoxia associated with birth or sleep apnea, and these receptors were present equally in both control and cocaine-exposed animals; the ontogenetic disappearance of α2-receptors also was unaffected by drug exposure. Similarly, the acquisition of cardiac β- adrenergic receptors, their link to adenylate cyclase activity, and the development of adenylate cyclase catalytic units (assessed with forskolin) remained essentially normal despite fetal cocaine exposure. These results suggest that adverse effects on perinatal cardiac function associated with human maternal cocaine abuse either result from indirect actions of cocaine, such as cell damage caused by hypoxia/ischemia, or alternatively from primary contributions of covariables known to affect cardiac development, such as cigarette smoking.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - To evaluate the incidence and predisposing factors of severe hypoglycemia (SH) in pregnant women with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - SH (impairment of consciousness due to hypoglycemia subsequently treated with glucagon or i.v. glucose) was recorded in all pregnant type I diabetic women (n = 77) who attended our pregnancy clinic during 85 pregnancies from 1986 to 1990. RESULTS - Ninety- four SHs were reported during 35 pregnancies. Of 94 SHs, 84% occurred before the 20th gestational wk (median 12th wk) and 77% during sleep. In the group with SH, there was no permanent maternal sequelae, and there was a favorable fetal outcome (no perinatal death and no congenital malformation). Mean HbA(1c) values were not different between the group with and without SH for the first half (6.4 ± 1.1 vs. 6.3 ± 0.9%) and 2nd half (5.4 ± 0.6 vs. 5.5 ± 0.7%) of pregnancy. The percentage of women with SH before pregnancy (51 vs. 28%, P < 0.05) and the incidence of SH patients before pregnancy (0.49 vs. 0.08 SH/patient/yr) was different between the group with and without SH. CONCLUSIONS - SH is frequent during pregnancies of type I diabetic women with near normoglycemia. The risk for SH is particularly pronounced during the first half of pregnancy and in women with a history of SH.

N2  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics of fetuses exposed and not exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were studied. FHR is considered to reflect central nervous system (CNS) integrity. Three intervals during pregnancy were investigated: 20, 32, and 38 weeks. At 32 and 38 weeks, FHR was studied in relation to quiet (C1F) and active (C2F) sleep periods. For each tracing, a baseline was determined and accelerations and decelerations were identified. To assess FHR variability, the long-term irregularity, interval difference and absolute beat-to-beat indexes, and the bandwidth were calculated for 30-s intervals between accelerations and decelerations. No marked differences were noted between study and control groups concerning basal FHR and the occurrence of accelerations. For FHR derived from the fetal ECG, all indexes of FHR variability and the bandwidth were lower for the study group as compared with the control group, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study shows that chronic prenatal exposure to AEDs does not seriously interfere with modulation of fetal heart rhythm by the CNS.

N2  - We observed fetal behavior by using three ultrasonic real-time scanners simultaneously in 30 normal pregnant women between 20 and 40 weeks of gestation and analyzed developmental changes in behavioral pattern focussing the attention on the characteristics of REM and non-REM sleep and wakeful state. The frequency of REM significantly increased with gestational age, and its occurrences formed a group in late pregnancy. REM and non-REM periods, which were defined as the phase with uninterrupted appearance of rapid eye movements and the phase without them over 3min, respectively, became clearly distinguishable between 28 and 31 weeks of gestation. The correlation between the occurrence of rapid eye movements and breathing movements was high after 27 weeks. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus.

N2  - Twelve women in their third trimester of pregnancy and 10 age-matched nonpregnant controls underwent complete polysomnography for one night in the laboratory. Seven of the original women returned for a second study 3-5 months postpartum. During late pregnancy, women showed increased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a lower sleep efficiency in comparison with the control group. The percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly decreased and the percentage of stage 1 significantly increased compared to the nonpregnant group. At 3-5 months postpartum, a significant reduction in WASO and increased sleep efficiency were noted. However, only a slight increase was noted in REM sleep during the postpartum period compared to the prepartum period. The most frequent sleep complaints in the pregnant group were restless sleep, low back pain, leg cramps and frightening dreams. In summary, in accordance with their complaints, women in their third trimester demonstrated polysomnographic patterns of sleep maintenance insomnia.

N2  - The circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase, E.C. 3.2.1.1. alpha-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) in the parotid glands of 25-day-old rats were studied under different experimental designs (fasting, reversed photoperiod, constant lighting conditions and treatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of fasted rats did not change. There were modifications in the rhythm of rats submitted to a reversed photoperiod or treated with reserpine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The rhythm was present, with changes in the acrophase, in parotids of rats kept during their gestation and postnatal life in constant light or dark. Results suggest that the circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase in parotid gland of young rats is endogenous, synchronized by the photoperiod, and with maternal coordination.

N2  - The effects of mating time and of LD cycles on the timing of birth and length of gestation were examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Hamsters maintained on 14L:10D cycles were mated for 2 h either in the evening or in the morning, and groups of hamsters mated in the morning were subjected to either a 6-h advance shift or a 6-h delay shift of the LD cycle on Days 5-14 of gestation. For the last 2 days of gestation the hamsters were kept in constant dim light and observed every hour to determine the time of birth. Hamsters mated in the evening gave birth an average of 4.8 h before those mated in the morning, and the hamsters subjected to an advance shift gave birth an average of 8.1 h before those subjected to delay shift. The results show that 80-100% of births occur during the subjective day on Day 16 of gestation and that the minimum duration of gestation is 15 days and 2 h. The regulation of birth appears to involve two processes, an interval timer related to the time of conception and a circadian rhythm that is governed by the LD cycle.

N2  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. To examine this hypothesis, the ontogeny of thermoregulation was measured in prenatal ethanol exposed offspring of mice selected for differences in alcohol sensitivity. Pregnant long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice were exposed to 3 or 4 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin twice per day from day 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Doses were given six hours apart via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow controls were included for both genotypes. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred strain. Offspring temperatures were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7 through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each day of testing compared to all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from controls. These results suggest a relatively steep dose-response curve for thermoregulatory deficits in LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol. Genetically-based alcohol sensitivity did not influence the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on this response.

N2  - Thirty female subjects examined in the first three months of pregnancy took part in the study. Ten of these suffered from severe gravidic hyperemesis, while twenty had a physiological pregnancy. All subjects with hyperemesis and six controls were subjected to measurement of cortisolaemia at the following times: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 4.00 so as to obtain the circadian curve of the hormone, measurement of T3 and T4 and of TSH. The Cattell test in form C was carried out in all patients. The results obtained evidenced a global increase in the production of cortisol in the group of hyperemetic women, with maintenance of the circadian rhythm. The Cattell test identified characteristic personality traits in the subjects suffering from hyperemesis compared to the controls.

N2  - Infants experiencing apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) have been reported to have elevated frequencies of periodic breathing and obstructive apnea when compared to presumably normal control groups. Whether these characteristics extend to the siblings of ALTE infants remains unknown. This study compared, retrospectively, the apnea indices of 13 first-born infants experiencing an ALTE with their subsequent asymptomatic siblings who had undergone polygraphic sleep apnea evaluations (including electrocardiogram, chest wall movements, expired CO2, and transcutaneous pulse oximetry). Gestation, birthweight, age at study, apnea and periodic breathing indices, and oxygen desaturations were compared. Regression analyses revealed that adjustments for gestational and postnatal age eliminated differences in apnea indices. ALTE infants and their subsequent siblings experienced similar rates of apnea. Neither group had elevated rates of prolonged central apneas (greater than 10 seconds duration) or periodic breathing (greater than 5% sleep time). Neither group had subsequent severe apneas. The use of polygraphic study and cardiac/apnea monitors in subsequent siblings of ALTE are unnecessary and should be considered only when there is parental disagreement.

N2  - This prospective study of 63 women was designed to investigate the relationship between sleep disruption prior to the birth, during labour and in the early postpartum period and the subsequent development of the postnatal blues. The results from this preliminary study suggest that two factors: (a) a night-time labour; and (b) a history of sleep disruption in the latter stages of pregnancy, may have aetiological importance in the development of postnatal blues. There was little evidence from this study to suggest that sleep disruption on the nights following the birth, the third sleep factor investigated, had any impact on the expression of the blues

N2  - The general pharmacological effects of felodipine, a novel calcium antagonist, were studied by comparing it with those of nifedipine. Felodipine and nifedipine at a high dose of 100 mg/kg, p.o. decreased the spontaneous motor activity in mice. Felodipine and nifedipine (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) had little effects on the body temperature, rotarod performance, muscle relaxation, pentetrazole-induced convulsions, reserpine-induced ptosis and tremorine-induced behaviors in various experimental animals. Felodipine and nifedipine (≥10 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently prolonged the hexobarbital sleeping time in mice. These drugs (≥30 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to decrease the duration of tonic extensive convulsion in maximum electro-shock of mice. Felodipine (≥30 mg/kg, p.o.) and nifedipine (100 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the metamphetamine-induced hypermotility in mice. These drugs (100 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to decrease the avoidance response rate and prolong the latent period of avoidance in rats. Felodipine and nifedipine (1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) induced no abnormal EEG pattern in cats. Both drugs, however, increased the arousal pattern on EEG and decreased slow wave deep sleep. Felodipine and nifedipine (30-100 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced or tended to reduce the acetic acid-induced writhing of mice. At a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg, p.o. felodipine and nifedipine lowered the blood pressure, reduced the heart rate, tended to increase the respiration rate and slightly prolonged Q-T interval in cats. Felodipine (≥10-10 g/ml) and nifedipine (≥10-9 g/ml) inhibited the spontaneous motility on isolated ileum in rabbits. Felodipine (≥10-12 g/ml) and nifedipine (≥10-11 g/ml) antagonized ACh, Hist and BaCl2-induced contraction of isolated ileum in guinea-pigs. Felodipine (≥10-8 g/ml) and nifedipine (≥10-7 g/ml) inhibited the serotonin-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus strip. Felodipine (≥10-9 g/ml) and nifedipine (10-8 g/ml) inhibited the NA-induced contraction of isolated rat vas deferens. Felodipine (10-10-10-9 g/ml) and nifedipine (10-9-10-7 g/ml) inhibited the spontaneous motility of isolated non-pregnant and pregnant uterus in rats. Both drugs (≥1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited spontaneous motility of both non-pregnant and pregnant rats uterus in situ and inhibited the gastric and intestinal motility of rabbits in situ. Felodipine had no effect on excretion of bile and on the stomach and duodenal mucosa in rats. Felodipine (1-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and nifedipine (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) suppressed the charcoal transportation of mice and the gastric secretion of rats. Felodipine and nifedipine (30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) did not affect the contraction of nictitating membrane in cats, the twitch tension of gastrocnemius muscle in rats, the twitch response of isolated rat diaphragm and the corneal reflex in guinea-pigs. In addition, these drugs had no effect on coagulation, osmotic fragility in blood cell, hemolysis and platelet aggregation in rats or rabbits. At a dose of 30 mg/kg, p.o. or more, these drugs increased the level of blood glucose and decreased the serum triglyceride level in rats. Felodipine and nifedipine (≥3 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently decreased the urinary excretion of Na+, K+ and Cl- in saline-loaded rats. Pelodipine (≥10 mg/kg, p.o.) and nifedipine (≥3 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased PSP excretion in rats. Felodipine (3 mg/kg, s.c. x 10 weeks) caused significant decreased in aortic atherosclerosis without reducing hypercholesterolemia in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In conclusion, these effects of felodipine were found to be qualitatively identical with those of nifedipine.

N2  - This case-controlled study examines some recently implicated risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (S.I.D.S.) in Irish infants. Irish S.I.D.S. infants are lighter at birth than controls (3463g) compared to (3542g) and boys out-number girls by a ratio of 1.3:1. S.I.D.S. infants are more frequently: breast-fed (42% vs 25%) and sleep in a location other than the parent's bedroom (54% vs 21%), but start solids at a similar age and appear not to be sicker prior to death than the control group. This study highlights the frequency of symptoms of possible ill-health (i.e. snuffles and being "chesty") in well infants during the first months of life with 32% of the control group having snuffles and 35% described as "chesty". In addition these symptoms are frequently treated with antibiotics with 31% of the control group having already received antibiotics by 2 months of age. A majority of S.I.D.S. infants were described as cold when found (52%) with 39% described as warm and 15% as sweaty. Obviously the recently implicated role of overheating may be relevant in the latter 15% of S.I.D.S. cases. In this series, 88% of infants had died by 6 months of age. Of the 97 parents of S.I.D.S. infants questioned, 78 had subsequently become pregnant by the time the study was conducted at an average time of 5 months post the S.I.D.S. event.

N2  - During evaluation for palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, seven pregnant women had documented ventricular tachycardia. Before pregnancy none had a history of significant cardiac disease or symptomatic arrhythmia. The tachycardia rate ranged from 117 to 250 beats/min and lasted up to 65 seconds. Arrhythmia evaluation in five of the patients suggested catecholamine-sensitive ventricular tachycardia. This diagnosis was supported by either a positive relation to exercise or isoproterenol infusion, suppression of arrhythmia by β-blockade or sleep, and lack of induction of arrhythmia by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart. The arrhythmias resolved in one patient soon after evaluation and in one other patient after 2 months of controlling therapy. Five other patients continued to receive therapy throughout pregnancy. Delivery was accomplished in all patients without significant maternal or neonatal complications.

N2  - While many aspects related to the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death remain unclear, the ultimate trigger event appears to be an acute regulatory disturbance of the cardiorespiratory neurons of the reticular formation of the brain stem. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that SIDS often occurs after infection of the upper respiratory tract. We present the case history of a 10-week old infant, where the respiratory pattern demonstrated highly pathological alterations induced by a mild infection of the upper airways, as confirmed by oxycardiorespirography. Oxycardiorespirography provides continuous recording of the respiration (transthoracic impedance) extending over several hours during sleep and during the critical phase just before going to sleep and waking up in relation to heart rate, partial oxygen pressure (measured transcutaneously) and nasal flow. The presented infant is a premature infant delivered in the 34th week of gestation according to Dubowitz (artificial respiration for 7 days due to hyalin membrane syndrome stage II). During infection periodic breathing was found to be 19,3% with partly severe hypoxemia. The longest single episode of apnea was 30 seconds. On the average, 5 episodes of bradycardia occurred (<100/min/measuring hour). An OCRG investigation performed at the age of 5 weeks and after disappearance of the infection at the age of 12 weeks yielded normal findings. This permits the conclusion that in our patient an infection of the upper airways may have induced a pathologic respiratory pattern, which could be a major trigger mechanism for sudden infant death.

N2  - Periodic breathing (PB) is a pattern of breathing that is frequently recognized in infants being studied for possible sleep apnea. Infants presenting to a sleep laboratory over a 3 1/2 -year period who had evidence on their initial study of prolonged (>15% of total sleep time) PB were prospectively studied in an effort to determine the significance of this pattern of breathing. Of the 331 infants studied, 40 demonstrated prolonged PB. Sixteen of these infants, who were of 37 weeks' gestation or greater at birth and did not receive pharmacologic therapy, were studied on at least two occasions (group 1). Of the remaining 24 infants, 11 were treated with methylxanthines by their attending physician (group 2), and 13 did not return for sequential studies (group 3). All infants who were of less than 37 weeks' gestation at birth were separately evaluated (group 4). For group 1, who were studied at a mean age of 5 postnatal weeks, there was a mean of 36.4% periodicity which decreased on the second study to 18.0%. By the fourth study, this had decreased to 9.2%. In group 2, there was a mean of 41.3% periodicity during the first study which decreased to 6.4% on the second study. Infants of group 3 had a mean of 31.4% PB on their initial study and the premature infants, group 4, had 30.1% PB. All infants showed a decrease in PB with sequential studies and no infant was known to have died of sudden infant death syndrome or any other disorder in the first year of life. For the majority of infants, the abnormal duration of PB was the only abnormality noted on the sleep recording. The results suggest that excess PB as an isolated abnormality on a sleep recording is not an indicator of subsequent risk. Additional longitudinal evaluations of this respiratory pattern are needed.

N2  - Eighteen non-pregnant woman complaining about insomnia were polysomnographically investigated for 3 nights with weekly intervals. They received placebo, 2 mg flunitrazepam or 10 mg zolpidem according to a cross-over double blind design. The patients were selected by general practitioners on the basis of subjective complaints. Zolpidem is a recently introduced short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic, binding to a subunit of the benzodiazepine 1 receptor. Flunitrazepam is a wellknown hypnotic, binding to both the benzodiazepine 1 and 2 receptor subtypes. Objective recording did not substantiate the subjective complaint of insomnia. Sleep patterns during placebo differed only little from that expected from age matched healthy persons. Both flunitrazepam and zolpidem significantly shortened sleep onset (5 min of continuous sleep beginning with NREM 1 sleep). The sleep composition following flunitrazepam was characterized by an increase in NREM 2, a prolongation of the time to REM sleep, a reduction of REM sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 sleep during the first 2 h of sleep. The sleep composition following zolpidem resembled more that seen in persons without sleep complaints. However, as compared to placebo, there was a decrcase of the time spent awake during sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 during the first 2 of sleep.

N2  - Nonnutritive sucking has been found to affect movement, sleep, state regulation and arousal, oxygenation, and nutrition and growth. Its quality is used as an indicator of central nervous system well-being. Speculations have been suggested about improved outcomes from respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The possible effect of sucking movements on attachment between mother and infant has also been described. Further research in the many areas in which this sucking phenomenon has effects are indicated. Exploration of the impact of nonnutritive sucking on the preterm infant of less than 28 weeks gestation and less than 800 gm and on the infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is recommended. Further research also needs to focus on implications of clinical applications of these findings to nursing care.

N2  - The pineal gland and melatonin exert a major influence in the control of brain electrical activity and have been shown to be involved in seizure and sleep mechanisms. Since pinealectomy has been reported to result in seizures in experimental animals, it is assumed that melatonin has anticonvulsant properties. Indeed, limited studies in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy indicate that melatonin attenuates seizure activity. In the present communication we present evidence, based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain measurements, that melatonin may exert proconvulsive activity in humans as well. The proconvulsive properties of melatonin may explain several phenomena associated with epilepsy such as the increased occurrence of seizures at night when melatonin plasma levels are 5 to 8-fold higher than during the day and the observed exacerbation of seizures premenstrually and during pregnancy as well as the attenuation of seizures in the menopause. Furthermore, our findings suggest that anticonvulsants which decrease melatonin secretion, such as the benzodiazepines, may exert their antiepileptic activity by attenuating nocturnal melatonin secretion. Finally, we propose that patients with nocturnal epilepsy or those experiencing exacerbation of seizures premenstrually may benefit from the administration of agents which block the secretion or action of melatonin.

N2  - The relationships between self-reported assessments of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep, preoperative anxiety, and several biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women at term receiving no premedication (n = 15), a placebo tablet (n = 15), diazepam 5 mg p.o. (n = 15), or atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.m. (n = 15), in connection with spinal analgesia for elective caesarean section. In the patients receiving no premedication, the subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively associated with concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in CSF, and with plasma adrenaline. The anxiolytic effect of diazepam was reflected as significantly lower plasma levels of another metabolite of NA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). Placebo and diazepam, and to a lesser extent atropine, confounded the statistical relationships between the clinical and biochemical responses found in the patients with no premedication. On the whole, the biochemical monoamine measurements were of little use in determining the clinical effects of different kinds of premedicants.

N2  - Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) colocalizes within gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH)-containing neurons in adult hypothalamus and could play a role in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary axis in adults. To support the possibility that DSIP also participates in fetal neuroendocrine events and to demonstrate the ontogenic evidence of coexisting neuropeptides, we have performed a detailed immunocytochemical study of DSIP- and GnRH-immunoreactivity in fetal hypothalamus of guinea pig. Using indirect immunofluorescent and sequential double-immunolabeling (elution-restaining) techniques, the results indicated that DSIP immunoreactivity was initially detected at the 38th day of gestation. In contrast to the first appearence of GnRH immunoreactivity at day 28, therefore, a 10-day delay was found. Such a delay remains as yet unexplained. From its first occurrence, DSIP immunoreactivity was always labeled with GnRH, whereas some of GnRH-immunoreactive structures did not display a DSIP immunoreactivity. But with the growth of fetus, especially before and after birth, a complete overlap between DSIP and GnRH immunoreactivity was observed throughout various regions of hypothalamus. Attention was also focused on prenatal morphological development of DSlP/GnRH- and GnRH-immunolabeled neurons. Initially, labeled neurons were visualized as uni- or bipolar types. Thereafter, their smooth and irregular subtypes could be distinguished. During later fetal age, relatively mature features were evident such as the increase of multipolar and irregularly labeled neurons. Taken together, these data provide, for the first time, anatomical evidence that DSIP exists in fetal hypothalamus and that, like GnRH, it could regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during ontogenesis.

N2  - The studies have demonstrated a correcting and synchronizing effect of differentiated psychotherapy and dosed exercise on the maternal and fetal reactions to active postural load in women with gestational arterial hypotension, developing a blood circulatory disadaptation in the mother-fetus system and circadian desynchronization of the postural tone. Traditional physiopsychoprophylactic preparation to labor, carried out in the reference group of pregnant women, was of no avail in this respect.

N2  - Delay in fetal maturation in diabetic and accelerated fetal maturation in hypertensive pregnancies have been reported in the past. The spontaneous activity of the fetal nervous system during pregnancy was followed longitudinally in a group of 29 normal pregnancies from the 28th to the 40th week of gestation by means of fetal behavioural states determination. 1 F state (quiet sleep) progressively increases from median values of 5.0% to values of 22.5-25% at term of pregnancy. This state represents the positive activity of inhibitory centers and has been related to a positive evolutionary process of brain maturation, according to preceding experiences conducted on experimental models and preterm babies followed with EEG and direct observation in the early neonatal period. The method of behavioural states determination has been applied to a group of 33 gestational diabetes (GDM) pregnant women followed longitudinally, and a clear reduction of development of 1 F state has been evidentiated, with significant differences (p < 0.001) at 35-36 weeks of gestation versus the control group. The normal values are reached in concomitance with L/S value of maturity. In 30 pregnant women affected by gestational hypertension (GH) different results are obtained: 1 F state seems to develop earlier, and is increased (p < 0.001) around 30-32 weeks versus the control group if a fetal growth reduction is present. The value of 1 F behavioural state in the evaluation of fetal condition of pathological pregnancies is discussed.

N2  - Subject of this review is the pathophysiology of the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), the apnea, and the sudden-death infant syndrome (SIDS). The fatality rate of the RDS yet amounts to 24%. Preterm infants are preferably involved because of their deficient surfactant synthesis. The lack of surfactant causes atelectases, hyaline membranes, lung oedema, and augmentation of respiration work. Only towards the very end of gestation the amount of surfactant of the fetal lung increases rapidly so that the normal postnatal respiration is guaranteed. RDS produces a pathological circulatory situation with insufficiency of the right heart and congestion. The atrial natriuretic hormone is increased about tenfold in the serum of RDS-infants. Modern treatment of the RDS uses instillations of exogenous surfactants before the first breath. Apneic attacks are observed predominantly during REM-sleep. They seem to have pathological value only if they exceed 15 seconds. Infants with recurrent apnoea breathe periodically, they were mostly preterm newborns. Probably, the cause of recurrent apneic attacks are central regulatory deficits and adenosine may play an important pathological role as neurotransmitter. Arrhythmias of the heart including the QT-syndrome observed in SIDS-infants at risk may have the same central pathophysiological source.

N2  - Rest-activity patterns were studied in fetuses exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and in control fetuses at three intervals during pregnancy: 20, 32, and 38 weeks. At 20 weeks, periods of rest and activity were distinguished on the basis of fetal motility. Trunk, head, and arm movements were totaled. Periods of absence of movements for >3 min were found in 20 of 31 recordings from AED-exposed fetuses compared with 11 of 20 recordings from controls (p > 0.05). The duration of these periods of inactivity did not differ significantly between the two groups. At 32 and 38 weeks, information on fetal motility and fetal heart rate (FHR) were combined to recognize rest-activity patterns according to the fetal behavioral state concept. At 32 weeks, three true fetal behavioral states were found for the study group, while there were none in the control group. Coincidence 1F through 4F occurred significantly less frequently at 32 weeks than at 38 weeks, regardless of whether fetuses were AED-exposed or not: 59% vs. 82% for the study group and 59% vs. 80% for the controls. At 38 weeks, true fetal behavioral states appeared in 20 of 34 fetuses exposed to AEDs and in 17 of 35 controls (p > 0.05). The sequence in which parameters changed within state transitions was found to follow the same preferred pattern in both groups. For transitions from behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep) into 2F (active sleep) the FHR pattern changed significantly earlier than fetal body or eye movements, while for the reverse transitions the FHR pattern changed significantly later (p < 0.05). No clearly preferred sequence of the other two state parameters was found. We concluded that chronic intrauterine exposure to AEDs does not affect fetal rest-activity patterns.

N2  - A 32 yr-old woman in her last trimester of pregnancy was found to have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram demonstrated an apnea plus hypopnea index of 159 events per hour. Apneas were associated with severe oxygen desaturation to 40% during rapid eye movement sleep, maternal bradycardia, and second degree heart block. External cardiotocography showed normal fetal heart rate reactivity to fetal movements, even during the apneas and episodes of oxygen desaturation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 15 cm H2O effectively treated the apneas and desaturation and had no effect on the fetal heart rate. The patient was induced electively during the 39th wk of pregnancy and gave birth to a newborn with growth retardation. Early recognition and treatment of OSA in pregnancy might prevent problems with fetal development.

N2  - Pregnant rats were treated with ethanol intragastrically (5.8 g/kg in two divided doses) spaced 4 hr apart on gestation days (GD) 7 and 8. Ganglioside GM1 was injected (10 mg/kg, IM) 24 hr and 1 hr prior to ethanol on GD7 and 1 hr prior on CD8. The controls received saline only. Maternal blood alcohol reached peak levels of 4.3 mg/ml within 2 hr in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups gain body weight, gestation time, or the litter size. There were also no significant differences in birth weight and the brain weight of the pups. At the age of 45 days, equal numbers of male offspring from each group were tested for hypnotic effect (sleep time) of ethanol challenge dose (3.5 g/kg). Animals that received ethanol alone in utero had a shorter sleep time compared to no ethanol controls (81 ± 19 and 130 ± 28 min respectively, P < .01 ). Ganglioside GM1 treated animals had sleep time similar to that of controls (131 ± 21 min). There were no significant differences in wakeup blood alcohol between the groups. These results indicate that pretreatment with GM1 ganglioside of maternal rats antagonized decrease in sleep time in offspring induced by prenatal ethanol exposure.

N2  - Twenty very premature babies, born at 24-29 weeks gestation, have been studied while they were maintained in intensive care with continuous intravenous feeding and constant ambient lighting and temperature. Hourly records of insulated skin temperature and heart rate were made for a continuous period of 6-17 weeks, always starting the recording within 24 h of birth. The development of rhythms within the ultradian, circadian and infradian domains was sought by methods including maximum entropy spectral analysis and autocorrelation. Circadian and ultradian rhythms were present, but not regularly so; rather they appeared and disappeared erratically in successive weeks. As a consequence, the group as a whole did not show an increasing rhythmicity with chronological age. In some cases, babies were later placed in a ward in which the lighting was dimmed at night, and feeding by mouth at regular intervals was instituted. There was some evidence for increases in circadian and ultradian rhythmicity after these changes. These results enable inferences to be drawn as to the origin of fetal rhythms in the third trimester of pregnancy, as well as speculation to be made on the ontogeny of ultradian and circadian rhythms in the neonate.

N2  - Thyroid function was investigated during and after pregnancy in 12 healthy euthyroid women. During pregnancy, serum total T4 (TT4) levels were significantly elevated and nearly stable, while thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels progressively increased till the 7th month. A slight elevation, though not significant, of free T4 (fT4) was recorded in early pregnancy. In the following months, fT4, free T3 (fT3) and the T4/TBG ratio progressively diminished, reaching a plateau at the 7th month. Serum TSH levels, measured by an ultrasensitive immunofluorometric assay, were comparable to postpartum values during the first trimester and showed a moderate upward trend with the progression of pregnancy. The evaluation of 24-hour TSH profiles was performed in 5 women during the first trimester of pregnancy. In all women, the circadian rhythm of TSH was present with a normal nocturnal surge, though anticipated in 1 case. In summary (1) during the first trimester of pregnancy, the increased thyroid activity does not seem to be only sustained by pituitary TSH which remains unmodified; the negative correlation between TSH and hCG levels might suggest that hCG also stimulates the gland to increase thyroid hormone output, and the presence of a normal TSH circadian rhythm indicates that the central mechanism of neuroregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis is preserved in early pregnancy, and (2) in late pregnancy, a marked decrease in free thyroid hormone fractions is accompanied by serum TSH levels still in the normal range, indicating a modification of thyroid homeostasis which might recognize various etiological factors.

N2  - Cardio-respiratory physiology in sleep was examined in eight preterm lambs born at 133 - 135 (134 ± 1, mean SEM) days of gestation after 3 - 5 days of pulsatile ACTH/TRH infusion, and contrasted with eight lambs born at term (147 ± 1 days). Lambs were instrumented with electrodes for recording electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram and nuchal electromyogram to define behavioural states, as well as carotid arterial catheters for determination of arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial blood gases. Compared to full-term lambs, the preterm lambs exhibited extended active sleep times, elevated PaCO2 and faster heart rate in all behavioural states than full-term lambs; with increasing postnatal age, sleep times and heart rate declined. As similar differences are found in preterm human infants, the preterm lamb will be a useful model to study the underlying physiology of these cardio-respiratory alterations.

N2  - Serum prolactin (HPR) levels are influenced by waking and sleep states, as reflected by surges in serum concentrations during daytime naps and nocturnal sleep. Other physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia include sexual activity, pregnancy, and lactation. Drugs may stimulate or inhibit HPR secretion. Pathological causes for HPR secretion include destructive lesions of the hypothalamus, prolactin-secreting neoplasms of the pituitary gland, lesions of the spinal cord, and occasionally Parkinson's disease. The most predictable postictal changes are increased serum cortisol levels and hyperprolactinemia. Serum HPR rises after virtually all generalized tonic-clonic seizures, most complex partial seizures, and some simple partial seizures. Absence and myoclonic seizures do not affect serum HPR levels. Repeated epileptic seizures and electroconvulsive therapy treatments produce successively less marked rises in serum HPR. The postictal elevation of serum cortisol has a longer latency than for HPR and follows an earlier rise in serum ACTH. Other postictal hormonal changes are much more variable. Because of the normal diurnal variation in serum cortisol levels and the relative delay in the postictal elevation of serum cortisol, HPR is more useful as a diagnostic measure of epileptic seizures. This application of HPR requires an understanding of other factors that influence serum HPR and the use of baseline serum HPR levels for comparison. HPR data must be correlated with behavioral and electroencephalographic events.

N2  - Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce continuous fetal breathing movements (FBM) in sheep. The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the relative roles of lung distension and oxygenation and 2) to test the hypothesis that FBM can be induced during labor, when normally they are greatly reduced or absent. We studied 13 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 128 and 144 d of gestation (term = 147 ± 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragm electromyogram, blood pressure, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions. The fetal lungs were distended via an in situ endotracheal tube with four different concentrations of O2 (0, 21, 50 and 100%) at a continuous positive airway pressure of 10, 20 and 30 cm H2O in a randomized order. No change in any recorded physiologic variable was observed at 129 ± 1 or 132 ± 1 d of gestation. At 135 ± 1 and 138 ± 1 d, in response to a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O and 100% O2, pH decreased (p = 0.0004 and 0.005, respectively) and arterial O2 tension increased (p = 0.004 and 0.02, respectively). However, increases in 1) breathing time, 2) breathing time/low-voltage electrocortical activity ratio, 3) duration of arousal, and 4) length of single breathing epochs were observed only at 138 ± 1 d. Lung distension with N2 resulted in a decrease in FBM. Six fetuses were studied during labor. Significant increase in total breathing time, stimulation of breathing during quiet sleep, and increased duration of arousal were observed with an increase in fetal arterial O2 tension. The onset of breathing always coincided with the onset of arousal. We conclude that fetal maturity, an increase in fetal arterial O2 tension, and a change in state from quiet sleep toward arousal are necessary conditions for the induction of FBM.

N2  - The term 'secondary hypertension' includes a variety of aetiological processes with no obvious common feature apart, perhaps, from the loss of normal blood pressure regulatory factors. It has been suggested that all forms of secondary hypertension, including renal/renovascular, accelerated phase, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid excess, phaeochromocytoma and toxaemia in pregnancy are associated with the loss of the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. The evidence for this view appears strongest for glucocorticoid-induced hypertension, but for most other forms the available data are conflicting and are mostly based on small numbers of patients without adequate control populations. Sleep is a powerful determinant of the nocturnal fall in blood pressure but few studies have addressed the quality of sleep in groups of patients who are often sick and/or hospitalized. Abnormalities in sympathetic drive (e.g. autonomic neuropathy and phaeochromocytoma) can abolish the nocturnal blood pressure reductions, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be a critical factor in determining the normal diurnal changes in blood pressure. As approximately 20% of patients with 'essential hypertension' have a blunted fall in nocturnal blood pressure it seems unlikely that ambulatory blood pressure could ever be useful in screening for secondary hypertension.

N2  - Oral contraceptive use is influenced by multiple emotional factors. Physiological and psychological effects are closely correlated. Contraception may assist women in pursuing important psychosocial goals, on the other hand, it may cause a number of problems. Many unconscious wishes or fears may interfere with the clear separation of sexuality from fertility. Ambivalence about pregnancy, neurotic personalities and problems in partner relationship may cause psychic conflicts with regard to contraception. Anxiety, side effects, misuse of contraceptives or problems in the relationship between doctor and patient may result. As a further development psychosomatic symptoms such as discomfort, nervousness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, nausea and sexual disorders may appear. The physician must take contradictory feelings of the patient into consideration, including her anxiety and her possible ambivalence with respect to pregnancy.

N2  - Six chronically catheterized rhesus macaques maintained on a 12-hour-light/dark cycle (lights on from 7 AM to 7 PM) showed a nocturnal uterine activity rhythm with peak contractile events between 9 and 11 PM (p < 0.05). In blood samples collected at 3-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, we determined that plasma melatonin and progesterone concentrations were elevated at night whereas estradiol, estrone, and cortisol reached peak concentrations in the early morning (p < 0.05). Lights were then left on for the remainder of the study. After 12 days in constant light, daily rhythms in uterine activity and plasma steroid levels were relatively unchanged, whereas melatonin concentrations were suppressed. Animals then received a timed infusion of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg/hr each day from 7 PM to 6 AM daily until delivery). The nocturnal uterine activity rhythm and the rhythms in plasma steroid concentrations were maintained. We conclude that the 24-hour patterns in maternal uterine activity and plasma steroid hormone levels are circadian rhythms generated by an endogenous biologic clock and do not appear to be driven by the pattern of melatonin in circulation.

Cause is unknown; sporadic occurrence is the rule. Data presented in this review include the characteristics of pregnancy, growth and development, principal manifestations, radiographic and ophthalmological characteristics, and the results of cephalometric study. Potential complications in the syndrome are related to the narrow upper airway associated with the craniofacial configuration. Severe complications may include early pulmonary infection, respiratory embarrassment, obstructive sleep apnea, and anesthetic risk. Topics for future study are suggested.

N2  - The rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in southern New Zealand has been very high with an apparent real increase in incidence from the early 1970s. Recent research is reviewed and the results of specific interventions aimed at preventing SIDS summarized. The intervention consisted of strongly advising new parents that their babies sleep on their back or side and that they avoid over-heating, especially during infections. For the Otago area, child-care practice has been documented and prone sleeping of 1 month old babies has declined from 41.8% in 1986 to 2.4% in 1989-90. There is also evidence that parental control of infants' thermal environment has improved, maternal smoking during pregnancy has slightly decreased and the number of babies breast fed at 1 month of age has increased by 11%. In southern NZ there has been a decline in post-neonatal SIDS mortality from 6.3 deaths per 1000 live births 1979-84 to 1.3 per 1000 live births in 1990. There are grounds for supposing that the intervention has been causative of this change, a possibility being addressed by on-going studies.

N2  - Long-term recordings of the electroencephalograms (EEGs) from the non-human fetal primate have been visually scored for state. Data were obtained from three fetuses using recently developed techniques for chronic instrumentation of the pregnant baboon. Seven days or more after surgery, nine chart records of 4-5 h in duration were analyzed. These records were made during an interval in gestation from 143 to 153 days (term = 175 to 185 days). Criteria for differentiation of EEG state were based on the presence (state 1) or absence (state 2) of trace alternant, which is the predominant characteristic of EEG activity during quiet sleep in human preterm and term infants. Two patterns of EEG activity were readily distinguished at both standard (30 mm/s) and compressed (30 mm/min) EEG chart speeds. On a minute-by-minute basis, there was an overall concurrence of 82.9% for EEG state when scored from compressed and standard EEG records. From the compressed records, state 1 was present on average 38.3% of the time, with a mean epoch duration of 15.1 min, while epochs of state 2 averaged 25.9 min. We conclude that at least two EEG states are present at this gestation in the fetal baboon. These two states can be reliably defined visually by scoring methods directly comparable to those used for EEG recognition of sleep states in the human newborn infant. To validate the conclusion that these fetal state assignments based on patterns of EEG activity correspond to sleep states, it will be necessary to determine if the oscillations of other physiological parameters are coherent with these patterns.

N2  - To assess how REM/NREM periods can be linked to the determination of the REM/NREM sleep and/or awake state, we have investigated the relationship between the REM/NREM periods and penile tumescence in the human fetus. This study was made on 11 male fetuses from 36 to 41 weeks of gestation. Eye movement and penile tumescence were simultaneously examined with an observation window of 60 min, using two separate real-time ultrasound systems. The mean percentage of the total duration of penile tumescence during the REM period and that during the NREM period was 77.7 and 15.8%, respectively. In all cases, the total duration of penile tumescence during the REM period against REM duration was greater than the duration of tumescence during the NREM period against NREM duration with statistical significance. This indicates that the fetal penile tumescence is strongly associated with REM period and the REM period containing penile tumescence in the human fetus can be considered equivalent to REM sleep in utero. In addition, the finding that there exists a part of the REM period lacking penile tumescence suggests the possible origin of the awake state, brought about by advances in fetal development at this stage of gestation.

N2  - The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured in REM and NREM periods, respectively, and their changes with advancing gestational age were investigated. Ten women without complications in their 20th to 40th week of pregnancy were examined. Fetal breathing movements and REM were observed simultaneously using ultrasonography. REM and NREM periods were selected for analyzing breathing movements separate from the whole examination period. The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured with the hand-held pressure transducer. The changes in inspiratory time with fetal age showed the same pattern both in REM and NREM periods. There were no significant changes in inspiratory time before 28 weeks gestational age. After that, the inspiratory time lengthened, showing the maximum at 32-35 weeks and then shortened at 36-40 weeks gestational age. There were no differences of the inspiratory time between REM and NREM periods before 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, the inspiratory time in the NREM period was longer than in the REM period. These changes in fetal breathing movements are thought to be caused by the morphological maturation of the fetal lung and the functional development of respiratory and sleep center of the fetal central nervous system.

N2  - The blood pressure shows circadian variation in normal subjects with higher diurnal than nocturnal values: the difference between day and night time blood pressure is about 10-20 mmHg for systolic and for diastolic blood pressure. These variations are mainly related to physical and/or psychosensorial stress: the physician is himself a cause of increased blood pressure (the 'white coat' effect). The degree of the nocturnal decrease in blood pressure which is maximal 2 and 3 o'clock is related to the quality and depth of sleep. The nocturnal decrease is followed by an increase in blood pressure when the person wakes up (early morning peak). Diagnostic signs: a physiological inversion of the circadian rhythm may be observed in people who sleep during the daytime and work at night. There would seem to be less of a nocturnal fall in black persons in the United States. Some pathological conditions can inverse or at least disturb the circadian variation: apart from hypertension, this has been reported in autonomic nervous system disease, in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy, in some elderly patients, in Cushing's syndrome, after cardiac transplantation, etc... In hypertensives, the lack of nocturnal decrease of the blood pressure or an inversion in circadian rhythm should be looked for in severe and secondary hypertension such as associated with pheochromocytoma, or in renal dialysis patients. In toxaemia of pregnancy, this abnormality may herald an eclamptic crisis. Prognostic signs: in normotensives (especially in black persons) and hypertensives, inversion of the circadian rhythm is associated with more severe left ventricular hypertrophy and a higher morbidity.

N2  - With the use of a chronic preparation to directly monitor blood pressure and heart rate in pregnant rats, continuous data were obtained over the last half of gestation in normotensive rats. Over this time span, the animals showed significant decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate. Heart rate exhibited marked and consistent circadian rhythmicity with peaks occurring near the midportion of the dark phase of the 24-hour cycle. Blood pressure rhythms were less prominent and peaked later. The trends observed in blood pressure and heart rate over gestation suggest that the pregnant rat is a useful model for studying the cardiovascular effects of pregnancy.

N2  - Fetal heart rate variation in early labor was measured by computerized analysis in cyclic episodes of low or high variation in 136 women at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation. The amplitude (mean ± SE) in episodes of low variation was 20.6 ± 0.4 milliseconds; in high variation it was 57.3 ± 1.1 milliseconds. The duration (mean ± SE) of low episodes (24.3 ± 1.3 minutes) was less than that of high episodes (45.1 ± 2.7 minutes) but was sometimes >1 hour. In episodes of low variation the amplitude was <5 beats/min long term in 11% and <2.5 milliseconds (pulse intervals) short term in 8%; these measures would be predictive of intrauterine death if persistent before birth. We conclude that the use of decreased fetal heart rate variation as a diagnostic sign of acute fetal hypoxemia in labor is incorrect, because changes of this size occur randomly as a consequence of fetal sleep states. There was no significant correlation between fetal heart rate variation over the last hour of labor and umbilical arterial base deficit on delivety.

N2  - Circadian rhythms in salivary [glucose], [Na+], [K+] and conductivity were measured in 2 age groups of men (men A, 20-45 years and men B, 46-60 years) and 8 different states of fertility in women (normally menstruating, taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, lactational amenorrhea, lactational amenorrhea and taking oral contraceptives, lactating and menstruating, menopausal, and post-menopausal). Unstimulated whole saliva (2-3 ml) was collected every 3 h over a 48 h span. Analysis of Spearman Rank Correlations indicated significant circadian rhythms (significant positive coefficients) for all groups of [Na+] (mean = 0.577 +/- 0.040) and conductivity (mean = 0.410 +/- 0.050). There was no evidence of differences in prominence of rhythm across groups for [Na+] and conductivity. [K+] showed less evidence of rhythms and much greater variability between groups (mean correlation coefficient = 0.198 +/- 0.055). Rhythms in [glucose] (mean correlation coefficient = 0.409 +/- 0.051) were evident in all groups except men B (0.016), menopausal women (0.151) and post-menopausal women (0.310). Model analysis of the data showed no discernible rhythmic trend with age for either conductivity, [Na+] or [K+], where any differences were explainable by the group characteristics. The rhythm in [glucose] showed a significant weakening with age over all groups (F-ratio = 7.46**), and was different between men A and men B (F-ratio = 6.95**). It was concluded that circadian rhythms were present in whole unstimulated saliva for conductivity and [Na+] and that these rhythms were independent of reproductive state, whereas circadian rhythms in [K+] were dependent on reproductive state. Circadian rhythms for [glucose] were dependent on age. The loss of a rhythm in [glucose] with age indicates that glucose, Na+ and K+ are not linked in their entry into saliva. The influence of entry and reabsorption on the final concentrations of glucose, Na+ and K+ in saliva is discussed.

N2  - We studied maternal and fetal blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases and fetal behavioral state alterations in response to maternally administered cocaine hydrochloride in 11 pregnant sheep. Cocaine administration to the ewe caused a dose-dependent increase in maternal blood pressure and heart rate and in fetal blood pressure, and a decrease in fetal arterial oxygen tension. In the ewe, blood pressure changes corresponded linearly to dose administered (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Blood pressure changes were correlated to peak plasma cocaine concentration in the ewe (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) and in the fetus (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). In addition, in 7 of 8 fetuses which had entered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep within 5 min of maternal cocaine administration, REM sleep was abruptly terminated either by the cocaine, fetal hypoxia or some other nonspecific event caused by the maternal cocaine administration. Maternal cocaine administration causes maternal and fetal hemodynamic alterations that have potential adverse effects in pregnancy.

N2  - The experience of fatigue in early pregnancy was studied, using a general model of fatigue as the conceptual framework. A convenience sample of 30 women, age 20-35 years, who were at less than 20 weeks' gestation and without health problems were included in the study. Physiologic, psychological, and environmental factors were measured and related to the occurrence and intensity of fatigue. Pearson correlations and content analysis were used to analyze the data. Results showed that a large portion of the sample (90%) experienced fatigue and that this fatigue had a significant impact on their ability to maintain personal and social activities. Significant correlations were observed between fatigue and the physiologic variables of nausea and feeling tired upon awakening from sleep. There was no significant relationship between fatigue and environmental variables such as number of hours worked or the number of children living in the home. In addition, significant correlations were observed between fatigue and psychological variables that included depression, anger, anxiety, and confusion. These data suggest that fatigue is a significant problem for pregnant women and is not relieved by rest. These data further suggest that the fatigue may be related to other physiologic changes, perhaps hormonal, that mediate physiologic and psychological variables, including fatigue.

N2  - Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded in 16 uncomplicated near-term pregnancies. The recordings were used to evaluate a system for automated fetal mean rate analysis (Sonicaid System 8000). Fetal rest-activity patterns were considered in the analysis. The mean duration of C2P periods 'active sleep,' 33 minutes) was significantly greater than that of C1F periods ('quiet sleep,' 19 minutes) (p<0.001). The incidence of accelerations and decelerations and the overall fetal heart rate variations were greater during C2P than during C1F (p<0.001). In 11 of 16 C1F periods, the system classified the fetal heart rate variation as 'questionable' or 'abnormal.' Episodes of high variation were identified in only 3 of 16 C1F periods, but they were found in all 18 C2F periods. Episodes of low variation were identified in 14 of the 16 C1F periods but were not found in any C2F periods. During C2F periods, the system's criteria of normality were met in all cases but one; they were not met during any of the C1F periods. Thus the diagnosis of fetal distress should not be based merely on the absence of accelerations, low fetal heart rate variation, or absence of episodes of high variation in recordings with a duration of <45 minutes.

N2  - Relationship between blood flow velocity waveform and fetal behavioral states was studied in 16 normal pregnancies at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. The peak flow velocity has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction during active sleep, as against that in quite sleep. These data reflect reduced ductal flow and suggest a redistribution in the left-ventricular and right-ventricular output in favor of the left side of the heart during active sleep. In a prospective cross-sectional study of 49 pregnancies (50 fetuses) between 25th and 38th weeks an exponential increase in breathing-related ductal blood flow velocity modulation was observed with advancing gestational age, reflecting the developing pulmonary vascular bed. Fetal ductal flow velocity waveforms were also recorded in 13 cases of prolonged severe oligohydramnios after membrane rupture before 28 weeks' gestation. Normal ductal blood flow velocity modulation values were associated with normal neonatal lung performance, whereas reduced blood flow velocity modulation values were associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Fetal breathing-related ductal flow velocity modulation appears to be a promising predictor of neonatal lung performance.

N2  - Transvaginal ultrasonography with colour flow mapping has been used to study changes in intra-follicular morphology and blood flow during a peri-ovulatory period in one volunteer. Aspects of uterine morphology and blood flow were also recorded. The intervals from a defined luteinizing hormone (LH) rise and peak to the mean time of follicular rupture were 37.5 and 17.5 h, respectively. Blood flow velocity waveforms were observed clearly at the time of the LH rise and blood vessels were visible when the hormone level reached a peak. Concurrently, the wall of the follicle became less clear, crenated, thicker and more echogenic. A structure resembling the detached cumulus and oocyte was seen before the follicle had ruptured. Peak systolic blood velocity was highest immediately after ovulation had occurred. Blood flow impedance in the uterine arteries suggested the presence of a circadian rhythm, but no pronounced daily changes were observed over the study period. In contrast, flow velocity waveforms were clearly visible in the endometrium around the time of ovulation. These preliminary data suggest that intra-follicular vascularization or angiogenesis may be critical processes that might be used to predict ovulation and could possibly be modified to help achieve or avoid a pregnancy.

N2  - A typical diurnal variation in blood pressure is observed in patients with essential hypertension. Attenuation or lack of circadian periodicity might be expected in patients with secondary hypertension. Therefore, non invasive ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring was performed in 172 patients with secondary hypertension and in 201 patients with essential hypertension. The following patients with secondary hypertension were investigated: renoparenchymatous nephropathy (n = 29), diabetic nephropathy (n = 24), morbus Conn (n = 6), renal artery stenosis (n = 32), pheochromocytoma (n = 5), hemodialysis patients (n = 30), and patients after kidney transplantation (n = 44). In addition, 36 pregnant women (17 normotensives, 19 hypertensives) were studied. 98.5% of patients with essential hypertension showed a nightly decline in blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg (systolic + diastolic), whereas 70% of patients with secondary hypertension showed either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm. Patients with pheochromocytoma who had a nighttime increase in blood pressure demonstrated the greatest difference in the essential hypertension collective, followed by patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients after kidney transplantation. After successful treatment of the condition leading to hypertension, circadian periodicity returned in some patients. In summary, these results suggest that the absence of a nighttime decline in blood pressure during 24-h-ambulatory monitoring is an indication of secondary hypertension, which should be further investigated. As a practical consequence, antihypertensive drugs should also be applied in an evening dose in secondary hypertensives. Noninvasive ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring is recommended for treatment control, especially in patients who need an efficient blood-pressure control.

N2  - The objective of this study was to determine if a skeletal photoperiod administered at the appropriate time of a 24-h day could stimulate prolactin and somatotropin release in dairy cattle. Cows in mo 8 of gestation were exposed to either 12 to 13 h of continuous light or to three skeletal photoperiods consisting of a total of 8 h of light. Cows in the skeletal photoperiod light regimens received 6 h of light from 0500 to 1100 h and a 2-h light pulse at either 1500 to 1700 h, 1800 to 2000 h, or 2100 to 2300 h. Cows exposed to the light regimen pulse at 1800 to 2000 h exhibited a circadian rhythm of prolactin and somatotropin release. The mean prolactin and somatotropin concentrations were also higher in this treatment. It is concluded that a circadian rhythm with a photosensitive phase is present for prolactin and somatotropin release in the lactating dairy cow. The photosensitive phase for both hormones occurs between 13 and 15 h after subjective dawn. The expression of the circadian rhythm of these hormones depends on the photoperiod to which cows are exposed.

N2  - Pregnant dams were subjected to REM sleep deprivation during different stages of pregnancy. Pups were reared by their biological mothers and tested as adults for susceptibility to PTZ-induced convulsions, and ambulation and defecation in an open-field arena. Adrenal weights were taken at this time. Those animals whose mothers had been stressed during the first trimester showed a reduction in ambulatory behavior measured in the open field, and a reduction in adrenal weight after open-field exposure. Subjects exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) during the 2nd trimester showed an increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced clonic convulsions, and a reduction in adrenal weight after PTZ administration and open-field exposure. Finally, subjects exposed to PNS during the third trimester showed a reduction in susceptibility to PTZ compared with 2nd week PNS pups. The results showed different patterns of prenatal stress-induced behavioral and physiological changes, depending on the developmental stage in which the stress was applied.

N2  - β-Blockers are used in pregnancy-associated hypertension and in postnatal cardiac arrhythmias, and the neonate may get them in breast milk. We therefore studied the effects of β-adrenergic medication on interrelations between heart rate (HR), respiration, and arterial blood pressure (aBP) in newborn lambs. The influence of sleep state on these cardiorespiratory interrelations was also examined. HR, aBP, and respiration (based on transthoracic electrical impedance) were recorded and the sleep state was visually documented in five healthy chronically instrumented newborn lambs before the age of 30 d. Propranolol was given (1 mg/kg). Two-min stationary segments of the three signals were analyzed using a multivariate autoregressive model, which yields oscillations of the signals and intersignal relationships as source contributions. The variabilities of aBP and HR were greatest at the low frequencies (<0.25 Hz) and so were their intersignal relationships (including baroreflex). The respiratory variability was greatest at the frequencies corresponding to the respiratory rate. During quiet sleep, the variabilities in HR, aBP, and respiration were lowest. The impact of respiratory oscillations on other signals increased but the impact of aBP variability decreased during quiet sleep. β-Blockade and sleep state affected separately the cardiovascular and respiratory variables and their interrelations. β-Blockade reduced HR and increased pulse pressure. The overall heart rate variability and the respiratory low-frequency contribution to heart rate variability decreased due to the β-blockade. We postulate that the β-adrenergic system is an important regulator of HR and HR variability in neonatal lambs and also of the low-frequency components of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. However, inasmuch as the interrelations between HR and aBP were not altered by the β-blockade, even high doses of propranolol do not seem hazardous for the cardiovascular system in neonatal lambs.

N2  - In 16 normal pregnancies the relationship between foramen ovale flow velocity waveforms and fetal behavioral states at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation was studied with Doppler techniques. Foramen ovale flow velocity waveforms are characterized by a typical systolic/diastolic component. Average flow velocity was statistically significantly increased in behavioral state 2F (active sleep) as compared with state 1F (quiet sleep), which was mainly determined by an increase in flow velocity during the end-systolic and passive atrial filling phase. The increase in the average flow velocity at the foramen ovale level during active sleep suggests a redistribution of blood flow at the cardiac level, resulting in an increased right-to-left shunt.

N2  - Alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). To examine this hypothesis, pregnancy outcome and offspring development were examined in alcohol-sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) mice and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice following prenatal ethanol exposure. Dams were intragastrically intubated twice per day (6 hr apart) with either 4.5 g/kg (20% w/v) ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) on days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Results showed litter mortality at 10 days of age was greater for LS-E litters compared to both LS-S and LS-C litters. Litter mortality for SS-E litters did not differ from either SS-S or SS-C litters. Maternal weight gain, blood ethanol levels, and birth weight deficits were similar for ethanol-exposed LS and SS groups. These results suggest genetically based alcohol sensitivity influences the severity of ARBD.

N2  - Starting within two hours after birth, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) and heart rate (HR) of 72 newborns were automatically monitored at about 30-min intervals for 48 hours with a Nippon Colin (Komaki, Japan) device at the Hospital General de Galicia, Santiago, Spain. On the basis of questionnaires given to the parents inquiring notably about the medical family history, the newborns were assigned a cardiovascular risk score (CRS). This risk scale was obtained according to the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, elevated BP or obesity across 2 generations, those of the newborn's parents and grandparents. BP and HR values outside ± 3 standard deviations (SD) from the individual series mean were removed, and the remaining data were used to compute model dependent (circadian rhythm-adjusted mean or MESOR, amplitude and acrophase) and model independent characteristics (arithmetic mean, SD, 90% and 50% ranges, and circadian range, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest means of hourly classes) for the three circulatory variables. A correlation coefficient was computed between each variable and the CRS. Results indicate highly statistically significant correlations between CRS and indices of variability or dispersion, notably circadian range, SD and 90% range of systolic and diastolic BP and HR, and lack on significant correlation between CRS and average values or indices of location (means, MESORS and even 50% ranges). A 48-hr profile for the computation of extent of change of BP and HR shortly after birth could then provide a neonatal index of cardiovascular risk, to be used for the evaluation of the effects of the newborn of intervention on the pregnant women.

N2  - Women of all ages have been found to have a higher rate of sleep disturbances than men. Attempts to determine whether hormonal changes marking their reproductive lives render women more vulnerable to emotional stress and to concomitant sleep disturbances are the focus of this article. Investigations of sleep patterns and sleep-related experiences that occur in connection with the menstrual cycle (normal menstrual cycle and premenstrual syndrome) and are associated with hormonal abnormalities (amenorrhea) and changes in hormonal status (pregnancy and menopause) are reviewed. Methodological problems are discussed and areas of future research are proposed. It is suggested that the triad of sleep, endocrine changes, and mood should be more systematically investigated.

N2  - The circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase, E.C. 3.2.1.1. (alpha-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) in parotid gland of 25 day old rats was studied under different experimental conditions (fast, reversed photoperiod, constant light or darkness and treatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of rats fasted or exposed for 7 days to constant darkness did not change. There were modifications in the rhythm of rats submitted to a reversed photoperiod and it disappeared in animals submitted to constant light or darkness for 15 days or treated with reserpine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The rhythm persisted, with minor changes in the acrophase, in parotids of rats kept during their gestation and post-natal life in constant light or darkness. Results suggest that the circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase in parotid gland of young rats is endogenous, synchronized by the photoperiod, under autonomous nervous system control and maternal coordination. This model appears to be useful in the study of sympathetic nervous system control of target organs and circadian rhythms in general.

N2  - In normal pregnancy the circadian blood pressure rhythm is similar to that in the non-pregnant state, with the highest blood pressure values in the morning and the lowest at mignight. This rhythm is lost in patients with pre-eclampsia. Women with severe pre-eclampsia show a reversed circadian rhythm, with a nocturnal increase in blood pressure during the sleeping phase. Although the reasons for this nocturnal hypertension in severe pre-eclampsia are poorly understood, the results suggest that pre-eclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies, mostly at night. Therefore blood pressure measurement should be extended to the night, and antihypertensive treatment must be adapted to the demands of a reversed circadian rhythm in relevant subgroups of patients.

N2  - Interactions between sleep and respiration have been noticed in several lung diseases. In COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients, the night sleep is delayed or shortened and deep sleep is often reduced or even absent. These disturbances are associated with hypoxaemic episodes occurring either in light slow wave sleep or in REM sleep, the former being short in duration and mild but repetitive and related to ventilatory changes, the latter prolonged, often severe, and resulting from both decrease in ventilation and alterations of ventilation-perfusion ratios. Restrictive syndrome due to interstitial pneumonia, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular diseases or, more commonly, to obesity or even pregnancy also alter sleep in a non-specific manner. Most of them result in hypoxia during paradoxical sleep. Unquestionably, there exists a relationship between sleep and asthma (aggravation of dyspnoea at night, reduction of peak expiratory flow when awaking, stage 2 asthmatic attacks). This relationship is probably caused by multifactorial interactions.

N2  - To investigate potential adverse effects of residency training on pregnancy outcome, a cohort study was conducted among 45 university-affiliated residency programs. Outcomes of the first pregnancy experienced during residency were compared between 92 female residents and 144 spouses of male residents. Despite long hours, sleep deprivation, and an increase in perceived stress, the female residents were as likely to give birth to a live, full-term newborn as the spouses of male residents. For white cohort members, an increased risk of premature labor without delivery was identified (RR = 12.3, 95% confidence interval 2.4-61.6). No significant differences were found in prematurity, spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, or presence of congenital abnormalities in the infants. Method of delivery and use of anesthetics and of other medications were similar in both groups. Pregnancy outcomes between the two groups were similar; however, the increased risk for premature labor among female residents is a cause for concern and should be further investigated.

N2  - Prolactin is a 21,500 Dalton single-chain polypeptide hormone but may occur in 50 kDa and 150 kDa molecular variants. These large PRL variants may be secreted predominantly; this condition is termed 'macroprolactinemia'. It is characterized by high immunological and normal biological serum levels of prolactin, and lack of clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. The information on PRL is encoded on chromosome 6. Transcription can be enhanced and suppressed by a variety of hormonal factors. PRL is secreted in a pulsatile fashion; it displays a circadian rhythm (with a maximum during sleep) and is stimulated by some amino acids. PRL also responds to mechanical stimulation of the breast. PRL rises during pregnancy, and maintainance of hyperprolactinemia (and, thereby, physiological infertility) is dependent on the frequency and duration of breast feedings. Hypothalamic regulation of prolactin mainly involves tonic inhibition via portal dopamine. The physiological importance of various stimulating factors present in the hypothalamus is still incompletely understood. In particular, there is still no place for TRH in PRL physiology. PRL is released in response to stress; this response may be mediated by opioids. The low-estrogen, low-gonadotropin amenorrhea of endurance-training women is not mediated by prolactin, however. Estrogens stimulate PRL gene transcription via at least two independent mechanisms. There are many clinical examples of this estrogen effect on prolactin serum, levels, and also on the growth of prolactinomas. Mild hyperprolactinemia remains an enigma which cannot satisfactorily be resolved by biochemical or radiological testing. The border between 'normal' and 'elevated' prolactin is ill-defined. The possibility of macroprolactinemia complicates this matter even further. The number of drugs which suppress prolactin by acting on pituitary D2 receptors, and which are useful in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, continues to increase. In the field of ergot alkaloids, parenteral application appears to be a logical solution to the problem of the high first-pass effect; in addition, this form of treatment is frequently better tolerated than the oral route. Prolactinoma development is presently being studied employing molecular biological techniques; the question of whether tumorigenesis can be attributed to specific defects of gene regulation remains to be answered.

N2  - The effects on breathing movements and sleep state of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and its antagonist, proglumide, have been studied in unanaesthetised fetal lambs of 124-142 days gestation. CCK-8 when given into a lateral ventricle as bolus injections of 10-500 ng caused dose-related periods of apnea ranging from 63-214 min. When given as a 100 ng bolus followed by a 50 ng/h infusion for 2 h there was a prolonged period of apnea lasting 331 ± 56 min. There was no effect of CCK-8 when given in higher doses (1-50 μg). The antagonist proglumide reversed the apnea induced by CCK-8 infusion, but had no effect when given alone, nor did it affect the normal fetal depressive response to hypoxia. Neither CCK-8 nor proglumide had any effect on electrocortical activity. We conclude that CCK has no role in the inhibitory mechanisms causing the apnea associated with high voltage electrocortical activity or hypoxia in the fetus. Furthermore CCK does not appear to be involved in the regulation of sleep state in the fetal lamb.

N2  - Respiratory control abnormalities are mechanistic in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In particular, arousal from sleep is an important component of respiratory regulation. Cocaine alters central neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly the monoamines. The locus coeruleus, the major Norepinephrine (NE) neuron system, is involved in arousal from sleep related apnea and has extensive forebrain and brainstem projections. Thus, it is plausible that in utero cocaine exposure disrupts the normal maturation of transmitters and/or brain structures essential to sleep related respiratory regulation. Infants exposed to cocaine in utero may have an increased incidence of SIDS. We propose that cocaine use in pregnancy alters the normal maturation of centers and/or neurotransmitters involved in respiratory regulation thereby altering postnatal respiratory control. We hypothesize that the increased incidence of SIDS in cocaine exposed infants may be secondary to deficits in arousal. The study of prenatal brain development and of postnatal respiratory control in rabbit pups exposed to cocaine in utero will provide a useful model for the study of mechanisms operative in SIDS.

N2  - The relationships between self-reported assessments of acute anxiety and several biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women at term in connection with spinal analgesia for caesarean section. Fear and apprehension were statistically significantly associated only with blood pressure and with an increase in heart rate from the previous daty. The subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively associated with biochemical plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of sympatho-adrenal activity. The previously reported negative correlation between body height and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, an indicator of serotonin metabolism) in lumbar CSF was confirmed. The concentration of 5-HIAA in CSF was positively correlated with the levels of other acidic monoamine metabolites and cortisol in CSF. It is concluded that hormone and monoamine metabolite measurements in CSF and plasma have only limited usefulness as quantitative indicators of the intensity of preoperative fear and anxiety.

N2  - The distribution of symptoms, physiologic responses, and upper airway structure in members of one family with three generations of subjects with sleep apnea (SA) is reported. Questionnaire data were obtained from ten family members (ages 7 to 66 years), overnight sleep studies were performed in nine subjects, and ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia and to eucapnic hypoxia and cephalometry were obtained in five subjects. All ten family members reported habitual snoring or nighttime snorting/gasping; five of ten family members also reported excessive daytime sleepiness. All studied subjects except for a pregnant woman had greater than ten apneas/hypopneas per hour. Ventilatory responses to hypoxia were markedly reduced in all five subjects studied (≤0.51 L/min/SaO2); hypercapnic responses were reduced in three morbidly obese (body mass index <29 kg/m2) or demonstrated retrognathia. The posterior airway space was reduced in three subjects, and the mandibular to hyoid distance was increased in four subjects. The two subjects with the longest soft palates and the most inferiorly displaced hyoids had the most severe sleep disorder. Sleep apnea was present, albeit less profound, in the one subject with normal anatomy who had an abnormal hypoxic ventilatory response. The distribution of these physiologic and anatomic measurements in this family provides further support for a genetic basis for SA, and suggests that the disorder may occur as a result of interactions between ventilatory control abnormalities and anatomic risk factors.

N2  - The chronobiologic question is raised whether exercise may be indicated for the pregnant woman as a general prophylactic measure and, if so, whether it should be timed according to rhythms and stage of pregnancy. This question, recently considered by others without chronobiologic focus, is here reviewed against the background of results from ongoing chronobiologic studies of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, the MESORs and circadian amplitudes of systolic (S), mean arterial (MA) and diastolic (D) BP are correlated with a questionnaire-assessed cardiovascular risk score. Such results were found under noisy ordinary conditions of life without accounting for effects of activity. They are group results, and as such require further work before they can contribute to identifying individuals at high risk in particular need of intervention, such as exercise. The dependence of exercise effects upon circadian rhythms should also prompt the use of rhythmometry at all ages for timing exercise, for gauging its effects and eventually for the optimization of fitness training for the population as well as for peak performance.

N2  - The effects of skin-to-skin contact on three indexes of energy expenditure: heart rate, activity level, and behavioral state, were examined in a pilot study. It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.

N2  - Clonidine is a recommended antihypertensive for use during pregnancy, although little is known of its fetal effects. This study examines the effects of clonidine on breathing and sleep-state cycling in fetal lambs. Clonidine was infused into a fetal lateral ventricle for up to 24 hours at 128 to 135 days' gestation. Control infusions of artificial cerebrospinal fluid had no effect. Clonidine infusion significantly reduced the incidence and episode duration of fetal breathing for the duration of the infusion period. Cycling of electrocortical activity became irregular and rapid, and the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity (equivalent to quiet sleep) was reduced. Fetal heart rate decreased but arterial pressure was unaffected. After infusion the breathing incidence and episode duration both increased significantly compared with control, with continuous high-amplitude breathing for several hours, whereas the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity remained low. Because lung development is promoted by fetal breathing, long-term use of clonidine during pregnancy could slow lung development by reducing fetal breathing activity.

N2  - In western societies a high frequency of heartburn, nausea and vomiting occur during pregnancy. The causes and mechanisms of these clinical symptoms remain poorly understood. Evidence suggests steroid hormones modulate gastrointestinal transit time and plasma peptide hormones, while peptide hormone modulated food intake and preferences. Since diurnal and episodic release of steroid and peptide hormones occur, it is postulated that heartburn and other digestive dysfunction during pregnancy are associated with elevated steroid and peptide (β-endorphin, NPY) hormone interaction with innate biological rhythms controlling the gastrointestinal tract.

N2  - Maternal genetic factors and/or fetal genetic factors contribute to variations in response to prenatal alcohol exposure. To assess the contribution of maternal genotype to ethanol teratogenesis, a reciprocal cross study was conducted in an animal model using C57BL/6J (B6) and long-sleep (LS) mice. B6 mice are more susceptible than LS mice to prenatal ethanol-induced malformations but both mouse stocks are susceptible to fetal weight deficits following in utero alcohol exposure. B6 and LS dams were reciprocally mated to B6 or LS males producing four embryonic genotype groups: the true-bred B6B6 and LSLS genotypes, and the genetically similar B6LS and LSB6 genotypes (the F1 genotype). Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on gestation day 18, weighed, and assessed for soft tissue or skeletal malformations. Results showed a greater litter weight deficit and increased total malformation rate in ethanol-exposed F1 litters carried by B6 mothers compared to ethanol-exposed F1 litters carried by LS mothers. This result would be expected only if maternal genetic factors contribute significantly towards susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. The influence of the LS mother was to decrease susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the B6 mother while the influence of the B6 mother was to increase susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the LS mother. The average malformation rate for F1 litters was significantly less than the predicted midparental value. This shows that the F1 genotype exhibited dominance towards resistance to prenatal alcohol effects. There was no differential effect of prenatal treatment on male and female fetuses for any embryonic genotype, indicating that the differential teratogenic response between F1 litters was not due to sex-linked traits. Likewise, weight gain due to pregnancy and maternal blood ethanol levels did not differ among genotypes. It was concluded that genetic factors differentially influence maternal physiological response to ethanol, which in turn affects teratogenic responses in F1 litters. Separation of maternal physiological mechanism from fetal mechanisms responsible for ethanol teratogenic susceptibility is needed for targeting women and infants at risk. Such knowledge will help in formulating effective therapeutic intervention strategies.

N2  - Doppler velocity waveforms from atrioventricular valves were recoreded in 20 healthy fetuses at 36 - 48 weeks of gestation during both behavioural states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). No significant changes were found in the ratios between the velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active ventricular filling (E/A ratios) at the level of both mitral and tricuspid valves when the measurements obtained during states 1F and 2F were compared. Moreover, during state 2F the left ventricular output increased and the right ventricular output decreased, resulting in a marked modification of the right to left cardiac output ratio. Our data suggest a redistribution of cardiac output in favour of the left side of the heart during state 2F.

N2  - Delay in fetal maturation in diabetic and accelerated fetal maturation in hypertensive pregnancies have been reported in the past. The spontaneous activity of fetal nervous system during pregnancy was followed longitudinally in a group of 29 normal pregnancies from 28th to 40th week of gestation by means of fetal behavioural states determination. If state (quiet sleep) progressively increases from median values of 5.0% to values of 22.5-25% at term of pregnancy. This state represents the positive activity of inhibitory centers and has been related to a positive evolutionary process of brain maturation according to preceding experiences conducted on experimental models and preterm babies followed with EEG and direct observation in the early neonatal period. The method of behavioural states determination has been applied to a group of 33 gestational diabetes (GDM) pregnant women followed longitudinally, and a clear reduction of development of 1F state has been evidentiated, with significant differences (p<0.001) at 35-36 weeks of gestation versus the control group. The normal values are reached in concomitance with L/S value of maturity. In 30 pregnant women affected by gestational hypertension (GH) different result are obtained: 1F state seems to develop earlier, and is increased (p<0.001) around 30-32 weeks versus the control group if a fetal growth reduction is present. The value of 1F behavioural state in the evaluation of fetal condition of pathological pregnancies is discussed.

N2  - In 1960 Hellbrugge reported that newborns and infants establish a circadian rhythm 2-3 years after birth. After that, in 1978 Abe et al. reported circadian rhythms of body temperature observed 10-11 months after birth by a 6-point measurement method every 4 hours. In addition, in 1980 Czeisler et al., in a thesis related to circadian rhythms of body temperature, reported that increasing episodes of REM stage sleep became a trigger for a rise in body temperature. Therefore, we decided to carry out trials to examine whether or not the sleep stage is able to trigger changes in body temperature and to confirm the existence of a rhythm. Four cases of 30-week gestation premature infants were selected as subjects and over a 10-week period the body temperature was measured periodically at one-week intervals.

N2  - The circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol was studied in 10 healthy women every 4 weeks throughout pregnancy. In addition, in 12 women the diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol, serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, plasma CRH and serum progesterone were analysed in late third trimester pregnancy and again 3-5 days after delivery. Salivary cortisol profiles exhibited a clear circadian rhythm during pregnancy with an increase in mean salivary cortisol from the 25th to 28th week onwards reaching concentrations in late pregnancy more than twice as high as in non-pregnant controls, rapidly returning to normal concentrations after delivery. The coefficient of variation of salivary cortisol profiles decreased in third trimester pregnancy due to a parallel upward shift of cortisol concentrations (40.2 ± 3.4% vs 77.6% ± 66.% after delivery, P < 0.01). A diurnal pattern was also found for plasma ACTH and serum cortisol before and after delivery with lower concentrations post-partum (P < 0.01). In late pregnancy, progesterone concentrations were significantly higher in the evening (930 ± 85 nmol/l vs 813 ± 74 nmol/l at 0900 h, P < 0.01) but showed no diurnal variation post-partum. Plasma CRH was significantly elevated in late third trimester pregnancy (1.22 ± 0.23 μg/l at 0900 h) but showed no diurnal change (1.30 ± 0.28 μg/l at 1900 h). Moreover, no correlation between the free cortisol increase in late pregnancy and plasma CRH was noted despite a wide range of CRH levels (0.13-3.60 μg/l). In contrast, a significant correlation was observed between the serum progesterone increase and the salivary cortisol increase in late pregnancy (r = 0.70, P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that placental CRH is not the only regulator of maternal ACTH and cortisol release. Instead, our study suggests that placental CRH has little influence on baseline maternal adrenocortical function in pregnancy. The elevated salivary cortisol levels in pregnancy may be explained by glucocorticoid resistance owing to the antiglucocorticoid action of high progesterone concentrations.

N2  - Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed in 17 normotensive and 19 preeclamptic pregnant women. The normotensive women showed a significant nightly decline in their systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, the preeclamptic women demonstrated either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm at all. This result was even more pronounced in patients with severe hypertension, some of whom had a nocturnal increase in blood pressure in spite of being treated with antihypertensive drugs in an evening dose. The lack of nocturnal blood pressure decrease was also found 24 hours post partum. In summary, these results suggest that preeclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies mostly during the night. Therefore blood pressure controls should be extended into the night, and antihypertensive drugs should also be given in a sufficient evening dose.

N2  - The association between respiratory complications of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and prematurity in infants has not been described completely. We studied 82 consecutive infants less than 6 months of age with major respiratory symptoms suspected to be caused by GER. Twenty-eight patients had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Extended (18 to 24 hours) esophageal pH monitoring was used to document GER with a pH score. Respiratory complications were considered to be caused by GER if a prolonged mean duration of sleep reflux (ZMD) was found. Seventy-five of the 82 (91%) infants had documented GER, but only 45 (55%) had a prolonged ZMD. The incidence of GER was high regardless of the gestational age at birth, postconceptual age at time of study, and the presence of BPD. The incidence of a prolonged ZMD was higher in infants who were 34 to 39 weeks' gestation (10/12, 83%) than in infants who were less than 34 weeks' gestation at birth (15/37, 41%; P = .01). The incidence of a prolonged ZMD was lowest in infants 39 weeks or less postconceptual age at the time of study (4/14, 29%; P = .017). Most infants with BPD did not have a prolonged ZMD (12/28, 43%). However, 11 of the 12 (92%) infants with BPD and a prolonged ZMD showed dramatic improvement after effective antireflux therapy compared with 0 of 16 infants with BPD and normal ZMD (P < .001). In conclusion, the incidence of reflux-induced respiratory complications as determined by a prolonged ZMD appears to be low in infants before 39 weeks postconceptual age, even though the incidence of GER is high. This observation suggests that the development of a prolonged ZMD may involve factors other than GER that occur near term. The presence of a prolonged ZMD is probably not a major factor in the development of BPD, but it may delay recovery from BPD.

N2  - Preliminary results obtained from 26 cases of prolactinomas less than 20 mm in diameter after treatment by enlarged adenomectomy are described. The operation consisted in removal of the adenoma, a layer of normal pituitary at the outer edge of the tumour and the pituitary capsule in contact with the sellar meninges, 24 women and 2 men were involved whose prolactin levels (PRL) were less than 200 ng/ml. All presented abnormal PRL responses to Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and Metoclopramide (MCP) tests and an absence of a nocturnal rise in the sleep cycle study. Postoperatively, three patients developed transitory diabetes insipidus and five transitory adrenal insufficiency. Gonadotropin reserve was always found normal. All 24 women resumed normal menstrual cycles and two became pregnant within one year. From a serological viewpoint, after surgery 100% of patients were found to be normal for levels of prolactin but only 85% turned to normal dynamic tests. The results of this small series of enlarged adenomectomies seem better than those obtained using selective adenomectomy, but must be confirmed with time.

N2  - In 1972, fetal breathing movements were clinically rediscovered. Details of their episodic occurrence, frequency, inspired volume, pleural pressure, and the nearly absolute independence of fetal blood gases were investigated in animal experiments. In the human being, there is also an association between fetal breathing and sleep state: fetal breathing movements were confined almost exclusively to periods of REM sleep. The pattern of respiratory frequency changes as gestation progresses; the rates decrease as term approaches. Hardly and breathing movement can be detected during labor. The fetal respiratory centre is capable of rhythmic movements, but there is a lack of response to basic chemical stimuli from the periphery of the body. The association between fetal breathing and REM sleep implies that the connection between breathing and behaviour is already established before birth; but in the fetus, the link between breathing and metabolism is not yet forged. Throughout postnatal life this linkage predominantly regulates breathing. The difference between fetus and newborn in the reaction to chemical stimuli implies a change at birth related to the glomera cells of the carotid bodies. Under the influence of the marked increase in the sympathetic tone there is a major increase in the sensitivity of the receptor cells to oxygen deficiency immediately after birth.

N2  - Individual sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of functional deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure. To examine this hypothesis, Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day on days 7 through 15 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Offspring were fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. Males and females from each litter were challenged with an acute dose of ethanol (3.8 g/kg) at 30 days of age. Measures of sleep time duration, waking blood ethanol concentrations (BEC), rectal temperatures, heart rate, and ethanol clearance were obtained to examine whether the acute effects of ethanol are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not differentially affect responses to ethanol challenge within either genotype. Ethanol-induced hypothermia, heart-rate depression, and sleep time did differ between genotypes, with LS more affected than SS mice. Ethanol clearance rates were faster for SS than LS mice. These results suggest postnatal pharmacological responses to acute ethanol challenge are not altered by prenatal alcohol exposure in LS and SS mice. Prenatal alcohol-exposed offspring of both mouse genotypes showed lower average heart rate responses than controls, suggesting this measure may be a sensitive indicator of prenatal alcohol effects in mice.

N2  - To determine the association between maternal activity and pregnancy outcome, the authors investigated the separate influences of time, physical effort, and posture at work, both at a job in the home, on birth weight. Study subjects were 1,507 of 1,889 women appearing consecutively for antenatal care at a district general hospital in inner London, England, in 1982-1984. Data were collected prospectively by interview and examination at several stages of pregnancy. Multivariable linear regression was used to distinguish associations with physical activity from confounding by other factors. The mean birth weight of infants born to women in full-time employment was 49 g less than that for births to women not in paid work (95 percent confidence interval (CI) 1097 g). However, the difference was due to confounding, and after adjustment, full-time employment was associated with a 12-g increase in birth weight (95 percent CI -39 to 63 g). There was little difference in birth weight related to gestational stage at leaving work. Duration, physical effort required, and energy expenditure in paid work and in work at home had no discernible association with birth weight. A small increase in birth weight was associated with increased hours of sleep. These data allow estimates of associations with birth weight as precise as 80 g. Within the range of activities performed by pregnant women in the population studied, birth weight is unlikely to be associated with maternal physical activity.

N2  - In a prospective, blinded study 38 infants of mothers with varying quantities of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy had an EEG at 40 weeks post conceptional age. Bayley Development Tests were administered between 1.5 and 10 months of age. The total power of the EEG during REM sleep was inversely related to subsequent motor development (r = -0.51, F = 13.1, p < 0.0008) whereas the total power of the EEG during quiet sleep was inversely related to subsequent mental development (r = 0.61, F = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In alcohol exposed babies EEG abnormalities were present even in the absence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In 16 older children born to abstainers or alcoholic mother similar results were obtained. Thus, the power of the EEG during REM and quiet sleep at birth appears to be a sensitive index of alcohol effects on the fetal brain and may be used to predict future motor and mental development.

N2  - Documented studies have indicated that sleep loss occurs in women during the third trimester of pregnancy. This study quantified the third trimester and intrapartal sleep of 28 primigravid women to identify the relationship between sleep loss and the presence of anxiety, hostility, and depression on the first postpartum day. The study sample reported an increase in third-trimester sleep but significant intrapartal sleep loss. A computation of Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated no significant relationship between sleep loss and moods of anxiety, hostility, and depression.

N2  - Studies indicate that sleep is disturbed throughout the maternity cycle. The sleep disturbance, leading to reduced sleep time, has been associated with a variety of physical, behavioral, and psychological problems. When these are superimposed on the normal pregnancy and child birth, the potential for altered health is increased. Nursing intervention to identify sleep deficit and promote sleep is required at all stages of the maternity cycle. A knowledge of sleep structure and the role of each stage of sleep is a prerequisite in understanding the value of sleep in health.

N2  - In adults of several species arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) stimulate pancreatic secretion of immunoreactive plasma glucagon (IRG). In fetal sleep AVP is an important stress hormone and may be simultaneously secreted with OT; however, their effects on IRG secretion are not known. We sought to determine fi AVP and/or OT affected pancreatic IRG secretion in fetal and neonatal sheep. Either AVP or OT was infused for 30 min in chronically catheterized fetal and neonatal sheep, obtaining peripheral arterial and/or portal venous blood samples before; 10, 15, and 30 min during; and 15, 30, and 60 min after infusion for measurements of blood gases, hematocrit, IRG, immunoreactive plasma insulin (IRI) and plasma glucose. AVP did not affect Irg or IRI in fetal sheep (mean ± SE, 133 ± 1 days gestation), but small increases occured in portal venous blood of lambs (2-49 days old). In contrast, OT (4.6 ± 0.3 mU/min·kg; n = 12) increased fetal plasma IRG from 72 ± 5 to 86 ± 6 and 97 ± 7 pg/ml (P < 0.001) and IRI from 16 ± 2 to 20 ± 3 and 20 ± 2 μU/ml (P < 0.02) at 15 and 30 min, respectively; 157 ± 11 μU OT/min·kg had no effect. In lambs (2-49 days old), 3.0 mU OT/min·kg increased arterial (n = 15) IRG from 139 ± 19 to 367 ± 43 and 483 ± 76 pg/ml (P < 0.01) and portal IRG (n = 8) from 167 ± 39 to 341 ± 72 and 502 ± 148 pg/ml (P < 0.01), respectively. Arterial and portal IRI also rose (P < 0.01) from 36 ± 4 to 82 ± 12 and 105 ± 32 μU/ml and from 29 ± 5 to 65 ± 13 and 51 ± 7 μU/ml, respectively. Glucose was unchanged in all experiments. In fetal and neonatal sheep, AVP has minimal effects on IRG and IRI release. In contrast, OT increases both substantially; furthermore, there is a difference in fetal and neonatal responsiveness. OT may be important in modulating glucagon and insulin secretion during and after parturition.

N2  - Diurnal variations in plasma unconjugated estriol and urinary estriol were assessed in 12 pregnant women during the 3rd trimester of uncomplicated pregnancies. Commerically available 125I-labelled radioimmunoassay kits were used. The preliminary data presented here support the hypothesis that there is no circadian rhythm of unconjugated plasma estriol in normal late pregnancy. Total urinary estriol reaches a nadir during the sleep hours (24.00-6.00). A biological carrier 'stick' for estriol measurements might serve as the test of choice in the monitoring of high-risk pregnancy as well as for identifying pregnancies complicated by chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down's syndrome).

N2  - The present study was performed to assess the changes of plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in preeclampsia, and to clarify the character of circadian variations of plasma COP in preeclampsia. During the third trimester of a normal pregnancy, plasma COP values were 21.0 ± 0.2 at 28-31 weeks' gestation, 19.3 ± 0.5 at 32-35 weeks' gestation and 20.4 ± 0.5 mmHg at 36 weeks or more of gestation. These values were significantly lower than those in normal non-pregnant subjects (23.5 ± 0.6). In preeclampsia, plasma COP values (14.7 ± 0.4) were significantly lower than those in normal pregnancy. A circadian variation of plasma COP confirmed a clear circadian rhythm with the acrophase at afternoon in all subjects, and there were no differences among normal non-pregnant, pregnant and severe preeclamptic women. These results indicate that circadian variations of plasma COP are not influenced by either pregnancy or preeclampsia, though plasma COP in preeclampsia significantly decreases.

N2  - Fetal rapid eye movements (REM), breathing movements (BM), and trunk movements (TM) were observed through the use of 3 ultrasonic real-time scanners. Each movement was recorded with the event marker and quantitatively analyzed in relation to the development of the sleep-wakefulness cycle by a computer-assisted system. The results were as follows: The number of REM increased with gestational age. The appearance rate of REM reached a certain level after 32 weeks of gestation. REM-non-REM rhythm was distinguished after 32 weeks. The relationship between REM and BM increased with gestational age. The occurrence of each TM has no correlation to that of REM when it was analyzed in short-term units, but the incidence of TM was high in REM periods. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in human fetuses.

N2  - Genetic factors have been implicated as contributing to the considerable variation in the severity of alcohol-related birth defects in offspring of women who drink heavily during pregnancy. Two animal models of alcohol-related developmental effects incorporated different behavior genetic approaches to examine genetic influences on brain and body growth following alcohol exposure during development. The first, extensively developed in Sprague-Dawley rats, examined the effects of three doses of alcohol administered to two inbred rat strains (MR and M520) via artificial-rearing procedures during the early postnatal brain growth spurt. In both strains, alcohol produced a dose-dependent restriction of brain weight (but not body weight) on postnatal day 10, compared to artificially reared controls. The MR strain was more susceptible to cerebellar growth restriction than the M520 strain, an effect not attributable to strain differences in blood alcohol concentrations. In the second model, pregnant female Long-sleep and Short-sleep mice, selectively bred for differences in initial sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of acute alcohol administration, were intubated with ethanol from gestational days 7 - 18. Controls included either sucrose or maltose/dextrin intubation controls and non-intubated controls. The LS offspring showed growth deficits and brain weight reductions in adulthood, while the SS offspring were resistant to these detrimental effects of the prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, differences in either maternal or fetal genotype may contribute to individual differences in the severity of the effects of alcohol exposure during development.

N2  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of ethanol teratogenesis. To examine this hypothesis, the teratogenic effects of ethanol were compared in Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis. Inbred C57BL/6J (B6) mice were included to confirm previously reported teratogenic effects using our own treatment regimen and standard assessment techniques. Intragastric administration of ethanol (5.8 g/kg) on Days 9 and 10 of pregnancy resulted in growth retardation and an increase in prenatal mortality in LS litters but not in SS litters. Therefore, alcohol sensitivity plays a role in the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. B6 mice showed more ethanol teratogencity than either LS or SS mice, even though maternal blood ethanol levels were similar across genotypes. This result suggests genetic variations other than alcohol sensitivity also influence ethanol teratogenesis.

N2  - A total of 14 healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to determine the effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on human fetal behavioral states. Fetal behavioral state observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. During the first episode of behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep rate) ≥ 10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged ≤ 3 minutes after stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial larynx.

N2  - Thirteen healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, and gross fetal body movement patterns. All fetuses were stimulated during an episode of low fetal heart rate variability (mean minute range ≤ 32 milliseconds for ≥ 5 minutes) lasting at least 50 minutes. There was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term FHR variability, number of FHR accelerations, and gross fetal body movements after stimulation. Fetuses made breathing movements more irregularly after vibratory stimulus. We hypothesize that external low-frequency vibratory stimulus, applied during episodes of low fetal heart rate variability, causes a change from a state of quiet sleep to a state of rapid-eye-movement sleep in healthy term fetuses.

N2  - Cerebral oxidative metabolism and regional blood flow were studied, with changes in behavioral state over the immediate perinatal period, to determine the change in cerebral metabolism at birth and the relationship to behavioral activity. Nine unanesthetized fetal sheep (139-142 days gestation) were each studied during a period of high-voltage and low-voltage electrocorticogram (ECOG) activity and then again after cesarean delivery at 2 h of age while awake and at 24 h of age while awake and during a period of high-voltage ECOG sleep. Preductal arterial and sagittal vein blood samples were analyzed for O2 content, blood gases, and pH. Blood flow was measured with a radioactive microsphere technique. Cerebral oxidative metabolism showed no significant perinatal change, although a coupling to behavioral state was evident with significant increases during both the perinatal low-voltage ECOG state and the awake state at 24 h. Blood flow to the brain showed a significant perinatal decrease after birth and state-related increases during both the prenatal low-voltage ECOG state and the awake state at 24 h consistent with the tight coupling of flow and/or O2 delivery to metabolic needs reported for normal brain tissue. The cerebral metabolic rate of the prenatal low-voltage ECOG state suggested a level of functional excitation comparable with that of the awake state after birth, supporting the importance of the rapid-eye-movement (REM) state mechanism as a source of endogenous stimulation during the perinatal period of brain growth and development.

N2  - Mothers in the last trimester of the second pregnancy admit to being less active, more tired and moody than previously. Many were more anxious than usual. Their first child frequently showed behavioural changes. Those surveyed were between 1 1/2 and 4 years of age and showed more clinging, sleep disturbance and misbehaviour with tantrums than expected. It is presumed that the mother's pregnancy induces anxiety in her child with consequent behavioural changes.

N2  - A pair of preterm, opposite-sex twins were examined during the lying-in period for behavioral and morphological effects of maternal alcohol and pentazocine abuse during pregnancy. A few morphological features typical of fetal alcohol syndrome were observed in each infant, and the male infant only was above the standardized mean in minor physical anomalies. The male's behavioral scores were more likely to be deviant from the standardized mean than the female's. Specifically, the male was more irritable, both spontaneously and in response to specific stimuli; highly active while awake and handled for the presentation of stimuli; more active than average during sleep; and low on ratings that reflect the attitude of the examiner toward the infant. These findings imply individual and gender differences in behavioral susceptibility to teratogens.

N2  - Pregnant Long-Evans hooded rats were dosed via injections into the gum with 3, 6, or 9 mg/kg lidocaine, or vehicle, or were uninjected, on gestational day 4 (GD4), GD11, or GD18. Offsping (8-11 litters/group) were tested on a variety of tests of behavioral development and adult behavior. No effects of any dose at any time of administration were found upon maternal weight gain in gestation, litter size, or initial birth weight or weight gain of the pups. Administration at GD4 produced few effects; only footshock sensitivity showed a significant effect of dosing, although there were trends toward dosing effects on spontaneous alternation. For administration on GD11, lidocaine was associated with slight but significant alterations in sex ratios, and a trend toward drug effects on development of spontaneous alternation. Vehicle administration at this age reduced barbiturate sleep time in offspring and slightly altered footshock sensitivity. Lidocaine dosing on GD18 was associated with a number of significant alterations of behavior, including visual discrimination, shuttlebox avoidance, tail flick, and water maze errors; there were also both vehicle and lidocaine effects on water maze latencies. These data reinforce our previous report that lidocaine may be a behavioral teratogen, and suggest that administration in later gestation in the rat may alter a broader range of behaviors than earlier in gestation.

N2  - A case of severe obstructive sleep apnea developing during pregnancy is reported. A 27-year-old primigravida was well until the sixth month of pregnancy, when she developed loud snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography was performed at 36 weeks' gestation and revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea. The patient was treated successfully during pregnancy with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, but continued to suffer from moderate obstructive sleep apnea after delivery. This case suggests that sleep apnea may be either precipitated or exacerbated during pregnancy.

N2  - Circadian variations in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide were studied, to clarify the characteristic pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). The mean 24-h values (range) of atrial natriuretic peptide in mild and severe PIH, pregnancy-aggravated hypertension, chronic hypertension and normal pregnancy were 130.1 (97.3-207.0), 225.4 (202.8-281.8), 213.1 (183.2-249.5), 81.3 (61.8-116.1) and 77.1 (56.0-123.5) pg/ml, respectively. The values in PIH and pregnancy-aggravated hypertension were significantly higher, although those in chronic hypertension were no different from normal pregnancy. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide showed a clear circadian rhythm with acrophase in the middle of the night, in mild and severe PIH. In the other hypertensive disorders, a circadian rhythm could not be confirmed. The results indicate that the elevated values of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy relate to generalized vasoconstriction, and that the diurnal rhythm is a specific characteristic of PIH.

N2  - The ontogency of circadian rhythms is unknown. The newborn sheep has a circadian rhythm of temperature; to study the ontogeny of other rhythms, we examined the 24-h variation of plasma prolactin concentration in fetal and newborn sheep. To this effect, we measured plasma prolactin concentration in chronically catheterized fetuses (n = 7) and in newborn lambs raised under short day nycthemeral (12 light:12 dark, n = 13) or constant light conditions (n = 5). Indwelling catheters were implanted into the jugular vein and carotid artery of late gestation fetuses (0.9 gestation) and newborns (5-29 days old). Experiments were performed 4 or more days after surgery. Lambs were kept in a canvas sling were fed cow's milk either by mouth or through a nasogastric catheter at established time intervals. Haematocrit, pH, and blood gases were measured before and after the experiments in all cases and remained within normal values. Lights were on and room temperature was maintained constant during the whole experiment. Samples were obtained every 1-2 h for 24 h in fetuses and newborn lambs under nycthemeral conditions and every hour for 48 h in newborn lambs kept under constant light. Plasma prolactin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The presence of a 24 h rhythm was determined by Cosinor analysis. Fetuses, aged 129 ± 6 days (SD) n = 7, showed a variation in plasma prolactin concentration with a period of 24 h that fits the equation: plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 0.97 + 15.4 cos 15 (t-23.0), P = 0.035. Newborn lambs, aged 7.9 ± 2.3 days old (n = 11), kept under nycthemeral conditions showed a variation of plasma prolactin with a period of 24 h that fits the equation: plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 75.3 + 12.9 cos 15 (t-12.0), P = 0.036. This rhythm disappeared in newborns of 23.4 ± 3.8 days of age (n = 7). Newborn lambs, aged 22.0 ± 2.7 days (n = 5), raised under constant light, showed a 24 h variation of plasma prolactin in the individual data. These newborns showed a tendency to higher prolactin values and a wider dispersion of plasma prolactin concentration than the two other groups. To normalize the variance the group mean was calculated after log transformation. When log values were synchroniced considering the acrophase of the theoretical function as 24 h a rhythm that fits the equation: log plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 1.8 + 0.29 cos 15 (t-0.5), P = 0.031, was observed. This indicates that the rhythm of prolactin in the newborn sheep free-runs under constant light. The presence of a rhythm in plasma prolactin with a period of 24 h in fetuses and in the newborn, and the existence of this free running rhythm in newborns kept under constant light, suggest that the prolactin rhythm observed is a circadian rhythm endogenously generated. In addition, the disappearance of the rhythm in older newborns raised under short nycthemeral conditions, and its maintenance in newborns of similar age kept under constant light, suggests that the newborn sheep is sensitive to photoperiod.

N2  - Two different rhythms exist in the fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern of a full-term fetus. These rhythms seem to be related to the rhythms associated with sleep and wakefulness, but the results are not yet conclusive. In this study, at first, the states of sleep and wakefulness in newborn infants (measured simultaneously by EEG, EOG, respiration and body movement) were compared with their heart rate patterns in rest, active, awake and unclassified phases. The results suggest that in newborn infants it is possible to distinguish quiet sleep from other states of sleep and wakefulness by means of the heart rate pattern alone. In the second part of the study, NST for three consecutive hours with 24 to 41 week pregnant women was performed and examined to determine the relationship between maturity and heart rate pattern (measured minute by minute in rest, active and unclassified phases) in their fetus. The findings suggest that the rest phase in a heart rate pattern of a fetus indicates the fetus to be in a state of quiet sleep. Further, the proportional increase and significant increase in the duration of the rest phase after 34 gestational week indicate the maturity of the central nervous system of the fetus.

N2  - Behavioral state distribution in 19 preterm infants at term with good developmental prognosis was studied by 24-h video recordings. The preterm infants of shortest gestation had longer time awake and this was concentrated in the daytime. On classifying behavioral states by Prechtl's criteria, the preterm infants had a smaller amount of state 1 than healthy term infants; but a similar amount of state 5 in awake time. Preterm infants were thought to have accelerated development in terms of diurnal sleep-awake rhythm, and decelerated development in terms of the content of sleep manifested by the amount of state 1.

N2  - We have measured the concentrations of vasopressin in sequential samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from fetal lambs between 108 and 130 days gestation. There was a clear and significant (F = 4.46; P<0.005) rhythm in vasopressin concentrations in the CSF of nine fetuses, characterized by a mean trough value of 19.4 ± 6.4 pg/ml (mean ±SD) at 0200 h and a peak value of 41.1 ± 28.0 pg/ml at 1400 h. The mean cycle length was 23.2 ± 1.7 h, with the majority (>80%) of peak concentrations found during daylight hours. There were no concurrent fluctuations in concentrations of vasopressin in plasma or Na, K, Cl, or osmolality in CSF. To examine the relationship between environmental cycles of light and darkness and rhythm of vasopressin concentrations in CSF, pregnant animals were maintained in a constant light environment. In the five fetuses of ewes maintained under these conditions, the rhythm of vasopressin in CSF was markedly damped or not apparent (F = 1.50; P>0.15). These results demonstrate that prominent circadian rhythm of vasopressin in the CSF of the fetus in utero. Despite the fact that the fetus is sequestered from direct influences of the environment, exposure of the pregnant ewe to constant light disrupts the fetal pacemaker that generates the circadian rhythm of vasopressin in CSF. Studies of this rhythm in the fetal lamb, therefore, provide a means to examine the mechanisms of entrainment and assess prenatal influences on circadian organization of the fetus.

N2  - Experiences with using the biophysical profile according to Manning et al. in diagnosing the danger to the fetus in at risk pregnancy are presented. Examinations were carried out in 143 pregnant women. In 33 of them the following parameters were evaluated with respect to the values of the biophysical profile: placental maturity, urinary estriol, term and mode of termination of pregnancy, body weight, body length, and Apgar score of newborns. The authors recommend to extend this diagnostic method so that in interpreting the results it yields not only the overall clinical state of the pregnant woman should be considered but also biological rhythms of physiologic functions of the fetus as well the administration of drugs to the woman in pregnancy.

N2  - The primary neural pathway for entrainment of circadian rhythms in rodents is the retinohypothalamic tract, which conveys lighting information from the retina to a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In a precocious rodent species, the spiny mouse, the retinohypothalamic tract is present and functioning within the SCN on the day of birth, as assessed by HRP histochemistry and 14C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, respectively. Furthermore, direct perception of environmental lighting was observed in fetal spiny mice late in gestation. Direct, retina-mediated fetal light perception appears to be a less potent entraining agent than maternal cues communicating time-of-day information to the fetal spiny mouse. Nevertheless, direct fetal light perception may reinforce maternal entraining signals during the prenatal period and therefore be of physiological significance for entrainment of circadian rhythmicity in the fetus.

N2  - Sperm-positive female Long-Evans hooded rats were dosed subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg/day cocaine or an equal volume of vehicle (0.9% sterile saline) from gestation day 4 (GD4) through GD18. Offspring were assessed for development of negative geotaxis, righting reflex, spontaneous alteration, and open field activity, and for adult behaviors including DRL-20 acquisition, water maze, visual discrimination, barbiturate sleep time, shuttlebox avoidance, footshock sensitivity, and tail flick latency. Cocaine dosing produced no significant effects on dam weight gain, any measure of litter size and weight, or early postnatal behavior tests, but there were significant drug effects on development of spontaneous alternation, development of open field activity, DRL-20 acquisition, water maze performance, tail flick, and footshock sensitivity. These data suggest that chronic administration of a modest dose of cocaine during gestation in the rat alters a number of behaviors in the offspring.

N2  - The postabsorptive serum ferritin levels following normal dosages of prenatal multivitamin/multimineral supplements were studied in 17 pregnant teenagers, whose fetuses were between 16 and 20 weeks gestational age. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of a single oral dose of differing prenatal multivitamin/multimineral tablets containing 60 or 65 mg of elemental iron on the postabsorptive serum ferritin levels. Each woman was randomly tested following the ingestion of one of three different tablets, both in a fed and a fasting state. Blood samples were obtained for ferritin measurement immediately prior to ingestion of the prenatal tablet, with or without a standard meal, and at 1, 3, 6, and 8 hours postabsorption. The group mean serum ferritin levels increased dramatically during the fasting state following ingestion of the Stuart Prenatal(®) tablet and decreased when the Stuartnatal(®) 1 + 1 or Materna(®) 1.60 was ingested. The opposite results were observed when the tablets were ingested postprandially. The results of the study indicate that Stuart Prenatal was most suitable for consumption while fasting (ie, at the hour of sleep), and both Stuartnatal 1 + 1 and Materna 1.60 with a meal.

N2  - Eleven healthy fetuses between 36 and 39 weeks of gestation were studied during the active sleep state to examine effects of a 5-s vibratory acoustic stimulus on the baseline fetal heart rate and flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal carotid artery. There was an immediate marked rise in baseline fetal heart rate with concomitant drop in pulsatility index in the flow velocity waveform of the fetal internal carotid artery, which persisted for at least 15 min after the stimulus. However, when the pulsatility index was standardized for a fetal heart rate of 140 beats/min this index remained virtually unaltered. These data suggest that in the healthy term fetus during active sleep state, a vibratory acoustic stimulus has no measurable effect in cerebral vascular resistance. Since virtually all reported studies on vibratory acoustic stimulation of the fetus were carried-out during the quiet sleep state, the data from the present study do not provide any information on the safety of this device when employed as a means of assessing of fetal well-being.

N2  - Pregnant albino rats were treated during the eighth day of gestation (GD 8), with two IP injections, spaced by 4 hours, of either ethanol (2.9 g/kg in 24% v/v saline solution) or saline. Maternal blood alcohol levels reached a peak of 457 mg/dl 60 min after the second dose. At the age of 45 days, an equal number of male and female offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol and sleep time and blood ethanol levels were determined upon awakening. Ethanol metabolic rate was studied in other individuals injected with the same dose of ethanol and the slope of the linear descending portion of the curves was calculated. Animals that received ethanol in utero exhibited shorter sleep time and higher blood ethanol levels at the moment of awakening than controls. The rate of ethanol metabolism was similar in both groups. These results show that an acute intoxication with ethanol during GD 8 induced long-term changes in the CNS of offspring which caused reduced sensitivity to ethanol hypnotic effects.

N2  - Destruction of the maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) early in gestation disrupts maternal communication of time-of-day information to the rat fetus. In the present study, we demonstrated that periodic feeding (food cue) to SCN-lesioned pregnant rats entrains the fetal biological clock. The phase of the drinking behavior rhythm was examined in pups reared in constant darkness, beginning at weaning. In several control (uncued) litters, pup phases at weaning were scattered. In other control litters where within-litter coordination of phase was observed, the average litter phase was unpredictable. In contrast, drinking rhythms of pups whose dams had received food cue during gestation were synchronized within- and between-litters, suggesting that prenatal food cue entrained the fetuses. The effect of food cue occurs prenatally, as similar results were obtained when offspring of SCN-lesioned, cued dams were fostered to lesioned, uncued dams on the day of birth. The present results, along with data from this and other laboratories, suggest that redundant mechanisms communicate time-of-day information to the fetus.

N2  - Fifty-seven infants exposed to phencyclidine (PCP) in utero were followed for the first year of life. Thirty-six (65%) of the 55 for whom birth records were available manifested symptoms of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome, including 16 (52%) of those whose mothers denied opiate abuse during pregnancy. Temperament problems were noted in 47% of the babies and sleep problems in 14%. The majority of infants grew normally, but a larger than expected number started out small and remained small. Testing using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age one year revealed a mental development index (mean ±SD) of 94±10 and a psychomotor development index of 98±10. Attachment behavior was abnormal in 17%. Most infants were cared for by their natural mother. Further studies are needed to determine later effects of in utero PCP exposure, as well as effects on the infants being raised by women who have used PCP. Phencyclidine toxicity needs to be considered when evaluating babies with signs of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome.

N2  - In 16 normal pregnancies the relationship between the blood flow velocity waveform and fetal behavioral states at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation was studied. Whereas behavioral state independency was established for the acceleration time, peak flow velocity demonstrated a statistically significant reduction during active sleep, compared with quiet sleep. These data reflect reduced ductal flow and suggest a redistribution in the left-ventricular and right-ventricular output in favor of the left side of the heart during active sleep. Peak flow velocities in the fetal ductus arteriosus were independent of fetal heart rate.

N2  - Bilateral testicular tumours are a rare but well described complication of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It can be extremely difficult to distinguish histologically between Leydig cell tumours and adrenocortical rest hyperplasia which may lead in some cases to unnecessary orchidectomy in young men. A 26-year-old male in whom CAH had been diagnosed neonatally, was referred for further investigation of a craggy mass in the left testis. Six months earlier, right orchidectomy had been performed after presentation with bilateral enlarged, hard testes and azoospermia. The tumour was interpreted to be a malignant interstitial cell tumour of the testis. Our investigations revealed that this CAH was inadequately controlled and that the hormonal secretion from the remaining left testicular mass was ACTH dependent. Percutaneous venous sampling revealed high concentrations of cortisol and other adrenocortical hormones coming from the gonadal vein. Dexamethasone suppressed these adrenal hormones and reduced the size and softened the consistency of the testicular mass. Total disappearance of the mass was achieved by using dexamethasone, given in a reverse circadian rhythm regimen. Spermatogenesis returned and the patient's wife became pregnant after 6 months; she gave birth to a normal male infant. To our knowledge, this is the first time in this clinical setting that fertility has been achieved. This case highlights the need for both a functional and histological assessment of such 'tumours' in CAH prior to orchidectomy.

N2  - To assess the effect of endogenous human atrial natriuretic peptide on the vascular system in preeclampsia, the circadian variations of plasma human atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate, cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate, and blood pressure were measured. In severe preeclamptic women, the mean 24-hour values of human atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate rose significantly compared with those in normal nonpregnant and pregnant women. Also, in severe preeclamptic women, circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate, and blood pressure confirmed the same circadian rhythm with acrophase during the middle of the night. Plasma cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate values did not differ significantly among the three groups and did not confirm a circadian rhythm. These results suggest that plasma human atrial natriuretic peptide may not strongly influence blood pressure, although it may induce the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles via the cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate system in preeclampsia.

N2  - The mechanisms of the embryotoxic effects of the anticonvulsant drug, phenytoin (PHT), are unknown. Glucorticoids and PHT demonstrate similar embryopathic effects and strain sensitivity in that A/J mice are very sensitive to the embryopathic effects of synthetic glucocorticoids and PHT while C57BL/6 (B6) mice are comparatively resistant to both. It is possible that teratogenic consequences of PHT are not a result of drug interaction at the target site but are mediated indirectly by glucocorticoids. In this study, PHT was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 25 (a nonteratogenic dose) or 75 mg/kg body weight (a teratogenic dose) to pregnant A/J mice on Day 10 of gestation. Mice of the B6 strain received the drug at 75 mg/kg on Day 10. Control mice received vehicle (pH 11.0 distilled water). Dams were killed at various times after the injection; plasma samples were obtained, and corticosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. In control animals, maternal plasma corticosterone levels were elevated soon after dosing but gradually declined, except for an apparent circadian rhythm effect seen in samples obtained in the afteroon. Administration of a nonteratogenic dose of PHT to A/J mice caused a temporary increase in plasma corticosterone levels which decreased to the control level between 6 and 24 hr following dosing. Treatment with a teratogenic dose in A/J mice led to plasma levels that remained elevated for the entire 48-hr period examined in this study. In B67 mice, treatment with 75 mg/kg increased plasma corticosterone levels for 24 hr, after which they declined to the control value by 30 hr. The adrenal corticosteroid response of A/J mice to PHT appeared to be much more sensitive than that of B6 mice, and there appeared to be a relationship between plasma levels of PHT and corticosterone. The lengthy increase in plasma corticosterone during organogenesis may be a factor in the increased incidence of cleft lip and palate seen after administration of PHT to A/J mice.

N2  - Seasonality of the reproductive cycle in sheep is a general phenomenon for mid-latitude breeds. The proximal part (breeding season) and also partially distal part (end of gestation and beginning of lactation) of this cycle is controlled by photoperiod, whatever the form of light regimens. Data are presented which indicate that male and female do not necessarily have the same photoperiodic sensitivity. Gonadal stimulation in the ram starts 1.5-2 months earlier than in the ewe under annual variations. Photoperiod controls the reproductive cycle by the intermediary of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. There are both a steroid-independent and a steroid-dependent effect of light, depending on both decreasing and increasing daylength in mid-latitudes. Data are also presented which support Bunning's hypothesis on photoperiodic time measurement in mammals. Sheep measure photoperiodic time by using a circadian rhythm of photosensitivity. Daylength is not measured by the total duration of exposure to light but by the illumination of two special set points during the day, one of them entraining the circadian rhythm of photosensitivity and the other inducing or not inducing a physiological response if it is coincident, or not coincident, with photoinducible phase of that rhythm. A photoinducible phase has been found for prolactin secretion, and perhaps also for LH secretion. Melatonin secretion is used by sheep for measuring daylength. However, that secretion disappears during two set points during the day, thus raising the possibility of using alternatively melatonin and light pulse for controlling the reproductive cycle in sheep.

N2  - The evaluation of prenatal behavioural states is reported in normal and PIH pregnancies in the aim of fetal neurological investigation. After a complete construction of longitudinal normal values of different behavioural states, a group of PIH pregnancies is compared. The most significative differences are related to 1F (quiet sleep) state, which appears modified in all gestational ages considered. The possible relations with fetal maturations are described.

N2  - Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, were administered ethanol (2.9, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0 g/kg) twice per day during the period of organogenesis. On gestation day 18, the dams were sacrificed and the uterine horns were examined for live, dead, and resorbed fetuses. Live fetuses were weighed and assessed for either skeletal or soft tissue anomalies. The 5.8 g/kg/day dose had no effect on prenatal mortality, litter size, body weight, or number of physical anomalies in either line. However, the alcohol-sensitive LS mice exposed to ethanol doses of 8.0 g/kg/day or more evidenced decreased body weights while weights for the alcohol-insensitive SS mice differed from controls at only the highest dose tested. The incidence of skeletal variants was increased in the LS mice exposed to the 10 g/kg/day ethanol dose. These results indicate genetically-mediated alcohol sensitivity increases susceptibility to some of the fetotoxic effects of in utero alcohol exposure.

N2  - The fetal behaviour of 15 asymmetrical intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) fetuses was compared to that of a control group of healthy fetuses. Fetuses underwent simultaneous cardiotocographic and ultrasonographic examinations for 2 consecutive hours at 36-38 weeks' gestation. Behavioural states analysis was carried out by means of a computerized system (Digital PDP 11) that allowed the recording of several fetal variables including heart rate (FHR), gross body movements (FM), eye movements (FEM) and breathing movements (FBM). FHR was classified in four different patterns (FHRP) according to NIJHUIS et al.; fetal movements were automatically synchronized with FHR and grouped for each FHRP. Several quantitative parameters (i.e. incidence, mean duration, lag time, % time spent moving) were then computed for each movement. There were no statistical differences in the distribution of FHRP between healthy and IUGR fetuses. On the other hand quantitative differences were found when the movements investigated were related to FHRP. In IUGR fetuses FEM were mainly represented by low frequency movements (IEM) during both low (FHRP A) and high variability (FHRP B) FHRP, whereas healthy fetuses exhibited mostly rapid eye movements (REM) during FHRP B and absent type of FEM during FHRP A. Moreover IUGR fetuses showed a reduction of state 1F (quiet sleep) and an increase of periods of no coincidence between behavioural state variable when compared to the control group fetuses. These findings, therefore, suggest the existence of quantitative differences in fetal behaviour in asymmetrical IUGR fetuses when compared to healthy fetuses.

N2  - Fetal lambs were prepared for chronic intrauterine recording of behavioral states and breathing movements during the third trimester of pregnancy. Pilocarpine administered directly to the fetus produced an immediate change from quiet sleep to arousal. Neither the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep nor the latency to REM sleep was affected. Associated with this change in sleep-wake patterns, pilocarpine produced a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of fetal breathing movements. These effects of pilocarpine on behavioral states and breathing movements were blocked by atropine sulfate but not by methylatropine. We conclude that the increased incidence of breathing movements produced by pilocarpine are due, in part, to increased arousal at the expense of quiet sleep. As a result, the fetus alternates between arousal and REM sleep, and this behavioral pattern results in sustained breathing movements. In addition, pilocarpine increases the incidence of breathing movements in all three behavioral states. These effects of pilocarpine are mediated primarily via central muscarinic sites of action.

N2  - Even a nonprofessional observer is impressed by the efforts made by the mothers to carefully, painstakingly reanalyze every detail of the last moments and actions, in an almost desperate attempt to identify what went wrong, what each of them did wrong. Even her own sleep is perceived as not free from guilt. Then, the analysis goes backwards again, to the type of feeding, to the adherence to the golden rules; and then it goes further back, to the pregnancy, and to her habits: did she smoke, did she take some prescription drugs that might have caused harm; and, more important and painful: was the pregnancy a desired one, or one just accepted, or one meant to pursue other goals, in the relationship with either the husband or other persons. These questions, we all know, come back over and over again. Despite the well-recognized presence of the maternal feeling of guilt in the mothers of SIDS victims, there have been few attempts to investigate this problem in detail. Some relatively superficial and obvious reasons for guilty feelings include the following: (1) failure to have insured her own survival through her child, as an expression of continuation of herself; (2) an inferiority feeling in comparison to the other women; (3) fear of forgetting the infant because of the few memories - often there is not even a picture; and so on. There is, however, a deeper level at which the guilty feelings are related to the development of the feminine identity and to the beginning of the desire to become a mother. Within a psychoanalytical approach, it is accepted that this desire does not depend only on instinct, or on hormonal release, or on the learning of a social role, but that it is also the end-product of the emotional events and fantasies originated by the conflict with the mother, the ambivalent desire and fear of making a child with her own father (what is called the resolution of the Oedipal complex). It is worth noting that it is in conjunction with these infantile fantasies that there is the development of the superego, the internal judge and censor that condemns these wishes. There is an abundance of studies, within psychological research, on maternity and on the consequences of these unsolved conflicts. As an example, the classic study by Maria Langer, based on data collected from a large population of women who were either in departments of obstetrics or undergoing individual psychotherapy, shows that many somatic disturbances, including obstacles to the reproductive process, depend on persisting fears of being punished by an interiorized and vindictive mother who will make her daughter pay for those infantile wishes. She also showed that the resolution, during therapy, of these fears eliminates the physical symptoms as well. Does this relate to SIDS? The mystery still surrounding the SIDS event, the related lack of adequate explanations, the circumstances (often nighttime), the occurrence during the neonatal period - all this can well elicit the same problem. The study by Mandel on mothers of SIDS victims, showing the many difficulties with their subsequent pregnancies, seems to fit well with this concept. The material collected in this work, the dreams of the mothers of SIDS victims and the Rorschach tests, points to the presence of deep fears of persecution and of feelings that parts of oneself are damaged and destructive. This is true even in mothers for whom the sequence of events was such as to completely rule out any, even minor, responsibility for the infant's death. It is important to note that guilty feelings and defense mechanisms against aggressive impulses are normal mechanisms that, in varying degrees, can be found in every man and woman. The SIDS event brings to the surface something which is already there. It is essential to distinguish between reality and the world of emotions and aggressive fantasies that can easily produce guilty feelings preceived as real. This concept could be of practical use for the professionals involved in SIDS. The physician who deals with the mothers of SIDS victims should not be frightened by being exposed to the latent emotional dynamics, even if he is working only at the ego level, i.e., giving information, answering questions, and so on. Because of his respected position, of his knowledge on what has to be done, the physician has a special power and role. He could tell the mother 'I have heard your doubts, your fears, I know where are they coming from, and I know that you are not really guilty.' For once, the physician could become the good and loving mother.

N2  - A circadian pacemaker, thought to be within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, begins to function before birth in rodents. Prenatal entrainment of the pacemaker appears to be mediated by signals regulated by the maternal SCN; ablation of the mother's SCN during gestation disrupts the normal phase of the pups' rhythms. The present paper presents an experimental approach for identifying candidate entraining signals and for testing when they are effective during development. The candidate signal examined in these experiments was the pineal gland hormone, melatonin. Female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) received SCN lesions on day 7 of gestation. During the last week of gestation, they were given two daily subcutaneous injections of oil 12 h apart. One of the injections each day contained melatonin (10, 50, or 100 μg). The phases of the pups' activity rhythms were measured at weaning and were found to be related to the timing of the daily injection that contained melatonin, demonstrating that the melatonin directly or indirectly set the phase of the pups' rhythms. Injections given over 4 days of gestation were found to be as effective as injections given over 7 days. Although a physiological role for melatonin as an entraining signal has not been demonstrated, the results show that exogenous, prenatal treatment can predictably set the phase of the offsprings' circadian rhythms.

N2  - The degree of fetal heart rate dependency of pulsatility index measurements in the fetal descending aorta, internal carotid artery, and umbilical artery was studied relative to quiet and active sleep states in normal and growth-retarded fetuses at 37-38 weeks of gestation. In all vessels an inverse relationship between pulsatility index and heart rate was established. The degree of this inverse relationship varies proportionally with the level of peripheral vascular resistance in the vessel studied.

N2  - Two craniopagus twins sharing some common cerebral circulation but no common brain structures were recorded polygraphically and continuously observed for behavioral sleep states and wakefulness. The observations lasted 9.5 h when the twins were 12 weeks postgestation and for 24 h at 16 weeks post gestation, or ~4 weeks postterm. Sleep onsets were synchronous 67% of the time (±5 min), but arousals were synchronous only 38% of the time (±5 min) at 16 weeks postgestation. The recordings reported here are the longest ever made of craniopagus twins. This report is consistent with some interdependence of the sleep of each twin on the other. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

N2  - We have previously shown that acute exposure to low-dose morphine stimulates arousal and breathing movements in the fetal lamb. We now report on the effects of subacute low-dose morphine exposure on the regulation of fetal sleep-wake behavior and breathing patterns. Morphine was infused to 11 fetal lambs (121-129 days gestation) at a constant rate of 400 μg/h for 7 days via a mini osmotic pump implanted subcutaneously in the maternal flank and connected directly to an indwelling catheter in the fetal vena cava. On day 1, morphine resulted in a state of arousal in all fetuses, with loss of quiet sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This response was greatly reduced by day 2 and was insignificant by day 3, despite continuous drug exposure. There was no decrease in plasma morphine levels. Two fetuses died during morphine exposure. Upon removal of the pump, all fetuses exhibited disturbances in their sleep cycles within 1-3 h, with an increase in arousal time and loss of REM sleep. The duration of the arousal and quiet sleep episodes was also greatly reduced. Such disturbances were noted for 3-4 days after termination of morphine infusion. Four fetuses were delivered prematurely (131-136 days) during this period. These results demonstrate the rapid onset of tolerance to low-dose morphine exposure in the fetus and the development of physical dependence, as manifested by a mild abstinence syndrome characterized by sleep-wake disturbances.

N2  - A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer from symptoms similar to the 'rape trauma syndrome', which has been reported in adults. Symptoms similar to the rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p<.01. Common somatic complaints in the sexual abuse patients included dysuria, vaginal discharge and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral problems noted during the follow-up period among the sexual abuse patients included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts. The duration of abuse and age of the victim at the time of abuse significantly affected the frequency of reported somatic symptoms, but the type of abuse and type of assailant did not significantly affect the frequency of reported somatic and emotional reactions. There was no difference in the occurrence of school problems and early pregnancy between sexually abused patients and controls. Since 67% of all sexually abused patients suffered from emotional and somatic reactions, close follow-up of these patients is indicated.
