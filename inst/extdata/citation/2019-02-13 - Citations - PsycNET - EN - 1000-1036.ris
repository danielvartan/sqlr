N2  - Four groups of Wistar albino rats were given 18 trials, one a day, on the Maier 3-table-test. The groups consisted of a control group (N = 30) of offspring of normal rats, and three groups (N = 33, 30, 34) whose mothers had been dosed respectively with 40, 80, and 120 mgm. per kgm. of body weight per day of sodium bromide from the third through the twentieth day of gestation. All groups by blood test showed a normal concentration of bromide for at least 40 days before experimentation at 106 to 124 days of age. The bromide groups showed significantly poorer "pass" scores, error scores, and time scores, and greater variability of time and error scores than the control group. Differences were not significant between the various bromide groups. Thus bromide dosage of mothers was judged to have a persisting adverse effect on a "higher order nervous process" in their offspring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This is a college textbook for classes in child development and care, and will also serve as a reference work for lay readers of college caliber. The author has synthesized facts from the appropriate sciences (biochemistry, biology, genetics, psychology, and education) in terms of the phenomena of childhood. Her philosophy is organismic; she views the child as a behaving, integrated organism. Three divisions comprise the text: "Before the Child" has chapters covering such topics as the mechanism of the organization of life, heredity, evolution and anatomy of reproduction, fertility, glands of internal secretion, and pregnancy; "Enter the Child" discusses birth, puerperium, food, sleep, posture, care of head, and health during the baby's first year; and "Development, Behavior and Training" takes up the how and why of behavior, its neural bases, behavior levels of preschool children, learning, moral training, problems of childhood, and the techniques for observing children. References to current works are found in the footnotes. The book is illustrated with pictures, poetry, scientific illustrations and tables of data. It is complete with preface, table of contents, appendices, glossary, and index. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Several conceptions of "relaxation" are cited: a situation characterized by a considerably diminished activity of some peripheral organs plus a similarly diminished activity of the highest parts of the nervous system, or an advanced remission of muscular tension with undiminished normal activity of the higher central nerves. The question arises whether in combating labor pains without drugs the higher nervous activity should be maintained at normal levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Three cases of pseudocyesis were studied to determine the effect of the psyche on the endocrine system. In all cases the gonadotropin and estrogen output was far above normal but insufficient to result in a positive Friedman test. Pregnancy and abnormalities of the pituitary and ovary were absent. When each patient was told she was not pregnant and she received this information with conviction, prompt recession of physical signs took place.

N2  - Hibernating bats of the eastern United States mate during the fall. The spermatozoa are stored in the uterus during the winter and may fertilize ova released from the ovaries in the spring. During hibernation the female is in a state of subestrus. Spermatogenesis occurs only in summer, but the accessory glands remain functional throughout the winter and are filled with masses of mature spermatozoa. If hibernating animals are aroused, they may copulate. Gestation lasts 50-60 days, and parturition occurs near the end of June. Summer colonies of bats are composed almost exclusively of females. The males probably remain isolated during the summer, but in the winter roosts the sexes are more evenly divided, although the true sex ratio is still undetermined.

N2  - Obtained at monthly intervals polygraphic recordings on the last 3 of 5 consecutive nights from 7 mildly retarded pregnant girls. Considerable inter-S as well as intra-S (consecutive nights) variability was observed for most parameters. REM sleep (1-min epochs containing at least 1 REM) decreased, or increased, sometimes dramatically, with total stage 1 remaining remarkably constant. Stage 4 was just as variable as REM sleep. In 2 cases an increase in stage 2 REM was observed near term and becoming most pronounced in the early post partum period. Outstanding in consistency was the increase in stage 4, REM sleep, and increased saturation of REM periods with REMs during early postpartum. Data emphasize the need of more frequent polygraphic studies of indivdual Ss during pregnancy and early postpartum, as well as the need of baseline recordings at least several mo. post term for intra-S correlations.

N2  - From interviews with 199 white couples the author presents data that may be regarded as "an approximate estimate of the average group risk of pregnancy in human beings associated with sexual intercourse between fertile individuals doing nothing to diminish the risk, but motivated in their sex behavior solely by libido, habit and desire for children." The data for frequency of intercourse for the various age groups agree well with earlier figures, and thus tend to establish this as a reasonably normal group with which to investigate the relation between frequency of intercourse and expectation of pregnancy. The number of net potentially effective copulations per pregnancy for all ages of women (up to 50 years) is 254; and the average number of pregnancies per couple is 5.8. The data are broken down in various tables. From them it develops that the mean number of pregnancies per 100 years of exposure to normal intercourse is 76.8, and the median, 57.5.

N2  - The fact that many investigators consider the pernicious vomiting of pregnancy as a toxicosis, and at the same time recommend psychotherapy for it, leads to the conclusion that the successful use of this treatment does not settle the question in favor of an exclusively psychogenic origin. It may be a reaction of the vegetative nervous system to various injurious agents, either toxins or a pathologically conditioned, i.e., "psychogenic," reflex. The interpretation of psychogenic vomiting during pregnancy as a symbol of rejection is not to be summarily dismissed. It has been known for a long time that suggestion can influence not only the higher functions of the nervous system but also the somatic processes. The conditioned reflex offers a physiological explanation for this. The author reports 11 cases of the toxic vomiting of pregnancy treated by hypnotic suggestion‚Äî8 successfully, 2 without result, and one with partial success. Improvement was usually manifest after the first session. In the unsuccessful cases, hypnotic sleep could not be induced; ketonuria was also present. In none of the cases was inquiry made as to psychogenic factors. The author considers, nevertheless, that his results prove that purely symptomatic psychotherapy has an important place in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum.

N2  - "3 groups of pregnant women, 50 unwed, 50 married primigravida and 50 married multigravida were given the Pregnancy Research Questionnaire (PRQ)." The groups differ among themselves on a variety of dimensions. There was a significant tendency for psychosomatic anxiety indices, nausea, and sleep disturbances as recalled states before pregnancy to be related to the appearance of these factors during pregnancy. The stress of pregnancy apparently accentuates predispositional factors present before pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Attempted to evaluate the possibility of a humoral, rather than neural, mediation of the epiphenomena of REM sleep. The systemic communication between a mother and her fetus provided a possible approach to this problem. It was assumed that periods of active motility in the fetus of a sleeping mother reflected the occurrence of REM sleep in this organism. Maternal sleep was monitored by standard recording procedures, and fetal sleep was inferred from recordings of intrauterine activity. The following results were obtained from comparisons of all night sleep records of the mother-fetus unit: (1) the fetus tends to develop a recurrent quiet active cycle in the course of gestation; (2) specific instances of high fetal activity frequently occur together with or in close proximity to the recurrent episodes of REM sleep in the mother; and (3) a number of potential mechanisms for a dynamic humoral communication between the 2 physiological units during REM sleep are discussed.

N2  - The cerebral mechanism plays a part in the act of parturition of an importance hitherto unsuspected, though its action may be understood. The author cites several cases in which suggestion has induced uterine contractions. He asserts that it is possible to bring about, in no more than 2 or 3 treatments, abortion or premature delivery. Delivery has been effected at a predetermined date, by means of the suggestion that the normal term has been completed. Such suggestions act upon the medullary centers; the suggested idea of contractions is carried out in deep hypnosis with the certainty that would attach to a sensory-motor reflex. All the visceral functions are likewise dependent upon psychic mechanisms. It is possible to accelerate or retard menstruation by as much as 8 days in individuals normally regular. The depth of the hypnotic sleep is increased with the duration of gestation; the more closely the woman approaches her full term, the greater is her suggestibility and the more easily she may be put to sleep. The considerable frequency of nocturnal deliveries is not due to the fact of night itself, but to the slumber state, which intensifies the cerebro-spinal reflexes.

N2  - Obtained repeated all-night recordings of fetal motility from 4 pregnant females. Small pressure transducers were attached to the abdominal skin over the head, limbs, and buttock of the fetus. An additional transducer was attached to the dorsal surface of the mother's thigh to monitor maternal activity. Ss were recorded from during a normal night of sleep and during periods of quiet wakefulness. Fetal activity was detected from the 5th mo. of pregnancy, and became cyclic during the 6th mo. As measured from the beginning of 1 active period to the beginning of the next, the cycle times at this state of development had a mean of 47.8 26.5 min. Cycle times lengthened progressively, and a significantly longer mean cycle time of 62.7 20 min. was obtained by the 8th mo. This endogenous cyclicity was independent of maternal state, being the same during both sleep and wakefulness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A young married woman who had a phobia about becoming pregnant developed during her psychoanalysis symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. This patient's associations led her analyst to the conclusion that sleep as a gratification and withdrawal into sleep as a defense played a major part in her symptomatology and character structure. She had a lack of muscular tonus which the analyst understood as an expression of the wish to fall asleep and which he called the "possum defense." Strenuous activity of the limbs that had lacked tonus was believed to be the cause of damage to the patient's joints. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This paper is concerned with "the more important psychological stresses and strains associated with pregnancy and a few of the manifestations of these. The universality of pregnancy and its importance as one of the major experiences in the life of a woman, both psychologically and physiologically, justify an extensive study from the psychosomatic point of view." What such a study should encompass, is listed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The authors describe a method for measuring the contractions of the normal uterus by means of string galvanometers. 29 subjects were used, 15 of them free of uterine pathology. Uterine tonus was measured (for the first time in the intact organ) and found to vary in magnitude from subject to subject and from time to time. Spontaneous contractions were recorded repeatedly. The uterine contractions appeared to be relatively independent of the abdominal contractions, though there was slight evidence of a tendency for abdominal muscular contraction to promote uterine activity.

N2  - Stimulation of the cat's hypogastric or injection of adrenine causes relaxation of the uterus in the non-pregnant and contraction of the uterus of the pregnant animal. Similar reversals have been reported from progestin. In this study it was found possible to reverse the nerve response alone if a just minimal amount of progestin was given. Later the adrenine response reversed also (with a larger dose). It is felt that the results are of import to the theories of chemical mediation. Two possibilities are suggested (1) that the substances liberated are different in some slight way (from nerve and adrenine) and (2) that modification of the liberated substance into sympathin I and sympathin E occurs as postulated by Cannon and Rosenblueth and that a difference in the rate of this process and a different sensitivity to progestin in innervated and non-innervated smooth muscle cells accounts for the independent reversal. It is felt that Bacq's theory that sympathin E is a metabolic by-product does not explain the differing reactivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Menstruation--"the periods"--is the manifestation, the proof positive, the sign-manual of puberty; the due performance of which is, as a rule, necessary for health and for conception; it always ceases during pregnancy, usually during suckling, and oftentimes during severe illness; it comes on generally to the day, and frequently to the very hour, every lunar month, for the space of about thirty years, and then disappears altogether; constituting, at its close, "change of life."

N2  - The EEG's of 28 women, 8 of whom had toxemias, indicate that the electrical activity of the cortex is slowed in pregnancy and that, as a group, patients with toxemias show more high-voltage fast activity and less normal activity than patients without toxemia. Most of the records were taken in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy. In the cases in which both pre- and post-partum records were obtained, cortical activity was usually slower during pregnancy.

N2  - Ten daily measurements of differences in electrical potential were made during two menstrual cycles of a chimpanzee trained to present both of her hands for application of salt-bridge electrodes (Burr-Hill-Allen technique). These measures, when compared with the curve of genital swelling, show maximal voltage on the 17th day at the beginning of detumescence, which is related to ovulation. In the second menstrual cycle the maximal voltage appears again on the 17th day and is followed by another voltage rise on the 21st day. This second rise is believed to be incident to fertilization and pregnancy, which was shown to have begun at that point. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents the dream analysis of a 35-yr-old pregnant woman, to highlight the relation between erotic and vesical dreams. Eight dreams starting from the 4th month of the S's pregnancy were analyzed, and it was revealed that a tendency to menstrual periodicity influenced the causation of erotic dreams. Dreams exhibited the erotic needs of the S clearly. Thus, they were symbolic of the physical sexual phenomena arousing or accompanying the dream. Both vesical and erotic stimuli were present in the dreams. It has been observed that it is more difficult for women than men to achieve sexual satisfaction during sleep. Sexual impulse, which is primary, is regarded as a symbol of urination (vesical impulse), which is secondary. Thus, sexual and vesical impulse are 2 closely allied, yet distinct forces, which may arouse or stimulate the activity of the other. An associative and compensatory relation exists between them.

N2  - This first study of the relationship between the number of pregnancies and the number of children born in the human species employed the records of 6,390 mothers obtained from the Sloane Hospital for Women in New York City. The general result shows that "there is practically no relationship between the number of pregnancies incurred and the relative number brought to term. There seems a slight decrease in the relative number brought to term as the number of pregnancies increases." Specifically: coefficients between pregnancies and children born ranged between +.88 and +.94 for the various nationalities of foreign born women and was +.82 for American born. Coefficients between the number of pregnancies and the deviation of the number brought to term from its probable value were -.2513 ¬± .0093 for foreign born women and -.4072 ¬± .007 for American born mothers, showing that the relative number of offspring decreased more rapidly with increase in the number of pregnancies in American born women than in foreign born women. The biological interpretation, that frequent conception so weakens the maternal organism that normal development of the dependent organism is impossible, is probably false, because coefficients between age and number of births and between age and number of pregnancies range between .33 and .70 whereas they would be expected to approach 1.00.

N2  - Childbirth, nursing, and pregnancy in women are liable to act as the exciting causes of attacks of mental disease. In importance and frequency they stand in the order in which I have placed them. The three forms, though having much in common, yet differ in so many respects that I must take them separately. The advantage and the practical necessity of classifying mental diseases in other ways than according to the mental symptoms present, are especially seen in these three forms of mental disease. To know that a case is one that has begun after recent childbirth is to know far more about it than to know it as mania or melancholia for treatment and for prognosis. PUERPERAL INSANITY‚ÄîPuerperal insanity is technically limited to the mental disease that occurs within the first six weeks after confinement. By far the majority of the cases, and by far the most acute and characteristic cases, occur within the first fortnight. It is a very common form of mental disease, for five per cent, of all the cases of insanity among women are puerperal, and I think that it is a low estimate that one in every four hundred labors is followed by it. In one-half of the patients the disease begins within the first week after confinement, and in three-fourths of them within the first fortnight. In regard to the cause of the disease, therefore, it is definite and clear. The accompaniments of childbirth produce it. LACTATIONAL INSANITY‚ÄîNursing in women is the cause of mental disease sometimes. The poor are more liable to this than the rich, both being equally subject to puerperal insanity. A typical case of lactational insanity is one occurring in the case of a poor woman who has had several children, and has nursed the last for several months, who has got pale and thin in the process, and become subject to headaches, noises in her ears, giddiness, flashes of light before her eyes, lassitude and nervous irritability, in fact to the usual symptoms of general bloodlessness and brain an√¶mia. She then gets depressed in mind, her sleep leaves her, her self-control is lost, and she becomes either lethargic and stupid or suicidal, with delusions that her husband and neighbors are against her, thereby, poor woman, merely misinterpreting her sensations of mental pain and distress. She had little organic strength for her pregnancy, still less for her delivery, and it has quite broken down in her nursing. To such a woman the organic delight of suckling her infant, for which the maternal nature craves and is satisfied by the process, becomes an irritation, an excitement, and an exhaustion. THE INSANITY OF PREGNANCY‚ÄîNo doubt the alterations are chiefly in the affective faculties, but the reasoning power, the moral sense, the , the imagination, and even the memory, are often enough affected in pregnant women. As a part of the nervous disturbance the bodily appetites become changed, the physiological functions altered, and the nutrition of organs profoundly affected. In this state many women have endless caprices, unfounded dislikes and likings, for foods and drinks never before desired, unnatural desires for indigestible things, causeless weeping and laughing, stealing and lying, morbid thirst and hunger, an activity of digestion never before known, pigmentation of the skin, alteration of the expression of the face, of the tones of the voice, and of the power of muscular coordination.

N2  - Presents a case report of a five year old Jewish boy with a prolonged hypomanic episode. In addition to a difficulty in using his left arm and leg the mother complained the child suffered severe disturbances of his sleep. The patient was an only child of normal parents. The family history gave no evidence of hereditary nervous disease. Birth had been normal after full-term gestation and the child appeared normal at birth. At 5 months the child had an attack in which he became ‚Äúlike dead‚Äù and was cold, quiet and stiff. He was revived and for the next few days was listless and did not cry. It was difficult to feed him but he did not vomit. No inflammatory disease had preceded this episode. At 10 months convulsions set in, which became more frequent until there were several each day. Attack consisted of a definite warning, in which the child called to his mother and pointed to his left hand, the first area to show abnormal movement. He then became unconscious, eyes rolled up, head turned to the left, and body became rigid. There were clonic movements, first of the left hand and arm, then of the left lower extremity; there had never been movements of the right side of the body. Attack usually lasted about five minutes and then he fell into a deep sleep. The occurrence of a hypomanic state with flight of ideas and distractibility in a child of this age is a matter of special interest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
