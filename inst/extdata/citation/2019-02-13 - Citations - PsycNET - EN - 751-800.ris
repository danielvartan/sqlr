N2  - Epileptic comorbidity and its management in the contemporary therapeutic scene should not be unnoticed anymore. To ignore psychiatric comorbidity of a chronic disorder such as epilepsy means approaching the subject in a partial way and thus preventing the implementation of an integrated treatment. Emphasis is made in treatment attachment, not only of convulsive crises, but also of comorbid psychiatric symptoms and disorders. This paper reviews the therapeutic approaches, specially the pharmacological ones, of epileptic comorbid disorders, including depressive syndromes, suicide attempts, anxiety, psychotic, sleep and sexual disorders, pregnancy, psychomotor agitation, as well as self-medication and substance abuse. The appropriate management of the above mentioned comorbidity represents a definitive issue on these patients' life quality, and that is why health education directed to the community is an essential tool. Thus, an integrative view of the human being is not only a fundamental premise, but also a promoter of will and of the activities in favour of health.

N2  - Highlights some of the differences in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Main topics discussed in this chapter are (1) history and discovery; (2) structure-activity relations; (3) pharmacological profile (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine); (4) pharmacokinetics and disposition; (5) mechanism of action; (6) indications; (7) side effects and toxicology (sleep, suicidality, pregnancy and lactation, and SSRI dicontinuation syndrome); and (8) drug–drug interactions. The authors conclude that as experience with these compounds broaden, continued advances in scientific knowledge about the serotonin system and its role with human pathophysiology can be expected.

N2  - 52 pregnant women recruited during their 2nd trimester were given EEGs and divided into greater relative right and left frontal EEG activation groups. The greater relative right frontal EEG women had lower dopamine levels during their second trimester and lower dopamine and higher cortisol levels during the neonatal period. The newborns of the right frontal EEG mothers also showed greater relative right frontal EEG, had lower dopamine and serotonin levels, spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had inferior Brazelton scores. A discriminant function analysis based on the mothers' prenatal depression scores and biochemical measures correctly classified 74% of the women as greater relative right or left frontal EEG group members, (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - 45 parturient women (aged 19–36 yrs) were divided based on a psychological poll into subgroups with a high (changed mental state, CMS) and low (unchanged mental state, UMS) number of signs of changes in the MS during and after delivery. The MSs studied included active and passive wakefulness, dozing, and sleep. Background EEG was recorded before and after delivery. EEG processing included the calculation of indices of the basic rhythms, the parameters of auto- and cross-correlation functions, and the conditional probabilities of the mutual transitions of the EEG wave components that belong to the basic rhythm components according to their duration. Statistical comparison of the EEG characteristics of the subgroups, as well as their comparison with similar characteristics of the reference group of healthy nulliparous women, showed that the subgroups differed in some parameters; the differences were generalized by lead zones. The EEG characteristics of the CMS subgroup differed from those of the reference group more than those of the UMS subgroup. The differences between the 2 subgroups suggest an imbalance of the regulatory mechanisms in the former with the predominance of excitation at the predelivery stage and a more manifest physiological cerebral reaction to the delivery.

N2  - 120 pregnant women were asked about their ideas on infants' dreams. Two interviews were undertaken, before birth and 1 month after birth. The majority of women (both before and after birth) responded that infants dream. The reasons why they attributed dreaming to infants changed from before birth to after birth. At one month, these reasons were based on infant movements and behaviours, factors also taken into consideration by sleep researchers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The reviewer explains that this book (J. Martín Maldonado-Durán (Ed), 2001; see record 2003-02314-000)is divided into four sections (1) Theoretical framework, (2) Therapeutic approaches to relationships and their disturbances, (3) Therapeutic approaches to psychophysiological disturbances, and (4) illustrative case examples. All of these sections are well served by the individual chapters and, while a broad range of material is presented, the book retains theoretical coherence. Section II is weighty and deals with attachment during pregnancy and the nature of transgenerational patterns in attachment. Therapeutic interventions are dealt with in a chapter, which promotes attachment theory as a powerful therapeutic tool, balanced by the subsequent chapter, which considers the potential of a wide range of interventions, including cognitive behavioural and systemic approaches. The third section of the book deals with epidemiology, differential diagnosis and management of sleep, feeding and excessive and persistent crying. The reviewer's only criticism of the book is the relative lack of explicit commentary on therapeutic outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The discussion article speaks about the behavior of the fetus during the prenatal and postnatal periods. The development of the fetus has been discussed. The development of the brain and the lungs has been studied. It has been found that if in a prenatal stage a pregnant woman is given steroids then there is lower number of neurons in the hippocampus. The usage of steroids during pregnancy does not have extra positive effects on lung development. The movement of twins has also been discussed and studied. Some studies say that in twin pregnancies the sleep states will be a bit shorter, certainly not the non-REM sleep state, but that is probably biased, because the other one has been kicking and that is not really a nervous system effect. The consumption of alcohol during the pregnancy stage is not preferable as it hampers the development of the lungs and the liver. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This chapter provides a review and synthesis of research on women's sleep and fatigue from a nursing perspective. Most of the research involves four primary issues for women: menstrual cycles, childbearing, chronic mental or physical illness, and oncology. Research with healthy women focused on diurnal fluctuations in fatigue and relationships to sleep, without regard for exercise or level of daytime activity. Research on chronic illness and cancer fatigue focused on general fatigue and its impact on activity, without regard for sleep or therapeutic use of rest and naps. A comparison of these two areas highlights gaps in nursing knowledge about sleep and fatigue. Further research is needed to understand relationships between nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and symptoms related to poor quality of life. From a synthesis of these studies, nonpharmacologic interventions that could be prove useful in promoting a higher quality of life for those with either acute or chronic fatigue are then proposed.

N2  - Women have twice the incidence of major depression compared with men. They are prone to develop episodes of depression during times of reproductive hormonal change at puberty, with use of oral contraceptives, during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, postpartum, and during the perimenopause (B. L. Parry 1995a). A. Wirz-Justice (1995) describes the variety of disturbances in biological rhythms observed in mood disorders. This report involving 12 women describes the chronobiological disturbances observed in female-specific mood disorders, namely, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, pregnancy and postpartum depression, and menopause. It is hypothesized that changing reproductive hormones, by affecting the synchrony or coherence between components of the circadian system, may alter amplitude or phase (timing) relationships and thereby contribute to the development of mood disorders in predisposed individuals.

N2  - Presents the case study of the use of kangaroo care (KC) for adoptive parents. An adopted female was born at 27 wks gestation with respiration distress syndrome. Despite the critical situation, KC was begun at 3 days after birth and involved 2-hr daily bonding sessions as the infant was placed on either parent's chest. Sessions took place in the neonatal intensive care unit on a recliner where both parent and child could sleep. Both parents reported feelings of immediate and intense connection to their adoptive daughter and felt that KC provided an important opportunity to bond.

N2  - The study presents a survey of the effects of pregnancy on parasomnias. In an area of a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community, women were interviewed during and after their pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess the frequency of their parasomnias. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last one the 3 months after delivery. Altogether 325 mothers filled all the five questionnaires and constitute the study group. The total number of parasomnias declined during pregnancy and even more among the primiparas than among the multiparas. Among various parasomnias reported, sleep talking and sleepwalking decreased from the prepregnant period to the second trimester, and the reported sleep starts also diminished from the prepregnant time to the first trimester, but these phenomena did not change during the follow-up. Altogether 55.7% of the women reported having nightmares 3 months before the pregnancy, and 47.7, 49.5, 41.2 and 40.3%, respectively, at first, second and third trimester and after the delivery. Reported hypnagogic hallucinations decreased from the prepregnant time to the first trimester, but returned thereafter to the previous level.

N2  - During the first weeks of life, preterm neonates show fewer circadian rhythms in their physiological parameters than full-term neonates. To determine whether preterm neonates differ in their temporal adaptation to the daynight cycle from full-term neonates at the early age of 1 week, we compared activity-rest behavior of both groups. Activity-rest behavior of 10 neurologically healthy preterm neonates (born in 34th to 36th week of gestation) and 10 neurologically healthy full-term neonates (born in 37th to 42nd week of gestation) was monitored longitudinally for 8 successive days in the first 2 weeks of life. Actigraphy was used to register and display time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small actometers, which resemble a wristwatch. Nursing/feeding was recorded using the actometer's integrated event marker button. Recordings for preterm neonates were conducted in the hospital; recordings for full-term neonates were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Amounts of daily sleep time, nightly sleep time, and sleep time during 24h were compared. Nursing/feeding epochs were also analyzed for 5 preterm and 5 full-term neonates to compare their food intake behavior. The majority of preterm neonates showed a multitude of ultradian frequencies in their spectra. In contrast, several full-term neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency. In preterm neonates, average nightly sleep and average daily sleep of all recorded days were very similar, but after the fourth day of life, only average nightly sleep increased. In full-term neonates, average nightly and daily sleep time of all recorded days differed by about 1h. Average sleep time during 24h for preterm and full-term neonates was similar. Preterm neonates showed longer intervals between events of food intake than full-term neonates. The circadian peaks in the frequency spectra of full-term neonates may indicate the initial adaptation in the first week of life to a 24h day. This is in agreement with our results concerning the different durations of nightly and daily sleep. The increase in nightly sleep time of preterm neonates may be attributed to the progressing adaptation to a circadian activity- rest pattern.

N2  - Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H₂0) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). We demonstrated no difference between smoking and non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p < 0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.001), and in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p<0.05). BHR was significantly elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p<0.01) and in the prone position at 2-3 (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.05)...

N2  - Investigated the welfare of pregnant mares kept in straight stalls for 6 mo and given only limited exercise, conditions similar to those in the pregnant mare urine industry. 16 pregnant mares were randomly assigned to 2 groups: EX (exercised in paddock 30 min per day) or NoEX (exercised for one 30-min period every 14 days). Behavior was recorded on videotape once per week for 24 hrs. Major behaviors were eating hay, standing, and stand-resting. There was no differences between groups in stall behaviors or the number of foot lifts per min. Nine of 16 mares were not observed in recumbency throughout the 6-mo period, suggesting that horses with no experience in straight stalls may be reluctant to lie down. 13 of 16 mares dropped to their knees at least once, probably during REM sleep while standing. There were no significant differences between groups in baseline plasma cortisol levels or in cortisol response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). After 30 min exercise, NoEX mares showed an increase in cortisol; EX mares showed a decrease. NoEX horses confined for 2 wks trotted more and galloped more than EX horses released daily, but walked less and grazed less. Confined horses showed rebound locomotion (compensatory increase) when released from confinement, indicating a response to exercise deprivation.

N2  - Introduction: Little is known about sex differences in human fetal heart and behaviour. Patients and methods: One hundred twenty-three nulliparous healthy women carrying a male (n=56) or female (n=67) fetus participated in this study. All pregnancies remained uncomplicated and delivery was uneventful. Ultrasound observation of fetal general movements (GM) was performed for 1 h at 15-17 (T1) and 27-28 (T2) weeks of gestation and for 2 h at 37-39 weeks (T3). Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring occurred simultaneously with fetal ultrasound observations at T2 and T3. The incidence of GM (percentage of time), FHR and its variability, and the incidences of fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) A-D and behavioural states 1F-4F were compared between boys and girls. Results: There were no significant differences between males and females in the distribution of HRP A-D, overall behavioural state distribution, and basal FHR, FHR variability or the presence of GM during quiet and active sleep. A Time × Sex interaction effect for GM assessed for total record length and a higher %GM in male fetuses at term age were the only significant findings. Conclusion: Our data do not provide evidence for a difference in fetal functional development or maturation between the two sexes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has alerted pediatricians to the importance of safe sleep environment for infants. Prior studies have demonstrated that health care professional advice is influential in determining infant care practices and the reduction of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The authors surveyed a random sample of 3,717 physicians in North Carolina and the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area to determine knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction among physicians caring for pregnant women and infants. Of the 835 physicians who responded, most were aware of prone sleeping and cigarette smoke exposure as risk factors for SIDS. Almost all physicians agree that there are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS, and they consider it important to discuss SIDS and SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents of young infants. In spite of this belief, only 56% of family/general practitioners, 18% of obstetrician-gynecologists, and 79% of pediatricians discuss SIDS routinely. Overall, pediatricians are more likely to be aware of the AAP recommendation and to discuss SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - It has been proposed that prostaglandin (PG) D₂ induces physiological sleep in mammals by acting on sleep centers located in the anterior hypothalamus. In fetal sheep, definitive rapideye- movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep states appear at ∼125 d gestation (term is ∼147 d). In adult animals, PGD synthase (PGDS) (functionally and structurally homologous to β-trace protein) is secreted into CSF with a circadian pattern, with the highest concentrations present during sleep. In this study we show that PGDS/β-trace protein is present in fetal sheep CSF at 125 and 135 d gestation but not at 90 d gestation. SeCl₄, a specific inhibitor of PGDS, was given to unanesthetized fetal sheep (130–140 d gestation) by intracerebroventricular infusion at a dose of 25, 100, 500, or 1000 pmol/min for 4 hr. Artificial CSF was infused in control experiments. Arousal behavior, defined as the presence of nuchal muscle electromyogram activity, electro-ocular activity, and breathing movements during low-amplitude electrocortical activity, increased from 3.8 ± 1 min/hr to 6.6 ± 0.5 and 7.0 ± 0.3 min/hr at doses of 100 and 500 pmol/min, respectively (p p < 0.05). When 500 pmol/min PGD₂ was infused immediately after a 4 hr infusion of SeCl₄ (500 pmol/min), the SeCl₄-induced increase in arousal behavior was abolished. Together, the presence of PGDS/β- trace protein in fetal CSF in late gestation and the effects of SeCl₄ in increasing the incidence of arousal-like behavior suggest that PGD₂ has a role in the induction and maintenance of prenatal sleep.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered. Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk factor for preterm labor and birth.

N2  - Explored risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among American Indians. A population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls was carried out. Data sources included standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant death review. The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2% and 13.6%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4% and 55.4 %), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7% and 54.6 %) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7% of case infants and 45.5% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant, any visits by a public health nurse, periconceptional maternal alcohol use, and maternal first-trimester binge drinking. Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing appear to be risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.

N2  - In order to evaluate two patterns of interrupted and non-interrupted sleep for the post-partum mothers from 9 to 12 weeks after delivery, we compared them with sleep patterns of non-pregnant women. Subjects were 10 primipara (aged 26- 40 yrs) and 12 non-pregnant women (aged 28-39 yrs). Their polysomnographic recordings were made using a Medilog recorder at home. In interrupted sleep, low sleep efficiency, decreased total sleep time, and a decreased percentage of stage 2 were significantly observed compared with non-pregnant women. Sleep parameters of non-interrupted sleep, except for increased percentage of stage 4, did not show any significant differences from non-pregnant women. Mothers sleep fluctuated between interrupted sleep similar to the early post-partum sleep from 1 to 6 weeks and non-interrupted sleep with increased stage 4.

N2  - 48 newborns (62% female) were divided on the basis of greater relative right (GRRF) versus greater relative left frontal (GRLF) EEG to determine whether these groups differed in other ways at the neonatal period including behavior physiology, and biochemistry. The authors also were interested in whether these EEG patterns were related to any prenatal maternal variables (PMV) including mood states and biochemistry as well as fetal activity. The GFFR EEG newborns had mothers with lower prenatal and postnatal serotonin and higher postnatal cortisol levels. The mothers of the GRRF EEG newborns also had GRRF EEG activation and lower vagal tone. The GRRF EEG newborns themselves had elevated cortisol levels, showed a greater number of state changes during sleep/wake behavior observations, and performed less optimally on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment (T.B. Brazelton, 1973) including the habituation, motor range of state, excitability, and depressive symptoms scales. Data suggest that GRRF EEG newborns may be at greater risk for developmental problems than those with GRLF EEG activation. In addition, a discriminant function analysis correctly classified 67% of the newborns' EEG by PMV, suggesting that these might be used to target pregnant women for prenatal intervention.

N2  - This book demonstrates how health psychology has risen to the challenge to find new ways to reach and treat at-risk populations. Using as a springboard their experiences in responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis over nearly two decades, chapter authors illustrate how they identified avenues for intervention and new targets for behavior change and designed new methods to address critical problems. Each chapter presents the theoretical rationale for a host of strategies, empirical validation for the effectiveness with a specific population or presenting problem, and step-by-step procedures for implementation. Experts demonstrate how basic behavioral science principles were used to develop intervention to target individuals, families, small groups, and communities. They share guidance for treating chronic pain, sleep disturbance, noncompliance with complex medical regimens, and the miracle-cure/quick-fix mentality. They describe their successes in tailoring interventions to specific risk populations, such as adolescents, pregnant women, African American women, gay men, and IV drug users. These findings are invaluable for addressing a wide range of public health concerns, from sexually transmitted diseases to coping with chronic illness.

N2  - Thirty-eight 1st-time mothers were recruited from childbirth classes and were assessed at 4 different time periods: the last trimester of pregnancy, 2-4 weeks postpartum, 12-16 weeks postpartum, and 12-15 months postpartum. Measures included a daily sleep-wake diary and a depression scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). Results reveal significant differences in weekday night sleep schedules (rise time, time awake due to disruptions, and nap time) at 2-4 weeks postpartum in comparison to other times of measurement. Total sleep time and bedtime was not significantly different between times of measurement. More depressive symptoms were reported at 2-4 weeks postpartum than at later postpartum measurements. Mothers who developed clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥ 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum reported more total sleep time, later rise times, and more time napping at the end of pregnancy in comparison to those mothers that reported fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D < 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum.

N2  - Examined the development of adult-like biorhythms in infants as measured by the age-related fall of deep body temperature with sleep. This papers reports on 2 twin sets, where differences with singletons are identified. Both twins were seen at home from the age of 6 wks. Deep body temperature was monitored overnight. Results show that the pattern of body temperature change was similar for twins as for singletons, but sibling comparison shows differences, which may be unique to twins, and highlights the shortcomings of comparison with singletons. Within the first set, maturation occurs simultaneously at 15 wks, perhaps slightly delayed as a consequence of being 36 wks gestation, or perhaps to zygosity, since dizygosity appears to be the likely origin of these twins. The differences in twin set 2 show a more than 5 wk separation, with the larger female infant later than her smaller brother. It is concluded that this contradicts the findings in singletons where females and larger infants tend to develop earlier than smaller males.

N2  - This open-label prospective study examined maternal and neonatal saftey and efficacy outcome measures during and following prenatal buprenophine exposure. Three opioid-dependent pregnant women received 8 or 12 mg sublingual buprenorphine tablets daily for 15–16 weeks prior to delivery. Results showed that buprenorphine in combination with comprehensive prenatal care was safe and effective for these women. Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulted in normal birth outcomes, a mean of 4.33 days hospitalization, and a "relatively mild" neonatal abstinence syndrome comprised primarily of tremors, hyperactive moro and shortened sleep after feeding. The infants required no pharmacological treatment. Onset of neonatal abstinence signs occurred within the first 12 hrs after birth, peaked by 72 hrs, and returned to below pre-12 hr levels by 120 hrs. It is concluded that buprenorphine has potential utility for the treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This longitudinal study investigated sleep-wake behavior patterns during and after pregnancy, using an actimeter worn on the non-dominant wrist and a sleep log. Records were obtained from ten mothers, from the 34th week of gestation until the 15th week postpartum. Ten non-pregnant women were used as a control group, data being collected from them for 2 weeks. The sleep-wake behavior after delivery, obtained from wrist actigraphy, was greater in the postpartum period. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and circadian amplitude decreased in the weeks immediately following parturition, but wake after sleep onset increased. Subsequently, all the sleep and circadian variables improved slightly, but they had not returned to the levels of the non-pregnant control group even by the 15th postpartum week. The length of daytime naps increased, in order to make up for nocturnal sleep deprivation when the number of awakenings during nighttime had increased. There were significant positive correlations between total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and the length of daytime naps, but the numbers of awakenings at night and daytime naps did not show this correlation. The total sleep time indicated by sleep logs tended to be greater than that indicated by actigraphy, but wake after sleep onset tended to be underestimated by the sleep logs. The implications of these results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined activity–rest patterns of couples during late pregnancy and the alterations in the periodic structure of parental and neonatal time patterns during the 1st 4 mo after birth. The effects of late pregnancy and birth to the mother's rest–activity patterns and those of the father and, what time pattern the infant developed were examined. How activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other and how the infant synchronizes with the environment were investigated. Activity data of 7 families were recorded. Parental activity was recorded at the beginning of the 37th wk of gestation, and continued with the infants' recordings in 3 series of 3 wks each until 4 mo after birth. Records were kept of household routines, parental activities, type of feeding, initiation of sleep or waking up. Activity data of 7 non-pregnant women were used as a control. Irregular nocturnal activity epochs occurred frequently in pregnant women and were absent in non-pregnant women. Period lengthenings and shortenings of the circadian rhythms appeared in both parents from prepartum to postpartum. Activity at night increased from prepartum to postpartum in parents. All 7 infants showed a predominant circadian rhythm between day 8 and 19 after birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined specific sleep characteristics in neonatal opiate withdrawal, referred to as the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), by measuring sleep efficiency, deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation in 3 newborn groups (aged 36-42 wks gestation): (i) healthy term neonates; (ii) opiate-exposed neonates who were treated for opiate withdrawal; and (iii) a group of opiate exposed neonates who did not require treatment. 21 neonates were exposed to opiates during pregnancy. Polygraphic recordings of sleep, movement and breathing were made continuously after a daytime feed. Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation were found in newborns with NAS and were associated with the severity of the withdrawal. Neonates treated for NAS displayed increased wakefulness during early treatment (deprivation), but were similar to controls once stabilized. Both treated and non-treated groups had reduced amounts of quiet sleep (deprivation). Treated newborns showed an increase in indeterminate sleep (disorganization) and arousals-to-wakefulness (fragmentation). The findings contribute to a further understanding of the physiology underlying neonatal opiate withdrawal and suggest that some changes in sleep are due to opiate withdrawal but others may reflect opiate dependency in utero.

N2  - Common marmosets maintained in captivity were observed by focal sampling at 2 non-consecutive days per week during 2 nonconsecutive pregnancies (pregnancy 1: the last 8 fortnights before parturition; pregnancy 2: the last 5 ones) and after parturition (4 fortnights for both). The hourly percentiles of the duration of self-grooming and allogrooming interactions of the reproductive pair were submitted to analysis for 24-hrs. The reproductive female's progesterone was monitored by fecal collection twice a week. During pregnancy 1, all interactions of the reproductive pair showed a 24-hr statistically significant period. However, after parturition this periodicity is not present in some behaviors of the reproductive male. This animal presents the 24-hr periodicity only toward to the reproductive female, the subadult son and to the newborns. Hormonal levels of the reproductive female showed isolated increases above 100 ng/g at the 2nd and 3rd fortnight after parturition, but did not characterize ovulation. Between pregnancy 1 and 2, the family was increased by the birth of 4 Ss. During pregnancy 2, a statistically significant 24-hr period was found only in self-grooming of the reproductive male and female, and in the interactions between the reproductive pair.

N2  - Rat or hamster pups exposed to constant light or darkness since birth exhibit many circadian rhythms synchronized with those of the mother. During early development, a number of cues derived from the maternal circadian system synchronize the fetal and neonatal circadian clock. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation during early pregnancy disrupts maternal synchronization of parotid α-amylase and testicular malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythms in rat pups. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation was used to study potential agents able to synchronize the fetal or neonatal circadian clock. The present authors studied the synchronizing effect of a benzodiazepine compound, diazepam. This GABAA agonist synchronized testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity of pups when it was injected to sympathetic denervated pregnant dams (from the 14th to the 20th day of gestation) or orally administered to the pups (from the 10th to 24th day of life). Co-injection of diazepam and GABAA antagonist, flumazenil, blocked the synchronizing effect of diazepam. The results demonstrate that diazepam has a synchronizing effect on the development of the circadian clock in rats and suggest that modulation of maternal GABAA could participate in mammalian maternal synchronization.

N2  - Assessed the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of depression by General Practitioners (GPs). Questionnaires completed by 2,500 GPs attending a series of workshops aimed at improving their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression were analyzed. Findings suggest that the majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counseling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify depression were sleep disorders, and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. 47% of GPs used medicine together with nonpharmacologicai treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information.

N2  - Attempted an intervention against alcohol-induced damage by treating pregnant mice with peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-hr post-alcohol administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

N2  - The birth of a healthy child is supposed to be a joyous time for you, but post-delivery hormonal imbalances and sleep deprivation can overwhelm you with tears, anxiety, and depression. A range of negative emotional reactions--categorized as postpartum depression (PPD)--hits over 400,000 new mothers each year, and an astounding 8 in 10 women will experience some kind of mood alteration during or following pregnancy. Based on original research and clinical practice, this book provides a scientifically proven plan for beating PPD. For the first time in 1 book, 3 authors with complementary degrees combine their expertise in obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, and parenting to provide you, your partner, and your family with specific, healing steps as well as up-to-date information on: the medications--from alternative therapies to prescribed antidepressants--you can take during pregnancy and following childbirth, even while breastfeeding; why getting counseling can be an important part of your recovery, and advice on choosing the kind that is right for you; how you can bond with your new baby despite your mood, and invaluable tips for postpartum parenting; and the ways in which your partner may also be suffering and what can be done about it.

N2  - The purpose of the two studies described in this thesis was to investigate and develop the notion of a parental identity. During the transition to parenthood, one's identity as a parent is rapidly developing. The initial nature of this identity may be manifested in the kinds of expectations one has about what parenthood may be like. Thus, in study one, the relationship between individuals' prenatal expectations about parenthood and their postnatal experiences was examined. During their third trimester of pregnancy, 73 primiparous couples were interviewed and asked open-ended questions regarding their expectations about becoming parents. A content analysis of their prenatal responses was conducted to examine the nature and style of their expectations. Cluster analysis of women's expectations identified three clusters labelled Prepared, Fearful, and Complacent. Six- and 18-month postnatal comparisons of these clusters indicated that women in the Prepared cluster had significantly lower levels of stress and higher levels of self-esteem than women in both the Fearful and Complacent clusters. Cluster analysis of men's expectations replicated these three clusters and generated a fourth style of conceptualizing parenthood that was labelled Mixed. Postnatal comparisons indicated that men in the Prepared cluster had significantly lower levels of stress than did men in the Complacent cluster. In addition, there was a marginally significant effect of depression with men in the Prepared cluster scoring lower than men in the Complacent cluster. Gender differences were apparent in two distinct areas: the specific content of their thoughts and the time orientation of their thoughts. Women, more often then men, expressed concern regarding their ability to parent effectively, the lack of sleep they expected to get, and the labour/delivery process. Women were more likely to speak of their unborn child in terms of it being an infant. Men talked more often about playing with and teaching their child and spoke about their unborn child in terms of it being a child or an adolescent. Results are discussed in terms of the content of expectations about parenthood, gender differences in expectations, and the relationship between individuals' prenatal expectations and their postnatal experiences of parenthood. Results are also interpreted in terms of their contribution to the early development of one's identity as a parent. Based on the results of study one, study two was designed to further investigate and understand the notion of a more mature stage of parental identity in women. Using the same qualitative methodology as in study one, mothers of children aged three to eight were asked open-ended questions regarding descriptions of themselves as parents, how they felt and thought about being parents, and what they believed was their role as parents. Cluster analysis of their responses resulted in three distinct clusters of women labelled Stressed, Teaching, and Nurturant. Analysis comparing the clusters across a variety of behavioural components of parenting indicated that individuals in the Stressed cluster perceived there to be more parenting stress in their lives than individuals described as Nurturant, and they also reported having more difficulty dealing with the demands of their children than individuals in the Teaching cluster. Results are discussed in terms of the development of parental identity and the relationship between parental identity and parenting behaviour.

N2  - Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP) determinations are still the "gold standard" for diagnosing gestational hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed 2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women for 48 h every 4 wks from the first hospital visit until delivery. Women were divided for comparative purposes into three groups: "detected" gestational hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP> 140/90 mmHg after 20 wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy; "undetected" gestational hypertension, women with office BP0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy.

N2  - Studied whether prenatal depression effects on the fetus and neonate vary by ethnicity and SES. 86 depressed pregnant women were compared by ethnic group, Hispanic and African-American, and by SES (upper/lower) on prenatal and neonatal outcome variables. The Hispanic mothers were older, had a higher SES and had higher prenatal norepinephrine levels. Their fetuses were also more active. At the neonatal period they had higher anger scores, but also higher serotonin levels, and their infants had higher dopamine and lower cortisol levels and they spent less time in deep and indeterminate sleep. The comparison by middle/lower SES revealed that the middle SES group was older, had more social support and showed less depressed affect but had higher norepinephrine levels prenatally. At the postnatal period the middle SES mothers had lower depression, anxiety and anger scores and lower norepinephrine levels. Their infants also had lower norepinephrine levels, fewer postnatal complications and were less excitable on the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale.

N2  - One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined the possible effects of reproductive experience (RE) on hypothalamic concentrations of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5HT) and their major metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxy mandelic acid (VMA) and 5-hydroxyindole 3-acetic acid (5HIAA), respectively. These parameters were measured in 92 pregnant rats during the light dark shift and the prolactin surges. Primi- and multigravid rats were sacrificed on the 7th-8th day of pregnancy between 1700 and 1900 hr (light-dark shift and diurnal prolactin surge) or 0200 and 0400 hr (nocturnal prolactin surge). The prolactin surge was confirmed and multigravid rats showed significantly lower serum prolactin levels as compared to primigravid rats between 0200 and 0400 hr. During the light-dark shift DA and NE concentrations increased while DOPAC/DA, HVA/DA and 5HIAA/5HT ratios decreased in multigravid rats compared to primigravid rats. Except for 5HIAA/5HT, these differences were not observed during the prolactin nocturnal surge. Results suggest that a previous reproductive experience induces central functional changes during pregnancy which are expressed differently according to the time of day.

N2  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than full term infants. This study investigated whether a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia affected the maturation of arousal responses. 25 premature infants were studied. A perinatal risk score was determined for each infant and infants were divided into those with a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia (n = 16) and those without (n = 9). All infants were studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) a preterm study around 36 wks gestation, (b) within 3 wks of term, and (c) 2–3 mo post-term. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cmH₂O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Arousal thresholds were elevated in apnoeic infants compared to control infants in both AS and QS at the term study and in QS at 2–3 mo post-term. It is concluded that a history of prematurity with neonatal apnoea has a persisting effect on decreasing arousabilty from sleep and these infants may be at increased risk for SIDS.

N2  - The effects of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy on behavioral and physiological measures of arousal were examined in a sample of 50 neonates (mean age 39.5 wks; mothers aged 18–39 yrs). After the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and maternal demographic variables were statistically controlled, regression analyses show that maternal smoking during pregnancy is predictive of higher heart rates overall and during quiet and active sleep. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also predictive of lower heart rate variability and an increased number of tremors and changes in behavioral state. These findings suggest that maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy affects the regulation of spontaneous autonomic activity in neonates.

N2  - Reports results of the first longitudinal study of outcome correlates of parent-child bedsharing. 205 families in nonconventional and conventional family lifestyles have been followed since 1975. A target child in each family was followed from the 3rd trimester of mother's pregnancy through age 18 yrs. Bedsharing in early childhood was found to be significantly associated with increased cognitive competence measured at age 6 yrs, but the effect size was small. At age 6 yrs, bedsharing in infancy and early childhood was not associated with sleep problems, sexual pathology, or any other problematic consequences. At age 18 yrs, bedsharing in infancy and childhood was unrelated to pathology or problematic consequences, nor was it related to beneficial consequences. These results are discussed in light of widespread fears of harm caused by parent-child bedsharing. It is suggested that such fears are without warrant if bedsharing is practiced safely as part of a complex of valued and related family practices.

N2  - Eighty depressed mothers who could be classified as withdrawn or intrusive were compared with 40 nondepressed mothers on their prenatal cortisol and catecholamine levels and on fetal activity and neonatal outcome variables. The assessment was made at 18 to 24 wks of pregnancy and the Ss mean age was 27 yrs. The data suggested that the withdrawn mothers had lower dopamine levels during pregnancy, and their infants had lower Brazelton scale scores. The infants of withdrawn mothers also had the highest cortisol levels and the lowest dopamine and serotonin levels as well as the most asymmetrical EEG patterns. Newborns of depressed mothers were more likely to show a greater incidence of obstetric and postnatal complications, as well as more indeterminate sleep and less optimal Brazelton habituation, orientation, motor, and depressed symptoms scores than newborns of nondepressed mothers.

N2  - Notes that besides their binding to cognate intracellular receptors gonadal steroids may also act as functional antagonists at the serotonin type 3 (5-HT₃) receptor. It is argued that steroids appear to interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the receptor membrane interface. The functional antagonism of gonadal steroids at the 5-HT₃ receptor may play a role for the development and course of nausea during pregnancy and of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 3α-reduced neuroactive steroids concurrently modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-type A receptor and regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. It is also contended that progesterone and 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG profile in rats and humans. Neuroactive steroids may further be involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in patients during ethanol withdrawal. It is concluded that neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties and may constitute a yet unexploited class of drugs.

N2  - To understand the sleep-wake behaviours from the fifth pre-partum week to the 15th post-partum week by the number of actigraphic activities and sleep logs were evaluated in 10 women (mean age 29.5 yrs). It was found that total sleep time shortened, sleep efficiency decreased, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased in the weeks immediately after delivery. Compared with late pregnancy, total sleep time and sleep efficiency deteriorated significantly from the delivery week to the 12th post-partum week and there was a longer period of WASO until the 11th postpartum week. The after-delivery sleep parameters estimated by the actigraph were worse than those estimated from sleep logs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The interactions of 3-month-old infants and their depressed mothers were classified as intrusive, withdrawn or good interactions. Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy. The depressed mothers and their newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation. Despite these group similarities, the infants of the "good interaction" mothers did not show high amounts of indeterminate sleep and they received better scores on the Brazelton scale. The more organized behaviors of these newborns may have contributed to the better interaction ratings of the "good interaction" depressed mothers.

N2  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. 68 nurses (aged 22-39 yrs) completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. 53% of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms, slept approximately 1 hr less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.

N2  - Examined awareness of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and risk reducing recommendations in a sample of mothers, and to examine their infant care practices. Interviews were conducted with 195 women using a standardized questionnaire. 191 questionnaires were analyzed; 134 Caucasian and 57 indigenous women. Eight had never heard of SIDS. 29 had heard of SIDS and 154 had heard of SIDS and could list risk recommendations to reduce its incidence. Multivariate analysis identified ethnicity as the only significant predictor of maternal knowledge. Indigenous mothers knew less about SIDS. Avoidance of prone sleeping was the most frequently identified recommendation (n=132), with no smoking in pregnancy (n=48) and breastfeeding (n=40) identified least frequently. There were 80.2% of mothers who put their infant in non-prone positions to sleep. Only 48 women identified smoking in pregnancy, and 93 smoking in the infant's environment as risk factors. Indigenous women were more likely to smoke in their pregnancy, bed share with their infant, and have smokers in the home. There is a high level of awareness of SIDS and the main associated risk factor of infant prone sleeping, but the link between SIDS and smoking requires further emphasis.

N2  - Women in the reproductive age group are at increased risk of unintended pregnancy, and impaired mental and physical health status early in pregnancy is linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, we examined health-related quality of life (HRQOL) indicators to assess the extent of physical and mental impairment among women by social and economic group and to identify populations that may be at higher risk. The measures in this study were constructed using 14 days or more as the cutoff value for determining the chronic presence of mental and physical health problems among women in the reproductive age group. SUDAAN software was used for analysis to account for the complex sample design. The results of this analysis show that the majority of women reported that their general health was excellent or very good (62%), more than a quarter reported that their health was good, and about 10% reported that their health was fair or poor. Data on cigarette smoking and binge drinking showed that women who currently smoked cigarettes or who reported binge drinking were more likely to report experiencing frequent mental distress, depression, and stress or anxiety. These data show that women in the reproductive age group frequently experience a substantial amount of physical and mental distress, depression, and stress or anxiety, and a high proportion of these women do not get enough rest or sleep.

N2  - This quasi-experimental research investigates developmental regulation around a critical life-span transition, the "biological clock" for childbearing. The action-phase model of developmental regulation proposes contrasting control orientations in individuals approaching versus those having passed a developmental deadline. Individuals in an urgency phase close to the deadline should be invested in goal pursuit, whereas those who have passed the deadline without attaining the goal should focus on goal disengagement and self-protection. In 2 studies, women at different ages and with or without children were compared with regard to various indicators of primary and secondary control striving for goal attainment versus goal disengagement and self-protection. Findings support the action-phase model of developmental regulation. Patterns of control striving congruent with the participants' status as pre-versus post-deadline were associated with superior psychological well-being.

N2  - Examined the association between intimate partner abuse (IPA) of adult women, their health care use, and their emotional and physical health concerns. 2,043 females (aged 18–59 yrs) completed questionnaires concerning IPA, which was defined as experiencing physical violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Results show that 6.3% of Ss reported IPA during the previous year. Those experiencing IPA were more likely to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Ss experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance but did receive routine health care. Findings suggest that females in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for serious emotional and physical health concerns and that most are in routine contact with health care providers.
