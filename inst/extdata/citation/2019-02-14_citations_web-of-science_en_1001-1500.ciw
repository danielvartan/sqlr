AB Introduction: The circadian clock plays an important role in several aspects of female reproductive biology. Evidence linking circadian clock-related genes to pregnancy outcomes has been inconsistent. We sought to examine whether variations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of circadian clock genes are associated with PA risk.
   Methods: Maternal blood samples were collected from 470 PA case and 473 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip platform. We examined 119 SNPs in 13 candidate genes known to control circadian rhythms (e.g., CRY2, ARNTL, and RORA). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs); and the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS).
   Results: A common SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 21% reduced odds of PA (P < 0.05). The odds of PA increased with increasing wGRS (P-trend < 0.001). The corresponding ORs were 1.00, 1.83, 2.81 and 5.13 across wGRS quartiles. Participants in the highest wGRS quartile had a 5.13-fold (95% confidence interval: 3.21-8.21) higher odds of PA compared to those in the lowest quartile. Although the test for interaction was not significant, the odds of PA was substantially elevated for pre-eclamptics with the highest wGRS quartile (OR = 14.44, 95%CI: 6.62-31.53) compared to normotensive women in the lowest wGRS quartile.
   Discussion: Genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes may be associated with PA risk. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this important obstetrical complication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <32 weeks gestation spending a greater proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP).
   Methods: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP post-extubation had sleep and wake activity measured by actigraphy for 72 hours post-extubation. Activity diaries were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling. Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the analysis.
   Results: 28 infants with mean gestation of 283 weeks (SD 2) and birth weight 1074 g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those on NCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8) p = 0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean activity score than those on NCPAP (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, respectively).
   Conclusion: Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The prevalence of hypertensive disorders in China was much higher than that in the United States. Considering the large population with wide geographic area of China, we aimed to add more information regarding the risk factors for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. A case-control study was performed on 373 hypertensive cases and 507 normotensive controls. Participants were recruited from 2008 to 2014 in Yichang Maternal and Child Health Care Center in Hubei province and Anyang Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital in Henan province, China. Socio-demographic factors, family- related factors, pregnancy-associated factors, factors related to daily life behaviors and psychosocial factors were investigated with respect to hypertensive disorders in pregnancy through well-designed questionnaire. Chi-square test, t-test, univariate logistic regression analysis, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to find the possible risk factors behind hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. The results showed that family history of cardiovascular diseases (OR=6.18, 95% CI, 2.37 to 16.14), history of pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR=16.64, 95% CI, 5.74 to 48.22), low maternal educational level (OR=2.81, 95% CI, 1.30 to 6.04), and poor relationship with their parents-in-law (OR=3.44, 95% CI, 1.55 to 7.59) had statistically significant associations with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy through multivariate logistic regression analysis. Increased maternal age, increased pre-pregnancy body mass index, living in rural area, low paternal education level, family history of hypertension, passive smoking one year before and/or in pregnancy, and poor sleeping quality were significantly associated with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy from univariate logistic regression analysis while the associations became uncertain when they were entered for multivariate logistic regression analysis. It was concluded that family history of cardiovascular diseases, history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, low maternal educational level, and poor relationship with their parents-in-law were independent risk factors for hypertensive disorders among Chinese pregnant women.

   CONTENTS
AB Special care is required for airway management of patients undergoing emergency Cesarean section. Although the incidence of difficult intubation and difficult ventilation is similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women, the severity of complications in pregnant patients would be much greater than in non-pregnant patients, if tracheal intubation is found to be difficult: increased risk of pulmonary aspiration, hypoxia, airway obstruction due to laryngeal edema, and a "sleeping baby" being taken out. Rapid-sequence induction of anesthesia is generally indicated to a patient undergoing emergency Cesarean section under general anesthesia. The technique has been evolving, without losing the key premise of minimizing the period of the airway being not protected from pulmonary aspiration, and of permitting rapid wake up if tracheal intubation fails. In this review, I describe the appropriate airway management, based on the current state of knowledge, in a patient undergoing emergency Cesarean section under general anesthesia.

AB Introduction: Women living with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of mental health issues. To date, global guidelines contain insufficient guidance on mental health support, particularly regarding perinatal care. The aim of this article is to describe the extent and impact of mental health issues as experienced by women living with HIV on their sexual and reproductive health and human rights (SRH&HR).
   Methods: A global, mixed-methods, user-led and designed survey on SRH&HR of women living with HIV was conducted using snowball sampling, containing an optional section exploring mental health issues. Statistical quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple linear regression analysis for the mental health responses. Thematic analysis of open free-text responses was performed for qualitative data.
   Results: A total of 832 respondents from 94 countries participated in the online survey with 489 responses to the optional mental health section. Of the respondents, 82% reported depression symptoms and 78% rejection. One-fifth reported mental health issues before HIV diagnosis. Respondents reported experiencing a 3.5-fold higher number of mental health issues after diagnosis (8.71 vs 2.48, t[488] = 23.00, p<0.001). Nearly half (n = 224; 45.8%) had multiple socially disadvantaged identities (SDIs). The number of SDIs was positively correlated with experiencing mental health issues (p<0.05). Women described how mental health issues affected their ability to enjoy their right to sexual and reproductive health and to access services. These included depression, rejection and social exclusion, sleep problems, intersectional stigma, challenges with sexual and intimate relationships, substance use and sexual risk, reproductive health barriers and human rights (HR) violations. Respondents recommended that policymakers and clinicians provide psychological support and counselling, funding for peer support and interventions to challenge gender-based violence and to promote HR.
   Conclusions: Interventions addressing intersecting stigmas and any especial impacts of diagnosis during pregnancy are required to ensure women's SRH& HR. Global policy guidelines regarding women living with HIV must incorporate mental health considerations.

AB This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named "mixed)", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

AB Recent reports account for altered metabolism in adult offspring from pregnancy subjected to abnormal photoperiod, suggesting fetal programming of liver physiology. To generate a pipeline of subsequent mechanistic experiments addressing strong candidate genes, here we investigated the effects of constant gestational light on the fetal liver transcriptome. At 10 days of gestation, dams were randomized in two groups (n = 7 each): constant light (LL) and normal photoperiod (12 h light/12 h dark; LD). At 18 days of gestation, RNA was isolated from the fetal liver and subjected to DNA microarray (Affymetrix platform for 28,000 genes). Selected differential mRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR), while integrated transcriptional changes were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and other bioinformatics tools. Comparison of LL relative to LD fetal liver led to the following findings. Significant differential expression was found for 3,431 transcripts (1,960 upregulated and 1,471 downregulated), with 393 of them displaying >= 1.5-fold change. We validated 27 selected transcripts by qPCR, which displayed fold-change values highly correlated with microarray (r(2) = 0.91). Different markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were either upregulated (e.g., Ndn and Pnpla3) or downregulated (e.g., Gnmt, Bhmt1/2, Sult1a1, Mpo, and Mat1a). Diverse pathways were altered, including hematopoiesis, coagulation cascade, complement system, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The microRNAs 7a-1, 431, 146a, and 153 were upregulated, while the abundant hepatic miRNA 122 was downregulated. Constant gestational light induced extensive modification of the fetal liver transcriptome. A number of differentially expressed transcripts belong to fundamental functional pathways, potentially contributing to longterm liver disease.

AB Background: Pregnancy rates in veterans are an understudied phenomenon. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify predictors of pregnancy within 1 year of starting hormonal contraception among female veterans. Methods: This was a retrospective, cohort study of female veterans from Veterans Affairs facilities within Southern California and Nevada, who newly started hormonal contraception (pill, patch, or ring only) between October 2008 and September 2012. Pregnancy was defined as any event corresponding to a pregnant state using ICD-9 codes. Patients were followed for 1 year post-initiation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The final analysis included a total of 2166 patients. Approximately 5.9% (n = 127) of patients became pregnant during follow-up. Increased odds of pregnancy were associated with the following: mental health disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.58), lowest socioeconomic quintile (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.05-2.09), and Christian faith (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.31-2.41). Age groups 25 to 34 years (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.92] and 35 to 44 years (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.06-0.64) were both associated with decreased odds of pregnancy versus age group 18 to 24 years. Conclusion: This study successfully identified several predictors of pregnancy in female veterans starting a pill, patch, or ring form of hormonal contraception. Female veterans in the lowest socioeconomic quintile, aged 18 to 24 years, diagnosed with a mental health disorder, and of Christian faith were found to be at significantly higher odds of a pregnancy. Identification of these at-risk populations may help clinicians and policy makers choose strategies to identify which patients could benefit the most from more effective long-acting reversible contraception therapy.

AB Obstetrician-gynecologists are the leading experts in the health care of women, and obesity is the most common health care problem in women of reproductive age. Obesity in women is such a common problem that the implications relative to pregnancy often are unrecognized, overlooked, or ignored because of the lack of specific evidence-based treatment options. The management of obesity requires long-term approaches ranging from population-based public health and economic initiatives to individual nutritional, behavioral, or surgical interventions. Therefore, an understanding of the management of obesity during pregnancy is essential, and management should begin before conception and continue through the postpartum period. Although the care of the obese woman during pregnancy requires the involvement of the obstetrician or other obstetric care provider, additional health care professionals, such as nutritionists, can offer specific expertise related to management depending on the comfort level of the obstetric care provider. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to offer an integrated approach to the management of obesity in women of reproductive age who are planning a pregnancy.

AB The secretion of the stress hormone cortisol follows a diurnal circadian rhythm. There are indications that this rhythm is affected by stress early in life. This paper addresses the development of the cortisol circadian rhythm between 1 and 6 years of age, and the role of maternal stress and anxiety early in the child's life on this (developing) rhythm. Participants were 193 healthy mother-child dyads from a community sample. Self-reported maternal stress and anxiety and physiological stress (saliva cortisol), were assessed prenatally (gestational week 37). Postnatally, self-reported maternal stress and anxiety were measured at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 72 months, Saliva cortisol samples from the children were collected on two days (four times each day) at 12, 30, and 72 months of age. The total amount of cortisol during the day and the cortisol decline over the day were determined to indicate children's cortisol circadian rhythm. Multilevel analyses showed that the total amount of cortisol decreased between 1 and 6 years. Furthermore, more maternal pregnancy-specific stress was related to higher total amounts of cortisol in the child. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal anxiety were associated with flatter cortisol declines in children. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal daily hassles were associated with steeper child cortisol declines over the day. These results indicated developmental change in children's cortisol secretion from 1 to 6 years and associations between maternal stress and anxiety early in children's lives and children's cortisol circadian rhythm in early childhood.

AB Background: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers.
   Method: One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4-6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points.
   Results: Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure.
   Conclusion: Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4-6 months postpartum it tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

AB Introduction: Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children. More recently antenatal depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and offspring development.
   Methods: We used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available for n=14 in the CBT group and n=11 in the TAU group.
   Results: No differences by treatment arm were evident. improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was associated with easier temperament (beta= -.45, p=.024) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration (beta= -.58, p=.003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT group compared to the TAU group.
   Limitations: This was a pilot RCT and as such the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the baseline and postnatal assessment.
   Conclusion: improvement in antenatal depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in the postnatal mother-infant relationship remains to be determined.

AB Pregnancy is the most sensitive period in women's life which makes many physical and mental changes. Sleep problems are one of the issues that are reported by pregnant women. It appears to be associated with psychological consequences in pregnant women. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and insomnia in pregnant women referred to health centers in estahban. This descriptive-analytic study has been done on 182 pregnant women referred to health centers of Estahban in 2015 by available sampling method. Research tools used in this study were general health questionnaire 28 (GHQ 28) and insomnia severity index (ISI). Data were analyzed using Chi-Square and Pearson Correlation tests in SPSS 22 software. Research findings showed that 46.2% of women were suspected of mental disorders, and 58.8% of them suffered from insomnia. According to Chi-square test, there was a significant relationship between total score of mental health and a total score of insomnia (r=0.58, p<0.05). Also, a significant relationship was observed in all variables of mental health and insomnia (p<0.05). Results indicate a high level of mental disorders as well as insomnia among pregnant women; also, the mutual effect of these diseases on each other. As a result, sleep hygiene education as well as appropriate consideration and counseling to pregnant women to treat disorders for achieving a safe pregnancy are recommended.

SO OBSTETRIC MEDICINE

DT Review
DE Pregnancy; insomnia; adverse outcomes; therapy
AB Insomnia and sleep deficiency in pregnancy are very common with most women reporting sleep disturbances during pregnancy. Insomnia and sleep deficiency are also more prevalent as pregnancy progresses, possibly related to pregnancy-related physical symptoms or discomfort. There is increasing evidence indicating that these sleep problems may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as depressive symptoms, increased pain during labor, more Caesarean sections, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Treatment of insomnia remains challenging as some of the more commonly used sleep inducing medications such as benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy are available but the data in pregnancy are often lacking.

AB Background: The objective of this study is to explore and document perceptions and attitude associated with uptake of interventions to prevent malaria in pregnancy infection during pregnancy in Enugu State, Nigeria.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in three local government areas in Enugu State to identify the people's perceptions and attitudes towards sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets and uptake of recommended doses of intermittent presumptive treatment during pregnancy. In-depth interview guides were employed to collect data from health workers and mothers who delivered within 6 months preceding the study, while focus group discussion guides were employed in collecting data from grandmothers and fathers of children born within 6 months preceding the study.
   Results: The people expressed fairly good knowledge of malaria, having lived in the malaria-endemic communities. However, some were ignorant on what should be done to prevent malaria in pregnancy. Those who were aware of the use of insecticide-treated bednets and intermittent presumptive treatment during pregnancy however lamented the attitude of the health workers, who make access to these interventions difficult.
   Conclusions: Efforts to prevent malaria in pregnancy should focus on providing health education to pregnant women and their partners, who reinforce what the women are told during antenatal care. The attitude of health workers towards patients, who need these interventions, should be targeted for change.

AB Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was composed by 143 depressed (n=77) and non-depressed (n=66) pregnant women who completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep during the night and the entire 24h period. Present findings point out the effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety.

AB Background: Common mental disorder (CMD) and sleep disturbance are two common conditions among women in late pregnancy, affecting up to 20% and 63% of women, respectively, and may adversely affect their quality of life.Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and persistent CMD among low-income pregnant women living in Brazil.Methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted with pregnant women recruited from public primary care clinics in SAo Paulo, Brazil. We performed a longitudinal analysis of 219 women who had CMD from the Self-Report Questionnaire during the 20-30 weeks of pregnancy. Two groups were examined: (1) those who had CMD remission in the postpartum and (2) those who had persistent CMD in the postpartum (measured once in the postpartum period). Poisson regression was used to estimate the degree of association between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and the risk for persistent CMD postpartum.Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, sleep disturbance during pregnancy is associated with persistent CMD (RR=1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.84).Conclusion: In this sample of low-income pregnant women living in Brazil, the presence of sleep disturbance during pregnancy was associated with persistent common mental disorder in the postpartum period. Identification of sleep disturbance in pregnant women with CMD will be important in order to recognize those women at higher risk of persistent CMD in the postpartum period.

AB Biological rhythms are driven by endogenous biological clocks; in mammals, the master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. This master pacemaker can synchronize other peripheral oscillators in several tissues such as some involved in endocrine or reproductive functions. The presence of an endogenous placental clock has received little attention. In fact, there are no studies in human full-term placentas. To test the existence of an endogenous pacemaker in this tissue we have studied the expression of circadian locomoter output cycles kaput (Clock), brain and muscle arnt-like (Bmal)1, period (Per)2, and cryptochrome (Cry)1 mRNAs at 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, and 20 hours by qPCR. The four clock genes studied are expressed in full-term human placenta. The results obtained allow us to suggest that a peripheral oscillator exists in human placenta. Data were analyzed using Fourier series where only the Clock and Bmal1 expression shows a circadian rhythm.

TI Technical Versus Public Spheres: A Feminist Analysis of Women's Rhetoric
   in the Twilight Sleep Debates of 1914-1916
SO HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women's movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women's health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women's health and birthing practices, doctor-patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

AB Purpose of review
   The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.
   Recent findings
   Symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can negatively impact the ability to mother effectively.
   Summary
   The presence of insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB Kisspeptin is an essential gatekeeper of reproductive function. During pregnancy high circulating levels of kisspeptin have been described, however the clear role of this neuropeptide in pregnancy remains unknown. We tested the existence of rhythmic kisspeptin expression in human full-term placenta from healthy pregnant women at six different time points during the day. The data obtained by Western blotting were fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series), demonstrating, for the first time, the existence of a circadian rhythm in placental kisspeptin expression.

AB Fever has been recognized as an important symptom of disease since ancient times. For many years, fever was treated as a putative life-threatening phenomenon. More recently, it has been recognized as an important part of the body's defense mechanisms; indeed at times it has even been used as a therapeutic agent. The knowledge of the functional role of the central nervous system in the genesis of fever has greatly improved over the last decade. It is clear that the febrile process, which develops in the sick individual, is just one of many brain-controlled sickness symptoms. Not only will the sick individual appear "feverish" but they may also display a range of behavioral changes, such as anorexia, fatigue, loss of interest in usual daily activities, social withdrawal, listlessness or malaise, hyperalgesia, sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction, collectively termed "sickness behavior". In this review we consider the issue of whether fever and sickness behaviors are friend or foe during: a critical illness, the common cold or influenza, in pregnancy and in the newborn. Deciding whether these sickness responses are beneficial or harmful will very much shape our approach to the use of antipyretics during illness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother-infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum.
   Methods: The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants' sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms.
   Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reportedmore infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months.
   Conclusion: Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zurich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano).
   Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels < 35 mu g/l or hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dl were included in the study. RLS was graded according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Study Group rating scale. All participants had a score of >= 20 or had RLS >= 3 times/week. Based on the Hb levels, 500 or 700 mg of FCM was administered over 20 min. The primary end point was a >= 50% reduction in the mean IRLS score one week after FCM infusion. The secondary end points included periodic limb movements (PLMs; assessed using nocturnal foot actigraphy), sleep quality (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and safety.
   Results: The IRLS score decreased from 23 +/- 7 (baseline) to 13 +/- 7 (P < 0.01), whereas the PLM index decreased from 35 +/- 26 (baseline) to 25 +/- 20 (P < 0.001). Significant improvement in sleep quality was also reported (P < 0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to treatment.
   Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Glucocorticoids and serotonin may mediate the link between maternal environment, fetal brain development and 'programming' of offspring behaviors. The placenta regulates fetal exposure to maternal hormonal signals in animal studies, but few data address this in humans. We measured prospectively maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and mRNAs encoding key gene products determining glucocorticoid and serotonin function in term human placenta and explored associations with infant regulatory behaviors.
   Method. Bi-weekly self-ratings of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale from 12th to 13th gestational week onwards and term placental mRNAs of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2B11), type 1 (HSD1B11), glucocorticoid (NR3C1), mineralocorticoid receptors (NR3C2) and serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) were obtained from 54 healthy mothers aged 32.2 +/- 5.3 years with singleton pregnancies and without pregnancy complications. Infant regulatory behaviors (crying, feeding, spitting, elimination, sleeping and predictability) were mother-rated at 15.6 +/- 4.2 days.
   Results. Higher placental mRNA levels of HSD2B11 [0.41 standard deviation (S.D.) unit increase per S.D. unit increase; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.69, p = 0.005], HSD1B11 (0.30, 0.03-0.57, p = 0.03), NR3C1 (0.44, 0.19-0.68, p = 0.001) and SLC6A4 (0.26, 0.00-0.53, p = 0.05) were associated with more regulatory behavioral challenges of the infant. Higher placental NR3C1 mRNA partly mediated the association between maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and infant regulatory behaviors (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions. Higher placental expression of genes regulating feto-placental glucocorticoid and serotonin exposure is characteristic of infants with more regulatory behavioral challenges. Maternal depression acts, at least partly, via altering glucocorticoid action in the placenta to impact on offspring regulatory behaviors.

TI Recommendations for endocrinological aspects in adolescents with

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EPILEPTOLOGIE
LA German
DT Article
DE Epilepsy; Hormones; Glucose metabolism; Thyroid axis; Contraception
AB During growth and puberty profound changes in metabolic/ endocrine compartments are paralleled by the maturation of various hormone systems (e. g. sex-steroid axis, bone health, lipid and glucose homeostasis). On the one hand, things often change with epilepsy and the disease per semight influence enzyme systems. On the other hand, antiepileptic drugs (AED) are well known to elicit diverse neuroendocrine changes. Data concerning the thyroid axis are far from conclusive but regular measurement of serum hormones is recommended. Monitoring of bone health in children and adolescents with epilepsy comprises a thorough evaluation of the risk profile and periodic determination of vitamin D concentrations. To achievemaximumsafety, the use of an oral contraceptive containing a progestin dose above that needed to inhibit ovulation without a pill-free interval (a socalled " long cycle") is suggested. Furthermore, the use of additional barrier methods or -alternatively -classic or levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine devices should be taken into consideration. In the case of pregnancy, extensive instruction concerning sleep and compliance, as well as frequent determination of AED serum levels are necessary. When lamotrigine is combined with an oral contraceptive, physicians should be aware of decreasing lamotrigine concentrations, whereas mid-cycle bleedings might point towards loss of contraceptive safety. To sum up, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to monitor possible neuro-endocrine alterations that warrant further examination and treatment, especially in adolescent girls and boys.

AB Background: In recent years, there is considerable evidence of a relationship between the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) and pain disorders, including migraine and fibromyalgia. An association between multi-site pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of young adults.
   Methods: Twenty two year olds (n = 1072), followed since birth of part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex, psychological distress and sleep quality.
   Results: The prevalence of RLS was 3.0 % and MSK pain was reported by 37.4 % of the participants. In multivariable logistic regression models, strong associations were found between RLS-diagnosis and long duration (three months or more) of MSK pain (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 1.4-9.2) and reporting three or more pain sites (4.9, 1.6-14.6).
   Conclusions: Different dimensions of MSK pain were associated with RLS in young adults, suggestive of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Overlap between these conditions requires more clinical and research attention.

AB Understanding how metabolite levels change over the 24 hour day is of crucial importance for clinical and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the association between sleep deprivation and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity requires investigation into the links between sleep and metabolism. Here, we characterise time-of-day variation and the effects of sleep deprivation on urinary metabolite profiles. Healthy male participants (n=15) completed an in-laboratory study comprising one 24 h sleep/wake cycle prior to 24 h of continual wakefulness under highly controlled environmental conditions. Urine samples were collected over set 2-8 h intervals and analysed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Significant changes were observed with respect to both time of day and sleep deprivation. Of 32 identified metabolites, 7 (22%) exhibited cosine rhythmicity over at least one 24 h period; 5 exhibiting a cosine rhythm on both days. Eight metabolites significantly increased during sleep deprivation compared with sleep (taurine, formate, citrate, 3-indoxyl sulfate, carnitine, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, TMAO and acetate) and 8 significantly decreased (dimethylamine, 4-DTA, creatinine, ascorbate, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, allantoin, 4-DEA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate). These data indicate that sampling time, the presence or absence of sleep and the response to sleep deprivation are highly relevant when identifying biomarkers in urinary metabolic profiling studies.

AB Background: Universal long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage (ULC) has reduced malaria morbidity and mortality across Africa. Although information is available on bed net use in specific groups, such as pregnant women and children under 5 years, there is paucity of data on their use among the general population. Bed net source, ownership and determinants of use among individuals from households in an eastern Rwanda community 8 months after a ULC were characterized.
   Methods: Using household-based, interviewer-administered questionnaires and interviewer-direct observations, data on bed net source, ownership and key determinants of net use, including demographics, socio-economic status indicators, house structure characteristics, as well as of bed net quantity, type and integrity, were collected from 1400 randomly selected households. Univariate and mixed effects logistic regression modelling was done to assess for determinants of bed net use.
   Results: A total of 1410 households and 6598 individuals were included in the study. Overall, the proportion of households with at least one net was 92 % while bed net usage was reported among 72 % of household members. Of the households surveyed, a total ownership of 2768 nets was reported, of which about 96 % were reportedly LLINs received from the ULC. By interviewer-physical observation, 88 % of the nets owned were of the LLIN type with the remaining 12 % did not carry any mark to enable type recognition. The odds of bed net use were significantly lower among males and individuals: from households of low socio-economic status, from households with < two bed nets, from households reporting use of >= two sleeping spaces, and those reporting to have not slept on a bed.
   Conclusion: In this study, despite high a bed net coverage, over 25 % of members reported not to have slept under a bed net the night before the survey. Males were particularly less likely to use bed nets even where nets were available. Household socio-economic status, number of bed nets and type and number of sleeping spaces were key determinants of bed net use. To maximize impact of ULC, strategies that target males as well as those that ensure ITN coverage for all, address barriers to feasible and convenient bed net use including covering over all sleeping space types, and provide net hanging supports, are needed.

AB Background: The incidence of pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnancy is wide ranged depending on definition, the utilised diagnostic means, and the design of the studies. PGP during pregnancy has negative effects on activities of daily living and causes long sick leave, which makes it a major public health issue. Our objectives were to explore the frequency of sick leave in pregnancy due to PGP, assess the relationship between different types of pain-related activities of daily living, examine physical workload, type of work in relation to sick leave, and to explore factors that make women less likely to take sick leave for PGP.
   Methods: All women giving birth at the maternity ward of Stavanger University Hospital, Norway, were asked to participate and complete a questionnaire on demographic features, PGP, pain-related activities of daily living, sick leave in general and for PGP, frequency of exercising before and during pregnancy. Drawings of pelvic girdle and low back area were used for the localization of pain. PGP intensity was then rated retrospectively on a numerical rating scale. Non-parametric tests, multinomial logistic regression and sequential linear regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
   Results: PGP is a frequent and major cause of sick leave during pregnancy among Norwegian women, which is also reflected in activities of daily living as measured with scores on all Oswestry disability index items. In the multivariate analysis of factors related to sick leave and PGP we found that work satisfaction, problems with lifting and sleeping, and pain intensity were risk factors for sick leave. In addition, women with longer education, higher work satisfaction and fewer problems with sitting, walking and standing, were less likely to take sick leave in pregnancy, despite the same pain intensity as women being on sick leave.
   Conclusions: A coping factor in pregnant women with PGP was discovered, most likely dependant on education, associated with work situation and/or work posture, which decreases sick leave. We recommend these issues to be further examined in a prospective longitudinal study since it may have important implications for sick leave frequency during pregnancy.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy on maternal care and maternal aggression in a rodent model.
   Methods: Twenty-three female Wistar rats were assigned to one of two groups: control (n=12) or sleep restriction (n=11) during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth postpartum day, the animals were subjected to the resident-intruder paradigm and to the pup retrieval test.
   Results: Sleep restriction during pregnancy had no direct effects on maternal care. Regarding aggressive behavior, defensive aggression was increased by sleep loss, with a lower responsiveness threshold to hostile environmental stimuli. Sleep deprivation during gestation also reduced self-grooming behavior.
   Conclusion: Taking increased self-grooming as a behavioral correlate of anxiety in rodents, this study provides evidence that lactating dams were in a condition of reduced anxiety. From an adaptive perspective, this pattern of stress response may function to ensure proper maternal behavior, thereby guaranteeing the survival and viability of the litter. Under a translational perspective, the present article confronts the importance of biological and adaptive features to rodent maternal behavior with the relevance of sociocultural factors to the human mother-infant relationship and to the onset of postpartum depression.

   PREVALENCE; POSTPARTUM; RESISTANCE; SEVERITY
AB BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, upper airway resistance is increased, predisposing vulnerable women to pregnancy-related OSA. Elevation of the upper body increases upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and improves severity of OSA in a subgroup of nonpregnant patients (positional-dependent sleep apnea). We tested the hypothesis that elevated position of the upper body improves OSA early aft er delivery.
   METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, we conducted a randomized, crossover study on two postpartum units of Massachusetts General Hospital. Women during the first 48 h after delivery were included. Polysomnography was performed in nonelevated and 45 degrees elevated upper body position. Upper airway CSA was measured by acoustic pharyngometry in nonelevated, 45 degrees elevated, and sitting body position.
   RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled, and measurements of airway CSA obtained. Thirty patients completed polysomnography in both body positions. Elevation of the upper body significantly reduced apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 7.7 +/- 2.2/h in nonelevated to 4.5 +/- 1.4/h in 45 degrees elevated upper body position (P = .031) during sleep. Moderate to severe OSA (AHI > 15/h) was diagnosed in 20% of postpartum patients and successfully treated by elevated body position in one-half of them. Total sleep time and sleep architecture were not affected by upper body elevation. Change from nonelevated to sitting position increased inspiratory upper airway CSA from 1.35 +/- 0.1 cm(2) to 1.54 +/- 0.1 cm(2) during wakefulness. Position-dependent increase in CSA and decrease in AHI were correlated (r = 0.42, P = .022).
   CONCLUSIONS: Among early postpartum women, 45 degrees upper body elevation increased upper airway CSA and mitigated sleep apnea. Elevated body position might improve respiratory safety in women early aft er delivery.

TI Reducing Risks to Women Linked to Shift Work, Long Work Hours, and
   Related Workplace Sleep and Fatigue Issues
SO JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MARITAL INSTABILITY; NONSTANDARD WORK; HEART-DISEASE; METAANALYSIS;
   DISORDERS; PREGNANCY; SCHEDULES
AB In the United States, an estimated 12% to 28% of working women are on shift work schedules, and 12% work more than 48 hours per week. Shift work and long work hours are associated with many health and safety risks, including obesity, injuries, and negative reproductive outcomes. Over time, the worker is at risk for developing a wide range of chronic diseases. These work schedules can also strain personal relationships, owing to fatigue and poor mood from sleep deprivation and reduced quality time to spend with family and friends. Worker errors from fatigue can lead to reduced quality of goods and services, negatively impacting the employer. In addition, mistakes by fatigued workers can have far-reaching negative effects on the community, ranging from medical care errors to motor vehicle crashes and industrial disasters that endanger others. To reduce the many risks that are linked to these demanding work hours, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research, develops guidance and authoritative recommendations, and translates and disseminates scientific information to protect workers, their families, employers, and the community. The key message to reduce these risks is making sleep a priority in the employer's systems for organizing work and in the worker's personal life. The NIOSH website has freely available online training programs with suggestions for workers and their managers to help them better cope with this workplace hazard.

AB This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep quality and unplanned Caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent unplanned Caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned Caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section (95% CI=1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned Caesarean deliveries.

AB Background Migraine is associated with sleep disturbances in men and non-pregnant women. However, relatively little is known about sleep disturbances among pregnant migraineurs. We investigated sleep disturbances among pregnant women with and without history of migraine.
   Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy. Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results Migraineurs were more likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (<6.5 hours) (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.02), poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR=1.51, 95% CI 1.12-2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20-2.42). Associations were generally similar for migraine with or without aura. The odds of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight migraineurs.
   Conclusion Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common comorbid conditions among pregnant women.

AB Objective: To identify risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI) and assess the quality of life (QoL) of affected women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of all women with UI who attended the urology and gynecology services of four hospitals in central Portugal between March and December 2012. Information was obtained from participants using questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, obstetric, gynecologic, and lifestyle variables. Results: Among 505 participants, 351 (69.5%) had urgency UI, 107 (21.2%) stress UI, and 47 (9.3%) mixed UI. Stress UI was associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, constipation, gravidity, parity, and vaginal infections (P <= 0.02 for all). Urgency UI was associated with age above 50 years, employment, smoking, and sitting for 2 hours or less per day (P <= 0.02 for all). Mixed UI was associated with age 50 years or younger, smoking, sitting for 2 hours or less per day, and frequently carrying more than 3 kg in weight (P < 0.001 for all). A negative impact on QoL was reported by 501 (99.2%) women. Compared with younger participants, women older than 50 years presented with more sleep/energy disturbances and performance limitations (P <= 0.04 for both). Conclusion: UI is associated with several risk factors and has a negative impact on QoL. Appropriate investigation regarding the factors associated with the types of UI should be performed to diminish its impact on QoL (C) 2015 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of home care practices in very to moderately preterm (VPT), late preterm (LPT) and term infants born in Massachusetts.
   STUDY DESIGN: Using 2007 to 2010 Massachusetts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data, births were categorized by gestational age (VPT: 23 to 33 weeks; LPT: 34 to 36 weeks; term: 37 to 42 weeks). Home care practices included breastfeeding initiation and continuation, and infant sleep practices (supine sleep position, sleeping in a crib, cosleeping in an adult bed). We developed multivariate models to examine the association of infant sleep practices and breastfeeding with preterm status, controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics.
   RESULTS: Supine sleep position was more prevalent among term infants compared with VPT and LPT infants (77.1%, 71.5%, 64.4%; P = 0.02). In the adjusted model, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position compared with term infants (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.97). Breastfeeding initiation and continuation did not differ among preterm and term groups. Nearly 16% of VPT and 18% of LPT and term infants were not sleeping in cribs and 14% of LPT and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed.
   CONCLUSION: Compared with term infants, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position after hospital discharge. A significant percent of preterm and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed. Hospitals may consider improving their safe sleep education, particularly to mothers of LPT infants.

AB Objectives: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
   Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35-3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45-4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse.
   Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Up to 10% of pregnant women take antidepressants, of which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed. Using a rodent model, we investigated the reproductive impacts of perinatal SSRI treatment on reproductive cyclicity and function in female offspring.
   Methods: Virgin Wistar rats were given oral vehicle (n = 10) or fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLX, 10 mg/kg/d; n = 11) from 2 weeks prior to mating until weaning. Pubertal onset and reproductive cyclicity in offspring were assessed. Blood and ovarian tissues were collected for measures of reproductive function.
   Results: Perinatal FLX tends to induce irregular reproductive cycles in adult offspring, which most commonly manifest as a prolonged estrus phase (FLX 34% vs control [CON] 10%) relative to CON offspring. The FLX offspring tended to have longer cycles (P = .052), had more secondary follicles (P = .0067), more total follicles (P = .0310), and increased apoptotic ovarian cells (P < .001). Prenatally exposed FLX offspring demonstrated elevated ovarian messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of ER (P = .008), Cry1 (P = .043), and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (P = .024), independent of stage of cycle. Ovarian mRNA levels of brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (P = .046) and Pet-1 (P = .021) were increased in FLX offspring a manner that was reproductive cycle stage dependent.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the postnatal effects of maternal perinatal exposure to FLX on adult offspring reproduction. We show that genes that regulate serotonin signaling and action in the ovary are altered in prenatally FLX-exposed offspring, which when coupled with increased expression of components of the core Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene regulatory loop may suggest an interaction between serotonergic signaling and clock gene signaling pathways leading to the altered reproductive phenotype.

AB David Barker established growth as a seminal link between early development and later health attainment and disease risk. This was nothing less than a paradigm shift in health and medicine, turning the focus of disease causality away from contemporary environmental influences to earliest growth as a time when functional anatomy and physiology sets in place critical structures and function for a lifetime.
   Barker's prodigious work investigated time- and place-specific interactions between maternal condition and exogenous environmental influences, focusing on how growth unfolds across development to function as a mechanistic link to ensuing health. Subsequent applications do not always attend to the specificity and sensitivity issues included in his original work, and commonly overlook the long-standing methods and knowledge base of auxology. Methodological areas in need of refinement include enhanced precision in how growth is represented and assessed. For example, multiple variables have been used as a referent for 'growth,' which is problematic because different body dimensions grow by different biological clocks with unique functional physiologies. In addition, categorical clinical variables obscure the spectrum of variability in growth experienced at the individual level. Finally, size alone is a limited measure as it does not capture how individuals change across age, or actually grow.
   The ground-breaking notion that prenatal influences are important for future health gave rise to robust interest in studying the fetus. Identifying the many pathways by which size is realized permits targeted interventions addressing meaningful mechanistic links between growth and disease risk to promote health across the lifespan.

AB Stress during rat gestation can elicit depression-like physiological and behavioral responses in the offspring. However, human clinical depression is more prevalent among females than males. Accordingly, we examined how repeated variable prenatal stress (PS) alters rat anxiety- and depression-like behavior as well as circadian patterning of motor activity in both male and female offspring. For this purpose, we exposed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to multiple stressors during gestational days 13-21. Subsequently, we monitored locomotor and rearing/climbing activities in home-like cages for 24 h and measured anxiety- (elevated plus maze, EPM) and depression-like (forced swim test, FST) behaviors in the offspring at a young adult age. As a stressful event later in life (in addition to PS) may be needed to actually trigger an episode of clinical depression, half of the animals were exposed to an acute stressor (elevated platform) before EPM testing. Dams exposed to the stressor battery had increased plasma corticosterone levels compared with controls. Male PS offspring displayed changes in locomotor and rearing/climbing activity relative to controls. Additionally, anxiety measures in the EPM were affected in control animals after acute stressor exposure, however, this response was blunted in PS offspring. Moreover, FST immobility, as an indicator of depressive-like behavior, was increased in female but not male PS rats. Altogether, our results identify both sex- and circadian phase-specific effects of PS. These findings indicate that the PS rat model reflects multiple clinical depression characteristics, including elevated female vulnerability.

AB Levodopa and dopamine agonists have been the main treatment for restless legs syndrome during the past decades. Although their efficacy has been well documented over the short term, long-term dopaminergic treatment is often complicated by augmentation, loss of efficacy, and other side effects. Recent large randomized controlled trials provide new evidence for the efficacy of high-potency opioids and alpha 2 delta ligands, and several post hoc analyses, metaanalyses, algorithms, and guidelines have been published, often with a specific focus, for example, on augmentation, or on management of restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. Several new contributions to understanding the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome have been published, but at this time, whether they will have an impact on treatment possibilities in the future cannot be estimated.

AB BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) is a major public health problem in developing countries including India. The epidemiological observations depicted that infants weighing lesser than 2500 g are approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier babies, closely associated with the fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. The present study was undertaken with the objectives to find out the relevant socio-demographic and biological determinants of Low Birth Weight babies and to assess the degree of association between impact of health education and Low birth weight babies. METHODS: A community based cross sectional study was conducted from May - August 2013 in Dilawarganj, an urban slum, the field practice area of Department of Community Medicine, MGM Medical College, Kishanganj, Bihar. Study population comprised of women in 3rd trimester of pregnancy belonged to DILAWARGANJ urban slum area. 100 mothers of low birth weight and normal birth weight babies at urban slum of Kishanganj (Among them 33 mothers had delivered LBW babies & 67 mothers had delivered normal babies) were selected and interviewed through house to house survey with the help of a pre-designed, pre-tested and semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the sociodemographic factors that have been considered in the present study, it was observed that 51.5% mothers belong to age group 20 - 29, 84.8% mothers from Muslim community, 66.67% mothers were illiterate, 69.7% mothers were multipara, 75.76% mothers reside in a nuclear family 60.6% mothers were engaged in agricultural fields66.67% belong to lower and poor socio-economic group. It was also observed that 84.85% mothers do not consumes extra meals, 81.82% do not take adequate rest & sleep, 93.9% mothers take less than 100 IFA tablets, 69.7% mothers attend less than 3 ANC, 84.85% mothers practice exclusive breast feeding and 78.8% mother give vaccines to their babies. CONCLUSION: The study of LBW baby in Kishanganj, Bihar has highlighted the factors regarding high prevalence of LBW baby and identified socio-demographic profile and common existing problems. To combat these factors, better training to health care providers should be done and implementation of different policies by the government was needed.

AB It has been postulated that prenatal cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome. The victims of infant death syndrome suffer from respiratory abnormalities, such as central apnea, diminished chemoreflex and alteration in respiratory pattern during sleep. However, no experimental evidence on CSE model exists to confirm whether prenatal CSE gives rise to reduction of neonatal central chemoreception in in vitro preparations in absence of peripheral sensory feedback. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that maternal CSE during pregnancy depresses central chemoreception of the neonatal rats. The pregnant rats were divided into two groups, control (n = 8) and CSE (n = 8). Experiments were performed on neonatal (0-3days) rat pups. Fictive respiratory activity was monitored by recording the rhythmic discharge from the hypoglossal rootlets of the medullary slices obtained from the neonatal rats. The burst frequency (BF) and integrated amplitude (IA) of the discharge were analyzed. Their responses to acidified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) were tested to indicate the change of the central chemosensitivity. Under condition of perfusing with standard aCSF (pH 7.4), no significant difference was detected between the two groups in either BF or IA (P>0.05). Under condition of perfusing with acidified aCSF (pH 7.0), BF was increased and IA was decreased in both groups (P<0.01). However, their change rates in the CSE group were obviously smaller than that in the control group, 66.98 +/- 10.11% vs. 143.75 +/- 15.41% for BF and -22.38 +/- 2.51% vs. -44.90 +/- 3.92% for IA (P<0.01). In conclusion, these observations, in a prenatal CSE model, provide important evidence that maternal smoking during pregnancy exerts adverse effects on central chemoreception of neonates.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common and serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops during sleep, is associated with excess weight and obesity. Little is known about the co-occurrence of OSA among pregnant women from low and middle-income countries.
   Methods: We examined the extent to which maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity status are associated with high risk for OSA, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness in 1032 pregnant women in Lima, Peru. The Berlin questionnaire was used to identify women at high risk for OSA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to examine sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were employed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for putative confounding factors.
   Results: Compared with lean women (<25 kg/m(2)), overweight women (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) had 3.69-fold higher odds of high risk for OSA (95 % CI 1.82-7.50). The corresponding aOR for obese women (>= 30 kg/m(2)) was 13.23 (95 % CI: 6.25-28.01). Obese women, as compared with their lean counterparts had a 1.61-fold higher odds of poor sleep quality (95 % CI: 1.00-2.63).
   Conclusion: Overweight or obese pregnant women have increased odds of sleep disorders, particularly OSA. OSA screening and risk management may be indicated among pregnant women in low and middle income countries, particularly those undergoing rapid epidemiologic transitions characterized by increased prevalence of excessive adult weight gain.

AB Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) represents a spectrum of disorders, including habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep disordered breathing is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia, airflow limitation, and recurrent arousals, which may lead to tissue hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and inflammation. In this study, we aimed to examine whether SDB during pregnancy was associated with histopathologic evidence of chronic placental hypoxia and/or uteroplacental underperfusion. The placentas of women with OSA (n = 23) and habitual snoring (n = 78) as well as nonsnorer controls (n = 47) were assessed for histopathologic and immunohistochemical markers of chronic hypoxia and uteroplacental underperfusion. Fetal normoblastemia was significantly more prevalent in SDB placentas than in those of nonsnorer controls (34.6% and 56.5% in snorers and OSA, respectively, versus 6.4% in controls). Expression of the tissue hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) was more common in OSA placentas than controls (81.5% and 91.3% in snorers and OSA, respectively, versus 57.5% in controls). Adjusting for confounders such as body mass index, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension did not alter the results. The uteroplacental underperfusion scores were similar among the 3 groups. Our findings suggest that SDB during pregnancy is associated with fetoplacental hypoxia, as manifested by fetal normoblastemia and increased placental carbonic anhydrase IX immunoreactivity. The clinical implications and underlying mechanisms remain to be determined.

AB Introduction: recent studies suggest that women with gestational diabetes are more likely to suffer sleep disorders compared to pregnant women without diabetes. The objectives of this study were to analyze the risk factors associated with gestational diabetes and to verify if exist an association between the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes and the quality of the sleep and/or daytime sleepiness.
   Material and methods: case-controls study with a sample of 130 pregnant women, 46 of them with gestational diabetes and 84 controls. Anthropometric parameters such as weight, stature, body mass index (BMI) and abdominal perimeter were evaluated. Socio-demographic variables, including age and family situation were assessed, and a gynecological study was performed, evaluating the number of simple or multiple births, number of miscarriages and gynecological pathology during the past 3 years. The O'Sullivan test was conducted for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The quality of sleep and daytime sleepiness were also measured.
   Results: 46 women were diagnosed of gestational diabetes. There are significant differences (p < 0.001) in BMI scores among women with gestational diabetes and controls, being the highest values in the diabetic group. There is a significant association (p = 0.002) between the existence of family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes present a significant worse quality of sleep (p < 0.001), and values of daytime sleepiness higher than the general population.
   Conclusions: high values of BMI or family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be factors associated to the risk of suffer gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes have a poorer quality of sleep and a higher degree of daytime sleepiness than the general population, reducing the well-being of the mother and the fetus.

AB Study Objectives: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains an important cause of infant death, particularly among infants born preterm. Prone sleeping is the major risk factor for SIDS and this has recently been shown to alter cerebrovascular control in term infants. As preterm infants are at greater risk for SIDS than those born at term, we hypothesized that their cerebrovascular control in the prone position would be reduced compared to term infants.
   Patients or Participants: There were 35 preterm (mean gestation 31.2 +/- 0.4 w) and 17 term (mean gestation 40.1 +/- 0.3 w) infants.
   Design: Infants underwent daytime polysomnography at 2-4 w, 2-3 mo, and 5-6 mo postterm age. Infants slept both prone and supine and were presented with cardiovascular challenges in the form of 150 head-up tilts (HUT).
   Measurements and Results: Cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) was recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRO-200 spectrophotometer, Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Japan) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded using a Finometer cuff (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). In the prone position TOI increased following the HUT (P < 0.05), whereas no change was seen in the supine position. The overall pattern of response was similar in both groups, but more variable in preterm than term infants (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Cerebrovascular control differs between the prone and supine positions in preterm infants. Although overall the responses to headup tilts were similar between term and preterm infants, greater variability of responses in preterm infants suggests persisting immaturity of their cerebrovascular control in the first year of life, which may contribute to their increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome.

AB Background/Aims: Circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK) plays a key role in maintaining circadian rhythms and activation of downstream elements. However, its function on human female reproductive system remains unknown. Methods: To investigate the potential role of CLOCK, CLOCK-shRNAs were transfected into mouse 129 ES cells or injected into the ovaries of adult female mice. Western blotting was utilized to analyze the protein interactions and flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis. Results: The expression of CLOCK peaked at the 6th week in the healthy fetuses. However, an abnormal expression of CLOCK was detected in fetuses from spontaneous miscarriage. To determine the effect of CLOCK on female fertility, a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy was used to specifically knockdown the CLOCK gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of CLOCK induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and inhibited the proliferation in mES cells in vitro. CLOCK knockdown also led to decreased release of oocytes and smaller litter size compared with control in vivo. Conclusions: Collectively, theses findings indicate that CLOCK plays an important role in fertility and that the CLOCK knockdown leads to reduction in reproduction and increased miscarriage risk.

AB Sleep deprivation occurs when inadequate sleep leads to decreased performance, inadequate alertness, and deterioration in health. It is incompletely understood why humans need sleep, although some theories include energy conservation, restoration, and information processing. Sleep deprivation has many deleterious health effects. Residency programs have enacted strict work restrictions because of medically related errors due to sleep deprivation. Because obstetrics is an unpredictable specialty with long irregular hours, enacting a hospitalist program enhances patient safety, decreases malpractice risk, and improves the physician's quality of life by allowing obstetricians to get sufficient rest.

DT Article
ID RISK
AB Most infant apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) are minor with spontaneously favorable prognosis. Frequent etiologies are gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive apneas, respiratory infections, and breath-holding spells. Some rare but potentially serious causes must be discussed. Diagnosis is usually guided by careful questioning of the parents and repeated clinical examinations. A few complementary examinations are systematically needed and their performance is increased if they are oriented by clinical aspects. Hospitalization is usual for monitoring, further etiological investigation, and management of parental anxiety. ALTE and sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) etiologies are often different. SUDI is called sudden unexplained death in infancy if it remains unexplained after investigation including autopsy. The annual incidence in France fell sharply after prevention campaigns in the 1990s, and now is about 400 SUDI, including 250 unexplained SUDI. The main guidelines of prevention are back sleeping, cessation of smoking during and after pregnancy, securing the bed and bedding, prevention of hyperthermia, and avoidance of dangerous factors of bed sharing. In the future, infants with particular vulnerabilities may be identified. The Haute Autorite de sante (French National Authority for Health) has published guidelines to support SUDI, standardize procedures, and improve our understanding of the causes of death.

AB BackgroundPoor sleep has been studied in relation to various diseases. Few studies have investigated the effect of poor sleep on birth defects.
   MethodsWe examined the association of maternal poor sleep during periconceptional period and the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in offspring based on a large case-control study in northern China. The subjects included 629 NTD cases and 858 normal controls investigated between 2002 and 2007. Maternal sleep status was collected by health workers within first week after delivery. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of NTDs in association with poor sleep.
   ResultsThe proportion of mothers with frequent poor sleep (4 days/week on average) was markedly higher in NTDs group (5.9%) than in control group (1.2%). In the multivariate analysis, frequent poor sleep was significantly associated with an increased risk of total NTDs (adjusted OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.9-8.8) and spina bifida subtype (adjusted OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.8-14.5). Frequent poor sleep showed a significant interaction with body mass index (BMI). Relative to women who reported poor sleep <4 days/week and with BMI<24, frequent poor sleep showed a markedly higher increased risk of NTDs among overweight or obese women (adjusted OR, 11.8; 95% CI, 1.4-97.6) than women with BMI<24 (adjusted OR, 2.5; 95% CI,1.1-5.9).
   ConclusionMaternal frequent poor sleep during the periconceptional period may increase the risk for all NTDs and spina bifida. The association appears to be independent of some lifestyle factors that are closely associated with sleep quality. Birth Defects Research (Part A) 103:780-786, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Prenatal stress is a risk factor for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, many of which are commonly characterized by an increased persistence of aversive remote memory. Here, we addressed the effect of prenatal stress on both memory consolidation and functional connectivity in the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex axis, a dynamical interplay that is critical for mnemonic processing. Pregnant mice of the C57BL6 strain were subjected to restraint stressed during the last week of pregnancy, and male offspring were behaviorally tested at adulthood for recent and remote spatial memory performance in the Barnes Maze test under an aversive context. Prenatal stress did not affect the acquisition or recall of recent memory. In contrast, it produced the persistence of remote spatial memory. Memory persistence was not associated with alterations in major network rhythms, such as hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) or neocortical spindles. Instead, it was associated with a large decrease in the basal discharge activity of identified principal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as measured in urethane anesthetized mice. Furthermore, functional connectivity was disrupted, as the temporal coupling between neuronal discharge in the mPFC and hippocampal SWRs was decreased by prenatal stress. These results could be relevant to understand the biological basis of the persistence of aversive remote memories in stress-related disorders.

AB Introduction: This commentary describes a student-led project that distributed long-lasting insecticide-treated nets in Masaka, Uganda. The role of student-led initiatives in global health promotion projects is also discussed.
   Methods: A survey of 213 net recipients was conducted after a 12-month period to evaluate malaria prevention knowledge, and net use and maintenance.
   Results: Only 4.7% of recipients could not recall any malaria prevention methods. Seventy percent of pregnant women and 86.5% of children under five slept under a net the previous night. Only two households (0.9%) no longer possessed a net, and nets were not used in 2.3% of houses. Household observation revealed 17.4% of nets had at least one problem that would compromise effectiveness.
   Conclusions: Student-led projects can play an important role in effectively preventing malaria. However coordination with existing programs, targeting hard-to-access groups, and training of students overcomes some common limitations of such student-led initiatives.

AB BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD.
   METHODS: Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12: 12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months.
   RESULTS: We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.

AB Physiologic changes in the cardiac, respiratory, and renal systems in pregnancy likely impact ventilatory control. Though obstructive sleep apnea and snoring are common in the pregnant population, the predisposition to central respiratory events during sleep and the prevalence of such events is less well studied. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of central apneas during sleep in pregnant women and non-pregnant controls suspected of sleep disordered breathing.
   Twenty-five pregnant women referred for polysomnography for sleep disordered breathing were compared with non-pregnant controls matched for age, body mass index, gender, and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Central apnea index was defined as the number of central apneas per hour of sleep, and mixed apnea index was defined as the number of mixed apneas per hour of sleep.
   Sixty-four percent of pregnant women had a respiratory disturbance index > 5 events per hour of sleep. Mean body mass index was 44.1 +/- 6.9 kg/m(2) pregnant compared to 44.0 +/- 7.3 kg/m(2) in controls. The total number of central apneas observed during sleep in the pregnant group consisted of two central apneas in one patient, and of 98 central apneas in 11 patients in the control group (p = 0.05). Median central apnea index was low in both groups (pregnant 0, interquartile range (IQR) 0, 0 vs. non-pregnant 0, IQR 0, 0.2, p = 0.04). Mixed apnea index was similarly low in both groups.
   Despite some physiologic changes of pregnancy that impact ventilatory control, the prevalence of central sleep apnea was low in our sample of overweight pregnant women with sleep-disordered breathing.

AB The goal of this study was to identify the prevalence and clinical correlates and severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in mainland China.
   This cross-sectional study enrolled 1584 women (18-40 years old) who came to a prenatal outpatient clinic to consult an obstetrician. Pregnant women were studied in each trimester, and assessments included interviews about RLS symptoms and related questions. Standardized questionnaires include the International Restless Syndrome Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire. Blood tests included levels of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume.
   RLS was diagnosed in 177 of 1584 women (11.2 %); 4.2 % were categorized as having pre-existing RLS and 54.8 % reported onset of RLS symptoms after the 24th week. Multivariate analysis revealed that anemia was positively correlated with RLS. For the participants who first experienced RLS in pregnancy, RLS severity in the third trimester was more severe when compared with the first and second trimesters. Sleep disorders occurred more frequently in the third trimester.
   In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant Chinese women, and anemia was identified as an independent predictor of the disease. Further, most participants reported their symptoms during the third trimester, and the severity of RLS and sleep disorders of participants was more prominent in the third trimester.

AB Objective: To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders.
   Results: Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P<.001). After adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs. <= 5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.02-2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR=1.18; 95% CI 1.08-1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=3.48; 95% CI 1.96-6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor.
   Conclusion: Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

AB Hypothesis. Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was investigated. Study Design. In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland], dosage at physician's consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). Methods. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. Results. Patients were 61 +/- 10.4 years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 +/- 3.62 to 9.1 +/- 3.61 (P < .01), and ESS changed from 8.4 +/- 3.18 to 7.1 +/- 3.98 (P < .05). There was no change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6 patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion. B pinnatum may be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.

AB Objectives: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) is the most common sleep-related movement disorder in pregnancy. We designed a prospective longitudinal study to investigate the correlates of WED/RLS during and after pregnancy.
   Design: A total of 138 pregnant women with WED/RLS and a control group of 251 age-matched pregnant women were enrolled prospectively. A questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview at first evaluation during pregnancy and three months after delivery.
   Results: Among all women in the first trimester, 15.6% were diagnosed with WED/RLS, whereas 32.8% of those in the second trimester and 38.8% of those in the third trimester were diagnosed with WED/RLS (p = 0.032). In regression analysis, later gestational age [p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.054] and previous history of WED/RLS (p = 0.001; OR 2.795) were positively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS, while ferritin levels (p = 0.001; OR 0.956) were negatively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS. Ferritin levels were also negatively correlated with the International RLS Study Group severity index (p = 0.041). Forty-eight patients (34.8%) experienced WED/RLS symptomatology after delivery. The ferritin levels were lower, and the mean number of pregnancies was higher, in women with residual WED/RLS (p = 0.008).
   Conclusion: Our survey showed that WED/RLS was more common in the second and third trimesters. Emergence of WED/RLS during the second trimester was strongly associated with residual WED/RLS. Lower ferritin levels were associated with both WED/RLS in pregnancy and residual WED/RLS after delivery. A higher number of pregnancies were also associated with a greater likelihood of having residual WED/RLS after delivery. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB AimTo identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs during pregnancy.
   MethodsRetrospective review of neonatal postmortem examinations between 2004 and 2011.
   ResultsA total of 138 autopsies were performed in infants up to 28days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause ofdeath remained unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11days (range 1-28days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was inconsistent with the findings in only one case.
   ConclusionAn unexpectedly high proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the Safe Sleep' message with these families at every contact with health professionals.

TI A Review of the Relationship Between Socioeconomic Position and the
   Early-Life Predictors of Obesity
SO CURRENT OBESITY REPORTS
LA English
DT Review
DE Infant; Socioeconomic position; Physical activity; Nutrition
AB A range of important early-life predictors of later obesity have been identified. Children of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) have a steeper weight gain trajectory from birth with a strong socioeconomic gradient in child and adult obesity prevalence. An assessment of the association between SEP and the early-life predictors of obesity has been lacking. The review involved a two-stage process: Part 1, using previously published systematic reviews, we developed a list of the potentially modifiable determinants of obesity observable in the pre-natal, peri-natal or post-natal (pre-school) periods; and part 2, conducting a literature review of evidence for socioeconomic patterning in the determinants identified in part 1. Strong evidence was found for an inverse relationship between SEP and (1) pre-natal risk factors (pre-pregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI), diabetes and pre-pregnancy diet), (2) antenatal/ peri natal risk factors (smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight) and (3) early-life nutrition (including breastfeeding initiation and duration, early introduction of solids, maternal and infant diet quality, and some aspects of the home food environment), and television viewing in young children. Less strong evidence (because of a lack of studies for some factors) was found for paternal BMI, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, child sleep duration, high birth weight and lack of physical activity in young children. A strong socioeconomic gradient exists for the majority of the early-life predictors of obesity suggesting that the die is cast very early in life (even pre-conception). Lifestyle interventions targeting disadvantaged women at or before childbearing age may therefore be particularly important in reducing inequality. Given the likely challenges of reaching this target population, it may be that during pregnancy and their child's early years are more feasible windows for engagement.

DE betamethasone; Cardiotocography; Fetal heart rate; Variability
AB Objective. To evaluate the modifications provoked by betamethasone, used in prophylaxis for RDS, on fetal heart rate and variability.
   Materials and methods. Retrospective study including 58 pregnant women treated with corticosteroids for risk of preterm birth. Fetal heart rate and long term variability have been reviewed and evaluated with cardiotocographic examinations performed for each patient at time 0 (before betamethasone administration), within the first 12 hours after administration, between 12 and 24 hours, between 24 and 36 hours and after 36 hours.
   Results. Long term variability of fetal heart rate is altered above all in the period between 24 and 36 hours after the first administration of betamethasone (in the 48% of cases). This modification consists in the increase of variability in the 68% of cases. The baseline of heart rate shows a modification inversely proportional to the variability's one.
   Conclusion. The influence of corticosteroids on the fetal nervous centers involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake rhythm and in the sympathetic-vagal balance implies the possible transitory alteration of the fetal heart rate baseline and variability.

DE idiopathic generalized epilepsy; juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; juvenile
   absence epilepsy; generalized tonicclonic seizures
AB "Idiopathic" generalized epilepsies (juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone) are the most frequent group of epilepsies with onset during adolescence and constitute 15 to 20% of all epilepsies. These syndromes have overlapping clinical features and genetic origins as well as similar electroencephalographic findings. There are primarily three seizure types that occur with these epilepsy syndromes: generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and myoclonic seizures. Standard neurologic examination and neuroimaging studies do not generally reveal any abnormality. Potential precipitating factors are many, including sleep deprivation, fatigue, alcohol use, photic stimulation, and menstruation. The characteristic electroencephalographic abnormality consists of diffuse, bilateral, symmetric, and synchronous 4 to 6 Hz polyspike and wave complexes. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies are generally associated with low mortality and typically respond well to treatment. The most effective antiepileptic drug for these disorders is sodium valproate, but it should be used with caution in adolescent females who are of childbearing age. Levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, and zonisamide can also be used as effective monotherapy. Carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, and vigabatrin may exacerbate myoclonic and absence seizures in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease is 3-fold more prevalent in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Symptoms are particularly strong and frequent during the third trimester of pregnancy and disappear around delivery. A preexisting form of RLS tends to worsen during pregnancy. Women who experience RLS during pregnancy have a higher risk of symptoms in further pregnancies and of developing a primary form of RLS later in life, than women free of symptoms during pregnancy. This article reviews the literature for pregnancy-related RLS, with particular attention to its epidemiology, course, possible mechanisms, management, and the impact of symptoms.

AB Various medications and behavioral treatments for sleep-related leg cramps have been tried, but the quality of the evidence is low. Quinine seems to be effective, but dangerous. beta-Agonists may be one of the more common causes of secondary leg cramps. Statins may not be implicated in leg cramps as much as has been believed. Potassium-sparing diuretics may have a higher incidence of sleeprelated leg cramps than potassium-depleting diuretics. Plantar flexion of the feet may elicit most sleep-related leg cramps. More research into behavioral treatments is needed. A standardized sleep-related leg cramp questionnaire would be useful to expand research.

AB Background
   The biology of peripartum depression remains unclear, with altered stress and the Hypothalamus- Pituitary-Adrenal axis response having been implicated in its pathophysiology.
   Methods
   The current study was undertaken as a part of the BASIC project (Biology, Affect, Stress, Imaging, Cognition), a population-based longitudinal study of psychological wellbeing during pregnancy and the postpartum period in Uppsala County, Sweden, in order to assess the association between evening salivary cortisol levels and depressive symptoms in the peripartum period. Three hundred and sixty-five pregnant women from the BASIC cohort were recruited at pregnancy week 18 and instructed to complete a Swedish validated version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at the 36th week of pregnancy as well as the sixth week after delivery. At both times, they were also asked to provide evening salivary samples for cortisol analysis. A comprehensive review of the relevant literature is also provided.
   Results
   Women with postpartum EPDS score >= 10 had higher salivary evening cortisol at six weeks postpartum compared to healthy controls (median cortisol 1.19 vs 0.89 nmol/L). A logistic regression model showed a positive association between cortisol levels and depressive symptoms postpartum (OR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.7-9.7). This association remained significant even after controlling for history of depression, use of tobacco, partner support, breastfeeding, stressful life events, and sleep problems, as possible confounders (aOR = 4.5; 95% CI 1.5-14.1). Additionally, women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher postpartum cortisol levels compared to both women with depressive symptoms antenatally and controls (p = 0.019 and p = 0.004, respectively).
   Conclusions
   Women with depressive symptoms postpartum had higher postpartum cortisol levels, indicating an altered response of the HPA-axis in postpartum depression.

AB Internal working models (IWMs) of attachment can moderate the effect of maternal depression on mother child interactions and child development. Clinical depression predating birthgiving has been found to predict incoherent and less sensitive caregiving. Dysfunctional patterns observed, included interactive modes linked to feeding behaviors which may interfere with hunger satiation, biological rhythms, and the establishment of children's autonomy and individuation. Feeding interactions between depressed mothers and their children seem to be characterized by repetitive interactive failures: children refuse food through oppositional behavior or negativity. The aim of this study was to investigate parenting skills in the context of feeding in mothers with major depression from the point of view of attachment theory. This perspective emphasizes parents' emotion, relational and affective history and personal resources. The sample consisted of 60 mother child dyads. Mothers were divided into two groups: 30 with Major Depression and 30 without disorders. Children's age ranged between 12 and 36 months The measures employed were the Adult Attachment Interview and the Scale for the Evaluation of Alimentary Interactions between Mothers and Children. Insecure attachment prevailed in mothers with major depression, with differences on the Subjective Experience and State of Mind Scales. Groups also differed in maternal sensitivity, degrees of interactive conflicts and negative affective states, all of which can hinder the development of adequate interactive patterns during feeding. The results suggest that IWMs can constitute an indicator for the evaluation of the relational quality of the dyad and that evaluations of dyadic interactions should be considered when programming interventions.

AB Background: Stillbirth occurring after 28 weeks gestation affects between 1.5-4.5 per 1,000 births in high-income countries. The majority of stillbirths in this setting occur in women without risk factors. In addition, many established risk factors such as nulliparity and maternal age are not amenable to modification during pregnancy. Identification of other risk factors which could be amenable to change in pregnancy should be a priority in stillbirth prevention research. Therefore, this study aimed to utilise an online survey asking women who had a stillbirth about their pregnancy in order to identify any common symptoms and experiences.
   Methods: A web-based survey.
   Results: A total of 1,714 women who had experienced a stillbirth >3 weeks prior to enrolment completed the survey. Common experiences identified were: perception of changes in fetal movement (63 % of respondents), reports of a "gut instinct" that something was wrong (68 %), and perceived time of death occurring overnight (56 %). A quarter of participants believed that their baby's death was due to a cord issue and another 18 % indicated that they did not know the reason why their baby died. In many cases (55 %) the mother believed the cause of death was different to that told by clinicians.
   Conclusions: This study confirms the association between altered fetal movements and stillbirth and highlights novel associations that merit closer scrutiny including a maternal gut instinct that something was wrong. The potential importance of maternal sleep is highlighted by the finding of more than half the mothers believing their baby died during the night. This study supports the importance of listening to mothers' concerns and symptoms during pregnancy and highlights the need for thorough investigation of stillbirth and appropriate explanation being given to parents.

TI The use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy and

ID LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; METAANALYSIS; MORTALITY; BEDNETS; AFRICA; ANEMIA
AB Background: Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with malaria in pregnancy. Although the coverage for both IPTp and ITN use have been described in Malawi, the analysis of factors associated with IPTp receipt and ITN use is lacking. This analysis was conducted to assess IPTp and ITN use and predictors of use by women of child-bearing age (WOCBA).
   Methods: A two-stage cluster-sample cross-sectional survey was conducted April 16-30, 2009 in eight districts across Malawi. Information on receipt of two or more doses of IPTp, ITN ownership, and ITN use the night before the survey was collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of IPTp and ITN use.
   Results: Data were collected from 7407 households containing 6985 WOCBA and 3213 recently pregnant women (women who reported a completed pregnancy in the 2 years before the survey). Most recently pregnant women (96 %) had at least one antenatal care (ANC) clinic visit; 91 % reported receiving at least one dose of IPTp, and 72 % reported receiving two or more doses of IPTp. Women in Phalombe, Rumphi, and Lilongwe were more likely to receive two doses of IPTp than those in Blantyre [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.5 (95 % CI 1.5-4.5), 2.5 (95 % CI 1.5-4.3), and 2.0 (95 % CI 1.2-3.1), respectively]. Educated women were more likely to have received IPTp compared to women with no education [aOR 1.6 (95 % CI 1.0-2.6) for those who completed primary school, aOR1.9 (95 % CI 1.1-3.3) for some secondary school, and aOR 4.1 (95 % CI 1.9-8.7) for completed secondary school or above], and women in the poorest socioeconomic status quintile were less likely to receive IPTp than those in the least poor quintile [aOR 0.68 (95 % CI 0.48-0.97)]. In all, 53 % of WOCBA used an ITN the previous night. Women in Nkhotkhota and Phalombe were less likely to have slept under an ITN the previous night compared to those in Blantyre [aOR 0.52 (95 % CI 0.39-0.69) and aOR 0.67 (95 % CI 0.47-0.95), respectively]. In addition, age [aOR 0.61 (95 % CI 0.45-0.83) for women 15-19 years old], and either being currently pregnant [aOR 1.5 (95 % CI 1.2-2.0)] or having been pregnant in the previous 2 years [aOR 2.4, (95 % CI 2.1-2.8)] were associated with ITN use.
   Conclusion: In Malawi in 2009, IPTp and ITN use in WOCBA fell short of national and international goals. Adoption of new guidelines encouraging administration of IPTp at every scheduled ANC visit might increase IPTp use. Increasing health promotion activities to encourage earlier attendance at ANC clinics and create demand for IPTp and ITNs might improve overall IPTp and ITN use.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether depressive symptoms predict anxiety and stress or whether anxiety and stress precede depressive symptoms in fathers during the antenatal period. Background: The findings of previous studies suggest that there is an association between paternal depression, anxiety and stress during the antenatal period. However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated. Method: Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks' gestation. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner's depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers. Conclusion: Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety.

DT Article
DE ITN usage; Under five mortality; Health facility delivery; Northern
   Ghana
AB Background: Although under-five mortality rate seems to be declining in Ghana, the northern part of the country has higher levels of under-five mortality vis-a-vis the national rates. This research examines the correlates of the high under-five mortality among children in the northern part of Ghana, with emphasis on the usage of insecticide-treated bed net (ITN), as recommended by the World Health Organization.
   Methods: A total of 3,839 under-five children sourced from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey-was used for this study. Univariate descriptive statistics was employed to describe the variables used for the empirical estimation. The maximum likelihood estimation technique was used to estimate a logit model in other to determine the effect of insecticide treated bed net usage on under-five mortality.
   Results: Insecticide-treated bed net usage among children enhances their survival rates. Thus, under-five mortality among children who sleep under treated bed nets is about 18.8% lower than among children who do not sleep under treated bed nets. While health facility delivery was found to reduce to reduce under-five mortality, child bearing among older women is detrimental to the survival of the child.
   Conclusions: The study, therefore, recommends that policies targeting reduction in under-five mortality in northern Ghana should consider not mere availability of ITNs in the household, but advocate the usage of these treated nets. The study recommends to the Ministry of Health to extend their services to unreached rural communities to encourage health facility delivery to reduce under-five mortality.

AB Objective: Potential adverse effects of prenatal antidepressant exposure on child development are still debated. The possibility that associations are due to genetic or familial environmental risk factors rather than antidepressant use per se cannot easily be ruled out in conventional studies. Our objective was therefore to evaluate the association between prenatal antidepressant exposure and behavioural problems in a sibling controlled study.
   Method: This study used data on 20 180 siblings identified from the population-based Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study recruited between 1999 and 2008. The mothers were asked to report antidepressant use at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and 6 months post-partum. Child Behavioral Checklist syndrome scales were used to assess externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems by questionnaires sent to mothers at 18 and 36 months postpartum. We performed unmatched and matched sibling analyses using both random-and fixed-effects linear models, respectively, to determine potential behavioural effects of antidepressant exposure.
   Results: Prenatal exposure to antidepressants was associated with increased levels of anxiety symptoms in 3 year old children after adjusting for maternal familial effects and confounding by indication (i.e. maternal depression). Effect of prenatal exposure to antidepressants was specific to anxiety, and not associated with emotional reactivity, somatic complaints, sleep problems, attention problems or aggression.
   Conclusion: Using a sibling design, we showed that prenatal antidepressant use was specifically associated with increased anxiety symptoms after adjusting for maternal familial factors and confounding by indication.

AB Objective: This study was aimed to identify the physical and mental state of women after delivery, to investigate the factors that influence those, and to examine the effects of postpartum care performance, which is traditionally believed to be appropriate care in Korea, on women's physical and mental status.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 148 women who visited our hospital for postpartum check-up on the 2" week or 6th week after delivery were selected. We researched postpartum care methods using a questionnaire and had the women self-evaluate their postpartum symptoms. Depression was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory.
   Results: The average points of the 27 postpartum symptoms was 2.70 points (from I = very good to 5 = very bad). Seventy-two women had depression. Factors related to postpartum symptoms and depression were smoking before pregnancy, low marital satisfaction, bad mood during and after pregnancy, lack of support from husbands, and bad quality of sleep during puerperium. Treating the joints of hands carefully when milking breasts, and avoiding squatting down, demonstrated a negative correlation with the average points of postpartum symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that mood during puerperium and Beck Depression Inventory points were significant factors related to the average points of postpartum symptoms and that the degree of support from husbands and mood during pregnancy were statistically related with depression.
   Conclusion: Many women complained of postpartum discomfort. Although, while some postpartum care methods which are traditionally believed to be appropriate care in Korea can be helpful to women's recovery, most of them are not. We confirmed that physical symptoms and depression are closely related to each other. Copyright (C) 2015, Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

AB This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". Subjective changes in concentration and memory are commonly reported by women during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34-36 weeks of gestation (n = 28) with age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n = 26). All pregnant women were screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was evident only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast, pregnant women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or even significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences were observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist perspective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Adverse pregnancy conditions in women are common and have been associated with adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke. As risk stratification in women is often suboptimal, recognition of non-traditional risk factors such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and premature delivery has become increasingly important. Additionally, such conditions may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in the children of afflicted women. In this review, we aim to highlight these conditions, along with infertility, and the association between such conditions and various cardiovascular outcomes and related maternal risk along with potential translation of risk to offspring. We will also discuss proposed mechanisms driving these associations as well as potential opportunities for screening and risk modification.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between young children's sleep and maternal sleep from both a developmental and a cross-cultural perspective. Mothers of 10,085 young children completed the Brief Infant/Child Sleep Questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Overall, there were significant relationships between maternal and child sleep for bedtime, waketime, number of night wakings, and total nighttime sleep time across ages and cultures, although these relationships were stronger with younger children than preschool-aged children. Mothers report that their child's sleep pattern significantly impacts their sleep and daytime function, and they do not feel confident in managing their child's sleep pattern. Thus, interventions to improve children's sleep and develop good sleep habits, especially in early childhood, are likely to improve the quality of life of the whole family.

AB Circadian genes are expressed in virtually all cells and tissues, and circadian rhythms influence many bodily processes, including reproductive physiology. The expression of hMTNR1B is suppressed during pregnancy until late in term (much like the oxytocin receptor), at which time it is up-regulated to allow for the nocturnal melatonin/oxytocin synergy, which promotes strong nocturnal contractions. Little is currently known about the regulation of hMNTR1b, nor about its functional significance in the myometrium. We, therefore, aimed to elucidate some of the transcription factors that regulate hMNTR1b gene expression in the human myometrium and to determine if hMNTR1b is under circadian control. In this study, we used immortalized and primary myometrial cells that were assessed for circadian gene expression rhythms using real-time bioluminometry and quantitative PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation examined the binding of the clock gene product brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like protein 1 (BMAL1) to the promoter of the hMTNR1B gene. Overexpression studies tested the role of circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and its partner BMAL1 in regulating hMTNR1B expression. We confirmed circadian clock gene expression in both immortalized human myometrial cells and primary myometrial cell cultures. We further showed that the hBMAL1 protein binds to an E-box motif in the proximal promoter of the hMTNR1B gene. Overexpression studies demonstrated that the BMAL1/CLOCK complex activates expression of hMTNR1B leading to a circadian rhythm in phase with the E-box driven clock gene hPER2 (Period 2). These results indicate, for the first time, the presence of a functional circadian clock in the human myometrium with the hMTNR1B gene as a clock controlled target. Further investigations could open new vistas for understanding the regulation of uterine contractions and the timing of human labor.

AB Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) can severely affect quality of life and disturb sleep, so that pharmacological treatment is necessary, especially for elderly patients. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole or the rotigotine transdermal patch, all approved in most countries) or alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, approved in the USA and Japan), depending on the country and availability. Where approved, opioids (prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone, approved in Europe) are also recommended as a second-line therapy for severe RLS. Several iron formulations can be effective but are not yet approved for RLS therapy, whereas benzodiazepines and other anticonvulsants are not recommended or approved. Less is known about effective management of RLS that is associated with other conditions, such as uraemia or pregnancy. Furthermore, very little data are available on the management of RLS when first-line treatment fails or patients experience augmentation. In this Review, we summarize state-of-the-art therapies for RLS in the context of the diagnostic criteria and available guidelines, based on knowledge ranging from Class I evidence for the treatment of idiopathic RLS to Class IV evidence for the treatment of complications such as augmentation. We consider therapies, including combination therapies, that are used in clinical practice for long-term management of RLS, despite a lack of trials and approval, and highlight the need for practical long-term evaluation of current trials.

AB Systemic maternal inflammation is implicated in preterm birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and may induce morbidities including reduced pulmonary function, sleep-disordered breathing, and cardiovascular disorders. Here we test the hypothesis that antenatal maternal inflammation per se causes altered alveolar development and increased chemoreflex sensitivity that persists beyond infancy. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (150 mu g/kg ip) to induce maternal inflammation or saline (SHAM) at embryonic day 16 (randomized). Pups were weighed daily. On days 7, 28, and 60 (D07, D28, and D60), unrestrained wholebody plethysmography quantified ventilation and chemoreflex responses to hypoxia (10%), hypercapnia (7%), and asphyxia (hypoxic hypercapnia). Lungs were harvested to quantify alveolar number, size, and septal thickness. LPS pups had reduced baseline ventilation per unit body-weight (similar to 40%, P < 0.001) vs. SHAM. LPS increased ventilatory responses to hypoxia (D07: 66% vs. 28% increase in ventilation; P < 0.001) hypercapnia (170% vs. 88%; P < 0.001), and asphyxia (249% vs. 154%; P < 0.001); hypersensitive hypoxic responsiveness persisted until D60 (P < 0.001). LPS also increased apnea frequency (P < 0.01). LPS caused thicker alveolar septae (D07, P < 0.001), diminished alveolar number (D28, P < 0.001) vs. SHAM, but effects were minimal by D60. Pups delivered from mothers exposed to antenatal inflammation exhibit deficits in lung structure and hypersensitive responses to respiratory stimuli that persist beyond the newborn period. Antenatal inflammation may contribute to impaired gas exchange and unstable breathing in newborn infants and adversely affect long-term health.

AB Thrombosis can affect any venous circulation. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep-vein thrombosis of the leg or pelvis, and its complication, pulmonary embolism. VTE is a fairly common disease, particularly in older age, and is associated with reduced survival, substantial health-care costs, and a high rate of recurrence. VTE is a complex (multifactorial) disease, involving interactions between acquired or inherited predispositions to thrombosis and various risk factors. Major risk factors for incident VTE include hospitalization for surgery or acute illness, active cancer, neurological disease with leg paresis, nursing-home confinement, trauma or fracture, superficial vein thrombosis, and-in women-pregnancy and puerperium, oral contraception, and hormone therapy. Although independent risk factors for incident VTE and predictors of VTE recurrence have been identified, and effective primary and secondary prophylaxis is available, the occurrence of VTE seems to be fairly constant, or even increasing.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period.
   Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.
   Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

AB Study Objectives: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing similar to 1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women.
   Design: Observational.
   Measurements: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review.
   Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (r(s) = -0.35, P = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (r(s) = -0.34, P = 0.002), sleep latency (r(s) = -0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (r(s) = -0.27, P = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate -0.029; 95% confidence interval -0.06, -0.002).
   Conclusions: The data provide novel evidence that African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep and blood glucose in a prospective cohort of women recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   METHODS: Women with GDM were enrolled immediately after attending a GDM education class. All patients were recruited during their first week of attempted dietary management of GDM. They were instructed on the use of a glucometer and on the principles of a GDM diet. Women wore an actigraph and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data. Linear mixed model analysis was used to estimate the association of sleep duration on morning fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations.
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants provided data for 213 sleep intervals that corresponded to at least one glucose reading. Sleep duration was negatively associated with fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations In analyses adjusted for age, gestational age, and body mass index, a 1-hour increase in sleep time was associated with statistically significant reductions in fasting glucose (-2.09 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.98 to -0.20) as well as postprandial glucose concentrations (lunch -4.62 mg/dL, 95% CI -8.75 to -0.50; dinner -6.07 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.40 to -2.73).
   CONCLUSION: Short sleep durations are associated with worsened glucose control in women with gestational diabetes. Educating women on healthy sleep and screening for and treating sleep disorders during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in gestational diabetes.

AB The objective of the study was to characterize the phenotype of males and females with autism spectrum disorder born preterm versus those born at term. Descriptive statistical analyses identified differences between male and female autism spectrum disorder subjects born preterm compared to term for several phenotypic characteristics and comorbidities. Of the 115 (13.0% of 883) born preterm, a greater percentage of males had sleep apnea (13.8% vs 2.5%, p<0.0001), seizure disorders (17.0% vs 8.5%, p=0.01), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (14.9% vs 6.6%, p=0.005). Females born preterm were more likely to be nonverbal (22.2% vs 4.6%, p=0.001). In summary, phenotypic differences were observed, especially among males. The results may have implications for understanding the underpinnings of a subset of individuals with autism spectrum disorder and contribute to the development of focused treatments for autism spectrum disorder among children born preterm.

AB Objective: This study examined the prevalence and correlates of Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder (ASAD) and Adult Separation Anxiety (ASA) symptoms in a sample of first-time mothers with an unsettled infant during the first postpartum year.
   Methods: Eighty-three primiparous women admitted to a residential parent infant program participated in a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis and questionnaires assessing ASA symptoms, adult attachment and childhood parenting experiences. Nurses recorded infant behavior using 24-hour charts.
   Results: The prevalence of ASAD in this sample was 19.3% and women with ASAD were, on average, more likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, report aversive parenting experiences during childhood and show adult attachment style insecurity. Both ASAD and ASA symptoms were predicted by adult attachment anxiety, and ASAD was associated with unsettled infant behavior. Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance mediated relations between parental over-control and ASAD diagnosis, and between parental abuse and ASAD diagnosis. Attachment anxiety mediated the relation between parental over-control and ASA symptoms, and attachment avoidance mediated the relations of parental over-control and parental abuse with ASA symptoms.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the prevalence of ASAD among first time mothers experiencing early parenting difficulties and the roles of childhood parenting experiences and adult attachment style in the development of the disorder. This points to the importance of introducing universal screening for ASAD in postnatal settings, and for the development of targeted interventions. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Maternal alcohol exposure and adult alcohol intake have been shown to perturb the metabolism of various micro- and macro-nutrients, including vitamin A and its derivatives (retinoids). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the well-known detrimental consequences of alcohol consumption may be due to deregulations of the metabolism of such nutrients rather than to a direct effect of alcohol. Alcohol exposure in utero also has long-term harmful consequences on the health of the offspring with mechanisms that have not been fully clarified. Disruption of tissue retinoid homeostasis has been linked not only to abnormal embryonic development, but also to various adult pathological conditions, including cancer, metabolic disorders and abnormal lung function. We hypothesized that prenatal alcohol exposure may permanently perturb tissue retinoid metabolism, predisposing the offspring to adult chronic diseases.
   Methods: Serum and tissues (liver, lung and prostate from males; liver and lung from females) were collected from 60-75 day-old sprague dawley rats born from dams that were: (I) fed a liquid diet containing 6.7% alcohol between gestational day 7 and 21; or (II) pair-fed with isocaloric liquid diet during the same gestational window; or (III) fed ad libitum with regular rat chow diet throughout pregnancy. Serum and tissue retinoid levels were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) levels were measured by western blot analysis, and liver, lung and prostate mRNA levels of lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) were measured by qPCR.
   Results: Retinyl ester levels were significantly reduced in the lung of both males and females, as well as in the liver and ventral prostate of males born from alcohol-fed dams. Tissue LRAT mRNA levels remained unchanged upon maternal alcohol treatment.
   Conclusions: Prenatal alcohol exposure in rats affects retinoid metabolism in adult life, in a tissue- and sex-dependent manner. We propose that the alcohol-induced perturbations of vitamin A metabolism may predispose to detrimental consequnces on adult health.

AB PURPOSE: To compare sleep quality of overweight versus normal weight women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 223 women with 14 or more weeks of pregnancy, 105 of them overweight (pre-pregnancy body mass index - BMI - >= 25.0 kg/m(2)) and 118 of normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), attending the prenatal care clinic. The Brazilian version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep quality. The Student t-test and the chi-square test were used to compare differences between groups and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Most of the participants (67.7%) were poor sleepers (total score > 5); this proportion was significantly higher among overweight (80/105) versus normal weight (67/118) women (76.2 versus 56.8%, p= 0,004). During the second trimester, this difference did not reach statistical significance (72.5 versus 53.7%, respectively, p= 0.06) but mean total PSQI-BR scores were significantly higher among overweight participants (7.0 +/- 3.8 versus 5.5 +/- 3.2, p= 0.02). In the 2nd trimester, overweight women also had higher scores for sleep latency (1.4 +/- 1.0 versus 1.0 +/- 0.9, p= 0.02) and subjective sleep quality (1.3 +/- 0.8 versus 0.8 +/- 0.8, p= 0.02). In the third trimester, the proportion of women with poor sleep quality was significantly higher in the overweight group, but did not reach statistical significance (79.6 versus 60.8%, p= 0.06). During this period, total mean scores were similar for women with and without excess weight (9.4 +/- 4.2 versus 8.3 +/- 4.6, p= 0.2). However, overweight women had higher mean scores for sleep disturbance (2.3 +/- 0.7 versus 2.0 +/- 0.8, p= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Overweight women had a poorer sleep quality than normal weight women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

DT Review
DE Willis-Ekbom disease; movement disorder; diagnostic criteria
AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a chronic movement disorder, characterized by an urge to move legs usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations and sleep disorders. The prevalence of the syndrome ranges from 1% to 15% in the general population, and about 2% during childhood. RLS is the most common movement disorder in pregnancy. However RLS still remains under-diagnosed probably due to lack of accurate information about the disease. Family history is positive in 50-70% of the primary RLS patients. The secondary form of the syndrome is associated with iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus and many rheumatologic disorders. Secondary forms generally manifest at older ages and have a rapid progression with a poorer prognosis. The pathophysiology of RLS is focused on the dopaminergic system, reduced central nervous system iron levels and genetic linkages. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and the diagnostic criteria suggested by International RLS Study Group. Secondary causes must be carefully investigated before the treatment. In mild forms of the disease non-pharmacologic therapies might be useful, while in moderate or severe forms of the disease generally pharmacologic therapies such as dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opioids and benzodiazepines are required.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated "may be considered" when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and wellbeing, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs.
   Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies.
   Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life.

AB Background: Young adulthood is a critical life period for health and health behaviours. Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the Raine Study cohort.
   Methods/Design: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics, medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors, spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography.
   Discussion: Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health across adulthood.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the predictive ability of current obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening tools and the individual questions in these tools at identifying pregnant women who have OSA.
   METHODS: A total of 293 third-trimester patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2012, and 248 patients had sleep monitor results. Recruited participants completed a questionnaire consisting of six OSA screening tools and overnight portable sleep monitoring. Predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA compared with results of the diagnosis from overnight sleep monitoring was estimated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves.
   RESULTS: Two hundred eighteen (88%) of the patients were OSA-negative, and 30 patients (12%) were OSA-positive based on sleep monitoring results. Compared with OSA-negative patients, OSA-positive patients had greater body mass indices and neck circumferences as well as significantly higher rates of hypertension (chronic and gestational), pregestational diabetes mellitus, asthma, and preeclampsia. The overall predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA was modest (area under receiver operating characteristic curves 0.62-0.695). However, individual components of the questionnaire were strongly associated with OSA.
   CONCLUSION: We found that none of the studied OSA screening tools accurately detected OSA in pregnant women in the third trimester. We have identified proposed elements of a new screening tool based on promising components from several tools that may more accurately detect patients with OSA.

AB Night work has been associated with adverse effects in terms of reproductive health. Specifically, menstruation has been suggested to be negatively impacted by night work, which again may influence fertility. This study investigated whether working nights is related to menstrual characteristics and if there is a relationship between shift work disorder (SWD) and menstruation. The study was cross-sectional, response rate 38%. The sample comprised female nurses who were members of the Norwegian Nurses Association; below 50 yr of age, who were not pregnant, did not use hormonal pills or intrauterine devices and who had not reached menopause (n=766). The nurses answered a postal survey including questions about night work and menstrual characteristics. Fifteen per cent reported to have irregular menstruations. Thirty-nine per cent of the nurses were classified as having SWD. Logistic regression analyses concerning the relationship between irregular menstruations and night work did not show any associations. Furthermore, no associations were found between cycle length or bleeding period and night work parameters. No associations were found between menstrual characteristics and SWD.

AB Background: Recent research points to high levels of herbal medicine use during pregnancy. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the prevalence and understand the determinants of both the use and self-prescription of herbal medicine during pregnancy.
   Methods: The study sample was obtained via the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Women who were pregnant or who had recently given were invited to complete a subsurvey in 2010 about pregnancy, and complementary and alternative medicine use.
   Findings: A response rate of 79.2% (n = 1,835) was attained and 34.4% (n = 588 of 1,835) of the sample were utilizing herbal medicine during pregnancy, of which 77.9% (n = 458 of 588) were self-prescribing these products. The women in our study (aged 33-38) were more likely to use herbal medicine if they had anxiety (odds ratio [ OR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02-1.64; p = .031), sleeping problems (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.15-2.11; p = .005), or fatigue (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-1.68; p = .025), but less likely to use herbal medicine if they had nausea (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91; p = .007). Women were more likely to self-prescribe herbal medicine if they suffered from varicose veins (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.04-5.84; p = .041) and less likely to self-prescribe herbal medicine if they suffered from preeclampsia (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.81-0.63; p = .005). Women who self-prescribed herbal medicine during pregnancy were also more likely to live in a rural environment (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.32-3.73; p = .003).
   Conclusions: Many Australian women are consuming herbal medicine during pregnancy. The self-prescription of herbal medicine by pregnant women is of particular concern owing to potential safety issues, and it is important that maternity health care providers have an open and nonjudgmental conversation with women about herbal medicine use during pregnancy.

   CHILDREN; QUESTIONNAIRE; DIFFICULTIES; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIORS; AGE
AB Objective:
   A number of studies have established an association between antenatal maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts.
   Methods:
   Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age.
   Results:
   Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (beta = .085, p < .001) in the whole sample and when limited to the Dutch/European group (beta = .055, p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (beta = -.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression.
   Conclusion:
   For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.

TI An Overview of Treatments for Endometriosis
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Endometriosis is a chronic disease affecting up to 10% of women in the general population and up to 40% in subfertile women. The most common symptom is pain, which can recur even after treatment. Fertility problems are common among women of reproductive age with this disease. There is no cure. The main goal of treatment is to relieve pain and improve fertility.
   The primary aim of this overview was to summarize data on treatments associated with improved outcomes in women with endometriosis. Data were analyzed in studies published from 1979 to 2012 from 140 randomized clinical trials (included in 18 Cochrane systematic reviews). Primary treatment outcomes evaluated were self-reported pain relief for dysmenorrhea and live birth rate. Secondary outcomes examined included clinical improvement or resolution of endometriosis- related pain, recurrence of pain, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, and adverse events. The patient population comprised 13,599 women of reproductive age seen at gynecology and fertility clinics worldwide.
   Pain relief, improved fertility, and adverse reactions were compared for treatment versus placebo or no treatment and one treatment versus another treatment. The quality of evidence for treatment outcomes in all studies ranged from very low to moderate.
   Pain Relief
   The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) system reduced the number of painful symptoms compared with usual care. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) relieved pelvic tenderness compared with placebo and relieved dysmenorrhea compared with no treatment. Laparoscopic surgery (ablation and excision) reduced pain at 6 months compared with diagnostic laparoscopy. Laparoscopic excision of the endometrioma cyst wall decreased recurrence of dysmenorrhea after 2 years more than did ablation. Evidence was very low quality for studies comparing excisional versus ablative surgery, danazol versus placebo, and acupuncture versus Chinese herbal medicine.
   Fertility Outcomes
   Prior to in vitro fertilization, clinical pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis were increased by GnRHa compared with no GnRHa. Compared with diagnostic laparoscopy, laparoscopic surgery (ablation and excision) increased live births and ongoing pregnancies. Laparoscopic excision of the endometrioma cyst wall increased clinical pregnancy rates more than did ablation.
   Adverse Effects
   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy was associated with higher rates of sleep disturbances than placebo. Compared with GnRHa therapy, danazol was associated with higher rates of sleep disturbances, hot flashes, vaginitis, and headaches. Depot progestogens were associated with higher rates of nausea, weight gain, and bleeding compared with other treatments.
   Limited evidence is available to guide clinical decisions for endometriosis therapy, especially for preventing recurrence. There are insufficient data to demonstrate the superiority of any one treatment for endometriosis. Methodological problems that limit the value of the data include high risk of bias, poor reporting of randomization methods, allocation concealment, small sample sizes, and wide confidence intervals.
   Direct comparisons of medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis pain are needed as well as randomized trials exploring the role of surgical interventions in women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques.

AB BACKGROUND: Sleep fragmentation during late gestation (LG-SF) is one of the major perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during pregnancy. We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood.
   OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of late LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring.
   METHODS: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or sleep control during LG (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. At 24 weeks of age, lipid profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed in the offspring. We performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n = 8 mice per group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks.
   RESULTS: We detected significant increases in body weight (31.7 vs 28.8 g; P = 0.001), visceral (642.1 vs 497.0 mg; P = 0.002) and subcutaneous (293.1 vs 250.1 mg; P = 0.001) fat mass, plasma cholesterol (110.6 vs 87.6 mg dl(-1); P = 0.001), triglycerides (87.3 vs 84.1 mg dl(-1); P = 0.003) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values (8.1 vs 6.1; P = 0.007) in the LG-SF group. MeDIP analyses revealed that 2148 DMRs (LG-SF vs LG-SC; P < 0.0001, model-based analysis of tilling-arrays algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome, such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1 and so on. Overrepresented pathways and gene networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated with the metabolic processes and inflammatory responses in VWAT. LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations may underlie increases in the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

AB Background: Although the WHO recommends that complementary feeding in infants should begin at 6 mo of age, it often begins before this in developed countries.
   Objective: Our objective was to determine whether lactation consultant (LC) support, with educational resources given at 4-mo postpartum, can delay the introduction of complementary foods until around 6 mo of age.
   Methods: A total of 802 mother-infant pairs were recruited from the single maternity hospital serving Dunedin, New Zealand (59% response rate) and randomly assigned to the following: 1) usual care (control group); 21 infant sleep education intervention (Sleep); 3) food, activity, and breastfeeding intervention (FAB); or 4) combination (both) intervention (Combo). Certified LCs delivered 3 intervention sessions (late pregnancy and 1-wk and 4-mo postpartum). The 4-mo contact used educational resources focused on developmental readiness for complementary foods. Age when complementary foods were introduced was obtained from repeated interviews (monthly from 3- to 27-wk postpartum).
   Results: A total of 49.5% and 87.2% of infants received complementary foods before 5 and 6 mo of age, respectively. There was evidence of group differences in the number of infants introduced to complementary foods before 5 mo (P = 0.006), with those receiving support and resources (FAB and Combo groups combined; 55.6%) more likely to wait until at least 5 mo compared with controls (control and Sleep groups combined; 43.3%) (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.16). However, there was no evidence they were more likely to wait until 6 mo of age (P = 0.52). Higher maternal age, higher parity, and a less positive attitude toward breastfeeding were positively associated, and drinking alcohol during pregnancy was negatively associated, with later age of introduction of complementary foods.
   Conclusions: Providing an LC and educational resources at 4-mo postpartum to predominantly well-educated, mainly European, women can delay the introduction of complementary foods until 5 mo of age, but not until the WHO recommendation of 6 mo. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of paternal sleep disturbances on the biobehavioral development of offspring in rats. The biobehavioral characterization of adult offspring was detected by Morris water maze test, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming test. We report the presence of a significant decrease in the percentage of time spent in open arms (the time spent in the open arms/the time spent in the open arms + the time spent in the closed arms) and the percentage of entry into open arms (entry into the open arms/entry into the open arms + entry into closed arms) in elevated plus maze, and a significant increase in the immobility time in forced swimming test, following paternal sleep disturbances. Other aspects of neurobehavioral function, including locomotor activity, learning and memory were not affected by paternal sleep disturbances. Paternal sleep disturbances exert a long-term effect on the emotional behavior characterization of adult rat offspring.

AB BackgroundPerimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years.
   MethodsSeventy-four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n=40) or in their childbearing years (n=34) were recruited (M=40.11; SD=11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns.
   ResultsUnivariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger-hostility, depression, tension-anxiety, fatigue-inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tension-anxiety, and increased levels of anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group.
   ConclusionsThis research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options.

AB During fetal development, different control systems mediated by the autonomic nervous system form functional connections over a wide range of time scales. Using multiscale multifractal analysis (MMA) of fetal heart rate variability (HRV), we describe fundamental relationships in the developing scale-wide adjustments within fetal behavior states as well as across state changes.
   MMA yields the local Hurst exponent surface h(q,s,) with q as the multifractal parameter and s as the scale. In 30-minute recordings of healthy fetuses between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation (n = 25 in quiet sleep, n = 29 in active sleep, n = 30 changing sleep state) we investigated the dependency of h(q,s) on gestation age.
   In univariate models, we found a decreasing persistence for short scales and small amplitudes in the quiet (s(1) = 39, q(1) = 0.7, R-2 = 0.52) and in the active (s(1) = 69, q(1) = -1.4, R-2 = 0.23) sleep in contrast to an increasing persistency for long scales and large amplitudes (s(1) = 147, q(1) = 2.4, R-2 = 0.29) in the mixed state. Bivariate models (additional scales considered) presented increased coefficients of determination R-2 = 0.56, 0.4, and 0.43, respectively. Persistency increasing with age in connection with the sleep state changes (independent of the age related short range dependencies within the separate homogeneous sleep states) is reported here for the first time. The MMA indices obtained for the fetal HRV represent characteristics of the maturating scale-wide cardiovascular control in the context of the evolving sleep state dynamics, which have so far not been considered. They should be incorporated in the search for HRV indices for prenatal diagnosis of developmental disorders and risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasingly believed to originate from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current reviews exploring the neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an inadequate proxy.
   Objective We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood.
   Search strategy Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published after 1970.
   Selection criteria The analysis included studies that identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years of age.
   Data collection and analysis Data was extracted for cognitive, behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were summarised separately for children born at < 35 and >= 35 weeks gestation.
   Main results Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR children born >= 35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born < 35 weeks of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone.
   Conclusions IUGR increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected.

AB Objective To investigate the prevalence, severity and relation to fluid retention of self-reported pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms in a large sample of pregnant women.
   Design A prospective longitudinal cohort study.
   Setting Dutch women who became pregnant between January 2013 and January 2014 in the southeast of The Netherlands.
   Population or sample A total of 639 Dutch pregnant women.
   Methods Baseline characteristics were assessed at 12 weeks' gestation. CTS symptoms were assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) at 32 weeks and during the first postpartum week regarding the last weeks of pregnancy. Fluid retention, sleeping problems and depressive symptoms (using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) were assessed at several time points during pregnancy.
   Main outcome measures BCTQ scores, fluid retention and sleeping problems.
   Results Of the 639 women, 219 (34%) reported CTS symptoms during pregnancy. Total mean scores on the BCTQ were significantly higher after 32 weeks' than up to 32 weeks' gestation. Most women experienced mild to moderate symptoms. Pregnant women with CTS symptoms reported significantly higher levels of fluid retention during gestation compared with pregnant women without CTS symptoms [F = 60.6, df (1598), P < 0.001], adjusted for body mass index (BMI), age, parity, and depression scores. Higher scores on fluid retention throughout the pregnancy were significantly related to CTS (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.5, 2.1, P < 0.001). Finally, the occurrence of CTS was independently related to sleeping problems.
   Conclusions Although the severity of symptoms and functional impairment of CTS were relatively mild, health care professionals should be aware of the high prevalence. The occurrence of CTS symptoms is significantly higher in women who report fluid retention during gestation and it can contribute to sleeping problems.

AB Hypertension is a common medical complication of pregnancy. Although 75-80 % of women with preexisting essential hypertension will have uncomplicated pregnancies, the presence of secondary forms of hypertension adds considerably to both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Renovascular hypertension, pheochromocytoma, and Cushing's syndrome in particular are associated with accelerating hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal loss. Primary aldosteronism is a more heterogeneous disorder; there are well-documented cases where blood pressure and hypokalemia are improved during pregnancy due to elevated levels of progesterone. However, superimposed preeclampsia, worsening hypertension, and early delivery are also reported. When possible, secondary forms of hypertension should be diagnosed and treated prior to conception in order to avoid these complications.

AB Objective: to explore gestational weight gain in healthy women in relation to pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet and physical activity.
   Design: a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 455 healthy pregnant women of all gestational ages receiving antenatal care from an independent midwife in the Netherlands. Weight gain was assessed using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and classified as below, within, or above the guidelines. A multinomial regression analysis was performed with weight gain classifications as the dependent variable (within IOM-guidelines as reference). Independent variables were pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet (broken clown into consumption of vegetables, fruit and fish) and physical activity (motivation to engage in physical activity, pre-pregnancy physical activity and decline in physical activity during pregnancy). Covariates were age, gestational age, parity, ethnicity, family income, education, perceived sleep deprivation, satisfaction with pre-pregnancy weight, estimated prepregnancy body mass index, smoking, having a weight gain goal and having received weight gain advice from the midwife.
   Findings: forty-two per cent of the women surveyed gained weight within the guidelines. Fourteen per cent of the women gained weight below the guidelines and 44 per cent gained weight above the guidelines. Weight gain within the guidelines, compared to both above and below the guidelines, was not associated with pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index nor with diet. A decline in physical activity was associated with weight gain above the guidelines (OR 0.54, 95 per cent CI 0.33-0.89). Weight gain below the guidelines was seen more often in women who perceived a greater sleep deprivation (OR 1.20, 95 per cent CI 1.02-1.41). Weight gain above the guidelines was seen less often in Caucasian women in comparison to non Caucasian women (OR 0.22, 95 per cent CI 0.08-0.58) and with women who did not stop smoking during pregnancy (OR 0.49, 95 per cent CI 0.25-0.95).
   Key conclusions awl implications for practice: a decline in physical activity was the only modifiable factor in our population associated with weight gain above the gain recommended by the guidelines. Prevention of reduced physical activity during pregnancy seems a promising approach to promoting healthy weight gain. Interventions to promote healthy weight gain should focus on all women, regardless of pre-pregnancy body mass index. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A REVIEW ON THERAPEUTIC ASPECTS OF HYDROTHERAPY
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
DE Hydrotherapy; water cure therapy; water treatments; Cryotherapy
AB The term Hydrotherapy refers to a process which uses water at any temperature or forms to relieve pain and treat illness. This review describes about various conditions of water treatments. Hydrotherapy may help treat various conditions, including arthritis, stomach issues, sleep disorders, stress and depression. The theory behind hydrotherapy is that water has healing properties that can relieve various ailments and conditions. In its different forms-ice, liquid, and steam-water is a versatile treatment method. Water cure therapies includes enema therapy, gel therapy etc, which includes colonic hydrotropy, sitz bath, hydro-massage, wraps and compress methods. Recently we have a number of hydrotherapy treatments available which includes personal infrared sauna rooms and peat bath rooms. These are useful in pregnancy, heart or lung conditions, diabetes, neuropathy, high fever, acute headache, surgical implants, seizure disorders etc. Cryotherapy, cold water immersion or ice bath is a new form of hydrotherapy used by physical therapists, sports medicine facilities and rehab clinics.

SO JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE safe sleep; infant mortality; self-reported data; collaborative
   community action
AB Objective: To compare self-reported safe sleep data from a community social service agency and primary care centers. Design, Settings, and Participants: Cross-sectional Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)-based survey data from a community social service agency and survey data from primary care centers were compared using descriptive statistics. There were 166 community survey respondents, average age of 25 years (SD = 5.4 years), and 79 primary care center respondents, average age of 24 years (SD = 5.4 years). Two binary logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between demographic differences and safe sleep position/bed sharing. Results: Safe sleep position responses did not differ significantly between the community-based (n = 126, 85%) and primary care center-based (n = 62, 79%) samples, chi(2)(1) = 0.79, P = .372. Reported bed sharing was significantly higher in the community sample (n = 54, 36%) than the health care center sample (n = 4, 5%), Fisher's exact test, P< .001. Black race was determined to be significantly associated with increased unsafe sleep positioning (OR = 2.86, P = .022). The community center cohort was the only significant predictor of bed sharing (OR = 25.40, P = .002). Conclusion: Differences in reported safe sleep environments may be due to knowledge variances of safe sleep guidelines, or clinic-based respondents may have been more likely to provide socially desirable responses. The comparison data further highlight the need for continued targeted effort to improve safe sleep behaviors to improve infant health outcomes.

TI Automated Software Analysis of Fetal Movement Recorded during a Pregnant
   Woman's Sleep at Home
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ULTRASOUND; PATTERNS
AB Fetal movement is an important biological index of fetal well-being. Since 2008, we have been developing an original capacitive acceleration sensor and device that a pregnant woman can easily use to record fetal movement by herself at home during sleep. In this study, we report a newly developed automated software system for analyzing recorded fetal movement. This study will introduce the system and compare its results to those of a manual analysis of the same fetal movement signals (Experiment I). We will also demonstrate an appropriate way to use the system (Experiment II). In Experiment I, fetal movement data reported previously for six pregnant women at 28-38 gestational weeks were used. We evaluated the agreement of the manual and automated analyses for the same 10-sec epochs using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) including quantitative indicators for prevalence and bias. The mean PABAK value was 0.83, which can be considered almost perfect. In Experiment II, twelve pregnant women at 24-36 gestational weeks recorded fetal movement at night once every four weeks. Overall, mean fetal movement counts per hour during maternal sleep significantly decreased along with gestational weeks, though individual differences in fetal development were noted. This newly developed automated analysis system can provide important data throughout late pregnancy.

DE Vibroacoustic stimulation test as adjunct to non-stress test for
   antepartum fetal well-being
AB INTRODUCTION: Several studies show that fetal sleeping periods can lead to falsely non-reactive test, therefore increasing the risk of unnecessary obstetric intervention. Attempt to arouse the fetus while in sleeping state or in rest activity cycle include a change in maternal position, physical activity, maternal glucose ingestion, sound stimulation, light stimulation and manual fetal manipulation. However the only stimuli that have consistently evoked response in normal fetus are acoustic and vibrotactile ones. AIMS & OBJECTIVES: 1. To compare and evaluate the role of non-stress test and vibro acoustic stimulation test on the perinatal outcome. 2. To evaluate vibro acoustic stimulation test as a screening test for early intrapartum fetal monitoring. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was done at department of OBGY, NIMS, hospital Jaipur. It included 100 women with high risk pregnancies above 34 weeks of gestation. Fetal monitor was used for non-stress test, and acoustic stimulator by teksonic instrument with sound pressure 80-85db for vibro acoustic stimulation test. It is a cross sectional study. OBSERVATION & RESULTS: High risk pregnant women showed (75%) 75 cases positive test which included (Reactive nst with reactive vast and also with reactive vast over non-reactive nst) out of which 62 cases (82.6%) were with favourable perinatal outcome and 13cases (17.3%) with unfavourable perinatal outcome. CONCLUSION: Result showed that in the high risk pregnancies after vibroacoustic stimulation test were significantly associated with favourable perinatal outcome.

AB Background
   After cesarean section (CS), women may be at great risk for sleep disturbance, but little is known about temporal changes in their sleep patterns and characteristics. We had two aims: 1) to identify distinct classes of sleep-disturbance trajectories in women considering elective CS from third-trimester pregnancy to 6 months post-CS and 2) to examine associations of sleep trajectories with body mass index (BMI), depressive symptoms, and fatigue scores.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study of 139 Taiwanese pregnant women who elected CS. Sleep components were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in third-trimester pregnancy, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-CS. Data were collected on depressive symptoms, fatigue symptoms, and BMI. Sleep-quality trajectories were identified by group-based trajectory modeling.
   Results
   We identified three distinct trajectories: stable poor sleep (50 women, 36.0%), progressively worse sleep (67 women, 48.2%), and persistently poor sleep (22 women, 15.8%). Poor sleep was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy BMI and more baseline (third-trimester pregnancy) depressive and fatigue symptoms. At 6 months post-CS, women classified as progressively worse or persistently poor sleepers showed a trend toward higher BMI (p < 0.03), more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), and higher fatigue scores (p < 0.001) than those with stable poor sleep.
   Conclusions
   Women had three distinct sleep-disturbance trajectories before and after elective CS. These poor-sleep courses were associated with BMI and psychological well-being. Our findings suggest a need to continuously assess sleep quality among women considering elective CS and up to 6 months post-CS.

AB This longitudinal study aimed to compare static postural stability in women between early pregnancy, advanced pregnancy, and at 2 and 6 months postpartum. Forty-five pregnant women were enrolled and 31 completed the protocol. Data were collected at 7-16 and 34-39 weeks gestation, and at 6-10 and 26-30 weeks postpartum. For each subject, the center of foot pressure path length and mean velocity (with directional subcomponents) were computed from 30-s long quiet-standing trials on a stationary force plate with eyes open or closed. The body mass, stance width, and sleep duration within 24 h before testing were also recorded. Static postural stability was not different between pregnancy and postpartum, except for the anterior posterior sway tested in the eyes-closed condition, which was significantly increased in late pregnancy compared to that at 2 and 6 months postpartum. Pregnant/postpartum women's body mass weakly positively correlated with anterior-posterior sway in the eyes-closed condition and their stance width weakly positively correlated with the anterior-posterior sway in the eyes-open condition. No effect of sleep duration on postural sway was found. Our findings indicate that under visual deprivation conditions women in advanced pregnancy may have decreased static stability compared to their nonpregnant state.

   utilization among pregnant women in Shashogo District, Southern Ethiopia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Malaria; ITNs; Pregnant women
ID INSECTICIDE-TREATED NETS; NIGERIA; CURTAINS; GHANA
AB Background: Malaria causes variety of adverse consequences in pregnant women due to invasion of the placenta by Plasmodium. It increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome for the mother, the foetus and the new-born. Therefore, knowledge, attitudes and practices of this vulnerable group about malaria and the effective use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) contribute to sustainable control of the disease and its effects.
   Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was carried out in May, 2014. A validated structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The data was analysed using logistic regression by means of STATA version 11 data analysis software.
   Results: A total of 398 pregnant women participated in the study and their overall knowledge and attitude towards malaria and ITNs was fairly good; 74.3 % of the mothers had good knowledge and 51.1 % of them possessed positive attitude. Nevertheless, only 15.6 % of the mothers associated mosquitoes with malaria and majority of them (65.6 %) responded that it is transmitted due to poor personal hygiene and environmental sanitation. Younger age, receiving information and information obtained from health extension workers and media were found to be important predictors of pregnant women's attitude (P < 0.05). The ITNs utilization was poor. Only 15.8 % of 398 mothers owned at least one ITN. This was due to its unavailability in markets and unsustainable distribution. More than half of the mothers who owned the ITNs did not have a number proportional to their family size, and 52 % of the mothers had not slept under bed net the previous night. This was due to its being dirty, old, had holes and in some cases lack of awareness on how to install it and its importance to prevent malaria. Higher education was identified as the determining factor for ITNs utilization (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Even though the pregnant mothers' knowledge and attitude about malaria and ITNs was fairly good, its ownership and utilization was noticeably very low. Therefore, consistent and timely distribution by the government and other funding agencies is promptly needed. In addition, appropriate health education should be given on the link between malaria and mosquito, regular and correct use of ITNs with special focus to uneducated and elderly mothers.

AB Background: Sleep problems are common during pregnancy and in the postnatal period, but there is still a lack of longitudinal population-based studies assessing the quantity and quality of sleep in these women. The aim of the current study was to examine the natural development and stability of insomnia and short sleep duration in women from pregnancy to two years postpartum.
   Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study (the Akershus Birth Cohort Study) of 1480 healthy women, who completed three comprehensive health surveys, at week 32 of pregnancy, week 8 postpartum and year 2 postpartum. The survey was composed of the following validated questionnaires: the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Differences in sleep characteristics between the three assessment points were compared using Analyses of Variance with repeated measures, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the stability of sleep variables.
   Results: One thousand four hundred and eighty women completed all three surveys, and the mean age at birth was 30.7 (+/-4.9). The prevalence of insomnia remained stable at 60 % at the first two time periods, and remained high at 41 % at year 2 postpartum. The mean sleep duration at the three time periods was 7 h 16 min, 6 h 31 min, and 6 h 52 min, respectively. Concurrent maternal depression could not explain the stability of sleep problems from during and immediately after pregnancy, to sleep problems 2 years postpartum.
   Conclusion: Both insomnia and short sleep duration were found to be very common both before and after pregnancy.

AB Background: New parents have to adjust to less sleep, less free time, and more responsibility as a result of having a child. The purpose of this study was to examine how having a child impacts the physical activity (PA) beliefs and behaviors of new parents over a 2- to 3-year time period. Methods: Participants included 49 men and women (31% men, 96% white) who did not have a child at baseline (26.3 +/- 1.1 years old) but did have a child at the time of follow-up (28.9 +/- 1.7 years old). The child's mean age at follow-up was 12 +/- 7 months old. PA was measured via questionnaire at baseline and again at follow-up. Interviews regarding PA occurred at follow-up. Results: PA significantly decreased in parents across the time period (P < .001), and parents attributed this decrease to having a child and being pregnant. Parents mentioned they lack time, energy, and motivation for PA as a result of caring for a new child. Parents who maintained their activity level stated they prioritized PA and chose activities they enjoyed. Conclusions: These results show that although activity levels decrease in individuals who have a child, PA in new parents may be a function of priority, intensity, and enjoyment.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing occurs in 0.6-15% of reproductive age women. This condition is associated with an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. A substantial body of evidence demonstrated increased perinatal morbidity among pregnancies affected by SDB including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. These same conditions are predictive of later cardiovascular disease. Treatment of SDB has been demonstrated to decrease future cardiovascular events and mortality. Screening at-risk individuals in the perinatal period can identify women with SDB, who can benefit from treatment. Continuous positive airway pressure and lifestyle interventions can decrease subsequent adverse cardiovascular health outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Early life nutritional adversity is tightly associated with the development of long-term metabolic disorders. Particularly, maternal obesity and high-fat diets cause high risk of obesity in the offspring. Those offspring are also prone to develop hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular diseases. However, the precise underlying mechanisms leading to these metabolic dysregulation in the offspring remain unclear. On the other hand, disruptions of diurnal circadian rhythms are known to impair metabolic homeostasis in various tissues including the heart and liver. Therefore, we investigated that whether maternal obesity perturbs the circadian expression rhythms of clock, metabolic and inflammatory genes in offspring heart and liver by using RT-qPCR and Western blotting analysis. Offspring from lean and obese dams were examined on postnatal day 17 and 35, when pups were nursed by their mothers or took food independently. On P17, genes examined in the heart either showed anti-phase oscillations (Cpt1b, Ppar alpha, Per2) or had greater oscillation amplitudes (Bmal1, Tnf-alpha, Il-6). Such phase abnormalities of these genes were improved on P35, while defects in amplitudes still existed. In the liver of 17-day-old pups exposed to maternal obesity, the oscillation amplitudes of most rhythmic genes examined (except Bmal1) were strongly suppressed. On P35, the oscillations of circadian and inflammatory genes became more robust in the liver, while metabolic genes were still kept non-rhythmic. Maternal obesity also had a profound influence in the protein expression levels of examined genes in offspring heart and liver. Our observations indicate that the circadian clock undergoes nutritional programing, which may contribute to the alternations in energy metabolism associated with the development of metabolic disorders in early life and adulthood.

AB Topiramate (TPM) is an increasingly used drug during childbearing ages for treatment of epilepsy, migraine, and appetite suppression as well as for off-label indications such as sleep and psychiatric disorders. Presently, while some reports suggested an increased risk of oral cleft (OC), these reports are balanced by studies that could not confirm such association. We conducted a meta-analysis of all studies reporting on women exposed to TPM during pregnancy. Of the 2327 publications reviewed, 6 articles met the inclusion criteria including 3420 patients and 1,204,981 controls. The odd ratio (OR) of OC after the first trimester exposure to TPM exposure was 6.26 (95% confidence interval: 3.13-12.51; P=0.00001). This study provides strong evidence that TPM is associated with an increased risk of OC in infants exposed to TPM during embryogenesis and should lead to a careful review of TPM use in women of reproductive ages.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between postpartum depression (PPD), infantile colic (IC) and different psychosocial variables, psychiatric symptoms, attachment style and perceived social support in expecting parents.
   Method: Two hundred forty five expecting mothers and 150 expecting fathers were first interviewed between the 22-34 weeks of pregnancy Sociodemografic data form, Adult Attachment Style Scale (AASS), State Anxiety Inventory (SAT), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were filled out by each expecting parent. Second interview was conducted between the postpartum 4-24 weeks. Data form consisting health, nutrition, sleep and crying problems of the infant and EPDS and SAI were filled out by mothers and SAI by fathers.
   Results: One in every four mothers had PPD symptoms above the threshold on EPDS. Maternal and paternal insecure attachment style, maternal psychiatric symptoms and postpartum anxiety level were found to be the predictors of PPD. One in every five infants had IC and maternal education level, hostility score and PPD symptoms along with paternal insecure attachment style and psychiatric symptoms were the main predictors of IC.
   Conclusion: Results about PPD and IC regarding maternal variables are consistent with the literature. In addition, paternal insecure attachment style is found to be an important risk factor for both PPD and IC. Fathers should also be included in further studies exploring PPD or IC.

AB During pregnancy and the transition toward motherhood, a special time for the restructuring of the female identity and representational world, dreaming may play an important function in the psychic life. If we accept that psychological and psychosocial risk factors influence representation during pregnancy, this article explores, from a psychodynamic perspective, how the presence/absence of biological risk is represented into women's dream narration. Forty dreams of pregnant women (20 healthy pregnancies/20 at risk) were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We performed a thematic analysis of multiple correspondences to see whether the dreams recounted by the women in the 2 different categories had any specific characteristics. Four thematic clusters resulted, which, after interpretation using factorial mapping, fall into 3 sense vectors: from the unrepresentable to the representable; from dependency to reciprocal relationships; from undifferentiated to different. The work we did enabled us to observe that in healthy pregnancies dreams have a mainly elaborative function, whereas when there are risk factors, it seems to be difficult to construct a psychic representational space.

AB Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of childbearing with a 13% prevalence rate. Sleep disturbances are also common, particularly during early postpartum. In theory, l-tryptophan could improve sleep and reduce depressed mood in early postpartum; however, the first step in clinical development of tryptophan for use in postpartum is to measure the effect of oral l-tryptophan on its concentrations in breast milk, which is presently unknown.
   The aims were to investigate the effect of oral l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin, a protein with high tryptophan concentration, on total and free tryptophan levels in breast milk and plasma, and to compare free tryptophan levels in breast milk with those in common infant formulas.
   Thirty healthy breastfeeding women were randomly allocated to receive 2 g or 4 g of kryptophan, or, 20 g or 40 g of alpha-lactalbumin or no supplement. Free tryptophan levels were also measured in 12 different infant formulas. Total tryptophan in breast milk was unaffected by oral administration of l-tryptophan or alpha-lactalbumin (repeated measures of ANOVA (rANOVA), group effect: p=0.93). Both l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin were associated with greater free tryptophan levels in breast milk (rANOVA, group effect: p<0.001) (representing 2% of total tryptophan), but these concentrations were within the range of commonly used infant formulas.
   In contrast to most sleep inducing medications, l-tryptophan does not affect its total concentration in breast milk. These results support further investigation of dietary l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin as part of a dietary supplementation approach to address sleep disturbances in postpartum and reduce risk of PPD.

AB We analyzed the association of sleep quality and glucose metabolism in women after gestational diabetes (pGDM) and in women after normoglycemic pregnancy (controls). Data during pregnancy and a visit within the first 15 months after delivery were collected from 61 pGDM and 30 controls in a prospective cohort study. This included a medical history, physical examination, questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and 5-point oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurements to determine indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. We used Spearman correlation coefficients and multivariate regression models for analysis 9.3 +/- 3.2 months after delivery, pGDM had significantly higher fasting and 2 h glucose levels and lower insulin sensitivity than controls. There was no significant difference in age, BMI and sleep quality as assessed with the PSQI between the two groups. The PSQI score correlated with the ogtt-2 h plasma glucose in pGDM (delta = 0.41; p = 0.0012), but not in controls. This association was confirmed with a multivariate linear regression model with adjustment for age, BMI and months post-delivery. Perceived stress was an independent risk factor (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.23) for impaired sleep. Our findings suggest that post-delivery sleep quality significantly influences glucose tolerance in women after GDM and that impaired sleep is associated with increased stress perception. Measures to improve of sleep quality and reduce perceived stress should therefore be tested as additional strategies to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes after GDM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy, and studies show that pregnant women are more likely to suffer from restless legs syndrome (RLS). Pregnant women with hypertension and RLS often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the nervous system. The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between hypertension and RLS in pregnant women, and their impact on sleep. We enrolled 3,781 pregnant women who were admitted at our hospital for delivery between May 2011 and May 2014. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included the International RLS Study Group criteria for diagnosis, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and hypertension diagnosis. Depending on the time of occurrence of hypertension, it was divided into two different types: pregnancy-induced hypertension and chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Out of 3,781 patients, 453 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for RLS and 486 met the diagnostic criteria for hypertension. Among patients with RLS, prophylactic iron supplementation was less frequently taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, rather than chronic hypertension in pregnancy, was found to be more frequent in patients with RLS; pregnant women with RLS had higher PSQI and ESS scores than pregnant controls. In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant women, especially in those without prophylactic iron supplementation. Patients with RLS described more serious sleep disruption and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). In addition, pregnancy-induced hypertension was more common in patients with RLS.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in women five years after the birth of their first child as well as the HRQoL in relation to mode of delivery.
   Methods: 545 first-time pregnant women, drawn from a hospital situated in Sweden, consented to be included in a cohort. Five years after the birth of the first child, 372 (68%) women agreed to participate in a follow-up study. HRQoL was measured using the Swedish Health-Related Quality of Life Survey (SWED-QUAL) questionnaire. Socio-demographic background and variables related to pregnancy and childbirth were collected using a self-report questionnaire.
   Results: Overall, the HRQoL was perceived to be good. Suboptimal scores were obtained for the three variables: Sleeping problems, Emotional well-being negative affect and Family functioning sexual functioning. Women having a vaginal birth, an instrumental vaginal birth or women who underwent caesarean section on maternal request were more likely to report better perceived HRQoL than women who had undergone an emergency caesarean section or caesarean section due to medical indication.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the overall HRQoL of the women in the cohort was reported as good. Mode of delivery was associated with differences in HRQoL five years after birth of the first child. Our result suggests that some differences in perceived HRQoL persist in the long term.

AB Extensive research defines the impact of advanced maternal age on couples' fecundity and reproductive outcomes, but significantly less research has been focused on understanding the impact of advanced paternal age. Yet it is increasingly common for couples at advanced ages to conceive children. Limited research suggests that the importance of paternal age is significantly less than that of maternal age, but advanced age of the father is implicated in a variety of conditions affecting the offspring. This review examines three aspects of advanced paternal age: the potential problems with conception and pregnancy that couples with advanced paternal age may encounter, the concept of discussing a limit to paternal age in a clinical setting, and the risks of diseases associated with advanced paternal age. As paternal age increases, it presents no absolute barrier to conception, but it does present greater risks and complications. The current body of knowledge does not justify dissuading older men from trying to initiate a pregnancy, but the medical community must do a better job of communicating to couples the current understanding of the risks of conception with advanced paternal age.

AB IMPORTANCE Childhood sleep problems have been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, but there is limited knowledge as to the temporal association between sleep problems and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in young children.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether sleep problems in toddlers aged 18 months are related to both concurrent and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in preschool children aged 5 years.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A large population-based longitudinal study was conducted in September 2014 using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health from June 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008. A total of 32 662 children or pregnancies were included.
   EXPOSURES Sleep was assessed by mother-reported child sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Emotional and behavioral problems were measured with items from the Child Behavior Checklist and operationalized according to recommended clinical cutoffs, corresponding to T scores of greater than 65 (93rd percentile). Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using negative binomial regression, controlling for emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months and other relevant covariates.
   RESULTS Short sleep duration (<10 hours) in 556 children (1.7%) and frequent nocturnal awakenings (>= 3 times) in 1033 children (3.2%) at 18 months significantly predicted both concurrent and later incidence of emotional and behavioral problems at 5 years. The longitudinal RRs were generally larger for internalizing problems, with adjusted RRs of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23-2.08) for both short sleep duration and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.28-1.93) for nocturnal awakenings; RRs for externalizing problems were 1.77 (95% CI, 1.37-2.30) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.00-1.58), respectively. Additional adjustment for emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months slightly reduced the strength of these associations, and all RRs remained significant in the fully adjusted models.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early sleep problems predict later development of emotional and behavioral problems. Intervention studies are needed to examine whether sleep programs targeting early childhood may avert the onset of later adverse outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To provide a diagnostic and management approach for narcolepsy in children. METHODS: Narcolepsy is a chronic disabling disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnogogic and/or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. All four features are present in only half of the cases. Excessive daytime sleepiness is the essential feature of narcolepsy at any age and is usually the first symptom to manifest. A combination of excessive daytime sleepiness and definite cataplexy is considered pathognomonic of narcolepsy syndrome. RESULTS: New treatment options have become available over the past few years. Early diagnosis and management can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management options for children with narcolepsy.

AB Ninety-eight mothers of healthy firstborn infants 0 to 6 months old were randomly assigned to listen to 10-min of infant crying or infant cooing while continuously rating subjective feelings of frustration. Participants completed pre-test measures of depressed mood, empathy, and trait anger and post-test measures of infant-related harm thoughts, negative and positive emotions, and urge to comfort and to flee. Twenty-three (23.5 %) participants endorsed unwanted thoughts of active harm (e.g., throwing, yelling at, shaking the infant). Women in the cry condition were more likely than women in the coo condition to report thoughts of harm. Women in the cry condition who endorsed thoughts of harm reported higher frustration levels over the 10 min of crying, higher levels of post-test negative emotions, and stronger urges to flee the infant but not stronger urges to comfort the infant. Trait anger and personal distress empathy predicted the occurrence of unwanted thoughts of infant harm, whereas negative mood did not. Unwanted, intrusive, infant-related thoughts of harm may be triggered by prolonged infant crying, are predicted by personal distress empathy and a tendency to experience anger, and are associated with higher frustration, negative emotions, and the urge to escape the infant.

AB Despite huge efforts from public sectors to educate society as to the deleterious physiological consequences of smoking while pregnant, 12-25% of all babies worldwide are born to mothers who smoked during their pregnancies. Chief among the negative legacies bestowed to the exposed individual is an enhanced proclivity postnatally to addict to drugs of abuse, which suggests that the drug exposure during gestation changed the developing brain in such a way that biased it towards addiction. Glutamate signalling has been shown to be altered by prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter within the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), which is a brainstem region importantly involved in responding to motivational stimuli and critical in development of drug addiction-associated behaviours, however, it is unknown whether PNE alters glutamate signalling within this nucleus. Accordingly, we used calcium imaging, to evaluate AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated calcium responses in LDT brain slices from control and PNE mice. We also investigated whether the positive AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide (CYZ) had differential actions on calcium in the LDT following PNE. Our data indicated that PNE significantly decreased AMPA receptor-mediated calcium responses, and altered the neuronal calcium response to consecutive NMDA applications within the LDT. Furthermore, CYZ strongly potentiated AMPA-induced responses, however, this action was significantly reduced in the LDT of PNE mice when compared with enhancements in responses in control LDT cells. Immunohistochemical processing confirmed that calcium imaging recordings were obtained from the LDT nucleus as determined by presence of cholinergic neurons. Our results contribute to the body of evidence suggesting that neurobiological changes are induced if gestation is accompanied by nicotine exposure. We conclude that in light of the role played by the LDT in motivated behaviour, the cellular changes in the LDT induced by exposures to nicotine prenatally, when combined with alterations in other reward-related regions, could contribute to the increased susceptibility to smoking observed in the offspring.

TI Impact of Functional Status on the Quality of Life of Pregnant Women
   with Lumbopelvic Pain
SO ISTANBUL MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Pain; pregnancy; quality of life
AB Objective: To evaluate the functional status of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain (LPP) and to determine its effect on their health-related quality of life with respect to physical, social, and emotional functions.
   Methods: A total of 127 pregnant women at 8-39 gestational weeks who were admitted to our outpatient pregnancy clinic were included in the study. Of these patients, 83 pregnant women who reported LPP for at least 2 weeks formed the LPP group and the remaining 44 pregnant women formed the control group. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used for assessing functional status, and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used for assessing the health-related quality of life. The severity of pain was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS pain).
   Results: The scores of the LPP group were significantly higher than those of the control group in ODI and in the pain, physical mobility, and energy subscales of NHP (p<0.001). The scores of ODI correlated with those of VAS pain and those of pain, physical mobility, energy, sleep, social isolation, and emotional reaction subgroups of NHP (p<0.01, r=0.67, 0.54, 0.46, 0.49, 0.41, 0.29, and 0.38, respectively). The highest correlation was between ODI and VAS pain (r=0.67).
   Conclusion: LPP is common in pregnant women and causes functional limitation and decreased health-related quality of life. Identifying pregnancyrelated LPP and its treatment will result in an increase in the quality of life.

AB Assessing postpartum depressive symptoms is complicated by the fact that irritability, fatigue, insomnia, and appetite disruptions are also related to normative aspects of the childbearing process. We used multigroup confirmatory factor analysis to compare symptoms in 271 postpartum women with those of 820 non-postpartum women. We found that (a) irritability, insomnia, fatigue, and appetite loss were substantially associated with depressed mood among postpartum women whereas increased appetite was not; (b) irritability, insomnia, fatigue, and appetite changes were as strongly related to depression among postpartum women as they were among non-postpartum women; and (c) after controlling for overall depressed mood, postpartum women reported more irritability, insomnia, and appetite loss than the non-postpartum women. Irritability, fatigue, insomnia, and appetite loss are valid indicators and should be used to measure postpartum depressive symptoms. However, scores on these symptoms should be adjusted downward to account for their higher baseline rates in the postpartum population.

AB Objective: To determine the stationary characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) envelopes for prematurely born (preterm) infants and investigate the intrinsic characteristics of early brain development in preterm infants.
   Methods: Twenty neurologically normal sets of EEGs recorded in infants with a post-conceptional age (PCA) range of 26-44 weeks (mean 37.5 +/- 5.0 weeks) were analyzed. Hilbert transform was applied to extract the envelope. We determined the suitable probability distribution of the envelope and performed a statistical analysis.
   Results: It was found that (i) the probability distributions for preterm EEG envelopes were best fitted by lognormal distributions at 38 weeks PCA or less, and by gamma distributions at 44 weeks PCA; (ii) the scale parameter of the lognormal distribution had positive correlations with PCA as well as a strong negative correlation with the percentage of low-voltage activity; (iii) the shape parameter of the lognormal distribution had significant positive correlations with PCA; (iv) the statistics of mode showed significant linear relationships with PCA, and, therefore, it was considered a useful index in PCA prediction.
   Conclusion: These statistics, including the scale parameter of the lognormal distribution and the skewness and mode derived from a suitable probability distribution, may be good indexes for estimating stationary nature in developing brain activity in preterm infants.
   Significance: The stationary characteristics, such as discontinuity, asymmetry, and unimodality, of preterm EEGs are well indicated by the statistics estimated from the probability distribution of the preterm EEG envelopes.

AB Background: Myanmar is one of the 31 highest burden malaria countries worldwide. Scaling up the appropriate use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is a national policy for malaria prevention and control. However, the data on use, influencing factors and maintenance of bed nets is still lack among the population in Kachin Special Region II (KR2), Northeastern Myanmar.
   Methods: The study combined a quantitative household questionnaire survey and qualitative direct observation of households. A Chi-squared test was used to compare the percentages of ownership, coverage, and rates of use of bed nets. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVLRA) was used to analyse factors that influence the use of bed nets. Finally, covariance compared the mean calibrated hole indexes (MCHI) across potential influence variables.
   Results: The bed net to person ratio was 1: 1.96 (i.e., more than one net for every two people). The long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) to person ratio was 1: 2.52. Also, the percentage of households that owned at least one bed net was 99.7 % (666/688). Some 3262 (97.3 %) residents slept under bed nets the prior night, 2551 (76.1 %) of which slept under ITNs/LLINs the prior night (SUITNPN). The poorest families, those with thatched roofing, those who use agriculture as their main source of family income, household heads who knew that mosquitoes transmit malaria and those who used bed nets to prevent malaria, were significantly more likely to be in the SUITNPN group. However, residents in lowlands, and foothills were significantly less likely to be SUITNPNs. Finally, head of household attitude towards fixing bed nets influenced MCHI (F = 8.09, P = 0.0046).
   Conclusions: The coverage and usage rates of bed nets were high, especially among children, and pregnant women. Family wealth index, geographical zones, household roofing, source of family income, household head's knowledge of malaria transmission and of using bed nets as tools for malaria prevention are all independent factors which influence use of ITNs/LLINs in KR2. Maintaining high coverage, and use rate of bed nets should be a priority for the war-torn population of KR2 to ensure equity and human rights.

AB Objectives Our goal was to evaluate changes in respiratory pattern among premature infants born at <29 weeks gestation who underwent a physiological challenge at 36 weeks postmenstrual age with systematic reductions in supplemental oxygen and inspired airflow.
   Study design Subjects were all infants enrolled in the Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Project at St. Louis Children's Hospital and eligible for a physiological challenge protocol because they were receiving supplemental oxygen or augmented airflow alone as part of their routine care. Continuous recording of rib cage and abdominal excursion and haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2%) were made in the newborn intensive care unit.
   Results 37 of 49 infants (75.5%) failed the challenge, with severe or sustained falls in SpO2%. Also, 16 of 37 infants (43.2%) who failed had marked increases in the amount of periodic breathing at the time of challenge failure.
   Conclusions An unstable respiratory pattern is unmasked with a decrease in inspired oxygen or airflow support in many premature infants. Although infants with significant chronic lung disease may also be predisposed to more periodic breathing, these data suggest that the classification of chronic lung disease of prematurity based solely on clinical requirements for supplemental oxygen or airflow do not account for multiple mechanisms that are likely contributing to the need for respiratory support.

TI Treatment of Early-Onset Preeclampsia With Continuous Positive Airway
   Pressure
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is no treatment for preeclampsia other than delivery. Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, but it is not known whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves perinatal outcomes.
   CASE: We report a 35-year-old primigravid woman diagnosed with preeclampsia at 30 weeks of gestation. A sleep study confirmed severe sleep-disordered breathing, and CPAP treatment was started. After CPAP treatment, both clinical and biochemical markers of preeclampsia improved. In addition, circulating angiogenic markers of preeclampsia improved. As a result, the pregnancy safely continued for 30 days, allowing the fetus to gain gestation.
   CONCLUSION: Continuous positive airway pressure may be a novel treatment for women with early-onset preeclampsia associated with sleep-disordered breathing.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the relationship between postpartum sleep disturbance and postpartum depression and describe the characteristics and demographics of the samples.
   Data SourcesElectronic databases Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, EPOC, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Psych INFO. In addition, hand searches of bibliographies supplemented the electronic search.
   Study SelectionEnglish language primary studies on the relationship between postpartum sleep disturbance and postpartum depression were included. Thirteen observational studies met the inclusion criteria.
   Data ExtractionData that specified the relationship between sleep disturbance and postpartum depression were extracted from the studies. The data were organized per author, year, participants, setting, country, demographics, design, sample size, outcomes, evidence, and effect size.
   Data SynthesisThe effect size indicating the relationship between sleep disturbance and postpartum depression across the studies ranged between 0.4 and 1.7. There was evidence of a strong relationship between sleep disturbance and postpartum depression; however, the participants in the 13 studies were predominantly educated, middle class, older than age 30 years, and White. Likewise, the definition and measurement of postpartum sleep varied across the studies, which increased the possibility of bias.
   ConclusionsFurther research within the postpartum period involving underserved, younger women and samples with more diversity in race and ethnicity are needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the effect of maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) on infant general movements (GMs) and neurodevelopment.
   STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies and their offspring were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low-risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire on second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index > 5) and controls. Infant GMs were assessed in the first 48 hours and at 8-11 and 14-16 weeks of age. At 12 months of age the Infant Developmental Inventory and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered.
   RESULTS: In all, 74 women and their full-term infants were studied. Eighteen (24%) women had SDB. Mean birthweight was 3347.1 +/- 423.9 g. Median Apgar score at 5 minutes was 10 (range, 8-10). In adjusted comparisons, no differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and controls in GM scores in all 3 evaluations. Low social developmental score was detected at 12 months in 64% of infants born to SDB mothers compared to 25% of infants born to controls (adjusted P = .036; odds ratio, 16.7). Infant snoring was reported by 41.7% of mothers with SDB compared to 7.5% of controls (P = .004).
   CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal and infant neuromotor development but may affect social development at 1 year.

AB AimAlthough sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) might impose an underlying health threat upon some pregnant women, the influence of SDB on the health status of most pregnant women is not discernible. In order to find out which pregnant women should be evaluated for clinically meaningful SDB during the second trimester, the present study aimed to determine which overnight oximetry findings significantly affect maternal resting cardiac autonomic modulations.
   Material and MethodsOvernight arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) was monitored at home using pulse oximetry by 64 women with uncomplicated pregnancy between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. We then determined the impact of the findings on maternal resting heart rate variability (HRV) using 5-min photoplethysmography.
   ResultsA relatively increased oxygen desaturation index (number of oxygen desaturation events where SaO(2) fell >3% below the baseline saturation/h) of 3.0 in five women did not significantly impact HRV. On the other hand, events associated with profound oxygen desaturation (minimum SaO(2)90%) in three women were associated with decreased HRV, including high- and low-frequency powers.
   ConclusionParasympathetic activities of cardiac autonomic modulations might be attenuated in women who experience profound night-time oxygen desaturation, even if the incidence of significant events is quite low. The oximetry finding of minimum SaO(2)90% might be a valuable criterion for clinically meaningful sleep-disordered breathing among women with early uncomplicated pregnancy.

AB Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop cardiovascular and metabolic pathology in adulthood when their circadian system exhibits significant aberrances compared with healthy control rats. This study was aimed to elucidate how the SHR circadian system develops during ontogenesis and to assess its sensitivity to changes in maternalfeeding regime. Analysis of ontogenesis of clock gene expression rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, liver and colon revealed significant differences in SHR compared with Wistar rats. In the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and liver, the development of a high-amplitude expression rhythm selectively for Bmal1 was delayed compared with Wistar rat. The atypical development of the SHR circadian clocks during postnatal ontogenesis might arise from differences in maternal behavior between SHR and Wistar rats that were detected soon after delivery. It may also arise from higher sensitivity of the circadian clocks in the SHR SCN, liver and colon to maternal behavior related to changes in the feeding regime because in contrast to Wistar rat, the SHR SCN and peripheral clocks during the prenatal period and the hepatic clock during the early postnatal period were phase shifted due to exposure of mothers to a restricted feeding regime. The maternal restricted feeding regime shifted the clocks despite the fact that the mothers were maintained under the light/dark cycle. Our findings of the diverse development and higher sensitivity of the developing circadian system of SHR to maternal cues might result from previously demonstrated differences in the SHR circadian genotype and may potentially contribute to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, which the animal model spontaneously develops.

AB This study investigated the mediating roles of sleep and depression on the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake among low-income overweight and obese pregnant women by trimesters. Participants (N = 213) completed a self-administered survey including stress (exogenous variable), depression, sleep (mediators), fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake (endogenous variables). Path analysis was performed to compare mediation effects among pregnant women in each trimester. Consistently across three trimesters, stress was related to depression but not sleep duration, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency or fat intake. Sleep duration was not associated with depression. Depending on trimester, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, and sleep latency were related to depression; night time sleep disturbance and depression affected fat intake; stress influenced fruit and vegetable intake. Sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency and depression did not mediate the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake in the second and third trimesters. However, depression mediated the relationship between stress and fat intake in the first trimester. Stress management interventions may help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women decrease depressive symptoms and therefore contribute to overall nutritional health.

AB This study was conducted to identify factors that influenced stress, healthy eating and physical activity among low-income overweight or obese pregnant women. We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women's pregnancy concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the woman's safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions. They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult, e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier, some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan effective ways to manage negative feelings.

AB Background: Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) are serious conditions that affect approximately 10-15% of women after childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders.
   Methods: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included.
   Results: There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong 13 were moderate and 17 were weak.
   Limitations: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis.
   Conclusions: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high quality research is needed on this topic area. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved

TI To assess whether addition of pyriproxyfen to long-lasting insecticidal

AB Background: The effectiveness of pyrethroid-treated bednets for malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa is under threat because of high levels of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in the vectors. Here we assess the durability of polyethylene nets with a novel combination of permethrin, a pyrethroid, with pyriproxyfen, an insect juvenile mimic (PPF-LLIN), in comparison with a typical permethrin-treated long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN).
   Methods: This is a cluster randomised controlled trial of net durability in Burkina Faso, with clustering at the level of the compound and includes entomological outcome measurements. Half the compounds in each village will be randomly allocated PPF-LLIN and half the LLIN. All sleeping places in a compound will be provided with one type of net. We will distribute the nets at the start of the first transmission season and follow net use at the start and end of each transmission season for 3 years. In one village, bio-efficacy and chemical content will be recorded immediately after net distribution and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. In the other village net survivorship and fabric integrity will be recorded immediately after distribution, and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. Routine measurements of indoor temperature and relative humidity will be made in both villages during the study. Residents will be followed for possible side effects of the PPF-LLIN by surveillance of known asthmatic subjects during the first month post-distribution and pregnancy outcomes will be monitored from antenatal clinic records.
   Discussion: The protocol is novel on two accounts. Firstly, it is the first to describe the procedure for measuring net durability following recent World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. Meeting the minimum requirements set in the guidelines is essential before a new type of net can be recommended by WHO's Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES). Secondly, it describes methods to monitor the persistence of an active ingredient that reduces vector fertility and fecundity. If the PPF-LLIN is both effective and persistent it will provide an alternative vector control strategy where pyrethroid-resistant vectors are present.

TI Effects of Clozapine and other Atypical Antipsychotics on Infants

   DRUGS; WOMEN; COST
AB Objective
   To investigate the developmental effects of clozapine and other atypical antipsychotics on infants who were exposed to as fetus.
   Method
   The developmental progress of 33 infants who were exposed to clozapine as fetus was compared to 30 infants who were exposed to risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine as fetus by assessing Apgar scoring, birth weight at birth, body weight, height, and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) at months 2, 6 and 12 of age. Five subscale scores of BSID-III including cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior were also compared. Student's t test and Chi-square analysis were used as appropriate. Repeated measurements were evaluated by analysis of covariance.
   Results
   Of the 63 infants, 58 (92.1%) completed a 12-month study period. At the age of 2 and 6 months, mean adaptive behavior scores of BSID-III were significantly lower in clozapine-exposed infants than infants who exposed to other atypical antipsychotic at 2 and 6 months of age. More clozapine-exposed infants had delayed development (defined as the subscale score of <85) for adaptive behavior at 2 and 6 months of age. There was no difference between the two groups for cognitive, language, motor, social and emotional at 2, 6 and 12 months of age. More infants who were exposed to clozapine as fetus (25 of 33, 75.8%) had disturbed sleep and a labile state than those who were exposed to other atypical antipsychotics (8 of 30, 26.7%) during 2 months of age (P<0.001).
   Conclusion
   These results suggest that clozapine has more adaptive behavior effects on infants who were exposed to as a fetus than other atypical antipsychotics at 2 and 6 months of age.

TI Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Concerning Malaria in Pregnancy:

AB Background
   Malaria is the leading cause of illness and death in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Infection during pregnancy with falciparum or vivax malaria, as occurs in PNG, has health implications for mother and child, causing complications such as maternal anemia, low birth weight and miscarriage. This article explores knowledge, attitudes and practices concerning malaria during pregnancy and it's prevention in Madang, PNG, a high prevalence area.
   Methods
   As part of a qualitative study in Madang, exploring MiP, participatory techniques (free-listing and sorting) were conducted along with focus group discussions, in-depth interviews (with pregnant women, health staff and other community members) and observations in the local community and health facilities.
   Results
   The main themes explored were attitudes towards and knowledge of MiP, its risks, and prevention. Although there was a general awareness of the term "malaria", it was often conflated with general sickness or with pregnancy-related symptoms. Moreover, many preventive methods for MiP were related to practices of general healthy living. Indeed, varied messages from health staff about the risks of MiP were observed. In addition to ideas about the seriousness and risk of MiP, other factors influenced the uptake of interventions: availability and perceived comfort of sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets were important determinants of usage, and women's heavy workload influenced Chloroquine adherence.
   Conclusion
   The non-specific symptoms of MiP and its resultant conflation with symptoms of pregnancy that are perceived as normal have implications for MiP prevention and control. However, in Madang, PNG, this was compounded by the inadequacy of health staff's message about MiP.

AB The rhythmic expression of clock genes in the uterus is attenuated during decidualization. This study focused on Ptgs2, which is essential for decidualization, as a putative clock-controlled gene, and aimed to reveal the functions of clock genes in relation to Ptgs2 during decidualization. We compared the transcript levels of clock genes in the rat uterus on days 4.5 (D4.5) and 6.5 of pregnancy. The transcript levels of clock genes (Per2, Bmal1, Ror alpha, and Rev-erb alpha) had decreased at implantation sites on day 6.5 (D6.5e) compared with those on D4.5, whereas Ptgs2 transcripts had increased on D6.5e. Similar observations of Rev-erb alpha and Ptgs2 were also obtained in the endometrium on D6.5e by immunohistochemistry. In the decidual cells induced by medroxyprogesterone and 2-O-dibutyryl-cAMP, the rhythmic expression levels of clock genes were attenuated, whereas Ptgs2 transcription was induced. These results indicate that decidualization causes the attenuation of clock genes and the induction of Ptgs2. Furthermore, in the experiment of Bmal1 siRNA, the rhythmic expression of clock genes and Ptgs2 was attenuated by the siRNA. Transcript levels of Ptgs2 and prostaglandin (PG) E-2 production were increased by treatment with the Rev-erb alpha antagonist, suggesting the contribution of the nuclear receptor Rev-erb alpha to Ptgs2 expression. Moreover, Rev-erb alpha knockdown enhanced the induction of Ptgs2 transcription and PGE2 production by forskolin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis revealed that Rev-erb alpha could directly bind to a proximal RORE site of Ptgs2. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the attenuation of the circadian clock, especially its core component Rev-erb alpha, contributes to the induction of Ptgs2 during decidualization.

AB The laboratory guinea pig, Cavia porcellus, shares with humans many similarities during pregnancy and prenatal development, including precocial offspring and social dependence. These similarities suggest the guinea pig as a promising model of fetal behavioral development as well. Using innovative methods of behavioral acclimation, fetal offspring of female IAF hairless guinea pigs time mated to NIH multicolored Hartley males were observed longitudinally without restraint using noninvasive ultrasound at weekly intervals across the 10 week gestation. To ensure that the ultrasound procedure did not cause significant stress, salivary cortisol was collected both before and after each observation. Measures of fetal spontaneous movement and behavioral state were quantified from video recordings from week 3 through the last week before birth. Results from prenatal quantification of Interlimb Movement Synchrony and state organization reveal guinea pig fetal development to be strikingly similar to that previously reported for other rodents and preterm human infants. Salivary cortisol readings taken before and after sonography did not differ at any observation time point. These results suggest this model holds translational promise for studying the prenatal mechanisms of neurobehavioral development, including those that may result from adverse events. Because the guinea pig is a highly social mammal with a wide range of socially oriented vocalizations, this model may also have utility for studying the prenatal origins and trajectories of developmental disabilities with social-emotional components, such as autism.

AB Fetal behavioral states are defined by fetal movement and heart rate variability (HRV). At 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) the distinction of four fetal behavioral states represented by combinations of quiet or active sleep or awakeness is possible. Prior to 32 weeks, only periods of fetal activity and quiesence can be distinguished. The increasing synchronization of fetal movement and HRV reflects the development of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) detects fetal heart activity at high temporal resolution, enabling the calculation of HRV parameters. This study combined the criteria of fetal movement with the HRV analysis to complete the criteria for fetal state detection. HRV parameters were calculated including the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal R-R interval (SDNN), the mean square of successive differences of the R-R intervals (RMSSD, SDNN/RMSSD ratio, and permutation entropy (PE) to gain information about the developing influence of the ANS within each fetal state. In this study, 55 magnetocardiograms from healthy fetuses of 24-41 weeks' GA were recorded for up to 45 min using a fetal biomagnetometer. Fetal states were classified based on HRV and movement detection. HRV parameters were calculated for each state. Before GA 32 weeks, 58.4% quiescence and 41.6% activity cycles were observed. Later, 24% quiet sleep state (1F), 65.4% active sleep state (2F), and 10.6% active awake state (4F) were observed. SDNN increased over gestation. Changes of HRV parameters between the fetal behavioral states, especially between 1F and 4F, were statistically significant. Increasing fetal activity was confirmed by a decrease in PE complexity measures. The fHRV parameters support the differentiation between states and indicate the development of autonomous nervous control of heart rate function.

AB Virgin does are indifferent to foster kits but lesions to the main or accessory olfactory systems allow them to behave "maternally" (i.e., they crouch over the litter and allow suckling). This suggests that kit-derived olfactory cues are aversive to virgins but not to lactating does. We hypothesised that the valence of such olfactory cues changes throughout gestation so that, at parturition, does are attracted to the newborn and can then show placentophagia, clean the kits and nurse them. To explore this hypothesis we exposed does to 2 nest boxes containing a variety of pup-derived vs. "neutral" odours, quantifying the number of sniffs and entrances to each box over 60 min. Virgins, confronted with 2 different types of contrasts, showed no significant differences in the number of sniffs or entrances directed at any of the 2 boxes. Pregnant rabbits sniffed the "kit-odour" box significantly more than the "neutral" one as early as gestation day 7, depending on the animals' experience with the experimental setup and kit odours as virgins. The number of sniffs declined in late pregnancy in all groups. Entrances into the "kit-odour" box were few and significantly higher than those shown towards the "neutral" box only in 1 group. Our findings agree with a correlation between a shift in the valence of kit-derived olfactory cues and the hormonal changes known to occur throughout pregnancy. The relevance of this phenomenon for the onset of maternal responsiveness at parturition is discussed.

AB There are gender differences in the upper airway function and respiratory stability in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Hormones are implicated in some gender-related differences, and these differences between men and women appear to mitigate as age increases. In addition, changes in the airway and lung function during pregnancy can contribute to snoring and OSA that might have an adverse effect on the mother and fetus. The limited data available suggest that although the prevalence and severity of OSA may be lower in women, the consequences of the disease are similar, if not worse. Women with OSA may have greater risk for hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, be more likely to develop comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression and have increased mortality. Therefore, treatment options specifically targeting female presentations and pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are expected to result in improved outcomes in women.

AB Maternal nutritional restriction has been shown to induce impairments in a number of organ systems including the ovary. We have previously shown that maternal undernutrition induces fetal growth restriction and low birth weight, and results in an offspring ovarian phenotype characteristic of premature ovarian aging with reduced ovarian reserve. In the present study, we set out to investigate the underlying mechanisms that lead offspring of undernourished mothers to premature ovarian aging. Pregnant dams were randomized to 1) a standard diet throughout pregnancy and lactation (control), 2) a calorie-restricted (50% of control) diet during pregnancy, 3) a calorie-restricted (50% of control) diet during pregnancy and lactation, or 4) a calorie-restricted (50% of control) diet during lactation alone. The present study shows that early life undernutrition-induced reduction of adult ovarian follicles may be mediated by increased ovarian endoplasmic reticulum stress in a manner that increased follicular apoptosis but not autophagy. These changes were associated with a loss of ovarian vessel density and are consistent with an accelerated ovarian aging phenotype. Whether these changes are mediated specifically by a reduction in the local antioxidant environment is unclear, although our data suggest the possibility that ovarian melatonin may play a part in early life nutritional undernutrition and impaired offspring folliculogenesis.

AB Implantation requires coordinated interactions between the conceptus and surrounding decidual cells, but the involvement of clock genes in this process is incompletely understood. Circadian oscillations are predicated on transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which balance the activities of the transcriptional activators CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and brain muscle arnt-like 1 and repressors encoded by PER (Period) and Cryptochrome genes. We show that loss of PER2 expression silences circadian oscillations in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). Downregulation occurred between 12 and 24 hours following differentiation and coincided with reduced CLOCK binding to a noncanonical E-box enhancer in the PER2 promoter. RNA sequencing revealed that premature inhibition of PER2 by small interfering RNA knockdown leads to a grossly disorganized decidual response. Gene ontology analysis highlighted a preponderance of cell cycle regulators among the 1121 genes perturbed upon PER2 knockdown. Congruently, PER2 inhibition abrogated mitotic expansion of differentiating HESCs by inducing cell cycle block at G2/M. Analysis of 70 midluteal endometrial biopsies revealed an inverse correlation between PER2 transcript levels and the number of miscarriages in women suffering reproductive failure (Spearman rank test, rho = -0.3260; P = 0.0046). Thus, PER2 synchronizes endometrial proliferation with initiation of aperiodic decidual gene expression; uncoupling of these events may cause recurrent pregnancy loss.

AB Pregnancy is accompanied by several haemodynamic, biochemical and haematological changes, which may lead to severe problems, if they are not suitably addressed. The current study highlights the haematological and biochemical differences observed in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP), in the 2nd trimester, in a north Indian population. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the body weight and body temperature of NAP compared with AP. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in haematological parameters including haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, MCH and MCHC, was observed in AP; however, MCV was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.038). Many biochemical parameters viz. potassium, albumin, total protein and calcium levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in AP, except alkaline phosphatase whose level was found significantly increased (p < 0.01). The findings of the study suggest that haematological and biochemical changes take place in anaemia during pregnancy. Further, the results obtained should be used for establishing normative values for similar populations.

AB Objectives: Every second 4.3 births occur in the world, signifying the magnitude and importance of pregnancy. This study looked at yoga interventions done from 2008 to December 2013 and examined whether yoga can be an efficacious approach for influencing maternal and birth outcomes in pregnancy.
   Design: A systematic search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Alt HealthWatch, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ACP Journal Club databases was conducted for quantitative articles of pregnancy involving all schools of yoga.
   Results: A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria: 6 from the United States, 6 from India, 2 from Taiwan, and 1 each from Korea and Thailand. Of the 15 studies, 10 showed positive changes in maternal psychological or birth outcomes.
   Conclusions: The included studies have some limitations. Nonetheless, yoga appears to be a promising intervention for pregnancy.

AB Background: Research evidence is limited regarding developmentally appropriate care. Variations exits with respect to test procedure type, infant age at testing, and test relatedness.
   Purpose: To assess developmental continuity using multiple developmental measures from birth to 12 months in a single cohort of term infants.
   Methods: A secondary analysis, longitudinal, correlational design was used to assess developmental continuity in a single cohort of infants (n = 27). Measures included: sleep, using the Motility Monitoring System (first 48 hours of life); temperament, using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (ICQ, 6 months) and the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire (RITQ, 12 months); problem-solving, using the Willatts Infant Planning Test (PS, 9 and 12 months); and the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII, 6 and 9 months).
   Results: Using Spearmen correlation, significant correlations included: (1) Sleep and ICQ: transitional sleep and "unpredictable" (r = 0.455, P = .017), "unadaptable" (r = 0.420, P = .026), and "dull" (r = 0.416, P = .028); (2) ICQ and FTII 6 months (r = -0.512, P = .008); (3) RITQ "approachability" and quiet sleep (r = 0.662, P = .005); (4) arousals in active sleep and PS at 9 months (r = -0.528, P = .016).
   Implications for Practice: Given our reported continuity between early sleep and later developmental measures, sleep-wake state should be considered in caregiving and environmental control to support sleep. Parental education on facilitating sleep-wake regulation in the home environment is essential.
   Implications for Research: These data support the existence of continuity between early sleep and later developmental milestones warranting a larger-scale investigation. Specific focus on development of care strategies for facilitating sleep immediately following birth is warranted.

AB Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestationalage infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is to determine whether sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   STUDY DESIGN: NuMoM2b is a prospective cohort study of 10,037 nulliparous women with singleton gestations that was conducted across 8 sites with a central Data Coordinating and Analysis Center. The Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy recruited 3702 women from the cohort to undergo objective, overnight in-home assessments of sleep disordered breathing. A standardized level 3 home sleep test was performed between 6(0) - 15(0) weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again between 22(0) - 31(0) weeks' gestation (visit 3). Scoring of tests was conducted by a central Sleep Reading Center. Participants and their health care providers were notified if test results met "urgent referral" criteria that were based on threshold levels of apnea hypopnea indices, oxygen saturation levels, or electrocardiogram abnormalities but were not notified of test results otherwise. The primary pregnancy outcomes to be analyzed in relation to maternal sleep disordered breathing are preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth.
   RESULTS: Objective data were obtained at visit 1 on 3261 women, which was 88.1% of the studies that were attempted and at visit 3 on 2511 women, which was 87.6% of the studies that were attempted. Basic characteristics of the substudy cohort are reported in this methods article.
   CONCLUSION: The substudy was designed to address important questions regarding the relationship of sleep- disordered breathing on the risk of preeclampsia and other outcomes of relevance to maternal and child health.

AB Circadian clocks play essential roles in the timing of events in the mammalian hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The molecular oscillator driving these rhythms has been localized to tissues of the HPO axis. It has been suggested that synchrony among these oscillators is a feature of normal reproductive function. The impact of fertility disorders on clock function and the role of the clock in the etiology of endocrine pathology remain unknown. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a particularly devastating fertility disorder, affecting 5%-10% of women at childbearing age with features including a polycystic ovary, anovulation, and elevated serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have metabolic syndrome, marked by hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. It has been suggested that developmental exposure to excess androgen contributes to the etiology of fertility disorders, including PCOS. To better define the role of the timing system in these disorders, we determined the effects of androgen-dependent developmental programming on clock gene expression in tissues of the metabolic and HPO axes. Female PERIOD2::luciferase (PER2::-LUC) mice were exposed to androgen (dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) in utero (Days 16-18 of gestation) or for 9-10 wk (DHT pellet) beginning at weaning (pubertal androgen excess [PAE]). As expected, both groups of androgen-treated mice had disrupted estrous cycles. Analysis of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants revealed that excess androgen produced circadian misalignment via tissue-dependent effects on phase distribution. In vitro treatment with DHT differentially affected the period of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants and granulosa cells, indicating that androgen has direct and tissue-specific effects on clock gene expression that may account for the effects of developmental programming on the timing system.

AB Background Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain (CWP), multiple areas of tenderness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and mood or cognitive dysfunction. Myotonia congenita (MC) is an inherited myopathic disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle chloride channel, which can infrequently manifest as generalized muscle cramps or myalgia.
   Case Report The first case was a 33-year-old woman who complained of CWP and chronic headache occurring during pregnancy, and the second case was a 37-year-old man with CWP and depression who suffered from cold-induced muscle cramps. These two patients were initially diagnosed with FMS by rheumatologists, based on CWP of longer than 3 months duration and mechanical tenderness in specific body regions. However, these two FMS patients were subsequently also diagnosed with MC.
   Conclusions These two cases are the first report of an overlap of CWP between FMS and MC.

AB Few studies have investigated the impact of alterations in gravity on mammalian transcriptomes. Here, we describe the impact of spaceflight on mammary transcriptome of late pregnant rats and the effect of hypergravity exposure on mammary, liver, and adipose transcriptomes in late pregnancy and at the onset of lactation. RNA was isolated from mammary collected on pregnancy day 20 from rats exposed to spaceflight from days 11 to 20 of gestation. To measure the impact of hypergravity on mammary, liver, and adipose transcriptomes we isolated RNA from tissues collected on P20 and lactation day 1 from rats exposed to hypergravity beginning on pregnancy day 9. Gene expression was measured with Affymetrix GeneChips. Microarray analysis of variance revealed alterations in gravity affected the expression of genes that regulate circadian clocks and activate mechanotransduction pathways. Changes in these systems may explain global gene expression changes in immune response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Expression of genes that modify chromatin structure and methylation was affected, suggesting adaptation to gravity alterations may proceed through epigenetic change. Altered gravity experiments offer insights into the role of forces omnipresent on Earth that shape genomes in heritable ways. Our study is the first to analyze the impact of alterations in gravity on transcriptomes of pregnant and lactating mammals. Findings provide insight into systems that sense gravity and the way in which they affect phenotype, as well as the possibility of sustaining life beyond Earth's orbit.

AB Objective: This study sought to characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in a large sample of women across all months of pregnancy.
   Methods: A total of 2427 women completed an Internet-based survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Berlin questionnaire, International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) question set, and a short version of the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI).
   Results: Across all months of pregnancy, women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient nighttime sleep (38%), and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent nighttime awakenings (100%), and most women took daytime naps (78%). Symptoms of insomnia (57%), sleep-disordered breathing (19%), and restless legs syndrome (24%) were commonly endorsed, with no difference across the month of pregnancy for insomnia, sleep-disorder breathing, daytime sleepiness, or fatigue. In addition, high rates of pregnancy-related symptoms were found to disturb sleep, especially frequent urination (83%) and difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position (79%).
   Conclusions: Women experience significant sleep disruption, inadequate sleep, and high rates of symptoms of sleep disorder throughout pregnancy. These results suggest that all women should be screened and treated for sleep disturbances throughout pregnancy, especially given the impact of inadequate sleep and sleep disorders on fetal, pregnancy, and postpartum outcomes.

AB Uterus circadian rhythms have been implicated in the gestation processes of mammals through entraining of the clock proteins to numerous downstream genes. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), having clock-controlled regulatory sites in their gene promoters, are expressed in the uterus during decidualization, but the regulation of the Bmp gene expression is poorly understood. The present study was designed to dissect the physiological roles of the uterus oscillators in the Bmp expression using the uterus endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) isolated from Per2-dLuc transgenic rats on day 4.5 of gestation. The in vitro decidualization of UESCs was induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate and 2-O-dibutyryl cAMP. A significant decline of Per2-dLuc bioluminescence activity was induced in decidual cells, and concomitantly, the expression of canonical clock genes was downregulated. Conversely, the expression of the core Bmp genes Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp6, and Bmp7 was upregulated. In UESCs transfected with Bmall-specific siRNA, in which Rev-erb alpha expression was downregulated, Bmp genes, such as Bmp2, Bmp4, and Bmp6 were upregulated. However, Bmp1, Bmp7, and Bmp8a were not significantly affected by Bmal1 silencing. The expression of all Bmp genes was enhanced after treatment with the REV-ERB alpha antagonist (SR8278), although their rhythmic profiles were differed from each other. The binding of REV-ERB alpha to the proximal regions of the Bmp2 and Bmp4 promoters was revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis. Collectively, these results indicate that the Bmp genes are upregulated by the attenuation of the cellular circadian clock; in particular, its core component REV-ERB alpha functions as a transcriptional silencer in the Bmp gene family.

AB Despite the potential adverse effects of maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) on physiological and behavioral aspects of offspring, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study was intended to investigate the roles of microglia on neurodevelopment and cognition in young offspring rats with prenatal sleep deprivation. Pregnant Wistar rats received 72 h sleep deprivation in the last trimester of gestation, and their prepuberty male offspring were given the intraperitoneal injection with or without minocycline. The results showed the number of Iba1(+) microglia increased, that of hippocampal neurogenesis decreased, and the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were impaired in MSD offspring. The classical microglial activation markers (M1 phenotype) IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CD68 and iNOS were increased, while the alternative microglial activation markers (M2 phenotype) Arg1, Ym1, IL-4, IL-10 and CD206 were reduced in hippocampus of MSD offspring. After minocycline administration, the MSD offspring showed improvement in MWM behaviors and increase in BrdU(+)/DCX+ cells. Minocycline reduced Iba1(+) cells, suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and reversed the reduction of M2 microglial markers in the MSD prepuberty offspring. These results indicate that dysregulation in microglial pro-and anti-inflammatory activation is involved in MSD-induced inhibition of neurogenesis and impairment of spatial learning and memory.

AB Background: Excessive sleep fragmentation (SF) is common in pregnant women. Adult-onset metabolic disorders may begin during early development and exhibit substantial sex dimorphism. We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction induced by gestational SF in male mice would not be apparent in female littermates.
   Methods: Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in male and female offspring after late gestational SF or control sleep (SC). At 20 weeks, plasma leptin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, and insulin and glucose tolerance tests were assessed. Leptin and adiponectin, M1, and M2 macrophage messenger RNA expression and polarity were examined. Adiponectin gene promoter methylation levels in several tissues were assessed.
   Results: Food intake, body weight, visceral fat mass, and insulin resistance were higher, and adiponectin levels lower in male but not female offspring exposed to gestational SF. However, dyslipidemia was apparent in both male and female offspring exposed to SF, albeit of lesser magnitude. In visceral fat, leptin messenger RNA expression was selectively increased and adiponectin expression was decreased in male offspring exposed to gestational SF, but adiponectin was increased in exposed female offspring. Differences in adipokine expression also emerged in liver, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. Increased M1 macrophage markers were present in male offspring exposed to SF (SFOM) while increased M2 markers emerged in SF in female offspring (SFOF). Similarly, significant differences emerged in the methylation patterns of adiponectin promoter in SFOM and SFOF.
   Conclusion: Gestational sleep fragmentation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in male but not in female offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Thus, sleep perturbations impose long-term detrimental effects to the fetus manifesting as sex dimorphic metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

ID APNEA SYNDROME; LATE PREGNANCY; RISK; COHORT; BIRTH; PREECLAMPSIA
AB Study Objectives: Our investigation aims to assess the impact of symptoms of maternal sleep disordered breathing, specifically sleep apnea risk and daytime sleepiness, on fetal leukocyte telomere length. Participants and
   Setting: Pregnant women were recruited upon hospital delivery admission.
   Interventions: Sleep exposure outcomes were measured using the Berlin Questionnaire to quantify sleep apnea and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure daytime sleepiness. Participants were classified as "High Risk" or "Low Risk" for sleep apnea based on responses to the Berlin, while "Normal" or "Abnormal" daytime sleepiness was determined based on responses to the Epworth.
   Design: N eonatal umbilical cord blood samples (N = 67) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated from cord blood leukocytes u sing Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical procedures were employed.
   Measurements and Results: On the Berlin, 68.7% of participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value <0.05), and the T/S ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual snorers (P value <0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.

AB Background & Aims: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is defined by pruritus, elevated total fasting serum bile salts (TBS) and transaminases, and an increased risk of adverse fetal outcome. An accurate diagnostic marker is needed. Increased serum autotaxin correlates with cholestasis-associated pruritus. We aimed at unraveling the diagnostic accuracy of autotaxin in ICP.
   Methods: Serum samples and placental tissue were collected from 44 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 105 with pruritus and/or elevated serum transaminases. Autotaxin serum levels were quantified enzymatically and by Western blotting, autotaxin gene expression by quantitative PCR.
   Results: Serum autotaxin was increased in ICP (mean +/- SD: 43.5 +/- 18.2 nmol ml(-1) min(-1), n = 55, p < 0.0001) compared to other pruritic disorders of pregnancy (16.8 +/- 6.7 nmol ml(-1) min(-1), n = 33), pre-eclampsia complicated by HELLP-syndrome (16.8 +/- 8.9 nmol ml(-1) min(-1), n = 17), and pregnant controls (19.6 +/- 5.7 nmol ml(-1) min(-1), n = 44). Longitudinal analysis during pregnancy revealed a marked rise in serum autotaxin with onset of ICP-related pruritus. Serum autotaxin was increased in women taking oral contraceptives. Increased serum autotaxin during ICP was not associated with increased autotaxin mRNA in placenta. With a cut-off value of 27.0 nmol ml(-1) min(-1), autotaxin had an excellent sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing ICP from other pruritic disorders or pre-eclampsia/HELLP-syndrome. Serum autotaxin displayed no circadian rhythm and was not influenced by food intake.
   Conclusions: Increased serum autotaxin activity represents a highly sensitive, specific and robust diagnostic marker of ICP, distinguishing ICP from other pruritic disorders of pregnancy and pregnancy-related liver diseases. Pregnancy and oral contraception increase serum autotaxin to a much lesser extent than ICP. (C) 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mother-infant bed-sharing has been associated with a higher risk of sleep-related infant deaths, which affects African Americans at a disproportionately higher rate. Although "separate but proximate sleep surfaces" for infants has been recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007-2010 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806 African Americans and 1,680 Whites (N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) and maternal education of 13-15 years (OR 2.0: 1.2-3.4) or a parts per thousand yen16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1-6.3) was associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1-1.8), breastfeeding (OR 2.5: 1.9-3.1), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2-2.3), being unmarried (OR 1.5: 1.1-2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1-2.3), and non-supine sleep (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should ask families about their infant's sleeping environment and address safety issues within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for bed-sharing.

AB BACKGROUND: Fundal growth during pregnancy can lead to unremitting discomfort and skin breakdown in patients with extensive abdominal scarring.
   CASE: A 31-year-old primigravid woman at 30 weeks of gestation presented to the department of dermatology with constant abdominal discomfort, itch, and sleep disturbance secondary to increasing tension associated with existing abdominal scars. An outpatient course of ablative fractional laser resurfacing was initiated in consultation with the dermatology department, resulting in immediate and durable symptom relief and visible abdominal expansion. No complications were observed, and the patient delivered a healthy newborn at term.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ablative fractional laser resurfacing is a minimally invasive therapeutic alternative for treating pregnant patients with symptoms related to restrictive scarring of the abdomen.

AB Background and objectiveNon-invasive techniques for measuring lung mechanics in infants are needed for a better understanding of lung growth and function, and to study the effects of prenatal factors on subsequent lung growth in healthy infants. The forced oscillation technique requires minimal cooperation from the individual but has rarely been used in infants. The study aims to assess the use of the forced oscillation technique to measure the influence of antenatal exposures on respiratory mechanics in unsedated infants enrolled in a birth cohort study in Cape Town, South Africa.
   MethodsHealthy term infants were studied at 6-10 weeks of age using the forced oscillation technique. Respiratory impedance was measured in the frequency range 8-48Hz via a face mask during natural sleep. Respiratory system resistance, compliance and inertance were calculated from the impedance spectra.
   ResultsOf 177 infants tested, successful measurements were obtained in 164 (93%). Median (25-75%) values for resistance, compliance and inertance were 50.2 (39.5-60.6) cmH(2)O.s.L-1, 0.78 (0.61-0.99) mL.cmH(2)O(-1) and 0.062 (0.050-0.086) cmH(2)O.s(2).L-1, respectively. As a group, male infants had 16% higher resistance (P=0.006) and 18% lower compliance (P=0.02) than females. Infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had a 19% lower compliance than infants not exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy (P=0.005). Neither maternal HIV infection nor ethnicity had a significant effect on respiratory mechanics.
   ConclusionsThe forced oscillation technique is sensitive enough to demonstrate the effects of tobacco smoke exposure and sex in respiratory mechanics in healthy infants. This technique will facilitate assessing perinatal influences of lung function in infancy.

AB Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is of unknown etiology and is the most common cause of retinopathy after age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. Vision loss results from fluid leakage and serail detachment in the macula. Five percent of patients develop chronic CSCR. It is predominantly found in middle-aged men (age-adjusted rates per 100,000: 9.9 for men and 1.7 for women) and is usually unilateral and reversible. Three-quarters of CSCR patients resolve within 3 months but 45% have recurrences, usually with only minor visual acuity changes. Risk factors include type A personality, emotional stress, elevated catecholamines, hypertension, pregnancy, organ transplantation, increased levels of endogenous cortisol, psychopharmacologic medication, use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, obstructive sleep apnea, Helicobacter pylori infection, or treatment with corticosteroids. Five percent of patients develop chronic disease as a result of subretinal fibrin formation within the blister. CSCR is often bilateral, multifocal, and recurrent, and may be associated with subretinal fibrin formation within the blister. Permanent loss of vision may result from subretinal fibrin-fibrosis with scarring of the macula. Corticosteroid-associated CSCR occurs bilaterally in 20% of patients. Steroid-associated therapy may begin days to years after therapy with any form of drug delivery. We present three atopic patients who presented at various times after oral, inhaled, intranasal, and topical corticosteroid therapy. One patient developed CSCR after three separate types of administration of corticosteroids, which, to our knowledge, has not been observed in the literature.

AB Few studies have investigated maternal fatigue, particularly fatigue throughout the duration of pregnancy and the postpartum period. The purpose of this study was to explore changes related to maternal fatigue from pregnancy to postpartum and the factors influencing fatigue. This prospective longitudinal study surveyed 197 pregnant women beyond 24 gestational weeks monthly until one month postpartum. The Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale and one question about fatigue were used. Women at late pregnancy experienced a significant increase in level of fatigue, which remained high after childbirth. Those who were not happy about the pregnancy or were multiparas experienced a higher level of prenatal fatigue than their counterparts. At postpartum, mothers who were unemployed, had no one to help with childcare, or felt that the baby's night-time sleep pattern was a serious problem had a higher level of fatigue. Interventions can be planned and implemented at early pregnancy to reduce the prevalence of fatigue. Encouraging pregnant women to share experiences and thoughts about pregnancy and being a mother is suggested. Further studies that evaluate culturally sensitive instruments for fatigue are needed.

AB Objectives This study aimed to evaluate occupational exposures and menstrual cycle characteristics among nurses.
   Methods Using cross-sectional data collected in 2010-2012 from 6309 nurses aged 21-45 years, we investigated nurses' menstrual function in the Nurses' Health Study 3. We used multivariable regression modeling to analyze the associations between occupational exposures and prevalence of irregular cycles and long and short cycle lengths.
   Results The cohort reported cycle length as <21 (1.5%), 21-25 (15.6%), 26-31(69.7%), and 32-50(13.2%) days. In addition, 19% of participants reported irregular cycles. Working >= 41 hours/week was associated with a 16% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4-29%] higher prevalence of irregular cycles and a higher prevalence of very short (<21-day) cycles [prevalence odds ratio (OR) 1.93,95% CI 1.24-3.01] in adjusted models. Irregular menstrual cycles were more prevalent among women working nights only (32% higher; 95% CI 15-51%) or rotating nights (27% higher, 95% CI 10-47%), and was associated with the number of night shifts per month (P for trend <0.0001). Rotating night schedule was associated with long (32-50 day) cycles (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.61). Heavy lifting was associated with a higher prevalence of irregular cycles (34% higher), and the prevalence of cycles <21 days and 21-25 day cycles increased with increasing heavy lifting at work (P for trend <0.02 for each endpoint).
   Conclusion Night work, long hours, and physically demanding work might relate to menstrual disturbances.

AB Sleep disorders are highly prevalent during late pregnancy and can impose adverse effects, such as preeclampsia and diabetes. However, the consequences of sleep fragmentation (SF) on offspring metabolism and epigenomic signatures are unclear. We report that physical activity during early life, but not later, reversed the increased body weight, altered glucose and lipid homeostasis, and increased visceral adipose tissue in offspring of mice subjected to gestational SF (SFo). The reversibility of this phenotype may reflect epigenetic mechanisms induced by SF during gestation. Accordingly, we found that the metabolic master switch Foxo1 was epigenetically misregulated in SFo livers in a temporally regulated fashion. Temporal Foxo1 analysis and its gluconeogenetic targets revealed that the epigenetic abnormalities of Foxo1 precede the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Importantly, regular physical activity early, but not later in life, reversed Foxo1 epigenetic misregulation and altered the metabolic phenotype in gestationally SF-exposed offspring. Thus, we have identified a restricted postnatal period during which lifestyle interventions may reverse the Foxo1 epigenetically mediated risk for metabolic dysfunction later in the life, as induced by gestational sleep disorders.

AB Objective: To investigate whether the expression patterns of periphery clock genes were influenced by menstrual cycle in a monkey model.
   Study design: In this preliminary study, the expression patterns of four clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1 and Per2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 6 female Macaca fascicularis in menstrual, late follicular and mid luteal phases of menstrual cycle were determined by qrt-PCR.
   Results: Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA levels were found to exhibit significant diurnal rhythms in all phases of the menstrual cycle. The expression of Cry1 mRNA was statistically rhythmic in late follicular and mid luteal phases. A main effect of menstrual cycle existed on the rhythms of Bmal1, Cry1 and Per2 expression, but not Clock expression. No significant differences were detected between menstrual phase and late follicular phase in all clock genes. Significant differences were found on the expression of Bmal1, Cry1 or Per2 mRNA between late follicular phase and mid luteal phase, when no difference existed in estrogen level, indicating the role of progesterone on biological clock gene expression. Furthermore, the peak of Small mRNA level slightly advanced in mid luteal phase compared with that in menstrual and late follicular phases.
   Conclusion: The expression patterns of clock genes in PBMCs were influenced by menstrual cycle, potentially by the change of progesterone levels, and this effect maybe correlated with early pregnancy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This longitudinal study was designed to examine objective sleep parameters of older primiparous Japanese women during the first 4 months postpartum using actigraphy. The participants were 18 older primiparae (Mean (SD)=37.06 (2.62) years, range 35-44 years) who gave birth to healthy neonates at one of three urban Japanese hospitals. Objective sleep quality was measured using actigraphy for 48h at 1, 2 and 4 months postpartum. The Friedman test was used to test for differences in sleep parameters across time. Sleep duration (SMIN) increased significantly from 2 months (Mean (M)=301.94min) to 4 months (M=372.78min). Sleep efficiency (SE) increased significantly from 1 month (73.52%) to 2 (86.66%) and 4 months (89.05%). Waking after sleep onset (WASO) decreased significantly from 1 month (M=114.64min) to 2 (M=40.18min) and 4 months (M=38.36min) and long waking episodes (LWEP) significantly decreased from 1 month (4.67) to 2 (2.69) and 4 months (3.12). Persistent postpartum sleep problems can be a sign of postpartum depression as well as health problems among infants.

AB Lumbopelvic pain is common in pregnancy but the sensitization factors underlying the condition are largely unknown. This study characterized the somatosensory profile of pregnant and nonpregnant women and the relationship between pain, hypersensitivity, and commonly used manual clinical tests. Thirty-nine pregnant and 22 nonpregnant women were included. Although lumbopelvic pain was not an inclusion criterion, the pregnant women were divided into low- and high-pain groups following data collection. The sensitivity to light brush, pin-prick, and pressure pain was assessed bilaterally at 3 sites in the lumbopelvic region, at the shoulder, and in the lower leg. Responses to the active straight leg raise test and pain provocation tests of the sacroiliac joint were recorded. Participants completed questionnaires addressing emotional and physical well-being and rated disability using the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire. Compared with controls, the high-pain group rated the active straight leg raise test as more difficult (P < .05), and both pain groups had more positive pain provocation tests (P < .05). The pregnant groups demonstrated significantly lower pressure pain thresholds at most assessment sites compared with controls (P < .05), but self-reported disability and pain were not correlated with pressure pain thresholds within pregnant participants. The high-pain group reported worse emotional health and poorer sleep quality than controls (P < .05). Perspective: This article presents the somatosensoly profile of a healthy pregnant cohort. The results indicate that pain sensitivity increases during pregnancy possibly owing to the physical changes the body undergoes during pregnancy but also owing to changes in emotional health. This should be accounted for in clinical management of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain. (C) 2015 by the American Pain Society

AB Objectives To assess the effect of prone sleeping, the major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome, in the control of blood pressure (BP) in preterm infants born across a range of gestational ages.
   Study design Daytime polysomnography was performed at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months, and 5-6 months postterm age. The participants were 21 very preterm (mean gestation 29.4 +/- 0.3 weeks), 14 preterm (mean gestation 33.1 +/- 0.3 weeks), and 17 term (mean gestation 40.1 +/- 0.3 weeks). BP was measured via a Finometer cuff (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) placed around the wrist. Data were recorded both supine and prone. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated via cross-spectral analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in BP.
   Results BRS was lower in the prone position in very preterm infants at 2-4 weeks in active sleep (P < .05). Maturation of BRS was delayed in very preterm compared with both preterm and term infants.
   Conclusions Maturation of BRS after term-equivalent age is altered in very preterm infants. Reduced BRS may result in an impaired ability of very preterm infants to respond to cardiovascular stress during infancy and may predispose them to cardiovascular disease later in life.

AB The aims of this longitudinal study were to examine (a) development of infant sleep and maternal sleep from 3 to 6 months postpartum; (b) concomitant and prospective links between maternal sleep and infant sleep; and (c) triadic links between paternal involvement in infant caregiving and maternal and infant sleep. The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months. Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.

AB The aim of the study was to examine if there was an association between use of anxiolytics and hypnotics in pregnancy and language competence in the offspring at age 3 years.
   The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) is a prospective pregnancy cohort where the mothers were asked to report on their medication use at pregnancy week 17-18, 30, and at 6 months postpartum. A woman was defined as a user of anxiolytics and hypnotics during pregnancy if she had reported use of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-related drugs during pregnancy. Children's language competence was measured at age three by maternal report on a validated language grammar scale. We used ordinal logistic regression with estimated standard errors allowing for clustering of multiple pregnancies.
   Forty-five thousand and two hundred sixty-six women with 51,748 pregnancies were included in the study. The women reported use of anxiolytics and/or hypnotics in 395 pregnancies (0.8 %). The odds ratios of being in a group with lower language competence were 1.2 (0.9-1.5) and 1.7 (1.0-2.8) for short-term and long-term anxiolytics and hypnotics use, respectively. When adjusting for SSRI use during pregnancy, the odds ratios were 1.1 (0.83-1.41) and 1.4 (0.84-2.33), respectively. Children whose mothers took no anxiolytics and hypnotics during or before pregnancy were reference group.
   The results refute any strong association between prenatal use of anxiolytics and hypnotics and lower language competence in the offspring at age 3 years.

AB To investigate the relation between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnea symptoms during pregnancy.
   A questionnaire consisting of diagnostic criteria of restless legs syndrome, demographic characteristics, personal behavior, muscle cramps during pregnancy, past medical illnesses, family history of RLS, and the major symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was administered during a face-to-face interview. Pregnant women with and without RLS were compared in terms of serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, calcium, phosphor, iron, folate, vitamin B12 levels, and obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.
   There were statistically significant differences between two groups in terms of two of the obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (witnessed apnea and fatigue) (p < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found with regard to serum calcium, magnesium, iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamin B12, phosphor, and folate levels; however, there were significant differences in terms of total iron-binding capacity.
   Increasing awareness of restless legs syndrome among obstetricians is essential as it might be related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB Adults born preterm have higher blood pressure (BP) than those born at term. Most studies have focused on preterm birth, and few have assessed BP variability, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP, measured by an oscillometric device, in 42 young adults born early preterm (<34 weeks), 72 born late preterm (34-36 weeks), and 103 controls (>= 37 weeks). Sleep was confirmed with accelerometry in 72.4% of subjects. The 24-hour systolic BP of adults born early preterm was 5.5 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3), awake systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 2.8-10.1), and sleeping systolic BP was 2.9 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval 0.3-7.5) when adjusted for age, sex, and use of accelerometry. The differences remained similar when adjusted for height, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, parental education, maternal body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus and attenuated slightly when adjusted for maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Adults born early preterm also had higher BP variability as indicated by higher individual standard deviations of systolic BP and diastolic BP. Although our results were consistent with a dose-response relationship between shorter gestation and higher BP, the difference between the late preterm and term groups was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that the higher BP in adults born early preterm is present during both waking and sleeping hours, may be more pronounced during waking hours, and is accompanied by higher individual BP variability.

ID PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; PRENATAL STRESS; MUSIC-THERAPY; SLEEP QUALITY;
   WOMEN; HEALTH; OUTCOMES; ANXIETY
AB Background: Pregnancy is a potentially stressful event. Prenatal stress alters maternal endocrine and immune systems, has been implicated in the etiology of prenatal complications or postnatal psychiatric disorders, and may adversely affect fetal health. The 30-item Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), initially developed in 1983 by Chen and colleagues, is the only measure to date designed specifically to evaluate prenatal stress.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to reconsider and revise the 30-item PSRS and validate the new PSRS.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used. Adding new items of pregnancy stress generated from clinical experience and expert recommendations resulted in a 40-item revised PSRS that was more reflective of current social conditions. Three hundred pregnant women, recruited from the antenatal clinic of a medical center in southern Taiwan, completed the revised PSRS to assess its internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and convergent and discriminate validity.
   Results: The final 36-item PSRS (PSRS36) was derived by deleting four items with relatively low item-total correlation coefficients or factor loadings. The resultant 36-item scale showed good internal consistency (alpha = .92) and 2-week test-retest reliability (r = .82). Factor analysis confirmed construct validity and suggested five prenatal stress dimensions, which explained 52.17% of the total variance. Convergent and discriminate validities were indicated by significant correlations among the PSRS36, Perceived Stress Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List.
   Conclusions: The PSRS36 is a psychometrically sound and practical tool for nurses and other healthcare providers to assess prenatal stress and to examine intervention protocols in Taiwanese prenatal women. More research is recommended to determine whether the PSRS36 may be used in other racial-ethnic groups.

DT Article

   DISRUPTION; EVENTS; RISK
AB Background: Cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are potential reproductive hazards for flight attendants.
   Methods: Flight attendants from 3 US airlines in 3 cities were interviewed for pregnancy histories and lifestyle, medical, and occupational covariates. We assessed cosmic radiation and circadian disruption from company records of 2 million individual flights. Using Cox regression models, we compared respondents (1) by levels of flight exposures and (2) to teachers from the same cities, to evaluate whether these exposures were associated with miscarriage.
   Results: Of 2654 women interviewed (2273 flight attendants and 381 teachers), 958 pregnancies among 764 women met study criteria. A hypothetical pregnant flight attendant with median first-trimester exposures flew 130 hours in 53 flight segments, crossed 34 time zones, and flew 15 hours during her home-base sleep hours (10 pm-8 am), incurring 0.13 mGy absorbed dose (0.36 mSv effective dose) of cosmic radiation. About 2% of flight attendant pregnancies were likely exposed to a solar particle event, but doses varied widely. Analyses suggested that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of miscarriage in weeks 9-13 (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.95-3.2]). Risk of a first-trimester miscarriage with 15 hours or more of flying during home-base sleep hours was increased (1.5 [1.1-2.2]), as was risk with high physical job demands (2.5 [1.5-4.2]). Miscarriage risk was not increased among flight attendants compared with teachers.
   Conclusions: Miscarriage was associated with flight attendant work during sleep hours and high physical job demands and may be associated with cosmic radiation exposure.

AB Objective: To investigate factors affecting general sleep pattern and sleep quality in pregnant women.
   Materialds and Methods: We assessed all pregnant women applied to Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Training and Research Hospital, School of Medicine, Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University between 01 January 2014 and 01 March 2014. The participants were informed prior to the study and 100 pregnant women who gave their informed consent were included in the study. Questionnaires consisting sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy history and the Epworth sleepiness scale were applied to the patients. Factors affecting general sleep pattern and sleep quality in pregnant women were compared.
   Results: The mean age of 100 pregnant women was 27.9 years (min=16, max=42). The mean gestational age of participants was found to be 24.8 weeks (min=5, max=40). In obstetric history, 9% of women previously had a stillbirth and also 25% of women previously had curettage performed. There were tobacco use in 6% of participants and 6% of patients previously had been to the hospital due to a sleep disorder. The mean excessive daytime sleepiness scale score of pregnant women were found to be 4.56. There were no significant difference among the patients regarding regular exercise (p=0.137), tobacco use (p=0.784), accompanying disease (p=0.437) and excessive daytime sleepiness scale score.
   Conclusion: In our study, patients who had a complaint of sleep disorder before and who were previously admitted to a health center for this problem, were also found to suffer from the same problem during pregnancy. Treatment of sleep disorders in preconception period for women planning pregnancy is important in terms of mother and the baby's health. Pregnant women should be informed about factors reducing sleep quality during pregnancy.

AB Background: Physical activity (PA) interventions designed to prevent prenatal complications have focused on increasing moderate PA yielding conflicting results. Minimal attention has focused on the evaluation of sleep, sedentary behavior (SB), light activity or total daily PA during pregnancy. The purpose of this prospective, longitudinal study was to 1) objectively quantify and compare habitual PA and SB during the 2nd and 3rd trimester; and 2) evaluate differences in activity patterns for women meeting prenatal PA guidelines versus those that did not.
   Methods: Forty-six participants wore 2 PA monitors (SenseWear (R) Mini and activPAL (TM)) during week 18 and week 35 of pregnancy. We compared differences in sleep duration, postural allocation, daily steps, and PA between the 2nd and 3rd trimester and for women who met and did not meet PA guidelines.
   Results: During the 2nd trimester, 30% of the women's day (24-hours) was total sleep; 52% SB; 13% light; 3% moderate; and 0% vigorous PA. Light (P = 0.05), vigorous (P = 0.02), and moderate-vigorous PA (MET-minutes; P = 0.02), decreased with a trend in increased SB (P = 0.07). Activity of other intensities and sleep duration did not significantly change. Only 39% and 37% of participants slept between 7-9 hours/night at week 18 and 35, respectively. Forty-six percent (n = 21) and 28% (n = 13) of participants met prenatal PA guidelines during the 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. At week 18, no differences in total sleep, SB, or light PA existed for women who met PA guidelines versus those who did not; total PA was significantly greater for women who met guidelines. At week 35, women that met PA guidelines had significantly less SB (P < 0.005) than women who did not.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that pregnant women spend the majority of their day in SB. Significant reductions in total activity across pregnancy may be attributed, in part to shifts in light PA and increased SB. Based on the lifestyle of our sample, regardless of meeting PA guidelines in mid-pregnancy, no significant difference exists in time spent in SB, however meeting PA recommendations in late pregnancy may reduce SB. Future interventions should target reducing SB by increasing light and moderate PA beyond volitional exercise.

AB Maternal and infant health is a global healthcare problem affecting developing and developed countries alike. Pregnancy complications increase the risk of maternal and infant death, and are associated with adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm birth. Lifestyle modifications before and during pregnancy have been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications. This paper evaluates the use of wearable sensors as an enabling technology to motivate healthier lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. Wearable sensors have been used to track health and lifestyle in general populations. Pregnancy is associated with hormonal, physiological and psychological adaptations that need to be taken into account when quantifying lifestyle, and there is to date no solution available to accurately measure lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. The main challenges lay in developing algorithms and systems capable of dealing with physiological adaptations, lifestyle adaptations, and enabling longitudinal monitoring throughout pregnancy. Addressing these challenges will open new opportunities towards an integrated and personalized approach to behavior change interventions based on sensor data. Putting such solutions in the hands of consumers will unlock a crowdsourcing approach to quantifying known risk factors, discovering new markers for pregnancy complications, and to answering some of the fundamental questions that remain around adverse outcomes such as preterm birth.

AB We established Project Viva to examine prenatal diet and other factors in relation to maternal and child health. We recruited pregnant women at their initial prenatal visit in eastern Massachusetts between 1999 and 2002. Exclusion criteria included multiple gestation, inability to answer questions in English, gestational age >= 22 weeks at recruitment and plans to move away before delivery. We completed in-person visits with mothers during pregnancy in the late first (median 9.9 weeks of gestation) and second (median 27.9 weeks) trimesters. We saw mothers and children in the hospital during the delivery admission and during infancy (median age 6.3 months), early childhood (median 3.2 years) and mid-childhood (median 7.7 years). We collected information from mothers via interviews and questionnaires, performed anthropometric and neurodevelopmental assessments and collected biosamples. We have collected additional information from medical records and from mailed questionnaires sent annually to mothers between in-person visits and to children beginning at age 9 years. From 2341 eligible women, there were 2128 live births; 1279 mother-child pairs provided data at the mid-childhood visit. Primary study outcomes include pregnancy outcomes, maternal mental and cardiometabolic health and child neurodevelopment, asthma/atopy and obesity/cardiometabolic health. Investigators interested in learning more about how to obtain Project Viva data can contact Project_Viva@hphc.org.

AB Heart disease remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in women in the United States and worldwide. This review highlights known and emerging risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in women. Traditional Framingham risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, as well as lifestyle habits such as unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle are all modifiable. Health care providers should be aware of emerging cardiac risk factors in women such as adverse pregnancy outcomes, systemic autoimmune disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and radiation-induced heart disease; psychosocial factors such as mental stress, depression, anxiety, low socioeconomic status, and work and marital stress play an important role in IHD in women. Appropriate recognition and management of an array of risk factors is imperative given the growing burden of IHD and need to deliver cost-effective, quality care for women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Objective Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that maternal Mallampati class (MC), as a marker for OSA, is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.
   Study Design We performed a retrospective secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of term births (>= 37 weeks). Fetal anomalies and aneuploidy were excluded. Primary outcome was small for gestational age (SGA). Secondary outcomes included preeclampsia, neonatal cord arterial blood gas pH < 7.10 and < 7.05, base excess < - 8 and < - 12 mEq/L. Outcomes were compared between mothers with low MC airways and high MC airways using logistic regression.
   Results A total of 1,823 women met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were found in the risk of SGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.9, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.6-1.2), preeclampsia (aOR 1.2, 95% Cl 0.8-1.9) or neonatal acidemia (aOR 0.8, 95% Cl 0.3-2.0), between high and low MC.
   Conclusion High MC is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with adverse fetal outcomes in some studies. Second trimester Down syndrome screening markers reflect fetal and fetoplacental wellbeing. We aimed to compare markers of fetal and feto-placental wellbeing in women with OSA and low risk controls.
   Methods: A retrospective case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and available second trimester markers was performed. Controls were screened for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) at the time of delivery using a questionnaire. Women at low risk for OSA were selected. Marker levels were adjusted for gestational age and race and reported as multiples of median and later adjusted for body mass index (BMI).
   Results: Twenty-four OSA cases and 166 controls were identified. Women with OSA had a higher mean BMI when compared to controls (37.1 +/- 12.7 versus 24.1 +/- 5.1, p = 0.03). Estriol (uE3) multiples of the median (MoM) levels were lower in women with OSA compared to controls, even after adjusting for BMI, 0.74 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.45) versus 1.06 (IQR 0.38), respectively, p = 0.026. Once adjusted for BMI, alpha feto-protein (AFP) MoM levels were no longer significantly different in women with OSA compared to controls.
   Conclusion: OSA is associated with reduced serum uE3 levels, independently of BMI, possibly indicating fetal distress.

AB Objective: Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular complications and preterm delivery (PTD). Insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations and increased inflammation, both known to contribute to placental abruption (abruption), a determinant of PTD. We examined associations of abruption with sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion.
   Methods: The study included 164 abruption cases and 160 controls in a multicenter study in Peru. Data on habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (<= 6, 7-8 and >= 9 h); and frequency of feeling exhausted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
   Results: Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased odds of abruption. The ORs of abruption in relation to short (<= 6 h) and long (>= 9 h) sleep duration were 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-4.1), compared with normal sleep duration (7-8 h). Complaints of vital exhaustion were also associated with abruption (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.46-3.85), and were independent of sleep duration.
   Conclusion: We extend the existing literature and support the thesis that maternal sleep habits and disorders should be assessed among pregnant women.

AB Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rodent pups are analogous to cries in human babies. There is reduction in USVs in pups after experimental deprivation of rapid eye movement sleep of dams during pregnancy. However, the effects of total sleep deprivation on the USVs of newborns and their emotional development are not documented. Male pups born to the rats that underwent total sleep deprivation for 5 h during the third trimester made higher vocalizations, when tested on early postnatal days (pnds) in an isolation-paradigm. Their anxiety-related behaviors during pnds 25-28, were tested using elevated plus maze (EPM). In comparison to the control pups, weanlings of sleep-deprived dams made increased entries into the open arms and higher mobility in the EPM. Enhanced distress calls during early pnds and reduction in risk assessment in weanlings indicate a link between the two behaviors. The USVs during ontogeny may provide early signals about altered emotional development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the accuracy of a neck-worn device in measuring sleep/wake, detecting supine airway position, and using loud snoring to screen for obstructive sleep apnea. Study A included 20 subjects who wore the neck-device during polysomnography (PSG), with 31 records obtained from diagnostic and split-night studies. Study B included 24 community-based snorers studied in-home for up to three-nights with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity measured with a validated Level III recorder. The accuracy of neck actigraphy-based sleep/wake was measured by assessing sleep efficiency (SE). Differences in sleep position measured at the chest and neck during PSG were compared to video-editing. Loud snoring acquired with an acoustic microphone was compared to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by- and acrosspositions. Over-reported SE by neck actigraphy was inversely related to OSA severity. Measurement of neck and chest supine position were highly correlated with video-edits (r = 0.93, 0.78). Chest was bias toward over-estimating supine time while the majority of neck-device supine position errors occurred during CPAP titrations. Snoring was highly correlated with the overall, supine, and non-supine PSG-AHI (r = 0.79, 0.74, 0.83) and was both sensitive and specific in detecting overall, supine, and non-supine PSGAHI > 10 (sensitivity = 81, 88, 82 %; specificity = 87, 79, 100 %). At home sleep testing-AHI > 10, the sensitivity and specificity of loud snoring was superior when users were predominantly non-supine as compared to baseline (sensitivity = 100, 92 %; specificity = 88, 77 %). Neck actigraphy appears capable of estimating sleep/wake. The accuracy of supine airway detection with the neck-device warrants further investigation. Measurement of loud snoring appears to provide a screening tool for differentiating positional apneic and benign snorers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify potentially modifiable risk factors for late-pregnancy stillbirth.
   METHODS: This was a population-based matched case-control study of pregnant women at 32 weeks of gestation or greater booked into tertiary maternity hospitals in metropolitan Sydney between January 2006 and December 2011. The case group consisted of women with singleton pregnancies with antepartum fetal death in utero. Women in the control group were matched for booking hospital and expected delivery date with women in the case group. Data collection was performed using a semistructured interview and included validated questionnaires for specific risk factors. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for a priori-specified risk factors using conditional logistic regression.
   RESULTS: There were 103 women in the case group and 192 women in the control group. Mean gestation was 36 weeks. Supine sleeping was reported by 10 of 103 (9.7%) of women who experienced late-pregnancy stillbirth and by 4 of 192 (2.1%) of women in the control group (adjusted OR 6.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-34). Women who experienced stillbirth were more likely to: have been followed during pregnancy for suspected fetal growth restriction, 11.7% compared with 1.6% (adjusted OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.36-22.5); not be in paid work, 25.2% compared with 9.4% (adjusted OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.6); and to have not received further education beyond high school, 41.7% compared with 25.5% (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5). None of the deaths to women who reported supine sleeping were classified as unexplained.
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests that supine sleep position may be an additional risk for late-pregnancy stillbirth in an already compromised fetus. The clinical management of suspected fetal growth restriction should be investigated further as a means of reducing late stillbirth.

AB Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age-related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post-partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post-partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well-being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi-factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well-being.

AB The mammalian circadian system develops gradually during ontogenesis, and after birth, the system is already set to a phase of the mothers. The role of maternal melatonin in the entrainment of fetal circadian clocks has been suggested, but direct evidence is lacking. In our study, intact or pinealectomized pregnant rats were exposed to constant light (LL) throughout pregnancy to suppress the endogenous melatonin and behavioral rhythms. During the last 5 days of gestation, the rats were injected with melatonin or vehicle or were left untreated. After delivery, daily expression profiles of c-fos and Avp in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and Per1, Per2, Rev-erb, and Bmal1 in the liver were measured in 1-day-old pups. Due to the LL exposure, no gene expression rhythms were detected in the SCN of untreated pregnant rats or in the SCN and liver of the pups. The administration of melatonin to pregnant rats entrained the pups' gene expression profiles in the SCN, but not in the liver. Melatonin did not affect the maternal behavior during pregnancy. Vehicle injections also synchronized the gene expression in the SCN but not in the liver. Melatonin and vehicle entrained the gene expression profiles to different phases, demonstrating that the effect of melatonin was apparently not due to the treatment procedure per se. The data demonstrate that in pregnant rats with suppressed endogenous melatonin levels, pharmacological doses of melatonin affect the fetal clock in the SCN but not in the liver.

AB We consider the joint modelling, analysis and prediction of a longitudinal binary process and a discrete time-to-event outcome. We consider data from a prospective pregnancy study, which provides day level information regarding the behaviour of couples attempting to conceive. Reproductive epidemiologists are particularly interested in developing a model for individualized predictions of time to pregnancy (TTP). A couple's intercourse behaviour should be an integral part of such a model and is one of the main focuses of the paper. In our motivating data, the intercourse observations are a long series of binary data with a periodic probability of success and the amount of available intercourse data is a function of both the menstrual cycle length and TTP. Moreover, these variables are dependent and observed on different, and nested, timescales (TTP is measured in menstrual cycles whereas intercourse is measured on days within a menstrual cycle) further complicating its analysis. Here, we propose a semiparametric shared parameter model for the joint modelling of the binary longitudinal data (intercourse behaviour) and the discrete survival outcome (TTP). Further, we develop couple-based dynamic predictions for the intercourse profiles, which in turn are used to assess the risk for subfertility (i.e. TTP longer than six menstrual cycles).

AB Background: Previous research has established a number of risk factors that are associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms.
   Methods: This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum.
   Results: We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. Limitations.: Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms.
   Conclusions: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Sleep deprivation in women resulting from their modem lifestyle, especially during pregnancy, is a serious concern as it can affect the health of the newborn. Anxiety disorders and cognitive deficits in the offspring are also on the rise. However, experimental studies on the effects of sleep loss during pregnancy, on emotional development and cognitive function of the newborn, are scanty in literature. In the current study, female rats were sleep-deprived for 5 h by gentle handling, during the 6 days of the third trimester (days 14-19 of pregnancy). The effects of this sleep deprivation on anxiety-related behaviors of pups during their pen-adolescence age were studied using elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to body weights of dams and offspring, the maternal behavior was also monitored. The weanlings of sleep-deprived dams showed heightened risk-taking behavior as they made increased explorations into the open arms of EPM. They also showed higher mobility in comparison to the control group. Though the body weights of sleep-deprived dams were comparable to those of the control group, their newborns had lower birth weight. Nevertheless, these pups gained weight and reached the control group values during the initial post-natal week. But after weaning, their rate of growth was lower than that of the control group. This is the first report providing evidences for the role of sleep during late pregnancy in shaping the neuropsychological development in offspring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Child birth educators assist expectant parents in many ways. They teach about pregnancy, the birthing process and are resources for the decision making that is part of planning for a new baby. Bed-sharing is among the "hot-topics" for today's young families. Controversy abounds for this issue. Although some professional associations have taken a stand against the practice, actual research has been inconclusive on whether it is harmful or beneficial to children. It is important that child birth educators are informed on the issue so that they may effectively discuss the pros and cons and help parents reach satisfying conclusions.

AB In this work, the effects of different sleeping positions on cardiac output and cardiac activity are evaluated and a healthier sleeping position is recommended. Using different data acquisition units, the electrical bio-impedance based stroke volume is calculated in four different sleeping positions and hence cardiac output is evaluated. In addition, blood perfusion is measured by laser Doppler flowmetry technique in different sleeping positions to evaluate cardiac activity using frequency domain analysis. The stroke volume and hence the cardiac output is found maximum in soldier position for all subjects. Frequency domain analysis is also used to evaluate and compare cardiac activity with cardiac output in four different sleeping positions. Fast Fourier transform and power spectral density analysis show that the cardiac activity is highest at soldier position for most of the subjects. In addition, left sleeping position shows lowest cardiac output and cardiac activity. Since low blood perfusion and blood ejection is harmful for heart as well as human health, soldier sleeping position is highly recommended for all except the person with sleep disorders.

AB This study investigated the effects of elevated sleeping postures on cardiac functions by analyzing electrical bio-impedance and skin blood perfusion in case of normal human subjects. Using different data acquisition units, the electrical bio-impedance based stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated in different elevated sleeping postures. Skin blood perfusion was measured also by laser Doppler flowmetry technique in all elevations to evaluate cardiac activity using frequency domain analysis. At first, data recordings were performed in supine sleeping (0 degrees elevation) then sleeping elevations were changed sequentially from 0 degrees to 15 degrees, 15 degrees to 30 degrees and 30 degrees to 45 degrees. Data were recorded in all mentioned sleeping elevations for every subject. In most of the subjects, the parameters of cardiac functions were found highest in supine sleeping. When sleeping elevations were changed the cardiac functions were also changed in some significant level. Among all elevations except 0 degrees, most significant improvements in cardiac functions were observed in 30 degrees elevation only. It was highly recommended to sleep with an elevation around 30 degrees to get best cardiac functions for those subjects only who prefer to sleep in elevation rather than supine.

AB Objective: Opioid exposure during pregnancy is a potential risk factor for the developing central nervous system of the fetus. We studied evoked responses in buprenorphine-exposed newborns who displayed neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) to elucidate the possible alterations in functioning of the somatosensory and auditory systems.
   Methods: We compared somatosensory (SEFs) and auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs), recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG), of 11 prenatally buprenorphine-exposed newborns with those of 12 healthy newborns. Peak latencies, source strength and location of SEFs or AEFs were recorded.
   Results: AEFs were present in all buprenorphine-exposed newborns without significant differences from those of healthy newborns. In contrast, though no group level differences in SEFs existed, at individual level the response deviated from the typical neonatal morphology in four buprenorphine-exposed newborns.
   Conclusions: Although buprenorphine exposure during pregnancy does not seem to cause constant deficiencies in somatosensory or auditory processing, in some newborns the typical development of somatosensory networks may be - at least transiently-disrupted.

AB Objective: Our first aim was to investigate the effects of caffeine on preterm infants' respiratory functions and brain cortical activity (conventional and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (cEEG and aEEG)). Secondary aim was to study its long-term effects on respiratory system and electroencephalographic maturation by 36 weeks post-menstrual age.
   Methods: Prospective observational study on 33 consecutively admitted preterm infants less than 34-weeks-gestation. cEEG and aEEG, cardiopulmonary and sleep state were recorded in 20 preterm infants, before, during and 2-hours after intravenous (IV) caffeine (caffeine Group), and for 13 preterms (control group). Both groups were subjected to assessment of cerebral cortical maturation by cEEG and aEEG at 36-weeks post-menstrual age as an outcome measure.
   Results: IV caffeine administration significantly increased heart rate (p = 0.000), mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.000), capillary oxygen saturation (p = 0.003), arousability (p = 0.000) and aEEG continuity (p = 0.002) after half an hour. No clinical seizures were recorded and nonsignificant difference was found in electrographic seizures activity in cEEG. At 36-weeks post-conceptional age, NICU stay was significantly longer in controls (p = 0.022). aEEG score was significantly higher in caffeine group than the control group, (p = 0.000).
   Conclusions: Caffeine increases preterm infants' cerebral cortical activity during infusion and results in cerebral cortical maturation at 36 weeks, without increase in seizure activity.

ID SMOKING
AB Objective: To investigate the risk and protective factors related to premature ovarian failure (POF).
   Methods: A total of 168 patients with POF in Funing County Hospital of TCM were selected as POF group, and another 42 POF-free patients served as control group at the same term. The patients in both groups were inquired in details by investigators in the form of questionnaire, and the relevant risk questionnaires for POF and A-type behavior scale were filled. The risk and protective factors related to POF were analyzed after database was established via input of qualified raw data into 2007 Excel Table.
   Results: The incidence of POF in patients at the age of 35-40 was dramatically higher than those at the age of 17-24, 25-29 and 30-34, and there existed statistical significance (P< 0.01). No significant difference was presented between two groups in terms of age of menarche, menstrual cycle, menstrual period, dysmenorrhea and active smoking (P> 0.05), but there was statistical significance by comparison to gravidity, times of artificial abortion, history of mumps, history of ovarian surgery, passive smoking, physical exercise, intake of bean products, sleep quality, A-type character and self-felt much stress (P< 0.05). Multi-factor Logistic regression analysis further revealed that artificial abortion, history of mumps, passive smoking, poor sleep quality and A-type character were all independent risk factors for POF (OR= 5.555, 3.906, 4.031, 3.723, 5.912), and physical exercise belonged to the protective factor for POF (OR= 0.102).
   Conclusion: Artificial abortion, history of mumps, passive smoking, poor sleep quality and A-type character pertain to risk factors for POF, and physical exercise to the protective factor for POF.

AB Objective: To assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and related factors at the end of pregnancy using the Berlin questionnaire.
   Methods: A total of 367 women at the end of pregnancy (median gestational age 39 weeks) were interviewed with the Berlin questionnaire and a general survey containing maternal socio-demographic and anthropometric information. Neonatal outcome data were also assessed.
   Results: Median age for the whole sample was 31 years. According to the Berlin questionnaire, 39.8% were positive for high risk of OSAHS. Upon bivariate analysis, higher risk of OSAHS was significantly related to church attendance, and higher pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), current BMI, weight, neck and arm circumference and systolic blood pressure at survey. Logistic regression analysis found that higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (OR 2.71 95% CI 1.84-4.00, p < 0.0001) and higher maternal weight at survey (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.78-5.17, p < 0.0001) were significantly related to a higher risk of OSAHS.
   Conclusion: The risk of OSAHS is relatively high at the end of pregnancy and related to a higher pre-pregnancy BMI and higher maternal weight at survey. Further studies are needed to confirm our results with a diagnostic tool, such as polysomnography or another similar yet less complicated to carry out procedure.

AB Background
   More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The two conditions may occur separately or together (low-back and pelvic pain) and typically increase with advancing pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep.
   Objectives
   To update the evidence assessing the effects of any intervention used to prevent and treat low-back pain, pelvic pain or both during pregnancy.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (to 19 January 2015), and the Cochrane Back Review Groups' (to 19 January 2015) Trials Registers, identified relevant studies and reviews and checked their reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment, or combination of treatments, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of low-back pain, pelvic pain or both, related functional disability, sick leave and adverse effects during pregnancy.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.
   Main results
   We included 34 RCTs examining 5121 pregnant women, aged 16 to 45 years and, when reported, from 12 to 38 weeks' gestation. Fifteen RCTs examined women with low-back pain (participants = 1847); six examined pelvic pain (participants = 889); and 13 examined women with both low-back and pelvic pain (participants = 2385). Two studies also investigated low-back pain prevention and four, low-back and pelvic pain prevention. Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to clinicians' interpretation of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and, unless noted, were compared with usual prenatal care. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, raising concerns about the confidence we could put in the estimates of effect.
   For low-back pain
   Results from meta-analyses provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, inconsistency) that any land-based exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to -0.25; participants = 645; studies = seven) and functional disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; participants = 146; studies = two). Low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) also suggested no significant differences in the number of women reporting low-back pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, versus usual prenatal care (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17; participants = 374; studies = two).
   For pelvic pain
   Results from a meta-analysis provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) of no significant difference in the number of women reporting pelvic pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, and usual prenatal care (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; participants = 374; studies = two).
   For low-back and pelvic pain
   Results from meta-analyses provided moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations) that: an eight-to 12-week exercise program reduced the number of women who reported low-back and pelvic pain (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; participants = 1176; studies = four); land-based exercise, in a variety of formats, significantly reduced low-back and pelvic pain-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; participants = 1062; studies = two).
   The results from a number of individual studies, incorporating various other interventions, could not be pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. There was moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations or imprecision) from individual studies suggesting that osteomanipulative therapy significantly reduced low-back pain and functional disability, and acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improved pelvic painmore than usual prenatal care. Evidence from individual studies was largely of low quality (study design limitations, imprecision), and suggested that pain and functional disability, but not sick leave, were significantly reduced following a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) for low-back and pelvic pain.
   When reported, adverse effects were minor and transient.

   There is low-quality evidence that exercise (any exercise on land or in water), may reduce pregnancy-related low-back pain and moderate-to low-quality evidence suggesting that any exercise improves functional disability and reduces sick leave more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from single studies suggests that acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improves pregnancy-related pelvic pain, and osteomanipulative therapy or a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) may also be of benefit.
   Clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling of results in many cases. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in all but three meta-analyses, which did not improve following sensitivity analyses. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.
   Further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and change the estimates. Studies would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to their presenting symptoms, so that treatment can be tailored accordingly.

AB Study Objectives: To assess whether daytime naps negatively impact nocturnal sleep. Design: Longitudinal, prospective cohort design.
   Participants: 161 pregnant women recruited and evaluated in early gestation (10-20 weeks).
   Measurements and Results: Daily sleep information was collected in three 2-week periods (10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation) with a daily sleep diary and an actigraph. The average number of naps, as well as the average length of each nap, were calculated from sleep diaries. Women were categorized first as non nappers (0 naps/2-week period), moderate nappers (1-3 naps/2-week period), or frequent nappers (>= 4 naps/2-week period). Then, based on the average nap length, they were categorized as short (< 90 min) or long (>= 90 min) nappers. Nocturnal sleep parameters included SOL, WASO, SE, and TST. SAS procedure MIXED was used for modeling the main effects of nap group and time, and time by nap group interactions. Women who took naps had a decrease in diary-assessed nocturnal TST, but not actigraphy-assessed TST. This observation was group-and time-specific. There were no other group differences. Women who napped >= 90 min had poorer diary-assessed SE and lower diary-assessed TST than those who took shorter naps. Length of nap was not associated with any other sleep measures.
   Conclusions: The number of daytime naps have minimal impact on nocturnal sleep parameters; however, long nappers did exhibit modestly impaired sleep continuity and sleep quality. Overall, we propose that daytime naps provide a beneficial countermeasure to the sleep disruption commonly reported by pregnant women. This may be clinically beneficial given that sleep continuity and quality are important correlates of pregnancy outcomes.

   DEPRESSION; DISTURBED SLEEP; PRETERM BIRTH; MENTAL-HEALTH
AB Study Objectives: Although a substantial number of pregnant women report symptoms of insomnia, few studies have used a validated instrument to determine the prevalence in early gestation. Identification of insomnia in pregnancy is vital given the strong connection between insomnia and the incidence of depression, cardiovascular disease, or immune dysregulation. The goal of this paper is to provide additional psychometric evaluation and validation of the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ) and to establish prevalence rates of insomnia among a cohort of pregnant women during early gestation.
   Methods: The ISQ was evaluated in 143 pregnant women at 12 weeks gestation. The internal consistency and criterion validity of the dichotomized ISQ were compared to traditional measures of sleep from sleep diaries, actigraphy, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using indices of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR) tests.
   Results: The ISQ identified 12.6% of the sample as meeting a case definition of insomnia, consistent with established diagnostic criteria. Good reliability was established with Cronbach alpha = 0.86. The ISQ had high specificity (most > 85%), but sensitivity, PPV, NPV, and LRs varied according to which sleep measure was used as the validating criterion.
   Conclusions: Insomnia is a health problem for many pregnant women at all stages in pregnancy. These data support the validity and reliability of the ISQ to identify insomnia in pregnant women. The ISQ is a short and cost-effective tool that can be quickly employed in large observational studies or in clinical practice where perinatal women are seen.

AB Study Objectives: We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among pregnant Peruvian women.
   Methods: A cohort of 642 women were interviewed at <= 16 weeks of gestation. During interview, we ascertained information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment scales, respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used.
   Results: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep medication. We observed significantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42), the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had significantly increased odds of experiencing stress-induced sleep disturbance (odds ratio, OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.40, 5.31), depression (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 3.58, 8.37), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.57; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.76).
   Conclusions: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three, factor-specific scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.

AB Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a burdensome sensorimotor disorder that has been linked to diabetes and obesity. However, the relationship of RLS to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common pregnancy complication strongly associated with obesity and a harbinger of diabetes, remains unknown. In this study, we examined the association of RLS to history of GDM in a sample of older female primary care patients.
   Methods: Participants were community-dwelling women aged >= 40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia adult primary care patients. Data gathered included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, reproductive history, sleep patterns, and medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or had missing data on key variables were excluded from the analyses.
   Results: Of the 498 participants included in the final analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms at least once/week). After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, body mass index, diabetes and other comorbid conditions, parity, and other factors, those reporting history of GDM were almost three times as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3, 5.3). This association increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS symptoms >= 3x/week = 4.8, CI 2.1, 11.2, p for trend = 0.004).
   Conclusions: History of GDM was strongly and positively related to RLS in this study of older female primary care patients, offering further support for a possible role of metabolic dysregulation in RLS development.

AB Objectives To explore associations between features of sleep during pregnancy and adverse outcomes for the infant.
   Setting E Moe, Mm is a cohort study in Aotearoa/New Zealand that investigates self-reported sleep and maternal health in late pregnancy and the postpartum period.
   Participants Women (N=633; 194 Maori) reported detailed information on their sleep duration, quality, disturbances, disorders (snoring, breathing pauses, twitching legs, restless legs) and daytime sleepiness between 35 and 37weeks gestation.
   Outcome measures Birthweight and fetal distress during labour were extracted from medical records. Associations between each sleep variable and small or large for gestational age (SGA/LGA) using customised birthweight centile or fetal distress were estimated using multinomial/logistic regression, controlling for potential confounders. Secondary analyses considered differences in associations between Maori and non-Maori women.
   Results There was some indication that breathing pauses (a measure of sleep apnoea) were associated with both SGA (OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 9.0, p=0.08) and LGA (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 5.7, p=0.20), with the association for LGA being stronger when only pregnancy-onset breathing pauses were considered (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 9.6, p=0.01). There was also some evidence that pregnancy-onset leg twitching (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 10.0, p=0.03) and frequent sleep disturbance due to feeling too hot or too cold (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.6, p=0.13) were associated with higher risk of fetal distress. Other sleep measures, including snoring, were not associated with SGA, LGA or fetal distress. Many of the associations we observed were considerably stronger in Maori compared with non-Maori women.
   Conclusions We did not find evidence of previously reported associations between snoring and SGA. Our findings tentatively suggest that self-reported breathing pauses and leg twitching in late pregnancy are associated with infant outcomes, and highlight ethnic inequalities.

AB This article examines the ways in which the genealogical model is mobilized, challenged and/or reinforced in imaginaries related to the possibility of medically assisting the extension of female fertility and the making of older mothers. By focusing on public discourses on egg donation and egg freezing procedures, it shows firstly how oocytes may become active and visible elements in the production of genetic continuity in the female line, in contrast with genealogical thinking based on the importance of the male line. Secondly, it identifies two ambivalent figures, 'the grandmother mother' and the 'radiant forties mother', revealing the anxieties and hope associated with the extension of female fertility. It results from the analysis that gender and age are two crucial components of the genealogical model that need to be studied together when it comes to the extension of fertility time.

AB Background
   Overweight and obesity (body mass index (BMI) >= 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2) and BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), respectively are increasingly common among women of reproductive age. Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of women.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (including those using a cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25 kg/m2. Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular woman.
   Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems, customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions.
   Data collection and analysis
   We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently excluded.
   Main results
   There are no included trials.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be made. Further research is required in this area.

AB Introduction: Pathological features of disease appear to be quite different. Despite this diversity, the common feature of various disorders underlies physicochemical and biochemical factors such as surface tension. Human biological fluids comprise various proteins and phospholipids which are capable of adsorption at fluid interfaces and play a vital role in the physiological function of human organs. Surface tension of body fluids correlates directly to the development of pathological states.
   Methods: In this review, the variety of human diseases mediated by the surface tension changes of biological phenomena and the failure of biological fluids to remain in their native state are discussed.
   Results: Dynamic surface tension measurements of human biological fluids depend on various parameters such as sex, age and changes during pregnancy or certain disease. It is expected that studies of surface tension behavior of human biological fluids will provide additional information and might become useful in medical practice. Theoretical background on surface tension measurement and surface tension values of reference fluids obtained from healthy and sick patients are depicted.
   Conclusion: It is well accepted that no single biomarker will be effective in clinical diagnosis. The surface tension measurement combined with routine lab tests may be a novel non-invasive method which can not only facilitate the discovery of diagnostic models for various diseases and its severity, but also be a useful tool for monitoring treatment efficacy. We therefore expect that studies of surface tension behavior of human biological fluids will provide additional useful information in medical practice.

   Study; Etiopathogenesis
AB It is accepted by everyone that Ayurveda is an ancient most literature in medical world. In the early period of Samhita the traces of survey can be seen mainly aiming to the prevention of people suffering from various diseases. Survey is the way by which one can present the classical facts and directives in more practical manner to the current society. Upapluta Yonivyapad is one of the 20 Yonivyapad described by Acharyas. On the basis of the textual description Upapluta Yonivyapad can be compared to vulvovaginitis during pregnancy. Here, Survey study was aimed to elicit etiopathogenesis and prevalence of Upapluta Yonivyapad in and around Jamnagar city. The Study was conducted on 200 pregnant women attending the OPD of SRPT Dept. (I.P.G.T. & R.A.), Jamnagar, of whom 100% cooperated to give vaginal smear samples to microbiology laboratory. Organisms like gram negative bacteria and yeast were found in (92.5%) and (17.5%) of cases respectively. Etiological factors like Vishamashana in (49%) of cases, Divaswapa (day sleep) in (74.5%), excessive intake of Madhura Rasa in (68.5%) and Ati-Vyavaya (Excessive coitus) in (58%) were observed. Survey questionnaire shows that certain dietary and life style factors contribute towards occurrence of Upapluta Yonivyapad in maximum i.e. 56.5% of patients.

DT Review

   TRIAL; SYMPTOMS; WEIGHT; SLEEP; LABOR
AB Background
   Leg cramps are a common problem in pregnancy. Various interventions have been used to treat them, including drug, electrolyte and vitamin therapies, and non-drug therapies.
   Objectives
   To assess the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating leg cramps in pregnancy.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Register (31 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention (drug, electrolyte, vitamin or non-drug therapies) for treatment of leg cramps in pregnancy compared with placebo, no treatment or other treatment. Quinine was excluded for its known adverse effects (teratogenicity). Cluster-RCTS were considered for inclusion. Quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.
   Main results
   We included six studies (390 women). Four trials compared oral magnesium with placebo/no treatment, two compared oral calcium with no treatment, one compared oral vitamin B versus no treatment, and one compared oral calcium with oral vitamin C. Two of the trials were well-conducted and reported, the other four had design limitations. The process of random allocation was sub-optimal in three studies, and blinding was not attempted in two. Outcomes were reported in different ways, precluding the use of meta-analysis and limiting the strength of our conclusions.
   The 'no treatment' group in one four-arm trial has been used as the comparison group for the composite outcome (intensity and frequency of leg cramps) in magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B versus no treatment. This gives it disproportionate weight in the overall analysis, thus interpretation of these results should be cautious.
   Oral magnesium versus placebo/no treatment
   Magnesium (taken orally for two to four weeks) did not consistently reduce the frequency of leg cramps compared with placebo or no treatment. Outcomes that showed differences were: frequency of leg cramps after treatment: never, and twice a week (risk ratio (RR) 5.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 23.68, one trial, 69 women, evidence graded low; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80, one trial, 69 women), and frequency of leg cramps: 50% reduction in number of leg cramps after treatment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.86, one trial, 86 women, evidence graded low). The outcomes that showed no difference were: frequency of leg cramps during two weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) 1.80, 95% CI -1.32 to 4.92, one trial, 38 women, evidence graded low); frequency of leg cramps after treatment: daily, every other day, and once a week (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.21, one trial, 69 women; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.57, one trial, 69 women; RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.87, one trial, 69 women).
   Evidence about whether magnesium supplements reduced the intensity of pain was inconclusive, with two studies showing that it may slightly reduce pain, while one showed no difference. There were no differences in the experience of side effects (including nausea, flatulence, diarrhoea and intestinal air) between pregnant women receiving magnesium compared with placebo/no treatment.
   Oral calcium versus no treatment
   A greater proportion of women receiving calcium supplements experienced no leg cramps after treatment than those receiving no treatment (frequency of leg cramps after treatment: never RR 8.59, 95% CI 1.19 to 62.07, one study, 43 women, evidence graded very low). There was no difference between groups for a composite outcome (intensity and frequency) for partial improvement (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15, one trial, 42 women); however, the same trial showed a greater proportion of women experiencing no leg cramps after treatment with calcium compared with no treatment (RR 5.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 21.86).
   Other secondary outcomes, including side effects, were not reported.
   Oral vitamin B versus no treatment
   Frequency of leg cramps was not reported in the one included trial. According to a composite outcome (frequency and intensity), more women receiving vitamin B fully recovered compared with those receiving no treatment (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.95 to 28.81). Those women receiving no treatment were more likely to experience a partial improvement in the intensity and frequency of leg cramps than those taking vitamin B (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73, one trial, 42 women), or to see no change in their condition. However, these results are based on one small study with design limitations. Other secondary outcomes, including side effects, were not reported.
   Oral calcium versus oral vitamin C
   There was no difference in the frequency of leg cramps after treatment with calcium versus vitamin C (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.38, one study, 60 women, evidence graded very low). Other outcomes, includingside effects, were not reported.
   Authors' conclusions
   It is unclear from the evidence reviewed whether any of the interventions (oral magnesium, oral calcium, oral vitamin B or oral vitamin C) provide an effective treatment for leg cramps. This is primarily due to outcomes being measured and reported in different, incomparable ways, and design limitations compromising the quality of the evidence (the level of evidence was graded low or very low). This was mainly due to poor study design and trials being too small to address the question satisfactorily.
   Adverse outcomes were not reported, other than side effects for magnesium versus placebo/no treatment. It is therefore not possible to assess the safety of these interventions.
   The inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes, meant that data could not be pooled, meta-analyses could not be carried out, and comparisons between studies are difficult.
   The review only identified trials of oral interventions (magnesium, calcium, vitamin B or vitamin C) to treat leg cramps in pregnancy. None of the trials considered non-drug therapies, for example, muscle stretching, massage, relaxation, heat therapy, and dorsiflexion of the foot. This limits the completeness and applicability of the evidence.
   Standardised measures for assessing the frequency, intensity and duration of leg cramps to be used in large well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to answer this question. Trials of non-drug therapies are also needed.

AB Background: At prevalence rates of up to 40%, rates of depression and anxiety among women with medically complex pregnancies are 3 times greater than those in community-based samples of pregnant women. However, mental health care is not a component of routine hospital-based antenatal care for medically high-risk pregnant women.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the hospital-based implementation of a Web-based integrated mental health intervention comprising psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for antenatal inpatients.
   Methods: This study is a quasi-experimental design. Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they are (1) < 37 weeks gestation, (2) admitted to the antenatal inpatient unit for > 72 hours, (3) able to speak and read English or be willing to use a translation service to assist with completion of the questionnaires and intervention, (4) able to complete follow-up email questionnaires, (5) > 16 years of age, and (6) not actively suicidal. Women admitted to the unit for induction (eg, <72-hour length of stay) are excluded. A minimum sample of 54 women will be recruited from the antenatal high-risk unit of a large, urban tertiary care hospital. All women will complete a Web-based psychosocial assessment and 6 Web-based CBT modules. Results of the psychosocial assessment will be used by a Web-based clinical decision support system to generate a clinical risk score and clinician prompts to provide recommendations for the best treatment and referral options. The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence at 3-months postpartum; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment and 3-months postpartum. Qualitative interviews with 10-15 health care providers and 15-30 women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.
   Results: The study was funded in September, 2014 and ethics was approved in November, 2014. Subject recruitment will begin January, 2015 and results are expected in December, 2015. Results of this study will determine (1) the effectiveness of an integrated Web-based prenatal mental health intervention on maternal and infant outcomes and (2) the feasibility of implementation of the intervention on a high-risk antenatal unit.
   Conclusions: This study will provide evidence and guidance regarding the implementation of a Web-based mental health program into routine hospital-based care for women with medically high-risk pregnancies.

AB Background: The impact of growth restriction on perinatal morbidity is well known, but electroencephalographic (EEG) data on its influence are still scarce. Objectives: We aimed to analyze the influence of being born small for gestational age (SGA; defined as a birth weight < 10th percentile) on the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) score in the first 2 weeks of life in preterm infants born before 30 weeks of gestation, and its impact on later outcome. Methods: aEEG data obtained within the first 2 weeks of life on preterm infants born SGA and before 30 weeks of gestational age (GA) were analyzed retrospectively using a combined score [including background activity, occurrence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC) and suspected seizure activity]. Neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated at 24 months by means of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and a standardized neurological examination. Results: One hundred and thirty-six patients were included (47 SGA and 89 controls). Infants with SGA had abnormal aEEG scores significantly more often (57 vs.24%, p = 0.002) than infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). They also displayed SWC less frequently (65 vs. 96%, p = 0.001), were more likely to develop seizure activity (15 vs. 4%, p = 0.013) and had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at the age of 2 years less frequently (36.2 vs. 59.6%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Preterm infants born SGA and before 30 weeks of GA had less optimal scores on early aEEG and a poorer neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months than the AGA controls. (C) 2015 S.

TI Strategies to increase the ownership and use of insecticide-treated

AB Background
   Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease and 40% of the world's population lives in areas affected by malaria. Insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) effectively prevent malaria, however, barriers to their use have been identified.
   Objectives
   To assess the evidence on the effectiveness of available strategies that focus on delivery and appropriate use of ITNs.
   Search methods
   We searched the EPOC Register of Studies, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthStar, CINAHL, PubMed, Science Citation Index, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, African Index Medicus (AIM), World Health Organization Library and Information Networks for Knowledge
   (WHOLIS), LILACS, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and the World Health Organization Library Information System (WHOLIS). Initial searches were conducted in May 2011, updated in March 2012 and February 2013. Authors contacted organizations and individuals involved in ITN distribution programs or research to identify current initiatives, studies or unpublished data, and searched reference lists of relevant reviews and studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series evaluating interventions focused on increasing ITN ownership and use were considered. The populations of interest were individuals in malariaendemic areas.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently screened studies to be included. They extracted data from the selected studies and assessed the risk of bias. When consensus was not reached, any disagreements were discussed with a third author. The magnitude of effect and quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed.
   Main results
   Of the 3032 records identified, 10 studies were included in this review.
   Effect of ITN cost on ownership:
   Four studies including 4566 households and another study comprising 424 participants evaluated the effect of ITN price on ownership. These studies suggest that providing free ITNs probably increases ITN ownership when compared to subsidized ITNs or ITNs offered at full market price.
   Effect of ITN Cost on appropriate use of ITNs:
   Three studies including 9968 households and another study comprising 259 individuals found that there is probably little or no difference in the use of ITNs when they are provided free, compared to providing subsidized ITNs or ITNs offered at full market price.
   Education:
   Five studies, including 12,637 households, assessed educational interventions regarding ITN use and concluded that education may increase the number of adults and children using ITNs (sleeping under ITNs) compared to no education.
   One study, including 519 households, assessed the effects of providing an incentive (an undisclosed prize) to promote ITN ownership and use, and found that incentives probably lead to little or no difference in ownership or use of ITNs, compared to not receiving an incentive.
   None of the included studies reported on adverse effects.
   Authors' conclusions
   Five studies examined the effect of price on ITN ownership and found moderate-certainty evidence that ownership was highest among the groups who received the ITN free versus those who purchased the ITN at any cost. In economic terms, this means that demand for ITNs is elastic with regard to price. However, once the ITN is supplied, the price paid for the ITN probably has little to no effect on its use; the four studies addressing this outcome failed to confirm the hypothesis that people who purchase nets will use them more than those who receive them at no cost. Educational interventions for promoting ITN use have an additional positive effect. However, the impact of different types or intensities of education is unknown.

ID RISK-FACTORS; PELVIC PAIN; PREVALENCE; INTENSITY; THERAPY
AB OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the self-reported prevalence and impact of low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy in primiparous and multiparous women, and their treatment-seeking rationales and experiences, including their use of physiotherapy.
   METHODS: A sample of 105 post-partum women was recruited. All participants answered a questionnaire; women who experienced LBP during pregnancy (n = 71) continue in the study and later they were also interviewed. Content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data.
   RESULTS: Reports of LBP were common (n = 71; 67.6%) and slightly more frequent in primiparous (n = 40; 56.3%) than multiparous (n = 31; 43.7%) women. Multiparous women with LBP were significantly older (p < 0.001) and reported more sleep disturbances (p = 0.026) than primiparous women with LBP. LBP prevented women performing their daily activities (n = 41; 57.7%) and worsened with the advance of pregnancy (n = 55; 77.5%), yet 93.0% (n = 66) of these women received no treatment.
   CONCLUSION: LBP is a prevalent and important clinical condition affecting the daily life of many pregnant women. Nevertheless, few women seek any treatment and physiotherapy is rarely considered. Given the significant impact on quality of life, health professionals need to be proactive in asking women about LBP.

AB Study Objectives: Evaluation of Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires in detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) across trimesters of pregnancy.
   Methods: Pregnant women from a high-risk pregnancy clinic were recruited to complete sleep evaluations including Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires. Overnight testing with Watch-PAT200 for diagnosis of OSA (cutoff point of apnea-hypopnea index >= 5 events/h) was performed.
   Results: Seventy-two singleton pregnant women participated in the study. Enrollment consisted of 23, 24, and 25 women during first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Of 72 pregnancies, 23 patients (31.9%) had OSA. Prevalence of OSA classified by trimesters from first to third was 30.4%, 33.33%, and 32.0%, respectively. Overall predictive values of Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires were fair (ROC area under curve, AUC 0.72 for Berlin, p = 0.003; 0.75 for Stop-Bang, p = 0.001). When categorized according to trimesters, predictive values substantially improved in second (AUC: 0.84 for Berlin; 0.78 for Stop-Bang) and third trimesters (AUC: 0.81 for Berlin; 0.75 for Stop-Bang), whereas performances of both questionnaires during first trimester were poorer (AUC: 0.49 for Berlin; 0.71 for Stop-Bang). Multivariate analyses show that pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) in first trimester, snore often in second trimester, and weight gain and pregnancy BMI in third trimester were significantly associated with OSA.
   Conclusions: In high-risk pregnancy, Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires were of limited usefulness in the first trimester. However their predictive values are acceptable as pregnancy progresses, particularly in second trimester. OSA in pregnancy seems to be a dynamic process with different predictors association during each trimester.

AB Background: About 79% of the pregnant women experience sleep disorders and 70% of pregnant women experience some symptoms of the depression. Physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes of pregnancy can predispose mothers to depression these disorders before, during, and after childbirth and might be aggravated by neglecting health behavior. Health behavior education might be useful for the management of depression in pregnant women.
   Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sleep health behavioral education on the improvement of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders.
   Patients and Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial, performed on 96 pregnant women with sleep disorder diagnosed according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Tools for data collection included demographic questionnaire and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Easy and accessible sampling was done. Participants were randomly (simple) allocated to intervention and control groups. In intervention group, sleep health behavior education was presented during a four-hour session held in weeks 22, 23, 24, and 25; then the patients were followed up to fill out the BDIQ in follow-up session at weeks 29 and 33 of pregnancy. The control group received no intervention and only received routine prenatal care. The results were assessed by Chi-square tests, independent-samples t-test, and Fischer's exact-test by SPSS 16.
   Results: A statistically significant change was reported in the severity of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders in the intervention group in comparison to the control group at weeks 29 (P < 0.000) and 33 (P < 0.00).
   Conclusions: Sleep health behavioral education improves depression in pregnant women who are experiencing insomnia. Findings from this study add support to the reported effectiveness of sleep health behavioral education in the prenatal care and clinical management of insomnia in pregnancy.

AB There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n = 9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n = 9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n = 9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 26.0 +/- 1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033 +/- 412 vs. 5,261 +/- 238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

This is significant for the periodic production and ejection of milk, but the activation of other areas of the brain has not been explored. Here, we hypothesised that daily suckling would induce a rhythm in the preoptic area, lateral septum, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which are important areas for the expression of maternal behavior in mammals, including the rabbit. To this end, we analysed PER1 expression in those areas through a complete 24-h cycle at lactation day 7. Does were scheduled to nurse during either the day at 10:00h [zeitgeber time (ZT)03] or the night at 02:00h (ZT19). Non-pregnant, non-lactating females were used as controls. In contrast to control females, lactating does showed a clear, significant rhythm of PER1 that shifted in parallel with the timing of nursing in the preoptic area and lateral septum. We determined that the maximal expression of PER1 at 8h after scheduled nursing decreased significantly at 24 and 48h after the absence of suckling. This effect was more pronounced in the lateral septum than in the preoptic area. We conclude that daily suckling is a powerful stimulus inducing rhythmic activity in brain structures in the rabbit that appear to form part of a maternal entrainable circuit.

TI Patient Characteristics Associated with Pregnancy Ambivalence

   STRESS; WOMEN
AB Background: The objective of our study was to determine demographic characteristics, health and sexual behaviors, and psychological health associated with pregnancy ambivalence. We used a cross-sectional design for our study.
   Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August 2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent females.
   Results: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger (p=0.03), had fewer children living at home (p<0.01), and were less likely to have been previously pregnant (p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more likely to smoke (p<0.01), sleep poorly (p=0.02), have had more sexual partners in the past month (p<0.01) and in their lifetime (p=0.01), not used contraception at last sex (p=0.01), be a victim of violence (p=0.01), and have experienced pregnancy coercion (p<0.01). In addition, these women exhibited higher scores on scales measuring depressive symptoms (p=0.01) and perceived stress (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive education through contraceptive counseling.

AB Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns. Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newbornswith a birth weight <= 1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomes were severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a low-voltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death. Conclusion: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with severe neurological lesions/death.

AB Aims: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with placenta-mediated adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed at comparing placenta-secreted proteins, such as first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers which have been linked to preeclampsia, and markers of angiogenesis in pregnant women with OSA, and pregnant controls at low risk for OSA.
   Methods: A case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and controls at low risk for OSA was performed. Levels of first and second trimester markers were reported as multiple of median (MoM), and adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Stored samples were tested for markers of angiogenesis and adjusted for gestational age, BMI, and chronic hypertension.
   Results: A total of 24 women with OSA and 166 controls had screening markers. BMI was higher in cases compared to controls, P = 0.01. MoM levels of placenta associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were significantly lower in cases versus controls, even after adjusting for BMI (0.52 IQR 0.48 vs. 1.01 IQR 0.63, P = 0.009). The ratio of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 to placental growth factor was significantly higher in cases than controls, even after adjusting for confounders (4.42 IQR 2.52 vs. 2.93 IQR 2.01, P = 0.009).
   Conclusion: Circulating placenta-secreted glycoproteins and markers of angiogenesis are altered in pregnant women with OSA.

AB BackgroundThe burden of childhood respiratory illness is large in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Infant lung function (ILF) testing may provide useful information about lung growth and susceptibility to respiratory disease. However, ILF has not been widely available in LMICs settings where the greatest burden of childhood respiratory disease occurs.
   AimTo implement and evaluate a pilot study of ILF testing in a semi-rural setting in South Africa.
   MethodInfant lung function testing was established at a community hospital in South Africa. All measures were done in unsedated infants during sleep. Measurements, made with the infant quietly breathing through a face mask and bacterial filter, included tidal breathing (TBFVL), exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), and sulphur hexafluoride multiple breath washout (MBW) measures using an ultrasonic flow meter and chemoluminescent NO analyzer.
   ResultsTwenty infants, mean age of 7.7 (SD 2.9) weeks were tested; 8 (40%) were Black African and 12 (60%) were mixed race. Five (25%) infants were preterm. There were 19 (95%) successful TBFVL and NO tests and 18 (90%) successful MBW tests. The mean tidal volume was 30.5ml (SD 5.9), respiratory rate 50.2 breaths per minute (SD 8.7), and eNO 10.4 ppb (SD 7.3). The mean MBW measures were: functional residual capacity 71ml (SD 13) and the lung clearance index 7.6 (SD 0.5). The intra-subject coefficient of variations (CV) of lung function measures were similar to published normative data for Caucasian European infants.
   ConclusionIn this study we demonstrate that unsedated infant lung function measures of tidal breathing, MBW, and eNO are feasible in a semi-rural African setting with rates comparable to those reported from high income countries.

AB Objective: This study investigated the prospective relationships between mental health symptoms (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and body mass index (BMI) in women with and without excessive weight gain during pregnancy. The secondary aim was to examine whether mental health symptoms and BMI were predictive of one another. Two models were tested: the first depicted depressive or anxiety symptoms predicting BMI, and the second model depicted BMI predicting depressive or anxiety symptoms.
   Design and participants: Women completed questionnaires at three time points throughout pregnancy, which comprised of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and self-reported weight Height and weight were also reported retrospectively at T1 to calculate pre-pregancy BMI category. To calculate total gestational weight gain (GWG), pre-pregnancy weight was substracted from weight at 36 weeks gestation.
   Methods: 183 women were tracked during pregnancy; Time (T)1 (mean-16.50 weeks of gestation, SD=.92), T2 (mean-24.40 weeks of gestation, SD=.92), and T3 (mean=32.61 weeks gestation, SD=.88). The sample was divided into those for whom weight gain exceeded the guidelines for GWG (excessive gestational weight gain; EGWG), and those who for whom it did not. Multigroup path analyses compared the longitudinal relationships between depressive or anxiety symptoms and BMI during pregnancy for women with and without EGWG.
   Findings: BMI did not predict depressive or anxiety symptoms. Depressive symptoms at T1, did however predict higher BMI at T2 for women without EGWC. Anxiety symptoms and BMI were not related, regardless of GWG status.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that depressive symptoms may precede increased BMI during pregnancy in women who do not gain weight excessively. There may be longitudinal relationships between depressive symptoms and BMI during pregnancy; hovvever, further research is required to identify the mechanisms that link these health outcomes and inform the focus of intervention design.

AB Background
   Heartburn is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in pregnant women. It can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy. The symptoms of heartburn in pregnancy may be frequent, severe and distressing, but serious complications are rare. Many interventions have been used for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. These interventions include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications. However, there has been no evidence-based recommendation for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of interventions for relieving heartburn in pregnancy.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (2 March 2015), Asian & Oceanic Congress of Obstetrics & Gynaecology (AOCOG) conference proceedings (20-23 October 2013, Centara Grand & Bangkok Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand), and reference lists of retrieved studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy compared with another intervention, or placebo, or no intervention. Cluster-RCTs would have been eligible for inclusion but none were identified. We excluded studies available as abstracts only and those using a cross-over design.
   Interventions could include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications (such as antacids, sucralfate, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)).
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.
   Main results
   We included nine RCTs involving 725 women. However, five trials did not contribute data. Four trials involving 358 women contributed data. Trials were generally at mixed risk of bias. We only identified data for three comparisons: pharmaceutical treatment versus placebo or no treatment; acupuncture versus no treatment and pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle changes.
   Pharmaceutical treatment compared with placebo or no treatment
   Two trials evaluated any pharmaceutical treatment compared with placebo or no treatment. One trial examined a treatment rarely used nowadays (intramuscular prostigmine 0.5 mg versus placebo). One trial evaluated the effect of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide plus simethicone liquid and tablet compared with placebo. For the primary outcome of this review (relief of heartburn), women who received pharmaceutical treatment reported complete heartburn relief more often than women receiving no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.50 in two RCTs of 256 women, I-2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Data on partial relief of heartburn were heterogenous and showed no clear difference (average RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.76 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no clear difference in the rate of side effects between the pharmaceutical treatment group and the placebo/no treatment group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.89 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence).
   Pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle choices
   One study compared 1 g of sucralfate with advice on dietary and lifestyle choices in treating heartburn. More women in the sucralfate group experienced complete relief of heartburn compared to women who received advice on diet and lifestyle choices (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.07; participants = 65; studies = one). The only secondary outcome of interest addressed by this trial was side effects. The evidence was not clear on intervention side effects rate between the two groups (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.07 to 41.21; participants = 66; studies = one). There was only one instance of side effects in the pharmacological group.
   Acupuncture compared with no treatment
   One trial evaluated acupuncture compared with no treatment but did not report data relating to this review's primary outcome (relief of heartburn). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no difference in the rate of side effects between women who had acupuncture and women who had no treatment (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.11 to 55.89 in one RCT of 36 women). With regard to quality of life, women who had acupuncture reported improved ability to sleep (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.14 to 6.86) and eat (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18 in one RCT of 36 women).
   The following secondary outcomes were not reported upon in any of the trials included in the review: miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight.
   Authors' conclusions
   There are no large-scale RCTs to assess heartburn relief in pregnancy. This review of nine small studies (which involved data from only four small studies) indicates that there are limited data suggesting that heartburn in pregnancy could be completely relieved by pharmaceutical treatment. Three outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence from two trials for the outcome of complete relief of heartburn was assessed as of moderate quality. Evidence for the outcomes of partial heartburn relief and side effects was graded to be of very low quality. Downgrading decisions were based in part on the small size of the trials and on heterogenous and imprecise results.
   There are insufficient data to assess acupuncture versus no treatment and no data to assess other comparisons (miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight).
   Further RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also address other medications such as histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and a raft-forming alginate reflux suppressant in treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. More research is needed on acupuncture and other complimentary therapies as treatments for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also evaluate any adverse outcomes, maternal satisfaction with treatment and measure pregnant women's quality of life in relation to the intervention.

TI Analogs of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in the treatment of
   endometriosis
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOMETRIOSIS AND PELVIC PAIN DISORDERS
LA English
DT Review
DE Endometriosis; Medical treatment; LHRH agonist; LHRH antagonist
AB Agonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) induce a reversible hypoestrogenic state through the down-regulation of LHRH receptors and desensitization of the pituitary. Since endometrial implants are estrogen sensitive, LHRH agonists have frequently been used for medical treatment of endometriosis. Nowadays, LHRH agonists can be considered in general as a second-line medical treatment for endometriosis-related symptoms, as oral therapy with dienogest is as effective and has fewer side effects. However, therapy with LHRH agonists for 3-6 months prior to in vitro fertilization remains the treatment of choice in patients with endometriosis, as it significantly increases pregnancy rates.
   LHRH agonists are used prior to surgery and as an adjuvant after an operation to prevent recurrence or prolong disease-free intervals. Adverse effects of LHRH agonists are due to hypoestrogenism and include hot flushes, vaginal dryness, loss of libido, sleep disturbances and a diminished bone density which limits the duration of their administration to 6 months. For long-term treatment, add-back of estrogen and/or progestin,/or progestin only with or without bisphosphonates, can be used, but existing studies only cover a 12-month period of treatment. LHRH antagonists competitively block the pituitary receptors for LHRH. Consequently, a partial pharmacological hypophysectomy with a reduction of the estrogen levels to a desired level is possible if LHRH antagonists are adequately dosed. As endometriotic implants require relatively high levels of estrogen, partially lower plasma levels of estrogens are sufficient to prevent the loss of bone density. A long-term treatment without add-back therapy is also possible.

DE DEPRESSION; SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC LUPUS
AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder that occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, immunologic abnormalities being a prominent feature of the disease. Psychiatric disorders frequently coexist, depression being the most common mood disorder in neuropsychiatric lupus. This literature review was performed through searching MEDLINE database for full-text English-language articles -original research, systematic review and updates published in the last five years (2010-2015), using the keywords "depression and systemic lupus erythematosus". The main outcomes identified were prevalence and predictors of depression in various cultural and ethnic groups, depression-related clinical issues (suicidal ideation, cognitive impairment, altered body image, sleep and sexual disturbances, influence of SLE treatment), and influence on quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach that takes into account the polymorphism and individual variability of the SLE clinical manifestations helps to improve early detection of depression, which is responsible for the increased risk of comorbidities, suicidal attempts, decreased treatment adherence, and impaired quality of life. Physicians across all specialties involved in the care for lupus patients should be aware of the major prevalence of this condition, while helping patients to cope with their disabling disease.

TI Immunonutrition: methodology and applications
SO NUTRICION HOSPITALARIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Diet; Food; Food habits; Health; Lifestyles; Nutrients
AB Immunonutrition is an emergent and interdisciplinary subject, since it comprises several aspects related to Nutrition, Immunity, Infection, Inflammation, and Injury or tissue damage, what is known as Nutrition and 4 "Is". Within these interactions the endocrine, nervous and immune systems are involved, microbiota being a part of the last one. Nowadays, gut microbiota has been shown to play an essential role, not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also into the nervous system, because of its bilateral connection.
   There are several methods to study Immunonutrition, which allow measuring different immunological biomarkers to provide information about the nutritional status. However, it should be taken into account that there is not a single gold standard parameter to evaluate the cause-effect relationship between nutrition and the immune system. On the contrary, a combination of biomarkers have to be assessed depending on the different nutritional situations.
   Since Immunonutrition is a multidisciplinary matter as mentioned above, the study on the interactions between nutrition and the immune system has not been exclusively focused as such, but bearing in mind other systems of the organisms as well as a wide range of confounding factors and determinants coming from idiosyncratic features, genes and lifestyle of each individual.
   Therefore, Immunonutrition allows to study the following research fields: 1) Evaluation of nutritional status in presumably healthy people with risk of malnutrition (children, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, elderly, and sportspeople); 2) Assessment of the evolution and progress of patients with nutrition and immune-related diseases, such as food allergies, eating and metabolic disorders; 3) Evaluation of the effects of nutrients, bioactive compounds and both conventional and functional foods on the immune system; 4) Evaluation of impact of lifestyle determinants on the immune system, such as diet, food behaviour, physical activity, sedentariness, sleep quality and quantity, and as a key factor, stress.

TI Circadian System and Melatonin Hormone: Risk Factors for Complications
   during Pregnancy
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Review
AB Pregnancy is a complex and well-regulated temporal event in which several steps are finely orchestrated including implantation, decidualization, placentation, and partum and any temporary alteration has serious effects on fetal and maternal health. Interestingly, alterations of circadian rhythms (i.e., shiftwork) have been correlated with increased risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia. In the last few years evidence is accumulating that the placenta may have a functional circadian system and express the clock genes Bmal1, Per1-2, and Clock. On the other hand, there is evidence that the human placenta synthesizes melatonin, hormone involved in the regulation of the circadian system in other tissues. Moreover, is unknown the role of this local production ofmelatonin and whether this production have a circadian pattern. Available information indicates that melatonin induces in placenta the expression of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, prevents the injury produced by oxidative stress, and inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a gene that in other tissues is controlled by clock genes. In this review we aim to analyze available information regarding clock genes and clock genes controlled genes such as VEGF and the possible role of melatonin synthesis in the placenta.

TI Accuracy of Self-Reported Sleep Position in Late Pregnancy
SO PLOS ONE

ID INTRAUTERINE RESUSCITATION; MATERNAL SLEEP; DURATION; WOMEN; RISK;
   STILLBIRTH; DISORDERS; QUALITY; LABOR
AB Background: There is emerging research to suggest that supine maternal sleep position in late pregnancy may adversely affect fetal wellbeing. However, these studies have all been based on maternal report of sleeping position. Before recommendations to change sleep position can be made it is important to determine the validity of these studies by investigating how accurate pregnant women are in reporting their sleep position. If avoiding the supine sleeping position reduces risk of poor pregnancy outcome, it is also important to know how well women can comply with the instruction to avoid this position and sleep on their left.
   Method: Thirty women in late pregnancy participated in a three-night observational study and were asked to report their sleeping position. This was compared to sleep position as recorded by a night capable video recording. The participants were instructed to settle to sleep on their left side and if they woke overnight to settle back to sleep on their left.
   Results: There was a moderate correlation between reported and video-determined left-side sleep time (r = 0.48), mean difference = 3 min (SD = 3.5 h). Participants spent an average of 59.60% (SD = 16.73%) of time in bed on their left side (ICC across multiple nights = 0.67). Those who included left side among their typical sleep positions reported significantly longer sleep during the study (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: On average participant reports of sleep position were relatively accurate but there were large individual differences in reporting accuracy and in objectively-determined time on left side. Night-to-night consistency was substantial. For those who do not ordinarily sleep on that side, asking participants to sleep on their left may result in reduced sleep duration. This is an important consideration during a sleep-critical time such as late pregnancy.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether poor sleep quality of third-trimester pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression.
   Material/Methods: Third-trimester pregnant women (T0, n = 293) were tested using the first socio-demographic, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale assessments, and received a diagnosis of depression. Three months (T1, n = 223) after delivery, scale filling was finished and the structured interview was performed again.
   Results: We found that 73 persons (32.7%) were low income, 84 persons (37.7%) were middle-income, and 66 persons (29.6%) were higher income. The overall prevalence of postpartum depression was 9.4% (21 persons). After controlling for other factors, age, household income, marital satisfaction, and sleep quality were significantly related to postpartum depression, in which age and sleep quality scores (a higher score was associated with poorer sleep quality) were positively related to postpartum depression, and household income and marital satisfaction were negatively related to postpartum depression. Moreover, third-trimester sleep quality score was positively related to postpartum depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Poor third-trimester subjective sleep quality is a risk factor for postpartum depression.

AB Background: Poor sleep contributes to the developmental problems seen in preterm infants. We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6 months of post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with that of full-term infants.
   Methods: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time, all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7 days. Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and objective measures of sleep.
   Results: The sleep problems indicated in the subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: "the nocturnal sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing" had significant correlations with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of premature infants with AHI > 1 event/ hour as indicated by the questionnaire.
   Conclusion: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants, including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ).

TI Embryo transfers between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice: Examination of a

AB Genetic factors influence fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) in both humans and animals. Experiments using inbred and selectively bred mouse stocks that controlled for (1) ethanol dose, (2) maternal and fetal blood ethanol levels, and (3) fetal developmental exposure stage, show genotype can affect teratogenic outcome. Other experiments distinguish the teratogenic effects mediated by maternal genotype from those mediated by fetal genotype. One technique to distinguish maternal versus fetal genotype effect is to utilize embryo transfers. This study is the first to examine ethanol teratogenesis fetal weight deficits and mortality, and digit, kidney, and vertebral malformations - in C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) fetuses that were transferred as blastocysts into B6 and D2 dams. We hypothesized that, following maternal alcohol exposure, B6 and D2 fetuses gestating within B6 mothers, as compared to D2 mothers, will exhibit a higher frequency of malformations. On day 9 of pregnancy, females were intubated (IG) with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or maltose-dextrin (MD). Other females were mated within strain and treated with either ethanol or maltose, or were not exposed to either treatment. Implantation rates were affected by genotype. Results show more B6 embryos implanted into D2 females than B6 females (p < 0.05; 47% vs. 23%, respectively). There was no difference in the percentage of D2 embryos implanting into B6 and D2 females (14 and 16%, respectfully). Litter mortality averaged 24% across all experimental groups. Overall, in utero ethanol exposure reduced mean litter weight compared to maltose treatment (E = 1.01 g; MD = 1.19 g; p < 0.05); but maltose exposed litters with transferred embryos weighed more than similarly treated natural litters (1.30 g vs. 1.11 g; p < 0.05). Approximately 50% of all ethanol exposed B6 fetuses exhibited some malformation (digit, vertebral, and/or kidney) regardless of whether they were transferred into a B6 or D2 female, or were naturally conceived. This suggests the D2 maternal uterine environment did not offer any protection against ethanol teratogenesis for B6 fetuses. One of the questions remaining is the how the B6 uterine environment affects D2 teratogenesis. No definitive conclusions can be drawn because too few viable D2 litters were produced.

   PERIOD; PREGNANCY; SCALE; CHILDBIRTH; PREDICTORS
AB Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common illness, but due to the underlying processes and the diversity of symptoms, some variability is exhibited. The risk of postpartum depression is great if the mother has previously suffered from depression, but there is some evidence that a certain subgroup of women only experience depression during the postpartum period.
   Methods: The study group consisted of 104 mothers with postpartum major depression and a control group of 104 postpartum mothers without depression. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was used for data collection. The severity of depression and other mental symptoms were assessed using several validated rating scales.
   Results: A history of past depression (82%), including depression during pregnancy (42%) and during the postpartum period (53%), was very common in those with current PPD. Eighteen per cent of mothers with current PPD had previously not had any depressive episodes and four per cent had experienced depression only during the postpartum period. Therefore, pure PPD was rare. The onset of PPD was usually (84%) within six weeks of childbirth. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, depressed mood, diminished pleasure/ interest, decreased energy, and psychomotor agitation/retardation were common with all kinds of depression histories. Pure PPD was the most similar to the first depressive episode. Nevertheless, the severity of depression, the level of hopelessness, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation were lower, appetite changed less, and concentration was better than in other recurrent depressions.
   Conclusions: According to this study, PPD is not a homogenous disorder. The time of onset, severity, symptoms, level of hopelessness, and the course of depression vary. Recurrent depression is common. All mothers must be screened during the sixth week postpartum at the latest. Screening alone is not effective; it is also important to give mothers information about PPD and to discuss the symptoms with them in order for them to recognise this disorder and possible new episodes in the future.

AB Objective: Government funders of biomedical research are under increasing pressure to demonstrate societal benefits of their investments. A number of published studies attempted to correlate research funding levels with the societal burden for various diseases, with mixed results. We examined whether research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is well aligned with current and projected veterans' health needs. The organizational structure of the VA makes it a particularly suitable setting for examining these questions.
   Methods: We used the publication patterns and dollar expenditures of VA-funded researchers to characterize the VA research portfolio by disease. We used health care utilization data from the VA for the same diseases to define veterans' health needs. We then measured the level of correlation between the two and identified disease groups that were under-or over-represented in the research portfolio relative to disease expenditures. Finally, we used historic health care utilization trends combined with demographic projections to identify diseases and conditions that are increasing in costs and/or patient volume and consequently represent potential targets for future research investments.
   Results: We found a significant correlation between research volume/expenditures and health utilization. Some disease groups were slightly under- or over-represented, but these deviations were relatively small. Diseases and conditions with the increasing utilization trend at the VA included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hearing loss, sleeping disorders, complications of pregnancy, and several mental disorders.
   Conclusions: Research investments at the VA are well aligned with veteran health needs. The VA can continue to meet these needs by supporting research on the diseases and conditions with a growing number of patients, costs of care, or both. Our approach can be used by other funders of disease research to characterize their portfolios and to plan research investments.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea has been shown to increase intracranial pressure, and to be a secondary cause of intracranial hypertension. There are a few theories that attempt to explain this relationship, however there is little data, and even less recognition among physicians that this actually occurs. This paper discusses multiple pieces of data, from anatomical correlates to biochemical information involving neuroexcitotoxicity, as well as hematologic factors and issues surrounding brain edema and blood brain barrier dysfunction. A complex paradigm for how obstructive sleep apnea may lead to increased intracranial pressure is thus proposed. In addition, suggestions are made for how obstructive sleep apnea must as a result be managed differently in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In most species, self sustained molecular clocks regulate 24-h rhythms of behavior and physiology. In mammals, a circadian pacemaker residing in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives photic signals from the retina and synchronizes subordinate clocks in non-SCN tissues. The emergence of circadian rhythmicity during development has been extensively studied for many years. In mice, neuronal development in the presumptive SCN region of the embryonic hypothalamus occurs on days 12-15 of gestation lntra-SCN circuits differentiate during the following days and retinal projections reach the SCN, and thus mediate photic entrainment, only after birth. In contrast the genetic components of the clock gene machinery are expressed much earlier and during rnidgestation SCN explants and isolated neurons are capable of generating molecular oscillations in culture. In ovo metabolic rhythms in the SCN, however, are observed not earlier than the 19th day of rat gestation, and rhythmic expression of clock genes is hardly detectable until after birth. Together these data indicate that cellular coupling and, thus, tissue wide synchronization of single cell rhythms, may only develop very late during embryogenesis. In this mini review we describe the developmental origin of the SCN structure and summarize our current knowledge about the functional Initiation and entrainment of the circadian pacemaker during embryonic development.

AB Background: Mutual circadian rhythm is an early and essential component in the development of maternal-infant physiological synchrony.
   Aims: The aim of this to examine the longitudinal pattern of maternal-infant circadian rhythm and rhythm synchrony as measured by rhythm parameters.
   Study design: In-home dyadic actigraphy monitoring at infant age 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
   Subjects: Forty-three healthy mother-infant pairs.
   Outcome measures: Circadian parameters derived from cosinor and non-parametric analysis including mesor, magnitude, acrophase, L5 and M10 midpoints (midpoint of lowest 5 and highest 10 h of activity), amplitude, interdaily stability (IS), and intradaily variability (IV).
   Results: Mothers experienced early disruption of circadian rhythm, with re-establishment of rhythm over time. Significant time effects were noted in increasing maternal magnitude, amplitude, and IS and decreasing IV (p < .001). Infants demonstrated a developmental trajectory of circadian pattern with significant time effects for increasing mesor, magnitude, amplitude, L5, IS, and IV (p < .001). By 12 weeks, infant phase advancement was evidenced by mean acrophase and M10 midpoint occurring 60 and 43 min (respectively) earlier than at 4 weeks. While maternal acrophase remained consistent over time, infants became increasingly phase advanced relative to mother and mean infant acrophase at 12 weeks occurred 60 min before mother. Mother-infant synchrony was evidenced in increasing correspondence of acrophase at 12 weeks (r = 0.704), L5 (r = 0.453) and M10 (r = 0.479) midpoints.
   Conclusions: Development of mother-infant synchrony reflects shared elements of circadian rhythm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Perinatal distress has largely been conceptualised as the experience of depression and/or anxiety. Recent research has shown that the affective state of stress is also present during the perinatal period and thus may add to a broader understanding of perinatal distress.
   Aim: The aims of the present study were to investigate the changes in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms across pregnancy, and to explore the prospective relationships between these symptoms.
   Methods: Two-hundred and fourteen pregnant women were recruited when they were less than 16 weeks gestation. Women completed depression, anxiety and stress measures on a monthly basis, from 16 weeks gestation through to 36 weeks gestation. The covariate measures of sleep quality and social support were assessed bi-monthly at 16, 24 and 32 weeks gestation.
   Findings: Levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were all shown to change over time, with women experiencing fewer symptoms during the middle of their pregnancy. Higher symptoms early in pregnancy predicted higher symptom levels throughout the rest of pregnancy. Higher depression scores early in pregnancy were also shown to predict higher anxiety and higher stress scores in late pregnancy. Increased stress scores during mid pregnancy also predicted higher anxiety scores in late pregnancy.
   Conclusion: Current findings indicate that symptom levels of depression, anxiety and stress vary over the course of pregnancy. Increased depression in early pregnancy seemed to be particularly pertinent as it not only predicted later depression symptoms, but also increased anxiety and stress in late pregnancy. Collectively, these results further highlight the importance of emotional health screening early in pregnancy. (C) 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

AB Objectives: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis apply in a general sample of perinatal women.
   Method: 101 women in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R).
   Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted.
   Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To compare the prevalence of self-reported abnormal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy among M (a) over bar ori (indigenous New Zealanders) and non-M (a) over bar ori women versus the general population, and to examine the influence of socio-demographic factors.
   Methods: Self-reported total sleep time (TST) in 24-hrs, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and socio-demographic information were obtained from nullipara and multipara women aged 20-46 yrs at 3537 weeks pregnant (358 M (a) over bar ori and 717 non-M (a) over bar ori), and women in the general population (381 M (a) over bar ori and 577 non-M (a) over bar ori).
   Results: After controlling for ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women average 30 min less TST than women in the general population. The distribution of TST was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short sleepers (<= 6 h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (>9 h). In addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Pregnant women >30 years of age experienced greater age-related declines in TST. Identifying as M (a) over bar ori, being unemployed, and working at night increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women population in this study. EDS also more likely occurred among M (a) over bar ori women and women who worked at night.
   Conclusions: Pregnancy increases the prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and EDS, which are also higher among M (a) over bar ori than non-M (a) over bar ori women and those who do night work. Health professionals responsible for the care of pregnant women need to be well-educated about the importance of sleep and discuss sleep issues with the women they care for. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB BackgroundFew epidemiological studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been conducted in Australia, and current management practice and levels of unmet need in this country are not well characterised.
   AimTo perform a systematic literature review to identify Australia-specific information on SLE, particularly areas of unmet need.
   MethodsMEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched (1 January 1990 to 29 November 2013). All articles on prevalence, disease characteristics, management and outcomes of SLE in Australia were included.
   ResultsThere is limited published information on SLE in Australia. Of 24 articles included, 18 described results from observational studies, three were narrative reviews, one was a clinical update, and two were medical education articles. In remote regions, SLE was reported to be more prevalent in Aboriginal Australians than non-Aboriginal Australians; information in urban populations is lacking. Asian Australians may be more affected by SLE than non-Asian Australians. Pregnancy outcomes may also be adversely affected. Many Australians with SLE may experience high levels of unmet need, including delayed diagnosis, ongoing symptoms, flares, depression/anxiety, sleeping difficulty and decreased quality of life. Published guidance on the SLE management in Australia is limited and dated.
   ConclusionsPublished information on SLE in Australia is limited, but suggests that ethnicity may affect the prevalence and disease characteristics and that many Australians with SLE have unmet needs. Improvements in diagnosis, treatment and management are needed to alleviate these needs. Up-to-date guidance on the management of SLE would benefit healthcare professionals and patients.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of quarter turn from prone compared with supine and prone positioning in maintaining respiratory function in premature infants managed in a neonatal intensive care unit.
   MethodsThe study was a prospective, randomised, cross-over trial with concealed allocation and intention to treat analysis. Fifty-four infants 32 weeks gestation were randomly allocated to the order of the positions supine, prone and quarter turn from prone. Distribution of ventilation was assessed by measurement of regional impedance amplitude, global inhomogeneity index and phase angle analysis using electrical impedance tomography 30min after each position change. Physiological characteristics of heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation and inspired oxygen were also measured.
   ResultsThere was a significant difference between positions for RR with the RR in quarter turn from prone significantly lower than for supine (mean difference 6.53 breaths/min; 2.04-11.02), but not compared with the prone position. No significant differences between positions were found for any of the other outcomes measured.
   ConclusionThis study demonstrated that quarter turn from prone had an immediate positive positional effect on the RR of premature infants. The position of quarter turn from prone was comparable with prone in the maintenance of lung function and had a superior effect over supine on RR. These findings support the view that a quarter turn from prone can be confidently used in neonatal nurseries to manage premature infants.

DE Resting energy expenditure (REE); Resting activities; Music; Reading;
   Indirect calorimetry
ID VIDEO GAMES; TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES; CHILDREN
AB Indirect calorimetry is often done early in the morning in a fasting state, with the subject unshowered and abstained from caffeine or other stimulants. Subjects often fall asleep, resulting in measurement of a sleeping metabolic rate rather than a resting metabolic rate. The objective of this study was to determine whether listening to self-selected relaxing music or reading an electronic device or magazine affects resting energy expenditure (REE) during measurement in healthy adults. A randomized trial comparing three different conditions (ie, resting, reading, and listening to music) was performed. Sixty-five subjects (36 female and 29 male) were used in final data analysis. Inclusion criteria included healthy subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 years with a stable weight. Exclusion criteria included pregnant or lactating women or use of medications known to affect metabolism. Results showed that reading either a magazine or an electronic device significantly increased REE by 102.7 kcal/day when compared with resting (P<0.0001); however, there was no difference in REE between the electronic device and magazine. Listening to self-selected relaxing music increased REE by 27.6 kcal/day compared with rest (P = 0.0072). Based on our results, we recommend subjects refrain from reading a magazine or electronic device during an indirect calorimetry test. Whether or not the smaller difference found while listening to music is practically significant would be a decision for the indirect calorimetry test administrator.

AB Purpose: Data regarding circadian rhythm in the onset of spontaneous preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and placental abruption (PA) cases are conflicting. We modeled the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases and examined if the circadian profiles varied based on the gestational age at delivery.
   Methods: We used parametric and nonparametric methods, including trigonometric regression in the framework of generalized linear models, to test the presence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases among 395 women who delivered a singleton between 2009 and 2010 in Lima, Peru.
   Results: We found a diurnal circadian pattern, with a morning peak at 07:32 AM (95% confidence interval, 05:46 AM-09:18 AM) among moderate preterm PROM cases (P value < .001), and some evidence of a diurnal circadian periodicity among PA cases in term infants (P value = .067). However, we did not find evidence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of extremely or very preterm PROM (P value = .259) and preterm PA (P value = .224).
   Conclusions: The circadian rhythms of the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases varied based on gestational weeks at delivery. Although circadian rhythms were presented among moderate preterm PROM and term PA cases, there was no evidence of circadian rhythms among preterm PA and very or extremely preterm PROM cases, underlying other mechanisms associated with the time of onset.

AB ObjectiveTo assess the frequency of obstructive sleep apnoea among women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
   DesignCohort study.
   SettingObstetric clinics at an academic medical centre.
   PopulationPregnant women with hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia) and women who were normotensive.
   MethodsWomen completed a questionnaire about habitual snoring and underwent overnight ambulatory polysomnography.
   Main outcome measuresThe presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnoea.
   ResultsObstructive sleep apnoea was found among 21 of 51 women with hypertensive disorders (41%), but in only three of 16 women who were normotensive (19%, chi-square test, P=0.005). [Author correction added on 16 June 2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers than in non-snorers (19.934.1 versus 3.4 +/- 3.1, P=0.013), and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4 +/- 6.6 versus 90.2 +/- 3.5, P=0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8).
   ConclusionsPregnant women with hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or promote hypertension.

AB ObjectiveTo assess whether gynecologists have impaired laparoscopic skills and/or reduced cognitive function after long on-call hours.
   DesignProspective cohort study.
   SettingDepartment of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Norway.
   Population28 gynecologists working long shifts in a single department.
   MethodsPre-training of laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality simulator. Simulator- and cognitive testing on two different occasions; one in the morning after a normal nights' sleep at home and one in the morning directly after 17.5h on call. The virtual reality simulator test consisted of three repetitive salpingectomies in an ectopic pregnancy module. The cognitive test consisted of a standardized cognitive test battery (Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery).
   Main outcome measuresSimulated laparoscopic performance was assessed by time to perform the procedure, total length of instrument movement (tip trajectory) and blood loss. Cognitive function was assessed by reaction time, errors and total score.
   ResultsNo significant impairment in laparoscopic skills was found after 17.5h on call. Cognitive testing revealed a statistically significant increase in reaction time post-call. Construct validity for the metrics time to perform procedure and tip trajectory in the ectopic pregnancy module was established in a validation study prior to our main study.
   ConclusionsWe were not able to detect impaired laparoscopic skills among gynecologists tested by a virtual reality procedural module after 17.5h on call. We found a small increase in reaction time but no other signs of reduced cognitive function. The study adds information on surgical performance of sleep-deprived gynecologists.

AB Automated monitoring of the QT interval is increasingly common in a variety of clinical settings. A better understanding of how the heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) evolves in early postnatal life is needed before its clinical utility in neonates can be determined. This study aimed to use real-time bedside monitoring as a tool to describe the QTc evolution of premature neonates during the first week of life. All neonates born at a gestation age (GA) of 31 weeks or later and admitted to the level 2 intensive care nursery of the authors' institution between December 2012 and March 2013 were included in this study. The authors prospectively collected QTc values at 15-min intervals during the first week of life, then used two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare these data among three GA cohorts: 31 to < 34 weeks (cohort A), 34 to < 37 weeks (cohort B), and a parts per thousand yen37 weeks (cohort C). All the cohorts demonstrated a statistically significant decline in the 24-h average QTc during the first 3-4 days of life before reaching a stable baseline. No diurnal variation in the QTc was identified in any of the study patients. Marked variability and a progressive decline in the QTc of premature neonates occur during the first 3-4 days of life. Understanding this phenomenon is imperative when screening programs for the early detection of QT prolongation are considered.

AB This study examined the effectiveness of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback intervention for reduction of psychological stress in women in the early postpartum period. On postpartum day 4, 55 healthy subjects received a brief explanation about HRV biofeedback using a portable device. Among them, 25 mothers who agreed to implement HRV biofeedback at home were grouped as the biofeedback group, and other 30 mothers were grouped as the control group. At 1 month postpartum, there was a significant decrease in total Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score (P < 0.001) in the biofeedback group; this change was brought about mainly by decreases in items related to anxiety or difficulty sleeping. There was also a significant increase in standard deviation of the normal heartbeat interval (P < 0.01) of the resting HRV measures in the biofeedback group after adjusting for potential covariates. In conclusion, postpartum women who implemented HRV biofeedback after delivery were relatively free from anxiety and complained less of difficulties sleeping at 1 month postpartum. Although the positive effects of HRV biofeedback may be partly attributable to intervention effects, due to its clinical outcome, HRV biofeedback appears to be recommendable for many postpartum women as a feasible health-promoting measure after childbirth.

AB Previous investigations have suggested a strong association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, the results of the following replication studies were not always concordant. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the more reliable estimate.
   A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Springer Link, and EMBASE to identify all eligible studies published before August 2013. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random effects model.
   A total of 24 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Findings demonstrated that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI, 1.29 to 2.46), pregnancy-related hypertension (OR = 2.38; 95 % CI, 1.63 to 3.47), preeclampsia (OR = 2.19; 95 % CI, 1.71 to 2.80), preterm delivery (OR = 1.98; 95 % CI, 1.59 to 2.48), low birth weight (OR = 1.75; 95 % CI, 1.33 to 2.32), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (OR = 2.43; 95 % CI, 1.61 to 3.68), intrauterine growth restriction (OR = 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.22 to 1.71), and Apgar score of < 7 at 1 min (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI, 1.10 to 2.91) based on all studies but not gestational age and birth weight.
   This meta-analysis revealed that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy may be associated with most of adverse perinatal outcomes. Further well-designed studies are warranted to confirm our findings.

AB Background. True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia.
   Method. Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias.
   Results. High-and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent.
   Conclusions. We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited.

AB Pregnancy is a period influenced by the interaction of several factors, therefore this study aimed to identify changes in lifestyles due to pregnancy and childbirth in Portuguese and immigrant women in Portugal. This is a qualitative study, using the semi-structured interview, with eighty-two Portuguese and immigrant women. Content analysis was used, with verbatim classification supported by Nvivo 10. It was authorized by an Ethics Commission. Results revealed that the primary changes in lifestyles due to pregnancy were in eating habits (nutrition), daily activity, exposure to danger, sleep and rest patterns, social and family relationships, going out, self-care, work, clothing and footwear, travel, health monitoring and sexual activity and substances consumption. The main change after the birth, manifested by these women, was that their lives began to revolve around their baby.

AB Disturbances of fetal autonomic brain development can be evaluated from fetal heart rate patterns (HAP) reflecting the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Although HAP analysis from cardiotocographic (GIG) recordings is established for fetal surveillance, temporal resolution is low. Fetal magnetocardiography (MCG), however, provides stable continuous recordings at a higher temporal resolution combined with a more precise heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. A direct comparison of GIG and MCG based HRV analysis is pending. The aims of the present study are: (i) to compare the fetal maturation age predicting value of the MCG based fetal Autonomic Brain Age Score (fABAS) approach with that of GIG based Dawes-Redman methodology; and (ii) to elaborate fABAS methodology by segmentation according to fetal behavioral states and HAP We investigated MCG recordings from 418 normal fetuses, aged between 21 and 40 weeks of gestation. In linear regression models we obtained an age predicting value of GIG compatible short term variability (STV) of R-2 = 0.200 (coefficient of determination) in contrast to MCG/fABAS related multivariate models with R-2 = 0.648 in 30 min recordings, R-2 = 0.610 in active sleep segments of 10 min, and R-2 = 0.626 in quiet sleep segments of 10 min. Additionally segmented analysis under particular exclusion of accelerations (AC) and decelerations (DC) in quiet sleep resulted in a novel multivariate model with R-2 = 0.706. According to our results, fMCG based fABAS may provide a promising tool for the estimation of fetal autonomic brain age. Beside other traditional and novel HRV indices as possible indicators of developmental disturbances, the establishment of a fABAS score normogram may represent a specific reference. The present results are intended to contribute to further exploration and validation using independent data sets and multicenter research structures.

AB Changes in the maternal environment can induce fetal adaptations that result in the progression of chronic diseases in the offspring. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of maternal chronic sleep restriction on blood pressure, renal function and cardiac baroreflex response on male offspring at adult age. Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in two experimental groups: control (C) and chronic sleep restricted (CSR). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. Chronic sleep restricted females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily, between the 1st and 20th day of pregnancy. After birth, the litters were reduced to 6 rats per mother, and were designated as offspring from control (OC) and offspring from chronic sleep restricted (OCSR). Indirect blood pressure (BPi tail cuff) was measured by plethysmography in male offspring at 3 months old. Following, the renal function and cardiac baroreflex response were analyzed. Values of BPi in OCSR were significantly higher compared to OC [OC: 127 +/- 2.6 (19); OCSR: 144 +/- 2.5 (17) mmHg]. The baroreflex sensitivity to the increase of blood pressure was reduced in OCSR [Slope: OC: -2.6 +/- 0.15 (9); OCRS: -1.6 +/- 0.13 (9)]. Hypothalamic activity of ACE2 was significantly reduced in OCSR compared to OC [OC: 97.4 +/- 15 (18); OSR: 60.2 +/- 3.6 (16) UAF/min/protein mg]. Renal function alteration was noticed by the increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) observed in OCSR [OC: 6.4 +/- 0.2 (10); OCSR: 7.4 +/- 0.3 (7)]. Chronic sleep restriction during pregnancy caused in the offspring hypertension, altered cardiac baroreflex response, reduced ACE-2 activity in the hypothalamus and renal alterations. Our data suggest that the reduction of sleeping time along the pregnancy is able to modify maternal homeostasis leading to functional alterations in offspring.

AB Individual differences in sleep patterns of children may have developmental origins. In the present study, two factors known to influence behavioural development, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype and prenatal Fe-deficient (ID) diet, were examined for their influences on sleep patterns in juvenile rhesus monkeys. Sleep patterns were assessed based on a threshold for inactivity as recorded by activity monitors. Pregnant monkeys were fed diets containing either 100 parts per million (ppm) Fe (Fe sufficient, IS) or 10 ppm Fe (ID). At 3-4 months of age, male offspring were genotyped for polymorphisms of the MAOA gene that lead to high or low transcription. At 1 and 2 years of age, sleep patterns were assessed. Several parameters of sleep architecture changed with age. At 1 year of age, monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype demonstrated a trend towards more sleep episodes at night compared with those with the high-MAOA genotype. When monkeys reached 2 years of age, prenatal ID reversed this trend; ID in the low-MAOA group resulted in sleep fragmentation, more awakenings at night and more sleep episodes during the day when compared with prenatal IS in this genotype. The ability to consolidate sleep during the dark cycle was disrupted by prenatal ID, specifically in monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype.

AB Inconsistent information exists in the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and perinatal outcomes. This study was intended to investigate whether OSA in pregnant women has a potential to elevate the incidence of the maternal and neonatal outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of all available cohort studies. Five cohort studies including 977 participants were eligible for inclusion. The association between OSA and the risk of perinatal outcomes was expressed as relative risks (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Our results revealed that OSA group was associated with more frequent preeclampsia (RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.86), preterm birth (RR 1.90; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.91), cesarean delivery (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.29) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86 to 3.76). On analyzing data for the prevalence of gestational diabetes and small gestational age (SGA) <10 th percentile (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.62 to 3.19, and RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.24, respectively), there were no significant differences in both group. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that OSA in pregnant women significantly increases the incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes, which is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, preterm birth, cesarean delivery and NICU admission.

AB Background. Pregnancy brings about many changes in a woman's life in somatic, psychological and social spheres. Therefore, many women decide to participate in childbirth education classes. The aim of study was to determine the differences in emotional distress between women who participated in childbirth education classes and these who did not.
   Material and Methods. Seventy first-time mothers after labor were examined. Based on a survey carried out, the women were divided into two equal groups. Group I consisted of women who had participated in childbirth education classes and Group II of women who had not. The data was gathered by means of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) adapted to Polish conditions.
   Results. There were no differences either in age or in BMI rates among the examined women. The level of education and knowledge about labor was significantly higher among the participants of childbirth classes. The results of the GHQ-12 revealed that women from Group I had a better mental status than women from Group II. Significant differences were observed in terms of sleep deprivation, overcoming difficulties and in the ability to enjoy daily activities.
   Conclusions. Participation in childbirth classes has a significant influence on psychological well-being in pregnant women as measured by the GHQ-12.

AB Preterm infants are challenged by immature infant behavioral organization which may negatively influence their ability to oral feed. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the integrated H-HOPE (Hospital to Home: Optimizing the Infant's Environment) intervention would improve infant behavioral organization by increasing the frequency of orally directed behaviors and the proportion of time spent in an alert behavioral state when offered prior to oral feeding. Mother-infant dyads (n = 198) were randomly assigned to the H-HOPE intervention or the Attention Control groups. Infants were born at 29-34 weeks gestation and were clinically stable. Mothers had at least two social environmental risk factors such as minority status or less than high school education. H-HOPE is an integrated intervention that included (1) twice-daily infant directed stimulation using the ATVV intervention (auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular stimuli) and (2) maternal participatory guidance sessions by a nurse-community advocate team. Orally directed behaviors and behavioral states were assessed weekly prior to feeding during hospitalization when infants were able to feed orally. There were no differences between the groups at baseline (Day 0, prior to the initiation of the integrated H-HOPE intervention). We observed a pattern of increased frequency of orally directed behaviors in the H-HOPE intervention group when compared to the Attention Control group, however, the proportion of time spent in an alert behavioral state remained stable in both groups over the course of the study. On Day 7, the H-HOPE intervention group exhibited a significantly higher mean frequency of orally directed behaviors than the Attention Control group (12.6 vs. 7.1 pre-intervention, 51.8 vs. 33.2 during intervention, 4.3 vs. 3.2 immediately after intervention, and 8.9 vs. 5.3 immediately prior to feeding). On Day 7, the H-HOPE intervention group exhibited a significantly higher proportion of time spent in an alert behavioral state only during intervention (0.26 vs. 0.11) and immediately after intervention (0.28 vs. 0.06). These findings are suggestive that the integrated H-HOPE intervention facilitated infant behavioral organization for clinically stable infants born between 29 and 34 weeks gestation. The orally directed behaviors appear to be an important indicator of the infant's preparation for feeding, and when used in conjunction with assessment of behavioral states, are especially valuable to the clinician. Use of this combined assessment approach in practice would strengthen clinician assessment for initiation of (beginning the first oral feeding) and daily preparation for oral feeding in preterm infants.

AB The timing and pattern of mammalian behavioral activities are regulated by an evolutionary optimized interplay of the genetically based biological (circadian) clock located in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei and direct responses to environmental factors that superimpose and thus mask the clock-mediated effects, the most important of which is the photically induced phase-setting (synchronization) of the circadian rhythmicity to the 24-hour solar day. In wild and captive animals living under the natural conditions prevailing in their habitat, to date, only a few attempts have been made to analyze the role of these two regulatory mechanisms in the species' adaptation to the time structure prevailing in their habitat. We studied the impact of housing conditions and season on the daily timing and pattern of activity in Mexican spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). To this end, we carried out long-term activity recordings with Actiwatch (R) AW4 accelerometer/data-logger devices in 11 adult Ateles living under identical natural lighting and climatic conditions in either a large wire netting cage or a 0.25 ha forest enclosure in the primatological field station of Veracruz State University near Catemaco, Mexico. In a gravid female in the forest enclosure, we obtained first-hand information on the effect of late pregnancy and parturition on the monkey's activity rhythm. The Ateles behaved strictly diurnal and undertook about 90% of daily total activity during this activity time. Due to a higher second activity peak in late afternoon, the bimodal activity pattern was more pronounced in monkeys living in the forest enclosure. Although the spider monkeys kept there had an earlier activity onset and morning activity peak than their conspecifics in the cage, no consistent differences were found in the parameters characterizing the phase-setting of the circadian system to the environmental 24-h periodicity, either by comparison or correlation with the external time markers of sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS). The most obvious effect of late pregnancy, parturition and lactation was a distinct reduction of the activity level during the week of parturition and the next. Seasonal variations in the form of significant differences between the long-day summer half year and the short-day winter half year were established in the phase-angle differences of the morning activity peak to SR, in the evening activity peak and activity offset to SS, as well as in the activity time and the peak-to-peak interval, but not in the phase position of activity onset to SR or in the height of the morning and evening activity peak. These findings in combination with a high variability of the phase angle differences indicate that in A. geoffroyi, a relatively weak circadian component and strong masking direct effects of environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the daily activity rhythm.

AB Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model.
   Design: Case-control comparison in a murine model.
   Setting: University research laboratory.
   Participants: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice.
   Interventions: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O-2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses.
   Measurements and Results: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 +/- 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 +/- 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 +/- 0.10 and 2.45 +/- 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 +/- 0.16 and 5.80 +/- 1.24, respectively).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

AB Objective: To review the impact of sleep, stress, and/or depression on postpartum weight retention.
   Methods: We searched three electronic databases, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Psyclnfo. Studies were included if they were published between January 1990 and September 2013 in English, measured sleep, stress, and/or depression in the postpartum period, and assessed the association of these factors with postpartum weight retention. Two reviewers reviewed included articles and rated study quality using a modified version of the Downs and Black scale.
   Results: Thirteen studies met our pre-defined eligibility criteria, reporting on 9 study samples. Two were cross-sectional studies and eleven were longitudinal studies. The study sample size ranged from 74 to 37,127. All four studies examining short sleep duration and postpartum weight retention reported a positive association. The four studies examining postpartum stress and weight retention reported non-significant associations only. Of 7 studies examining postpartum depression and weight retention, 3 reported non-significant associations, and 4 reported positive associations.
   Conclusion: Research investigating the impact of postpartum sleep, stress, depression on weight retention is limited. Future longitudinal studies are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate which prepartum determinants contribute to the development of postpartum (PP) fatigue among working women in the Netherlands.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study in 15 Dutch companies was conducted to measure different potential predictors using self-administrated questionnaires at baseline and at 30 weeks of pregnancy. Fatigue was measured at 12 (N = 523) and 52 weeks (N = 436) PP using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS). A CIS score > 76 was defined as fatigue.
   Results: The prevalence of fatigue at 12 and 52 weeks PP was 24.5% and 18.1%, respectively. Fourteen predictive factors were found for fatigue (R-2 = 0.37) at 12 weeks PP. Ten predictive factors were found for fatigue at 52 weeks PP (R-2 = 0.36). In general, less favourable work relationships and characteristics, poorer mental health, more passive coping styles, more sleeping problems, more fatigue during pregnancy, and beliefs about child care arrangements were related to PP fatigue. At 30 weeks of pregnancy, only more fatigue (OR = 3.69, p < 0.001; OR = 2.68, p = 0.02) and poorer mental health (OR = 0.50, p = 0.02; OR = 0.90, p = 0.78) predicted fatigue both at 12 and 52 weeks PP.
   Conclusions: A large number of predictive factors for PP fatigue were found. These findings indicate that different aspects can contribute to being fatigued after pregnancy. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of possible interventions by employers and/or occupational physicians. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   PERSPECTIVES; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; PRETERM DELIVERY
AB ObjectivesMaternal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal-axis function regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol, which during pregnancy can cross the placenta and have lasting impacts on fetal growth and development. This article provides a preliminary test of the hypothesis that a woman's socioeconomic status (SES) predicts her cortisol during pregnancy and her offspring's cortisol during the early postnatal period among an ethnically diverse sample in Auckland, New Zealand to evaluate whether differences in cortisol contribute to the intergenerational inheritance of health disparities within this population.
   MethodsMaternal saliva samples were collected at waking and prior to sleep on 2 days in late pregnancy (34-36 weeks gestation; N=55), and a subset of offspring saliva was collected before (N=48) and 20 min after a standard vaccination at 6 weeks of age (N=19). SES was quantified using a locally validated index of material deprivation, the NZ Deprivation Index for individuals (NZiDep).
   ResultsWe found that, after controlling for ethnicity and other covariates, women with higher NZiDep scores had significantly higher evening but similar morning cortisol, consistent with a pattern of chronic strain. Infants of women reporting greater material deprivation had elevated cortisol response to vaccination.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that maternal SES experience impacts maternal cortisol in pregnancy and offspring cortisol reactivity soon after birth, with potential long-term effects on offspring biology and health. Additional research is needed to clarify how biological and behavioral factors in both the prenatal and postnatal period facilitate this relationship. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 26:723-730, 2014.

AB The circadian molecular clock is an internal time-keeping system composed of centrally synchronized tissue-level pacemakers. Here, we explored the ontogeny of the clock machinery in the developing kidney. Pregnant rats were housed at 12-12 h light-dark cycles. Offsprings were killed at 4-h intervals on embryonic day 20 and at postnatal weeks 1, 4, and 12. Canonical clock gene (Clock, Bmal1, Rev-erb alpha, Cry1, Cry2, Pen, Per2) and kidney-specific clock-controlled gene (alpha ENaC, SGK1, NHE3, AVPR2) expression was profiled by RT-PCR. To investigate the role of nutritional cues, the feeding pattern was modified postpartum. Clock, Rev-erb alpha, Per2, alpha ENaC, SGK1, NHE3, and AVPR2 showed circadian expression at the end of intrauterine development. By 1 week, all genes oscillated with a distinct acrophase shift toward the time of peak feeding activity. Daily 4-hour withdrawal of mothers induced a 12-hour phase shift of Clock and Bmal1 expression, while disrupting oscillations of the other genes. After weaning, oscillation phases shifted back toward the adult pattern, which was fully expressed at 12 weeks. Thus, functional circadian molecular clockwork evolves in the late fetal and early postnatal kidney. During the nursing period, oscillations are entrained by nutritional cues. The coupling of the circadian expression of tubular regulators of fluid and electrolyte excretion to the feeding-entrained clockwork may be important to maintain homeostasis during this critical period.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) (N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) (N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.

AB Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At 12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.03-1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88-0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) and overall MVPA (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal) sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12-5.15) and increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.05-3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep.

AB Purpose The study aimed to describe the dispensing of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs (z-hypnotics) to pregnant women and to study the characteristics of these women and the extent of co-medication.
   Methods A population-based cohort study was conducted based on the linkage of nationwide registries: the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Prescription Database. The data covers dispensed drugs to women 3 months prior to, during and after pregnancy. The study population consisted of 345,703 singleton pregnancies during a period starting 1 April 2004 or later and ending before 1 January 2011.
   Results In 5,135 (1.5 %) of the pregnancies, the women were dispensed a benzodiazepine or z-hypnotic at least once. Of these, 68.5 % filled just one prescription for the duration of the pregnancy. Prevalence was lower in pregnancy than before and after pregnancy. The median total amount of benzodiazepines and/or z-hypnotics dispensed during pregnancy was 15 defined daily doses (DDDs), while the 25 % receiving the largest amounts got 40 DDDs or more. Five hundred eleven women, the 10 % that were prescribed the largest amounts during pregnancy, received a median amount of 220 DDDs. Women receiving these drugs were older, more often smokers, without a partner and suffering from chronic disease. Of the medicated pregnant women, 19.6 % and 19.3 % were also prescribed an opioid and antidepressant, respectively.
   Conclusions The use of benzodiazepines and z-hypnotic drugs during pregnancy was not very prevalent in Norway. However, our findings imply that there is a substantial number of pregnancies where these drugs are dispensed often and/or in large quantities and where comedication occurred.

AB ObjectivesPost-partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR.
   DesignTherefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours.
   MethodPregnant women (N=126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9months post-partum.
   ResultsHierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6months or less) of breastfeeding, and post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6months are associated with higher PWR at 9months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence.
   ConclusionInterventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.

AB Purpose of review
   The evidence of a putative causal effect of sleep apnea-induced intermittent hypoxia on the pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is mounting. The present review presents the evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia.
   Recent findings
   Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea.
   Summary
   An association between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy among high-risk women.
   Study Design This was a prospective, observational study. We recruited women with a body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2), chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, history of preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9) and severe (>= 30). Subjects who had a normal AHI at the baseline (AHI < 5), but an abnormal study in the third trimester (AHI >= 5) were classified as having "new-onset" SDB.
   Results A total of 128 women were recruited. In early pregnancy 21, 6 and 3% had mild, moderate, or severe SDB, respectively. These frequencies increased to 35, 7, and 5% in the third trimester (p < 0.001). About 27% (n = 34) experienced a worsening of SDB during pregnancy; 26 were cases of new-onset SDB, while the other 8 had SDB in early pregnancy that worsened in severity. The incidence of new-onset SDB was 20%. The majority of these new-onset cases were mild.
   Conclusions SDB in early pregnancy is common in high-risk women and new-onset SDB occurs in 20% of these women.

AB In recent years, the negative impact of oxidative stress on fertility has become widely recognised. Several studies have demonstrated its negative effect on the number and quality of retrieved oocytes and embryos following in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Melatonin, a pineal hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, has also been shown to exhibit unique oxygen scavenging abilities. Some studies have suggested a role for melatonin in gamete biology. Clinical studies also suggest that melatonin supplementation in IVF may lead to better pregnancy rates. Here we present a critical review and summary of the current literature and provide suggestions for future well designed clinical trials.

AB Objective: The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child's temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant's temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant's temperament. Results: Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy.

AB Objectives: We used linked existing data from the 2006-2008 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), the Current Population Survey (CPS, a federal survey that provides on-going U. S. vital statistics, including employment rates) and self-reported body mass index (BMI) to answer: How does BMI vary across full time occupations dichotomized as sedentary/non-sedentary, accounting for time spent in sleep, other sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities?
   Methods: We classified time spent engaged at a primary job (sedentary or non-sedentary), sleep, and other non-work, non-sleep intensity-defined behaviors, specifically, sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities. Age groups were defined by 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64 years. BMI groups were defined by 18.5-24.9, 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and >= 35.0 kg/m(2). Logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between BMI and employment in a sedentary occupation, considering time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age race/ethnicity, and household income.
   Results: The analysis data set comprised 4,092 non-pregnant, non-underweight individuals 20-64 years of age who also reported working more than 7 hours at their primary jobs on their designated time use reporting day. Logistic and linear regression analyses failed to reveal any associations between BMI and the sedentary/non-sedentary occupation dichotomy considering time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence of a relationship between self-reported full time sedentary occupation classification and BMI after accounting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income and 24-hours of time use including non-work related physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The various sources of error associated with self-report methods and assignment of generalized activity and occupational intensity categories could compound to obscure any real relationships.

AB Background: Universal access to and utilization of malaria prevention measures is defined as every person at malaria risk sleeping under a quality insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) and every pregnant woman at risk receiving at least two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). This study aimed to determine factors affecting accessibility, availability and utilisation of malaria interventions among women of reproductive age in Kilosa district in central Tanzania.
   Methods: Women of reproductive age with children <5 years old or those who had been pregnant during the past 5 years were included in the study. A structured questionnaire was used to seek information on malaria knowledge, accessibility and utilization of malaria interventions during pregnancy.
   Results: A total of 297 women (mean age = 29 +/- 6.8 years) were involved. Seventy percent of the women had attained primary school education. About a quarter of women had two children of <5 years while over 58% had >= 3 children. Most (71.4%) women had medium general knowledge on malaria while only eight percent of them had good knowledge on malaria in pregnancy. A significant proportion of women were not aware of the reasons for taking SP during pregnancy (35%), timing for SP (18%), and the effect of malaria on pregnancy (45.8%). Timing for first dose of SP for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) was 1-3 months (28.4%) and 4-6 months (36.8%). Some 78.1% were provided with SP under supervision of the health provider. Knowledge on malaria in pregnancy had a significant association with levels of education (p = 0.024). Ninety-eight percent had an ITN, mostly (87.1%) received free from the government. All women attended the ANC during their last pregnancy. The coverage of IPT1 was 53.5% and IPTp2 was 41.1%. The proportion of women making more ANC visits decreased with increasing parity.
   Conclusion: This study showed that the knowledge of the pregnant women on malaria in pregnancy and IPTp was average and is likely to have an impact on the low IPTp coverage. Campaigns that provide educational massages on the risk of malaria during pregnancy and the usefulness of IPTp need to be emphasised.

AB The nuclear receptor REV-ERB alpha (encoded by NR1D1) has a critical role in metabolism and physiology as well as circadian rhythm. Here, we investigated the possible contribution of clock genes including NR1D1 to the secretion of prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2)alpha) from bovine uterine stromal (USCs) and epithelial cells (UECs) by modulating the expression of PTGS2. The circadian oscillation of clock genes in the cells was weak compared with that reported in rodents, but the expression of BMAL1, PER1, and NR1D1 was changed temporally by treatment with ovarian steroids. Significant expression of clock genes including NR1D1 was detected in USCs exposed to progesterone. NR1D1 was also significantly expressed in UECs exposed to estradiol. The expression of PTGS2 was suppressed in USCs exposed to progesterone, while the expression was initially suppressed in UECs exposed to estradiol and then increased after long-term exposure to estradiol. BMAL1 knockdown with specific siRNA caused a significant decrease in the transcript levels of NR1D1 and PTGS2 in USCs, but not in UECs. The production of PGF(2)alpha also decreased in USCs after BMAL1 knockdown, while its level did not significantly change in UECs. The transcript level of PTGS2 was increased by treatment with the antagonist of REV-ERB alpha in both cell types, but the agonist was ineffective. In these two cell types treated with the agonist or antagonist, the PGF(2)alpha production coincided well with the PTGS2 expression. Collectively, these results indicate that REV-ERB alpha plays an inhibitory role in the expression of PTGS2 in both bovine USCs and UECs treated with ovarian steroids.

AB Objective: The authors reviewed the published literature on the acute and long-term neurobehavioral effects on infants and children of either in utero exposure to maternal depression or in utero exposure to antidepressants.
   Data Sources: The PubMed electronic database was searched to locate 292 English-language studies from the first available year to October 2013 using the keywords pregnancy, antidepressants, depression, perinatal, and neurobehavioral.
   Study Selection: The authors reviewed only prospective studies that assessed the impact of maternal depression during pregnancy or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on (1) clearly defined short-term behavioral outcomes in infants (perinatal outcome) or (2) longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children (neurodevelopmental outcome).
   Data Extraction: Studies were included if they were prospective and assessed the impact of maternal depression or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on clearly measurable, objective short-term and longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children.
   Results: Untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with short-term neonatal effects, including increased distress after delivery, less than optimal orientation and motor activity, and disrupted sleep. Longer-term effects on neurobehavioral outcome have also been reported, including disruptive social behavior, depression, and changes in the period of sensitivity for language discrimination. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse short-term perinatal symptomatology, including effects on autonomic and motor activity, habituation, and sleep. Longer-term studies of neurobehavioral outcomes of in utero antidepressant exposure suggest potential effects on gross motor function and language development but not cognition.
   Conclusions: In utero exposure to either maternal depression or antidepressants carries risks to the developing fetus. Treatment decisions regarding whether and how to treat depression during pregnancy must be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the impact of these decisions on both mother and infant.

AB Purpose: To formulate radiation precautions for patients with thyroid cancer who are undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal-induced hypothyroidism and iodine 131 (I-131) therapy through actual biokinetic measurements.
   Materials and Methods: Informed consent and institutional review board approval were obtained. From October 2008 to December 2011, consecutive patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had been prepared for I-131 ablation treatment or I-131 treatment for metastatic disease during follow-up were prospectively recruited. Calculations based on deduced whole-body retention and measured iodine biokinetics in thyroidal tissue were derived to determine the thyroidal and extrathyroidal compartment uptake fractions and effective half-lives. Precaution times necessary to avoid close contact with family members and the general public were derived from these parameters and regulatory dose limits.
   Results: Seventy-seven patients (36 with ablation treatments, 41 with follow-up treatments) were eligible for the analysis. Actual dose rates from patients after therapeutic I-131 administration were greatly lower than those described in the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) models: The mean initial dose rate at 0.3 m for patients with ablation treatment was only 28% (0.183/0.655 mu Sv/h/MBq) +/- 2.9 (standard deviation) (range, 12.1%-38.3%) and 36% (0.183/0.511 mu Sv/h/MBq) +/- 3.7 (range, 15.5%-49.1%) of that described in the NRC and ATA models, respectively; the equivalent values for patients with follow-up treatment were only 30% (0.195/0.655 mu Sv/h/MBq) +/- 3.5 (range, 12.5%-45.3%) and 38% (0.195/0.511 mu Sv/h/MBq) +/- 4.5 (range, 16.0%-58.1%), respectively. The actual mean effective I-131 half-life in the thyroid remnant tissue was greatly lower than that described in the ATA and NRC models: 47.6 versus 175.2 hours.
   Conclusion: On the basis of the current dose limits, typically administered activities of 3.7 GBq to a patient with ablation treatment or 7.4 GBq to a patient with follow-up treatment required 3 days of sleeping apart for keeping the doses to pregnant women and children below 1 mSv. No precautions were required for non-cosleeping nonpregnant adult family members. (C) RSNA, 2014

AB Fetal movements (FM) related heart rate accelerations (AC) are an important maturation criterion. Since Doppler-based time resolution is not sufficient for accompanying heart rate variability analysis, the work is aimed at a comprehensive FM-AC analysis using magnetocardiographic recordings from fetuses during sleep.
   We identify FM and AC by independent component analysis and automatic recognition algorithms. We investigate associations between FM and AC of different magnitude by means of event coincidence and time series cross-correlation over the maturation period of 21-40 weeks of gestation (WGA).
   FM related AC appear with increasing AC magnitude and WGA. Vice versa, AC related FM appear independent of WGA, but more frequently with increasing AC amplitude. The FM-AC correlation exists already at 21 WGA and further increases with WGA while the variability of its time delay decreases. Hence, FM and AC are clearly associated over the whole investigated maturation period. The increase of FM related AC runs parallel to the increasing AC magnitude.
   The MCG methodology was confirmed and results from previous Doppler-based analyses reproduced. Hence, MCG recordings allow the collective analysis of heart rate variability based maturation indices and FM related AC. This synergism may improve the diagnosis of fetal developmental disorders.

AB The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in newborns when (1) long neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain activity consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to guide activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the fMRI recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG activity and fMRI signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

AB Aim: Depression is common and may have significant implications for the individual, their families and work and for the health care system. The menopause transition (MT) may be an 'at risk' time for the development of depression. This review aims to explore the relationship between depression and MT and the complex interaction between the biological, psychological and social factors that inform it. Methods: The literature on depressive disorders and MT is reviewed. Results and conclusions: Longitudinal studies have demonstrated an association between the menopause transition (MT) and an increase in depressive symptoms. A trend towards higher rates of depressive disorders during the MT, has also been shown, although not always reaching statistical significance. Risk factors for the development of depressive symptoms and depression in the MT include the presence of vasomotor symptoms (VMS), a personal history of depression (particularly depression that is related to pregnancy or hormonal changes through the menstrual cycle), surgical menopause, adverse life events, and negative attitudes to menopause and ageing. A treatment approach to depression during the MT exploits the biological as well as the psychosocial factors that are likely to be contributing in an individual.

AB Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11 beta-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.

AB Background: Although mass distribution has been considered as the best method to rapidly scale up the coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for malaria prevention, little information is available on determinants associated with net utilization at local settings. We studied individual and household factors associated with LLIN use in Halaba district in southern Ethiopia.
   Methods: This is a population-based survey conducted in October 2008 in 16 randomly selected villages. Data on individual and household characteristics, LLIN ownership and use were collected through house-to-house visits. Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of each independent variable on LLIN use by respondents.
   Results: A total of 1235 households participated in the study, and 755/1235 (61.1%) had owned at least one LLIN. Among LLIN-owning households, 419/629 (66.6%) children under the age of five years and 33/55 (60.0%) pregnant women slept under an LLIN the night before the survey. The number of LLINs hung in the household (adjusted OR [aOR] 13.2, 95% CI 3.7-47.5) and knowledge about malaria (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.5) were the two important predictors associated with LLINs use.
   Conclusions: A substantial gap between net ownership and use was identified. Hanging nets and knowledge of malaria predict higher odds of sleeping under an LLIN the previous night. More intensive research on factors that contribute to low LLIN usage is needed.

TI Acknowledging HIV and malaria as major causes of maternal mortality in

ID PREGNANT-WOMEN; BANGLADESH; DEATHS
AB Objective: To review national data on HIV and malaria as causes of maternal death and to determine the importance of looking at maternal mortality at a subnational level in Mozambique. Methods: Three national data surveys were used to document HIV and malaria as causes of maternal mortality and to assess HIV and malaria prevention services for pregnant women. Data were collected between 2007 and 2011, and included population-level verbal autopsy data and household survey data. Results: Verbal autopsy data indicated that 18.2% of maternal deaths were due to HIV and 23.1% were due to malaria. Only 19.6% of recently pregnant women received at least two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment, and only 42.3% of pregnant women were sleeping under an insecticide-treated net. Only 37.5% of recently pregnant women had been counseled, tested, and received an HIV test result. Coverage of prevention services varied substantially by province. Conclusion: Triangulation of information on cause of death and coverage of interventions can enable appropriate targeting of maternal health interventions. Such information could also help countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to recognize and take action against malaria and HIV in an effort to decrease maternal mortality.

AB This review aims to discuss how endogenous and exogenous testosterone exposures in men and estrogens/progesterone exposures in women interact with sleep regulation. In young men, testosterone secretion peaks during sleep and is linked to sleep architecture. Animal and human studies support the notion that sleep loss suppresses testosterone secretion. Testosterone levels decline slowly throughout the aging process, but relatively few studies investigate its impact on age-related sleep modifications. Results suggest that poorer sleep quality is associated with lower testosterone concentrations and that sleep loss may have a more prominent effect on testosterone levels in older individuals. In women, sex steroid levels are characterized by a marked monthly cycle and reproductive milestones such as pregnancy and menopause. Animal models indicate that estrogens and progesterone influence sleep. Most studies do not show any clear effects of the menstrual cycle on sleep, but sample sizes are too low, and research designs often inhibit definitive conclusions. The effects of hormonal contraceptives on sleep are currently unknown. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased sleep disturbances, but their relation to the hormonal milieu still needs to be determined. Finally, studies suggest that menopausal transition and the hormonal changes associated with it are linked to lower subjective sleep quality, but results concerning objective sleep measures are less conclusive. More research is necessary to unravel the effects of vasomotor symptoms on sleep. Hormone therapy seems to induce positive effects on sleep, but key concerns are still unresolved, including the long-term effects and efficacy of different hormonal regimens.

TI Maternal choline concentrations during pregnancy and choline-related

   METABOLISM; BETAINE
AB Background: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid.
   Objective: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionafly could reduce NTD rates.
   Design: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit.
   Results: Mean (+/- SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 +/- 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 +/- 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.

AB We examined the reactions of population, social and health care professionals and local politicians in the context of a narrative case of a newborn and her mother evincing postpartal mental symptoms. The results of this postal questionnaire study indicated that in assessing the urgent need for support, a significant positive association prevailed in the resident cohort with female gender, age over 50 years or being a parent. Professionals and politicians estimated that appropriate care and access to care would be obtained in the maternity and child health clinic in the local health centre. Residents would contact relatives rather than social and health care professionals. A future challenge is to promote the knowledge and sensitivity of the general population in recognizing mental symptoms in mothers with small children. Adequate information is also called for regarding local services and means of access to care.

AB Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common condition among pregnant women, particularly during late gestation. Gestational perturbations promote the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic consequences in the next generation.

ID CARE
AB The majority of children and adolescents with epilepsy are managed in the community setting by general paediatricians. However, there is a paucity of practical, relevant information and standardised management documents assisting paediatricians. In the era of sub-specialisation, an electronic educational resource developed by specialists in epilepsy and paediatrics enhances the interface between tertiary and secondary/primary care. We aimed to create a website (www.pennsw.com.au) designed to optimise the care of all children and adolescents living with epilepsy and to assess its clinical usefulness. The site provides clinicians and families an aligned resource, including key information on epilepsy syndromes, medication usage and adverse effects, safety (sleep deprivation, water sports), driving, pregnancy, psychosocial impact of epilepsy and coping skills. General paediatricians and carers completed a questionnaire, utilising rating scales and open ended questions, to evaluate design, content and clinical usefulness. Forty-nine general paediatricians with a median 12 years of paediatric practice participated. Thirty-two carers participated. Epilepsy syndrome was focal in 59% of the children and generalised in 41%. The majority of participants (paediatricians: 84-100%, families: 69-100%) rated the website as well designed, practical, informative and clinically useful. General paediatricians considered the "Medication" pages and "Epilepsy Management Documents" as practically useful. Carers recorded the "Family Resources", seizure recording documents, the support information on mental health, and the "Coping with Epilepsy" segment as most informative. General paediatricians and carers highly valued the website, reflected by 120,000 page views in 12 months since its launch. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study assessed the relationship between postpartum intimate partner violence (IPV) and postpartum health risks among young mothers over time. Data were collected from 2001 to 2005 on young women aged 14-25 attending obstetrics and gynecology clinics in two US cities. Postpartum IPV (i.e., emotional, physical, sexual) was assessed at 6 and 12 months after childbirth (n = 734). Four types of postpartum IPV patterns were examined: emerged IPV, dissipated IPV, repeated IPV, and no IPV. Emerged IPV occurred at 12 months postpartum, not 6 months postpartum. Dissipated IPV occurred at 6 months postpartum, not 12 months postpartum. Repeated IPV was reported at 6 months and 12 months postpartum. Postpartum health risks studied at both time points were perceived stress, depression, fear of condom negotiation, condom use, infant sleeping problems, and parental stress. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used. The proportion of young mothers reporting IPV after childbirth increased from 17.9 % at 6 months postpartum to 25.3 % at 12 months postpartum (P < 0.001). Emerged and/or repeated postpartum IPV were associated with increased perceived stress, depression, fear of condom negotiation, and infant sleeping problems as well as decreased condom use (P < 0.05). Dissipated postpartum IPV was associated with decreased depression (P < 0.05). IPV screening and prevention programs for young mothers may reduce health risks observed in this group during the postpartum period.

AB Embryo implantation in eutherian mammals is a highly complex process and requires reciprocal communication between different cell types of the embryo at the blastocyst stage and receptive uterus. The events of implantation are dynamic and highly orchestrated over a species-specific period of time with distinctive and overlapping expression of many genes. Delayed implantation in different species has helped elucidate some of the intricacies of implantation timing and different modes of the implantation process. How these events are coordinated in time and space are not clearly understood. We discuss potential regulators of the precise timing of these events with respect to central and local clock mechanisms. This review focuses on the timing and synchronization of early pregnancy events in mouse and consequences of their aberrations at later stages of pregnancy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To assess how change in sleep duration is related to subsequent obesity.
   Methods: In this 10-year follow-up, 4903 non-pregnant participants answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, obesity, and lifestyle factors (questions identical to baseline questionnaire). Habitual normal sleepers were defined as sleeping 6-9 h/night at both baseline and follow-up, whereas women sleeping <6 h/night or >= 9 h/night at both occasions were defined as habitual short sleepers and habitual long sleepers, respectively. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations between changes in sleep duration, general obesity (body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)), weight gain (>= 10 kg) and also, central obesity (waist circumference >= 88 cm), and increase in waist circumference (>= 10 cm) at follow-up.
   Results: Among younger women (aged <40 years) both habitual short sleepers and habitual long sleepers had a higher prevalence of general (short: 31.3%, P < 0.0001; long: 38.1%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (short: 60.5%, P = 0.01; long: 82.4%, P = 0.01) compared with habitual normal sleepers (general obesity: 8.9%; central obesity: 35.9%) at follow-up. Younger women who were short sleepers at baseline but normal sleepers at the follow-up had a higher prevalence of both general (19.3%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (45.4%, P = 0.07) compared with habitual normal sleepers at follow-up. In adjusted analyses, both habitual short [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71-17.0] and long (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09-19.8) sleep durations were risk factors for general obesity in younger women. In younger women habitual long sleep duration was a risk factor also for central obesity (aOR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.19-30.7) whereas habitual short sleep duration was not (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.87-4.81). Similar results were seen also for weight gain and increased waist circumference as dependent variables. In addition, decreased sleep duration from normal to short duration was a risk factor for both weight gain (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14-3.02) and increased waist circumference (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.20-2.81). There were no associations between changes in sleep duration and any of the measures of obesity at the follow-up in women aged >40 years at baseline.
   Conclusion: In younger women, both habitual short and long sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity, whereas no such relationship was seen in older women. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

ID PREECLAMPSIA; PREVIA; ULTRASOUND; SITE
AB Objective: This study investigates whether maternal socio-demographic and clinical characteristics influence the site of placental implantation so that placental localization and associated abnormalities can be predicted.
   Methods: This study reviews 500 healthy women with singleton pregnancy that were consecutively admitted to the study center and eventually delivered healthy newborns.
   Results: The most frequently observed sites of placentation were anterior uterine wall (53.2%), posterior uterine wall (28.8%), lateral uterine walls (10.0%) and uterine fundus (8.0%), respectively. The women with fundal placentation had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.044 and p = 0.040, respectively). Supine sleeping position was more frequent in women with anterior placenta and (OR: 11.568, 95% CI: 2.720-49.193) and prone sleeping position was more frequent in women with posterior placenta (OR: 15.449, 95% CI: 2.151-52.978) (p = 0.001). The women who favored to sleep in right lateral position were more likely to have lateral placentation, while the women who used to sleep in left lateral position were more likely to have fundal placentation (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Sleeping position in early pregnancy may influence placental implantation site. The probable mechanism may refer to the alterations in uterine perfusion which is induced by the change in systemic blood pressure and dominant sleeping position.

TI Does Tongue Size Contribute to Risk of Airway Narrowing in Preterm
   Infants Sitting in a Car Safety Seat?
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY

DT Article
DE car safety seat; preterm infant; upper airway size; tongue size
ID PREMATURE-INFANTS; OBSTRUCTION; INSERT; APNEA
AB Background Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size.
   Methods We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32.6 +/- 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 +/- 9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size.
   Results A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r(2) = 0.16, p = 0.11).
   Conclusion The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

AB Background: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Maori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device.
   Methods/Design: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Maori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns.
   Discussion: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide.

AB Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting in a pressing need to identify risk factors leading to effective interventions. Limited evidence suggests potential relationships between maternal sleep or vital exhaustion and preterm birth, yet the literature is generally inconclusive.
   Methods: We examined the relationship between maternal sleep duration and vital exhaustion in the first six months of pregnancy and spontaneous (non-medically indicated) preterm birth among 479 Peruvian women who delivered a preterm singleton infant (<37 weeks gestation) and 480 term controls who delivered a singleton infant at term (>= 37 weeks gestation). Maternal nightly sleep and reports of vital exhaustion were ascertained through in-person interviews. Spontaneous preterm birth cases were further categorized as those following either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. In addition, cases were categorized as very (<32 weeks), moderate (32-33 weeks), and late (34-<37 weeks) preterm birth for additional analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: After adjusting for confounders, we found that short sleep duration (<= 6 hours) was significantly associated with preterm birth (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19) compared to 7-8 hours of sleep. Vital exhaustion was also associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.79-3.23) compared to no exhaustion (P-trend <0.001). These associations remained significant for spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. We also found evidence of joint effects of sleep duration and vital exhaustion on the odds of spontaneous preterm birth.
   Conclusions: The results of this case-control study suggest maternal sleep duration, particularly short sleep duration, and vital exhaustion may be risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. These findings call for increased clinical attention to maternal sleep and the study of potential intervention strategies to improve sleep in early pregnancy with the aim of decreasing risk of preterm birth.

AB The mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and their intrinsic rhythmicity develop gradually during ontogenesis. In the rat, the SCN forms between embryonic day (E) 14 and E17, with gestation terminating at E21-22. Overt SCN rhythmicity is already present in the late embryonic stage. The aim of the present study was to determine when the fetal SCN clock develops in vivo and whether overt rhythmicity results from a functional fetal clock. To achieve this goal, the prenatal development of rhythmic expression of clock genes was measured with a more sensitive method for detection of the clock gene expression than previously. Fetal SCN were collected at 3 h intervals during the 24 h period on E19 and E21 by laser dissection and expression of clock genes (Per2, Nr1d1 and Bmal1) and genes related to cellular activity (c-fos, Avp and Vip) was measured by qRT PCR. At E19, the expression of canonical clock genes Per2 and Bmal1 was not rhythmic; however, the expression of all other studied genes followed clear circadian rhythms. At E21, Per2 and Bmal1 expression exhibited low amplitude but significant rhythmicity. From E19 to E21, the levels of the non-rhythmic transcripts (Per2 and Bmal1) decreased; however, the levels of the rhythmic transcripts (Nr1d1, c-fos, Avp and Vip) increased. In summary, these data demonstrate that at E19, rhythms in Per2 and Bmal1 expression were absent in the fetal SCN; however, the expression of Nr1d1 and other genes related to cellular activity was driven rhythmically. Therefore, at the early stage in vivo, the developing fetal SCN clock could theoretically be entrained by oscillation of Nr1d1 which may be driven by the maternal rather than fetal circadian system.

AB Heterogeneous anabolic capacity in cell populations can trigger a phenomenon known as cell competition, through which less active cells are eliminated. Cell competition has been induced experimentally in stem/precursor cell populations in insects and mammals and takes place endogenously in early mouse embryonic cells. Here, we show that cell competition can be efficiently induced in mouse cardiomyocytes by mosaic overexpression of Myc during both gestation and adult life. The expansion of the Myc-overexpressing cardiomyocyte population is driven by the elimination of wild-type cardiomyocytes. Importantly, this cardiomyocyte replacement is phenotypically silent and does not affect heart anatomy or function. These results show that the capacity for cell competition in mammals is not restricted to stem cell populations and suggest that stimulated cell competition has potential as a cardio-myocyte-replacement strategy.

AB Background: Though migraine and tension type headache are both commonly diagnosed in childhood, little is known about their determinants when diagnosed prior to puberty onset. Our aim was to determine psychosocial-and health-related risk factors of migraine and tension-type headache in 11 year old children.
   Methods: 871 New Zealand European children were enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth and data were collected at birth, 1, 3.5, 7, and 11 years of age. Primary headache was determined at age 11 years based on the International Headache Society. Perinatal factors assessed were small for gestational age status, sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress, and maternal school leaving age. Childhood factors assessed were sleep duration, percent body fat, television watching, parent and self-reported total problem behaviour, being bullied, and depression.
   Results: Prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was 10.5% and 18.6%, respectively. Both migraine and TTH were significantly associated with self-reported problem behaviour in univariable logistic regression analyses. Additionally, migraine was associated with reduced sleep duration, and both sleep and behaviour problems remained significant after multivariable analyses. TTH was also significantly associated with antenatal maternal smoking, higher body fat, and being bullied. For TTH, problem behaviour measured at ages 3.5 and 11 years both remained significant after multivariable analysis. Being born small for gestational age was not associated with either headache group.
   Conclusions: Although they share some commonality, migraine and tension-type headache are separate entities in childhood with different developmental characteristics. The association between primary headache and problem behaviour requires further investigation.

AB Intrauterine infection or inflammation in preterm neonates is a known risk for adverse neurological outcomes, including cognitive, motor and behavioral disabilities. Our previous data suggest that there is acute fetal brain inflammation in a mouse model of intrauterine exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We hypothesized that the in utero inflammation induced by LPS produces longterm electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the exposed mice that could be determined by using continuous quantitative video/EEG/electromyogram (EMG) analyses. A single LPS injection at E17 was performed in pregnant CD1 dams. Control dams were injected with same volumes of saline (LPS n = 10, Control n = 8). At postnatal age of P90-100, 24-h synchronous video/EEG/EMG recordings were done using a tethered recording system and implanted subdural electrodes. Behavioral state scoring was performed blind to treatment group, on each 10 s EEG epoch using synchronous video, EMG and EEG trace signatures to generate individual hypnograms. Automated EEG power spectrums were analyzed for delta and theta-beta power ratios during wake vs. sleep cycles. Both control and LPS hypnograms showed an ultradian wake/sleep cycling. Since rodents are nocturnal animals, control mice showed the expected diurnal variation with significantly longer time spent in wake states during the dark cycle phase. In contrast, the LPS-treated mice lost this circadian rhythm. Sleep microstructure also showed significant alteration in the LPS mice specifically during the dark cycle, caused by significantly longer average non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycle durations. No significance was found between treatment groups for the delta power data; however, significant activity-dependent changes in theta-beta power ratios seen in controls were absent in the LPS-exposed mice. In conclusion, exposure to in utero inflammation in CD1 mice resulted in significantly altered sleep architecture as adults that were circadian cycle and activity state dependent. (C) 2014 IBRO.

AB Introduction and Objectives: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a type of neurological disorder which presents with an uncontrollable urge to move legs and arms It commonly affects legs more than arms. Data regarding prevalence of restless legs syndrome in leprosy are sparse. The aims and objectives of the study were to find out the prevalence of RLS in people affected by leprosy and to determine the presence and magnitude of sleep disruption in leprosy patients with RLS.
   Materials and Methods: Total 143 patients diagnosed with leprosy were enrolled in the study. A diagnosis of RLS and a severity assessment were made using the criteria described by International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated in all those who were diagnosed with RLS.
   Results: Out of 143 patients recruited in the study, 56 (39.16%) patients were found to be suffering from RLS. Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score was higher (16.55), and the value was specifically higher among patients presenting with Type-2 lepra reaction (17.8) and pure neuritic leprosy (15.93).
   Conclusions: The frequency of RLS among leprosy patients is significantly higher. They suffer from bad sleep quality at night which significantly affects their quality of life. So all patients affected with leprosy should be evaluated for RLS and early treatment should be started to improve their sleep.

AB Objective. To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects. A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures. Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results. Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions. Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

AB In recent years the efficacy of endovascular venous stenting in idiopathic IIH treatment has been consistently reported, strongly suggesting that sinus stenosis should be viewed as a causative factor rather than a secondary phenomenon. We propose that in subjects carrying one or more collapsible segments of large cerebral venous collectors and exposed to a number of different promoting factors, sinus venous compression and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypertension may influence each other in a circular way, leading to a new relatively stable venous/CSF pressures balance state at higher values. The mechanism relay on self-limiting venous collapse (SVC) feedback-loop between the CSF pressure, that compresses the sinus, and the consequent venous pressure rise, that increases the CSF pressure. The result is the "coupled" increase of both pressure values, a phenomenon not expected in presence of sufficiently rigid central veins. Once the maximum stretch of venous wall is reached the loop stabilize at higher venous/CSF pressure values and become self-sustaining, therefore persisting even after the ceasing of the promoting factor. Notably, the SVC is reversible provided an adequate perturbation is carried to whichever side of the loop such as sinus venous stenting, on one hand, and CSF diversion or even a single CSF withdrawal by lumbar puncture (LP), on the other. The SVC model predicts that any condition leading to an increase of either, cerebral venous pressure or CSF pressure may trigger the feedback loop in predisposed individuals. Migraine with and without aura, a disease sharing with IIH a much higher prevalence among women of childbearing age, is associated with waves of significant brain hyperperfusion. These may lead to the congestion of large cerebral venous collectors and could represent a common SVC promoting condition in susceptible individuals. The SVC model give reason of the high specificity and sensitivity of sinus stenosis as IIH predictor and of the multiplicity of the factors that have been found associated with IIH. Moreover it might explain why, among the sinus stenosis carriers, young and overweight women are at higher risk of developing the disease. Finally, the SVC model fully explain the enigmatic longstanding remissions that can be commonly observed after a single LP with CSF subtraction in IIH with or without papilledema.

AB Objectives: To study the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in a certain rural area in Upper Egypt, identifying the factors that might be involved in its genesis.
   Study design: The current study is a cross-sectional community-based study.
   Methods: The study was conducted in El-Burgaia village, 5 km north to El-Minia city over a period of three months. Systematic random sampling was used to interview 200 female subjects, who gave birth within the last 14 months preceding interview. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was applied to these females to identify the presence of PPD.
   Results: The sample size analysed was 200 females, 99 (49.5%) of them had PPD (29.5% had minor PPD and 20% had major PPD). The age of the study subjects ranged between 19 and 45 years old (mean age 29 +/- 5.2 years). PPD occurred more significantly among wives of less educated husbands (P = 0.03). PPD was more common among those previously diagnosed of having depression or prescribed antidepressants (P = 0.02), in addition to those females experiencing financial problems after delivery (P = 0.0001). PPD was even more common among females having complications after delivery (P = 0.01). Using logistic regression analysis, total household income, child sleeping hours, complications after delivery and support of husband after delivery were found to be statistically associated with PPD.
   Conclusions: PPD is relatively common among rural females of El-Minia Governorate. Certain factors in these females, in the mere gestation and delivery after which they become depressed, and in the environment in which they live in, may all come to play a part in the emergence of their psychiatric illness.

AB Background Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for malaria prevention in HIV-negative pregnant women, but it is contraindicated in HIV-infected women taking daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CTXp) because of potential added risk of adverse effects associated with taking two antifolate drugs simultaneously. We studied the safety and efficacy of mefloquine (MQ) in women receiving CTXp and long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLITNs).
   Methods and Findings A total of 1,071 HIV-infected women from Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania were randomized to receive either three doses of IPTp-MQ (15 mg/kg) or placebo given at least one month apart; all received CTXp and a LLITN. IPTp-MQ was associated with reduced rates of maternal parasitemia (risk ratio [RR], 0.47 [95% CI 0.27-0.82]; p=0.008), placental malaria (RR, 0.52 [95% CI 0.29-0.90]; p=0.021), and reduced incidence of non-obstetric hospital admissions (RR, 0.59 [95% CI 0.37-0.95]; p=0.031) in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis. There were no differences in the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes between groups. Drug tolerability was poorer in the MQ group compared to the control group (29.6% referred dizziness and 23.9% vomiting after the first IPTp-MQ administration). HIV viral load at delivery was higher in the MQ group compared to the control group (p=0.048) in the ATP analysis. The frequency of perinatal mother to child transmission of HIV was increased in women who received MQ (RR, 1.95 [95% CI 1.14-3.33]; p=0.015). The main limitation of the latter finding relates to the exploratory nature of this part of the analysis.
   Conclusions An effective antimalarial added to CTXp and LLITNs in HIV-infected pregnant women can improve malaria prevention, as well as maternal health through reduction in hospital admissions. However, MQ was not well tolerated, limiting its potential for IPTp and indicating the need to find alternatives with better tolerability to reduce malaria in this particularly vulnerable group. MQ was associated with an increased risk of mother to child transmission of HIV, which warrants a better understanding of the pharmacological interactions between antimalarials and antiretroviral drugs.
   Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00811421; Pan African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR 2010020001813440Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary Editors' Summary Background Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills about 600,000 people every year. Most of these deaths occur among young children living in sub-Saharan Africa but pregnant women living in Africa are also very vulnerable to malaria. Infection with malaria during pregnancy can cause severe maternal anemia (reduced red blood cell numbers), stillbirths, and pre-term and low-birthweight babies, and is responsible for the deaths of many African women and their babies. To reduce the loss of life from malaria in pregnancy, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that pregnant women living in Africa receive the antimalarial drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) at each scheduled antenatal care visit given at least a month apart (intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy [IPTp]). In addition, WHO advises pregnant women to sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets to protect themselves from the bites of infected mosquitoes and recommends effective case management of pregnant women with malarial illness.
   Why Was This Study Done? Pregnant women living in Africa are often infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV infection increases both the risk and severity of malaria infection during pregnancy, and at least one million pregnancies are complicated by co-infection with malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa every year. WHO recommends that HIV-positive pregnant women take cotrimoxazole (CTX) daily to prevent opportunistic infections (CTX prophylaxis [CTXp]). Unfortunately, both CTX and SP are antifolate drugs and taking two drugs of this type increases a woman's risk of developing a severe skin reaction. Moreover, although CTXp protects children and HIV-infected adults against malaria, it is not known whether CTXp alone protects HIV-infected pregnant women adequately against malaria. Thus, evaluations of alternative drugs for use in IPTp in HIV-positive pregnant women are needed. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, the researchers study the safety and efficacy of the antimalarial drug mefloquine (MQ) in HIV-infected women receiving CTXp. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial compares outcomes among people chosen through the play of chance to receive either the drug under investigation or a dummy (placebo) drug.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers allocated 1,071 HIV-infected pregnant women from Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania to receive three doses of MQ (IPTp-MQ), given at least one month apart, or three doses of placebo. All the women received CTXp and were given an insecticide-treated bed net. In an intention-to-treat analysis (an analysis that considers the outcomes of all trial participants irrespective of whether they receive their allocated treatment), the prevalence of parasitemia (parasites in the blood) at delivery among women given IPTp-MQ was 3.5% whereas the prevalence among women given the placebo was 6.9%. In other words, compared to placebo, IPTp-MQ was associated with a reduced risk of maternal parasitemia. IPTp-MQ was also associated with a reduced rate of placental malaria (parasites in the placenta) and a reduced incidence of hospital admissions for non-pregnancy related causes. There was no difference in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as stillbirth between the intervention groups but drug tolerability was poorer in the MQ group than in the placebo group. Finally, in an exploratory (unplanned) according-to-protocol analysis (an analysis that only considers outcomes in trial participants who receive their allocated intervention), women in the MQ group had a higher HIV viral load at delivery than women in the control group and were nearly twice as likely to transmit HIV to their child around the time of birth.
   What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest that the addition of IPTp-MQ to CTXp and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets can improve malaria prevention and maternal health in HIV-infected pregnant women in Africa. However, the poor tolerability of MQ and the association of MQ treatment with both an increased HIV viral load at delivery and a higher frequency of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV when compared to placebo raise concerns about the use of MQ in IPTp. Because these last two findings came from an exploratory analysis, which is more likely to throw up a chance finding than a pre-planned analysis further studies are needed to confirm these unexpected but potentially important findings. Nevertheless, overall, the findings of this study suggest that MQ should not be recommended for IPTp in HIV-infected pregnant women in Africa and highlight the need to find alternative drugs for malaria prevention in this group of women who are particularly vulnerable to malaria.

AB In the past decades, the life course approach has gained importance in studies on the timing and incidence of childbirth. It allows a complex analysis of fertility. Following this approach, family formation and parenthood are perceived as instrumental goals of individual welfare production over the life course. In addition, the analysis of fertility has to take into account three kinds of essential interdependence: time dependence of the life course, multilevel structure of the life course and multidimensionality of the life course. As a consequence future fertility research should emphasize more on pre-decisional individual dispositions and behavioral intentions, should take into account more seriously that fertility takes place in the context of interdependent social relationships and social groups, and address changes in the cultural and institutional environment. The aim of this special issue is to present a series of empirical studies touching upon some of these aspects and therefore substantially contributing to progress in contemporary longitudinal fertility research. The twelve contributions deal with childbearing intentions and outcomes in multidimensional life courses; dyadic decision-making and social influences on fertility; and the interdependence of spatial mobility, regional context, culture, and fertility.

AB Background: Malaria is one the major health problem in Nigeria. During pregnancy, it poses serious threat to the survival of both unborn foetus and the mothers. This study determined the effect of adequate malaria knowledge and pregnancy status of women on use of mosquito nets and reported malaria fever morbidity.
   Methods: The data were collected during the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) from 4632 women. Data analyses were carried out with descriptive statistics and Seemingly Unrelated Bivariate Probit regression.
   Results: Results show that 13.19% of the women were pregnant, of which about one-third slept under mosquito nets. Also, 25.26% reported malaria associated fever in the previous two weeks to the time of interview, while 78.28% correctly answered that mosquitoes are responsible for malaria. Knowledge on malaria prevention was low with 55.70% and 14.93% indicating sleeping under mosquito nets and ITN, respectively. Probability of sleeping under mosquito nets significantly increased with knowing that sleeping under mosquito nets and ITN could prevent malaria while it decreased with having fever, age, urban residence and knowing that use of mosquito spray and coil can prevent malaria. The probability of having fever increased significantly with household size, being pregnant and age at first birth but decreased with age, knowing that sleeping under ITN, cutting grasses and closing door/windows would prevent malaria.
   Conclusions: Use of mosquito nets among the women was low. Also, efforts to enhance their knowledge on malaria prevention and ensuring adequate access to mosquito nets especially for pregnant women would curtail the impact of malaria.

AB The aim of this study was to identify the changes of perceived health status, physical symptoms, and sleep satisfaction of postpartum women over time. A longitudinal design was used. Participants were 137 healthy postpartum women who had not been diagnosed with any medical diseases. Data were collected by a self-report questionnaire at three periods, the second day, 4-6 weeks, and 12-14 weeks postpartum. Women's perceived health status was lower at 4-6 weeks than on the second day after childbirth, physical symptoms were more frequent at 4-6 weeks than on the second day after childbirth, and sleep satisfaction was lower at 4-6 weeks than at 12-14 weeks postpartum. Tiredness or fatigue was the most frequent symptom experienced by postpartum women at all three periods. These results indicate that the period from 4 to 6 weeks postpartum is the most difficult time for mothers. Therefore, there is a need to develop nursing interventions to alleviate fatigue and other symptoms, and to help and support women during the period 4-6 weeks postpartum, a critical period for interventions.

AB Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and may be influenced by a multitude of factors. Pregnancy physiology may predispose to sleep disruption but may also result in worsening of some underlying sleep disorders, and the de novo development of others. Apart from sleep disordered breathing, the impact of sleep disorders on pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes is poorly understood. In this article, we review the literature and discuss available data pertaining to the most common sleep disorders in perinatal women. These include restless legs syndrome, insomnia, circadian pattern disturbances, narcolepsy, and sleep-disordered breathing.

AB Although progesterone is most commonly regarded in terms of its role in the female estrous cycle, reproductive behavior, and pregnancy, progesterone is also a precursor to corticosterone (CORT) and is released from the adrenal glands of both sexes in response to stress. However, the relationship between plasma CORT and progesterone during times of stress has not been well established. To better characterize dynamic changes in progesterone release as a result of stressor exposure, plasma progesterone levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay under multiple conditions, including after stress exposure (footshock, restraint, and forced swim), manipulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (injection of metyrapone or dexamethasone, or adrenalectomy), and in response to CRH and ACTH injections. When plasma levels of ACTH, CORT, and progesterone were analyzed across studies, CORT and progesterone were found to be highly correlated and rarely dissociated. Additionally, it appears that in male rats, the adrenal glands are the principle source of circulating progesterone in response to stress. Interestingly, a detailed time course indicated lack of a circadian rhythm of progesterone secretion, despite a robust rhythm of circulating CORT. The current studies provide critical new information on the coincident release of progesterone and CORT in response to stress and their somewhat paradoxical dissociation across the circadian rhythm. These findings provide an important foundation for future studies that will examine the role of stress-induced progesterone in behavioral, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrine responses to stress.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate the differences between Jordanian depressed women and non-depressed women in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics during their pregnancy. A convenience sample of 218 Jordanian pregnant women in their third trimester was selected for this study from three major Governorates in Jordan (Amman, Irbid and Zarqa), and the antenatal clinics of teaching hospitals (Jordan University Hospital and King Abdullah University Hospital) were accessed to collect the data. A demographical sheet and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used to collect data. There was a significant difference in EPDS scores between smokers and non-smokers, primiparous and multiparous women, and also between women with secondary or lower education and those with diploma or higher education. Higher EPDS scores were classified as a >= 13 and lower EPDS scores as <13. However, there were no significant differences in the age, income and sleeping hours for women with higher EPDS scores compared with those with lower EPDS scores. This study showed that there are differences between pregnant women who had depression symptoms and pregnant women who did not have depression symptoms in relation to some sociodemographic variables (smoking status, education level and parity).

AB Background: Pregnant women with complications including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during the second and third trimesters.
   Methods: We enrolled 56 women in their second or third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations were measured as a biological indicator of stress.
   Results: PSS scores and subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the second and third trimesters, respectively).
   Mean one-day values for SIgA were 168.3 and 205.7 mu g/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester.
   Discussion: This investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared with the second trimester. (C) 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

AB Objective: To examine the effects of high-fat (HF) diet-induced maternal obesity on follicular population and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries.
   Design: Experimental mouse study.
   Setting: Laboratory.
   Animal(s): Mice on HF diet.
   Intervention(s): Female C57BL/6J mice were fed an HF or standard chow (C) diet 6 weeks before conception, through pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were fed the C or HF diet from weaning, creating the HF/HF, HF/C, C/HF, C/C offspring groups.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Follicular counts and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries.
   Result(s): Prenatal exposure to maternal HF nutrition resulted in the reduction of primordial, antral, and Graafian follicle numbers in offspring ovaries (both HF/C and HF/HF). Expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis (FoXO3 alpha), follicular growth and development (Gdf9), and circadian rhythms generation (Clock and Bmal1) were elevated in the ovaries of HF/C and HF/HF offspring, while expression of the circadian clock genes Cry1 and Per1 were lower in HF/HF ovaries.
   Conclusion(s): Maternal obesity during pregnancy has long-term deleterious consequences on follicular growth and development in the adult offspring ovaries, which may impact their reproductive potential. (C) 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB Objective To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children.
   Study design Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old.
   Results Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association.
   Conclusions Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to measure the brain activity of preterm infants treated with caffeine citrate and doxapram for preterm apnoea, using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), to identify any adverse effects on cerebral function.
   Methods: We analysed the aEEG tracings of 13 preterm infants <30 weeks of gestation before, during and after doxapram treatment, with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and discontinuous patterns), occurrence of sleep-wake cycling and appearance of electrographic seizure activity. They were also compared with 61 controls without doxapram treatment.
   Results: During doxapram treatment, aEEG tracings showed an increase in continuous background activity (19 +/- 30% before treatment, 38 +/- 35% during treatment) and a decrease in discontinuous patterns. In addition, they showed more frequent electrographic seizure activity (0% before treatment, 15 +/- 37% during treatment) and less frequent sleep-wake cycling (92 +/- 27% before treatment, 85 +/- 37% during treatment) could be observed. These results were confirmed when compared to the control group.
   Conclusion: Doxapram treatment influences aEEG in preterm infants, showing higher percentages of continuous activity as well as more electrographic seizure activity and less sleep-wake cycling. It should, therefore, be used with caution in very preterm infants.

AB This paper examines the existence of social interactions in malaria preventive behaviors in Sub-Saharan Africa, that is, whether an individual's social environment has an influence on the individual's preventive behaviors. We focus on the two population groups which are the most vulnerable to malaria (children under 5 years and pregnant women) and on two preventive behaviors (sleeping under a bednet and taking intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy). We define the social environment of the individual as people living in the same region. To detect social interactions, we calculate the size of the social multiplier by comparing the effects of an exogenous variable at individual and regional levels. Our data come from 92 surveys for 29 Sub-Saharan countries between 1999 and 2012, and they cover approximately 660,000 children and 95,000 women. Our results indicate that there are social interactions in malaria preventive behaviors in the form of social multipliers effects of women's education and household wealth. The long-run effects of these characteristics on preventive behaviors at the regional level are larger than those apparent at the individual level. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Internal temporal organisation properly synchronised to the environment is crucial for health maintenance. This organisation is provided at the cellular level by the molecular clock, a macromolecular transcription-based oscillator formed by the clock and the clock-controlled genes that is present in both central and peripheral tissues. In mammals, melanopsin in light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells plays a considerable role in the synchronisation of the circadian timing system to the daily light/dark cycle. Melatonin, a hormone synthesised in the pineal gland exclusively at night and an output of the central clock, has a fundamental role in regulating/timing several physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion and energy metabolism. As such, metabolism is severely impaired after a reduction in melatonin production. Furthermore, light pollution during the night and shift work schedules can abrogate melatonin synthesis and impair homeostasis. Chronodisruption during pregnancy has deleterious effects on the health of progeny, including metabolic, cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction. Developmental programming by steroids or steroid-mimetic compounds also produces internal circadian disorganisation that may be a significant factor in the aetiology of fertility disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Thus, both early and late in life, pernicious alterations of the endogenous temporal order by environmental factors can disrupt the homeostatic function of the circadian timing system, leading to pathophysiology and/or disease.

AB Background: Pregnancy-associated sleep disorder is a new category on the latest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. It is a significant problem for pregnant women.
   Purpose: The present follow-up study assesses the association between sleep quality during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and obstetric-neonatal outcomes.
   Methods: Aprospective follow-up study design was used. Follow-up examination of the obstetric birth records in the immediate postpartum period were carried out on 128 second-trimester and 120 third-trimester women and their newborns in two hospitals in Taiwan. Poor sleep quality was identified using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were collected from October 2007 to June 2008.
   Results: The prevalence of poor sleepers (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score > 5) was 58% for second-trimester participants and 66% for third-trimester participants; participants who were unemployed reported a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality than those who were employed. Subsequent review of the participant's obstetric birth records revealed that third-trimester poor sleepers were more likely to have had a vacuum-assisted delivery.
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: This study identified poor sleep quality during the third trimester as a novel risk factor for vacuum-assisted delivery. We suggest that prenatal healthcare providers focus greater attention to the sleep disturbance condition of pregnant women and provide proactive sleep counseling to facilitate pregnant women's adjustment to the new psychosocial and physiological demands of motherhood.

AB Aim: To explore the role of maternal personality (hardiness), sleep-related cognitions and bedtime involvement in child sleep behaviour during the second post-natal year in a sample of spontaneous and assisted conception first-time mothers.
   Method: Mothers (n = 134 (spontaneous (n = 81); assisted (n = 53) conception)) reported on a resilience measure (hardiness) during pregnancy and child sleep at 7 and 19 months post-partum. At 19 months post-partum, mothers also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their child's bedtime, and half the sample used Actigraph monitors (Acitiwatch-16, Mini Mitter Co. Inc, Bend, OR, USA) to validate maternal report of child sleep.
   Results: No significant differences were found between spontaneous and assisted conception mothers on any of the study variables; therefore, assisted and spontaneous samples were combined. Structural equation modelling confirmed that lower pre-birth maternal hardiness was associated with more problematic sleep-related cognitions (beta = 0.23, P < 0.01) and involvement at bedtime (beta = 0.29, P < 0.01) and poorer child sleep outcomes (beta = -0.33, P < 0.001) during toddlerhood, even after considering concurrent maternal mood and child temperament.
   Conclusions: Pre-birth maternal hardiness rather than mode of conception contributes to parenting cognitions and behaviour around child sleep and, ultimately, toddlers' sleep outcomes. Findings suggest that targeting negative maternal perceptions of control and efficacy through clinical interventions could benefit toddlers' sleep.

AB Purposes: To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-11) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major depression and women outside the perinatal period.
   Methods: 572 pregnant women in the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory II and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at three months postpartum. Ninety non pregnant women or that did not have a child in the last year (mean age=29.42 7.159 years) also filled in the cjuestionnaires.
   Results: Non depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the BDI II total score and in its Somatic Anxiety dimension. Non depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes.
   Limitations: Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed foi the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-11 mean score was similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age.
   Conclusion: In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed. Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of perinatal depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparing two approaches for estimating the causal effect of
   behaviour-change communication messages promoting insecticide-treated
   bed nets: an analysis of the 2010 Zambia malaria indicator survey
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Malaria; Behaviour-change communication; Insecticide-treated bed net;
   Long-lasting; Insecticidal-treated bed net; Zambia
ID HEALTH INTERVENTIONS; TANZANIA; ETHIOPIA; CHILDREN; IMPACT
AB Over the past decade, efforts to increase the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) have relied primarily on the routine distribution of bed nets to pregnant women attending antenatal services or on the mass distribution of bed nets to households. While these distributions have increased the proportion of households owning ITNs and the proportion of people sleeping under an ITN the night prior to the survey, the role that behaviour-change communication (BCC) plays in the use of ITNs remains unquantified.
   This paper uses two analytic approaches, propensity score matching and treatment effect modelling, to examine the relationship between exposure to the BCC messages and the use of a bed net the previous night, using the 2010 Zambia Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS).
   When matched on similar propensity scores, a statistically significant 29.5 percentage point difference in ITN use is observed between exposed and unexposed respondents. Fifty-nine per cent of unexposed respondents reported sleeping under an ITN the previous night, compared to 88% of the exposed respondents. A smaller but similarly significant difference between exposed and unexposed groups, 12.7 percentage points, is observed in the treatment effect model, which also controls for the number of bed nets owned by the household and exposure to malaria information from health workers.
   Using either approach, a statistically significant effect of exposure to BCC messages on a woman's use of an ITN was found. Propensity score matching has the advantage of using statistically-matched pairs and relying on the assumption that given the measured covariates, outcome is independent of treatment assignment (conditional independence assumption), thereby allowing us to mimic a randomized control trial. Results from propensity score matching indicate that BCC messages account for a 29-percentage point increase in the use of ITNs among Zambian households that already own at least one ITN.
   These analyses serve to illustrate that BCC programmes can contribute to national programmes seeking to increase the use of ITNs inside the home. They also offer a viable approach for evaluating the effectiveness of other BCC programmes promoting behaviour that will reduce malaria transmission or mitigate the consequences of infection.

AB Background: Assessment of quality of life after childbirth is an important health-outcome measurement for new mothers and is of special interest in midwifery. The Mother-Generated Index (MGI) is a validated instrument to assess postnatal quality of life. The tool has not been applied for making a cross-cultural comparison before. This study investigated (a) responses to the MGI in German-speaking women in Germany and Switzerland; and (b) associations between MGI scores on the one hand and maternity and midwifery care on the other.
   Methods: A two-stage survey was conducted in two rural hospitals 10 km apart, on opposite sides of the German-Swiss border. The questionnaires included the MGI and questions on socio-demographics, physical and mental health and maternity care, and were distributed during the first days after birth and six weeks postpartum. Parametric and non-parametric tests were computed with the statistical programme SPSS.
   Results: A total of 129 questionnaires were returned an average of three days after birth and 83 in the follow-up after seven weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in the MGI scores between the German and the Swiss women (p = 0.22). Significantly more favourable MGI scores were found associated with more adequate information during pregnancy (p = 0.02), a more satisfactory birth experience (p < 0.01), epidural anaesthesia (p < 0.01), more information (p = 0.01) and better support (p = 0.02) during the time in hospital and less disturbed sleep (p < 0.01). Significantly lower MGI scores were associated with the presence of a private doctor during birth (p = 0.01) and with exclusive breastfeeding during the first postnatal days (p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: The MGI scores of these German-speaking women were higher than those in other studies reported previously. Thus the tool may be able to detect differences in postnatal quality of life among women with substantially divergent cultural backgrounds. Shortcomings in maternity and midwifery care were detected, as for example the inadequate provision of information during pregnancy, a lack of individualised postpartum care during the hospital stay and insufficient support for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. The MGI is an appropriate instrument for maternity care outcome measurement in cross-cultural comparison research.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The aim of the survey was to document medicinal plants used in malaria treatment by Prometra (Promocion de la medicina tradicional amazonica) Traditional Medical Practitioners (TMPs) of Uganda and for search of new antiplasmodial herbal medicines (HMs) for further phytochemical analysis.
   Materials and methods: In this study, semi structured guided open and close ended questionnaires were used. Focus group discussions were conducted and key informants were chosen within the TMPs who helped in further discussions of how the herbal remedies where collected, prepared and administered.
   Results: A sample size of 51 respondents was randomly selected among the TMPs with the help of their leader. 86 species distributed over 81 genera and 39 families were reportedly being used as herbal remedies in malaria treatment. The TMPs use symptoms like high temperature, shivering, among others in malaria diagnosis an indication that they understand malaria. They emphasized the use of leaves and bark in treatment because they can regenerate and therefore ensure sustainable use of plants rather than the use of roots which would be destructive. These TMPS treat and also advise their patients on preventive measures against malaria attacks like sleeping under mosquito nets, clearing bushes near homesteads, among others which is an indication that they help in the prevention and mitigation of malaria incidences and prevalence in the areas where they live. The Informant Consensus Factor (FIC) value of 0.8 demonstrated that the TMPs of Prometra-Uganda tend to agree with each other in terms of the plant species they use in malaria treatment an indication of quality control in as far as administration of the herbal remedies. Vernonia amygdalina Delile, Bidens pilosa L., Justicia betonica L. were highly cited as being used in malaria treatment with frequencies of mention of 38, 28 and 25, respectively.
   Conclusion: TMPs of Prometra-Uganda understand and treat malaria using the available plant diversity from their huge forest and the herbal gardens within Buyija forest. The healers are very keen at plant conservation which is a good practice. Species like Justica betonica may be investigated further for antiplasmodial assays to justify its efficacy.

AB The endogenous timing system within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus drives the cyclic expression of the clock molecules across the 24 h day-night cycle controlling downstream molecular pathways and physiological processes. The developing fetal clock system is sensitive to the environment and physiology of the pregnant mother and as such disruption of this system could lead to altered physiology in the offspring. Characterizing the gene profiles of the endogenous molecular clock system by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is dependent on normalization by appropriate housekeeping genes (HKGs). However, many HKGs commonly used as internal controls, although stably expressed under control conditions, can vary significantly in their expression under certain experimental conditions. Here we analyzed the expression of 10 classic HKG across the 24 h light-dark cycle in the SCN of mouse offspring exposed to normal chow or a high fat diet during early development and in postnatal life. We found that the HKGs glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta actin and adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit to be the most stably expressed genes in the SCN regardless of diet or time within the 24 h light-dark cycle, and are therefore suitable to be used as internal controls. However SCN samples collected during the light and dark periods did show differences in expression and as such the timing of collection should be considered when carrying out gene expression studies.

AB Objective: To summarize the role of melatonin and circadian rhythms in determining optimal female reproductive physiology, especially at the peripheral level.
   Design: Databases were searched for the related English-language literature published up to March 1, 2014. Only papers in peer-reviewed journals are cited.
   Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Not applicable.
   Intervention(s): Melatonin treatment, alterations of the normal light: dark cycle and light exposure at night.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Melatonin levels in the blood and in the ovarian follicular fluid and melatonin synthesis, oxidative damage and circadian rhythm disturbances in peripheral reproductive organs.
   Result(s): The central circadian regulatory system is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The output of this master clock is synchronized to 24 hours by the prevailing light-dark cycle. The SCN regulates rhythms in peripheral cells via the autonomic nervous system and it sends a neural message to the pineal gland where it controls the cyclic production of melatonin; after its release, the melatonin rhythm strengthens peripheral oscillators. Melatonin is also produced in the peripheral reproductive organs, including granulosa cells, the cumulus oophorus, and the oocyte. These cells, along with the blood, may contribute melatonin to the follicular fluid, which has melatonin levels higher than those in the blood. Melatonin is a powerful free radical scavenger and protects the oocyte from oxidative stress, especially at the time of ovulation. The cyclic levels of melatonin in the blood pass through the placenta and aid in the organization of the fetal SCN. In the absence of this synchronizing effect, the offspring may exhibit neurobehavioral deficits. Also, melatonin protects the developing fetus from oxidative stress. Melatonin produced in the placenta likewise may preserve the optimal function of this organ.
   Conclusion(s): Both stable circadian rhythms and cyclic melatonin availability are critical for optimal ovarian physiology and placental function. Because light exposure after darkness onset at night disrupts the master circadian clock and suppresses elevated nocturnal melatonin levels, light at night should be avoided.

AB Short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia frequently characterize sleep in pregnancy during all three trimesters. We aimed: (i) to review the clinical evidence of the association between conditions of sleep loss during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) to discuss the potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may be involved. A systematic search of cross-sectional, longitudinal studies using Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO, and MeSH headings and key words for conditions of sleep loss such as 'insomnia', 'poor sleep quality', 'short sleep duration', and 'pregnancy outcome' was made for papers published between January 1, 1960 and July 2013. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria for sleep loss and pregnancy outcome: seven studies on prenatal depression, three on gestational diabetes, three on hypertension, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, six on length of labor/type of delivery, eight on preterm birth, and three on birth grow/birth weight. Two main results emerged: (i) conditions of chronic sleep loss are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) chronic sleep loss yields a stress-related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and abnormal immune/inflammatory, reaction, which, in turn, influences pregnancy outcome negatively. Chronic sleep loss frequently characterizes sleep throughout the course of pregnancy and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Common pathophysiological mechanisms emerged as being related to stress system activation. We propose that in accordance to the allostatic load hypothesis, chronic sleep loss during pregnancy may also be regarded as both a result of stress and a physiological stressor per se, leading to stress 'overload'. It may account for adverse pregnancy outcomes and somatic and mental disorders in pregnancy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The developing central nervous system may be particularly sensitive to bisphenol A (BPA)-induced alterations. Here, pregnant Sprague Dawley rats (n = 11-12/group) were gavaged daily with vehicle, 2.5 or 25.0 mu g/kg BPA, or 5.0 or 10.0 mu g/kg ethinyl estradiol (EE2) on gestational days 6-21. The BPA doses were selected to be below the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 5 mg/kg/day. On postnatal days 1-21, all offspring/litter were orally treated with the same dose. A naive control group was not gavaged. Body weight, pubertal age, estrous cyclicity, and adult serum hormone levels were measured. Adolescent play, running wheel activity, flavored solution intake, female sex behavior, and manually elicited lordosis were assessed. No significant differences existed between the vehicle and naive control groups. Vehicle controls exhibited significant sexual dimorphism for most behaviors, indicating these evaluations were sensitive to sex differences. However, only EE2 treatment caused significant effects. Relative to female controls, EE2-treated females were heavier, exhibited delayed vaginal opening, aberrant estrous cyclicity, increased play behavior, decreased running wheel activity, and increased aggression toward the stimulus male during sexual behavior assessments. Relative to male controls, EE2-treatedmales were older at testes descent and preputial separation and had lower testosterone levels. These results suggest EE2-induced masculinization/defeminization of females and are consistent with increased volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) at weaning in female siblings of these subjects (He, Z., Paule, M. G. and Ferguson, S. A. (2012) Low oral doses of bisphenol A increase volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area in male, but not female, rats at postnatal day 21. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 34, 331-337). Although EE2 treatment caused pubertal delays and decreased testosterone levels in males, their behaviors were within the range of controlmales. Conversely, BPA treatment did not alter anymeasured endpoint. Similar to our previous reports (Ferguson, S. A., Law, C. D. Jr and Abshire, J. S. (2011) Developmental treatment with bisphenolAor ethinyl estradiol causes few alterations on early preweaning measures. Toxicol. Sci. 124, 149-160; Ferguson, S. A., Law, C. D. and Abshire, J. S. (2012) Developmental treatment with bisphenol A causes few alterations on measures of postweaning activity and learning. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 34, 598-606), the BPA doses and design used here produced few alterations.

AB Objective:
   This narrative review describes the differential diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, and provides an overview of the evidence for the associations between RLS and potential comorbidities. Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized.
   Methods:
   The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications.
   Results and Conclusions:
   Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder.

AB Background: Chronic fatigue (CF) is an important late effect after childhood malignancies. Our aim was to assess CF persistence over time, concurrent comorbidities, and associations with clinical symptoms.
   Procedure: A total of 102 long-term survivors of childhood lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 53 and 49 reporting CF and no CF, respectively, at time point (TP)1, were evaluated for CF at a second TP after a median interval of 2.7 years. At TP2 a survey, including self-reported and objectively measured variables, assessed depressive symptoms, pain, and physical activity.
   Results: A total of 32 of the 53 reported CF cases at both TPs and 40/49 survivors had no CF at both TPs, whereas 30 had changed their fatigue status between first and second assessment (converters). Major somatic comorbidities were equally distributed among the groups. After exclusion of converters and survivors with major comorbidity/pregnancy, 27 persistent CF (PCF) cases and 35 controls were compared. PCF cases reported significantly more depression, sleeping problems, anxiety, pain, and reduced physical function. Further, they were less physically active than controls (steps/d; P = 0.009). In a multiple regression analysis, depressive symptoms remained the only significant predictor of PCF.
   Conclusions: Long-term survivors of childhood cancer with PCF are characterized by more depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain, insomnia, and less physical activity.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status and neurodevelopment in the offsprings of gestational diabetic mothers (ODMs).
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed. The offspring of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 19 insulin-treated GDM) were recruited. Maternal and venoUs cord plasma DHA percentages were analyzed. Skin temperature and activity in children were recorded for 72 h at 3 and 6 months of life. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development II (BSID II) at 6 and 12 months of age.
   RESULTS: Cord plasma DHA percentage was significantly lower in the ODMs compared with that in the controls (Control 6.43 [5.04-7.82](a); GDM+diet 5.65 [4.44-6.86](ab); GDM+insulin 5.53 [4.45-6.61](b)). Both mental (Control 102.71 [97.61-107.81](a); GDM+diet 100.39 [91.43-109.35](a); GDM+insulin 93.94 [88.31-99.57](b)) and psychomotor (Control 91.52 [81.82-101.22](a); GDM+diet 81.67 [73.95-89.39](b); GDM+insulin 81.89 [71.96-91.85](b) scores evaluated by the BSID II were significantly lower at 6 months in ODMs, even after adjusting for confounding factors such as breastfeeding, maternal educational level and gender. Cord plasma DHA percentage correlated with the psychomotor score from BSID II (r= 0.27; P=0.049) and with the intra-daily variability in activity (r= -0.24; P=0.043) at 6 months. Maternal DHA was correlated with several sleep rhythm maturation parameters at 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lower DHA levels in cord plasma of ODMs could affect their neurodevelopment. Maternal DHA status was also associated with higher values in the sleep rhythm maturation parameters of children.

AB Non-dipping circadian blood pressure (BP) is a common finding in preeclampsia, accompanied by adverse outcomes. Melatonin plays pivotal role in biological circadian rhythms. This study investigated the relationship between melatonin secretion and circadian BP rhythm in preeclampsia. Cases were women with preeclampsia treated between January 2006 and June 2007 in the University Hospital of Larissa. Volunteers with normal pregnancy, matched for chronological and gestational age, served as controls. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP monitoring was applied. Serum melatonin and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were determined in day and night time samples by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Measurements were repeated 2 months after delivery. Thirty-one women with preeclampsia and 20 controls were included. Twenty-one of the 31 women with preeclampsia were non-dippers. Compared to normal pregnancy, in preeclampsia there were significantly lower night time melatonin (48.4 +/- 24.7 vs. 85.4 +/- 26.9 pg/mL, p < 0.001) levels. Adjustment for circadian BP rhythm status ascribed this finding exclusively to non-dippers (p < 0.01). Two months after delivery, in 11 of the 21 non-dippers both circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm reappeared. In contrast, in cases with retained non-dipping status (n=10) melatonin secretion rhythm remained impaired: daytime versus night time melatonin (33.5 +/- 13.0 vs. 28.0 +/- 13.8 pg/mL, p=0.386). Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were, overall, similar to serum melatonin. Circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm follow parallel course in preeclampsia, both during pregnancy and, at least 2 months after delivery. Our findings may be not sufficient to implicate a putative therapeutic effect of melatonin, however, they clearly emphasize that its involvement in the pathogenesis of a non-dipping BP in preeclampsia needs intensive further investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE; We sought to ascertain the validity of two screening scales for obstructive sleep apnea (QSA) in: pregnancy and to establish the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective Observational study, two screening scales were administered. Screen positive Subjects were referred for diagnostic polysomnography (PSG); if admitted for antepartum care; screen positive subjects underwent a modified study with a type 3 device (T3D).
   RESULT: A total of 1509 subjects underwent OSA screening; 58 completed diagnostic testing. Neither measure was a reliable diagnostic tool for OSA as determined by T3D or PSG (detection rates of 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively). Among screen positive subjects undergoing PSG or T3D testing, 15.5% ultimately met 'gold standard' OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point Prevalence of 4.9%.
   CONCLUSION: In this prospective trial, screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire or Epworth sleepiness scale was poorly predictive of OSA among gravidae and was associated with a high false referral rate.

AB Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression (X (2) 13.39; p < 0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was also associated with probable depression (X (2) 9.20 p < 0.01), though this was attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute 'sleep-related causes' to their low mood (X (2) 20.78; p < 0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between neck circumference (NC) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in the third trimester pregnant women. Methods: The study included 126 women who were in the third trimester pregnancy. All subjects completed a standard sleep questionnaire, anthropometric measurements and ultrasonic testing. Results: Pregnant women with NC >= 34.7 cm had significantly higher frequency of PIH than pregnant women with NC < 34.7 cm (35.6% versus 2.5%, chi(2) = 25.863, p = 0.000). Conclusions: The increase of NC was independent risk factor for PIH in the third trimester pregnant women.

AB Although sleep complaints are very common among pregnant women, the potential adverse effects of sleep disturbance on the offspring are not well studied. Growing evidence suggests that maternal stress can induce an inflammatory environment on the fetal development. But people are not sure about the consequences of prenatal stress such as the inflammatory responses induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD). In the present study, we investigated the effects of MSD on long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences in offspring and its underlying inflammatory response pathway. The pregnant Wistar rats received prolonged sleep deprivation (72 h) on gestational day (GD) 4, 9, and 18, respectively. The post-natal day (PND) 21 offspring showed impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze task and anhedonia in sucrose preference experiment. Quantification of BrdtU(+) and DCX+ cells revealed a significant decrease in hippocampus neurogenesis in prepuberty offspring, especially for the late MSD (GD 18) group. Real-time RT-PCR showed that after MSD, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha) increased in the hippocampus of offspring on PND 1, 7, 14 and 21, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 reduced at the same time. Immunofluorescence found that the cells of activated microglia were higher in the brains of MSD offspring. Taken together, these results suggested that the MSD-induced inflammatory response is an important factor for neurogenesis impairment and neurobehavioral outcomes in prepuberty offspring.

AB Knowledge of factors influencing the timing of reproduction is important for animal conservation and management. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) are able to vary the birth date of their cubs in response to their fat stores, but little information is available about the timing of implantation and parturition in free-ranging brown bears. Body temperature and activity of pregnant brown bears is higher during the gestation period than during the rest of hibernation and drops at parturition. We compared mean daily body temperature and activity levels of pregnant and nonpregnant females during preimplantation, gestation, and lactation. Additionally we tested whether age, litter size, primiparity, environmental conditions, and the start of hibernation influence the timing of parturition. The mean date of implantation was 1 December (SD = 12), the mean date of parturition was 26 January (SD = 12), and the mean duration of the gestation period was 56 days (SD = 2). The body temperature of pregnant females was higher during the gestation and lactation periods than that of nonpregnant bears. The body temperature of pregnant females decreased during the gestation period. Activity recordings were also used to determine the date of parturition. The parturition dates calculated with activity and body temperature data did not differ significantly and were the same in 50% of the females. Older females started hibernation earlier. The start of hibernation was earlier during years with favorable environmental conditions. Dates of parturition were later during years with good environmental conditions which was unexpected. We suggest that free-ranging pregnant brown bears in areas with high levels of human activities at the beginning of the denning period, as in our study area, might prioritize investing energy in early denning than in early parturition during years with favorable environmental conditions, as a strategy to prevent disturbances caused by human.

AB The impact of pregnancy and lactation on ultradian rhythms (URs) and circadian rhythms (CRs) of locomotor activity was assessed in circadian rhythmic and arrhythmic Siberian hamsters maintained in a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/day). Progressive decrements in CR robustness and amplitude over the course of gestation were accompanied by enhanced URs. Dark-phase UR period and amplitude increased during early gestation and complexity and robustness increased during late gestation. The persistence of pregnancy-associated enhancements of URs in circadian arrhythmic (ARR) hamsters suggests that reproductive modulation of the UR waveform is not dependent on coherent circadian organization. The increased incidence of dark-phase URs appeared more rapidly in ARR dams than entrained (ENTR) dams. Throughout gestation, the percentage of dams with dark-phase URs was significantly greater in the ARR group. Gestational increases in UR complexity and robustness emerged earlier and were greater in ARR than ENTR dams. The attenuation of CRs during lactation is correlated with increased expression of URs. Relaxation of circadian control of the dam's behavior may increase fitness by permitting more efficient interactions with circadian arrhythmic pups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Depression has been associated with vascular dysfunction, which may be of particular relevance in pregnancy. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and L-arginine play a critical role in vascular function. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in ADMA, SDMA, and L-arginine among pregnant women with major depression compared with pregnant women without depression. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 21 depressed pregnant women and 42 matched controls. Maternal plasma ADMA, SDMA, and L-arginine were quantified, as well as C-reactive protein and urine excretion of ADMA, SDMA, L-arginine, and Arginase I. Results: Plasma L-arginine and ADMA levels were significantly lower in the first trimester in women with depression (mean [standard deviation = 37.0 [9.2] and 0.298 [0.06] mu M, respectively) compared with matched controls (42.1 [11.4] and 0.336 [0.08] mu M, p = .004 and p = .002, respectively) and across pregnancies (p < .001 both). Depressed pregnant women had higher levels of plasma C-reactive protein (7.5 [3.7] versus 5.1 [4.0] mu g/ml, p = .027), but no differences in urine excretion of ADMA, SDMA, or L-arginine, or plasma levels of Arginase I (p > .10). Conclusions: Pregnant women with depression show lower plasma levels of L-arginine and ADMA. These differences are not explained by urinary excretion or Arginase I levels. The mechanism responsible for the observed differences in depressed pregnant women requires further research.

AB Capturing components of the weather that drive environment animal interactions is a perennial problem in ecology. Identifying biologically significant elements, of weather conditions in sensible statistics suitable for analysis of life history variation and population dynamics is central. Meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind modulate rates of heat loss in animals, but analysis of their effects on endothermic species is complicated by the fact that their influence on energy balance is not invariably linear, even across the thermoneutral range. Rather, the thermal load imposed by a given set of weather conditions is a function of organisms' metabolic requirement, which, crucially, may vary spontaneously both seasonally and across different life phases. We propose that the endogenous component of variation in metabolic demand introduces a temporal dimension and that, as a consequence, the specific effect of meteorological variables on energy balance and attendant life history parameters is a function of the timing of weather events with respect to the organism's metabolic rhythm(s). To test this, we examined how a spontaneous increase in metabolic demand influenced the effect of weather on early development in a large mammal. Specifically, we examined interaction between the exponential rise in the energy requirements of pregnancy and depth of snow, which restricts dams' access to forage, on the body mass of reindeer calves (Rang(er tarandus) at weaning. As expected, we detected a significant temporal component: the specific negative effect of snow on weaning mass was not constant, but increased across pregnancy. The life history response was therefore better predicted by interaction between the magnitude and the timing of weather events than by their magnitude alone. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the influence of an endogenous metabolic dynamic on the impact of weather on a life history trait in a free-living mammal. Evaluating weather variables with respect to endogenous variation in metabolic demand adds biological realism and is likely to improve understanding of the influence of environmental variation on life history traits in many ecological contexts.

AB Objective: To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions.
   Design: Repeated measures.
   Setting: Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia.
   Participants: 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation.
   Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals.
   Results: Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future.
   Conclusions: Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

AB While the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) typically occurs during the childbearing years, many women living with MS are of perimenopausal age. There is frequent overlap between menopausal and MS-related symptoms and co-morbidities (e.g. sexual dysfunction, mood disorders and bladder function). Furthermore, some MS symptoms may be exacerbated by perimenopausal changes such as hot flashes or sleep disturbance. The MS neurologist may frequently be the first to become aware of these symptoms and to play a role in monitoring and managing them. In this review, we describe immunological and neurologic changes at menopause as they may impact MS. We then review common symptoms, including fatigue, depression, sexual function, pain and insomnia, and provide both behavioral and pharmacological suggestions for their management. Next, we discuss the need for osteoporosis and cancer screening in perimenopausal women with MS. Finally, we highlight important research gaps, including what effect, if any, the menopausal transition may play on MS disease course as well as the potential modulatory role of hormone replacement therapies.

AB Background: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes.
   Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women.
   Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum.
   Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >=.97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient >.87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity.
   Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum. Background: A woman's preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour. Method: At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother-infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation. Conclusions: Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories.

AB Background: Maternal influence on fetal growth is mediated through the placenta and this influence may have an implication for the offspring's long-term health. The placenta-to-birth weight ratio has been regarded as an indicator of placental function. However, few studies have examined the effect of maternal lifestyle exposures on the placenta-to-birth weight ratio. This study aims to examine the associations of maternal prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption with the placenta-to-birth weight ratio.
   Methods: Data for 7945 term singletons, gestation >= 37 weeks, were selected from the Tasmanian Infant Health Survey; a 1988-1995 Australian cohort study. Placenta and birth weight were extracted from birth notification records.
   Results: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was strongly associated with a 6.77 g/kg higher (95% CI 4.83-8.71) placenta-to-birth weight ratio when compared to non-smoking mothers. Maternal prenatal smoking was associated with lower placental (beta = -15.37 g; 95% CI -23.43 to -7.31) and birth weights (beta = -205.49 g; 95% CI -232.91 to -178.08). Mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy had a lower placenta to-birth weight ratio (beta = -2.07 g/kg; 95% CI -4.01 to -0.12) than mothers who did not consume alcohol. The associations of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy with placental and birth weight did not reach statistical significance.
   Discussion: Maternal prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption may influence fetal growth by either directly or indirectly altering the function of the placenta.
   Condlusions: The alteration of the in utero environment induced by smoking and alcohol consumption appears to affect placental and fetal growth in differing ways. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE:To determine whether an association exists between shift work and early reproductive outcomes.DATA SOURCES:MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Additional sources included Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, online publications of national colleges, the ClinicalTrials.gov, and references of retrieved papers.METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION:Included studies compared female shift workers (work outside 8:00 am to 6:00 pm) with nonshift workers with menstrual disruption (cycles less than 25 days or greater than 31 days), infertility (time-to-pregnancy exceeding 12 months), or early spontaneous pregnancy loss (less than 25 weeks).TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS:Two reviewers extracted adjusted and raw data. Random effect models were used to pool data weighting for the inverse of variance. Assessments of heterogeneity, bias, and subgroup analyses were performed. Sixteen independent cohorts from 15 studies (123,403 women) were subject to analysis. Shift workers had increased rates of menstrual disruption (16.05% [2,207/13,749] compared with 13.05% [7,561/57,932] [n=71.681, odds ratio {OR} 1.22, 95% confidence interval {CI} 1.15-1.29, I-2 0%]) and infertility (11.3% [529/4,668] compared with 9.9% [2,354/23,811] [OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.01-3.20, I-2 94%]) but not early spontaneous pregnancy loss (11.84% [939/7,931] compared with 12.11% [1,898/15,673] [n=23,604, OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.05, I-2 0%]). Night shifts were associated with increased early spontaneous pregnancy loss (n=13,018, OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.50, I-2 0%). Confounder adjustment led to persistent relationships between shift work and menstrual disruption (adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31, I-2 70%) but not infertility (adjusted OR 1.11 95% CI 0.86-1.44, I-2 61%). The association between night shifts and early spontaneous pregnancy loss remained (adjusted OR 1.41 95% CI 1.22-1.63, I-2 0%).CONCLUSION:This review provides evidence for an association between performing shift work and early reproductive outcomes, consistent with later pregnancy findings. However, there is currently insufficient evidence for clinicians to advise restricting shift work in women of reproductive age.

AB Objective: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of fetal state on these indices.
   Methods: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 37 weeks. As major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity, burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation with GA and fetal state.
   Results: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (-0.21 s/week, P = 0.0031). This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state.
   Conclusion: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The decrease in IBI over gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG maturational indices.
   Significance: With further investigation, indices extracted from spontaneous fetal brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal neurological distress. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To identify key socio-demographic and knowledge factors associated with compliance with recommended use of commodities for preventing malaria in pregnancy (MIP) in Enugu State, Nigeria. Cross-sectional study of 720 women who delivered within 6 months preceding the survey in three local government areas in Enugu State was conducted using a structured questionnaire. About half (51.6 %) of the women used IPTp1 while 25.9 % took IPTp2 as recommended during their most recent pregnancy. Forty-one percent of the women slept under insecticide treat nets (ITN) during the most recent pregnancy but only 15.4 % did so as recommended every night. Socio-demographic and knowledge factors associated with compliance were identified. Compliance with intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) recommendation was more common among those in the rural setting (26.9 %) compared to the peri-urban (20.3 %) and urban (17.3 %) (P = 0.032). Those with good knowledge of the causes, effects and prevention of malaria during pregnancy complied more (23.7 %) than those with poor knowledge (17.0 %) (P = 0.020). With respect to sleeping under ITN, more of those with post secondary education, good knowledge of MIP and currently living with a partner used ITN every night during the last pregnancy. Knowledge about the MIP issues and having a partner influence compliance with relevant preventives. Efforts to increase compliance with recommended practices to prevent MIP should focus on providing health education to pregnant women and their partners, who reinforce what the women are told during antenatal care. More qualitative studies need to be conducted on this subject.

AB The treatment of opiate-dependent women during pregnancy is a common problem. Maintenance treatment with methadone is the best-established treatment, although a few case reports demonstrate the possible advantages of buprenorphine and slow release morphine in limiting the intensity of the postnatal, neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Here we report on the course of pregnancy and the postnatal withdrawal symptom of the son of a 25-year-old, first childbearing woman in her 38th week of pregnancy under diamorphine-assisted treatment (HAT=heroin-assisted treatment). Until the beginning of her pregnancy Mrs. X was maintained on diamorphine for about a year; apart from diamorphine, the only medicinal treatment was low dosages of quetiapine ad libitum, which were prescribed to treat nightmares and sleep-onset disorder. The pregnancy under diamorphine maintenance caused no major problems, and childbirth by Caesarean section took place in the 38+2 week of her pregnancy, although Mrs. X's son's neonatal withdrawal syndrome turned out to be more severe, and to show an earlier onset compared with methadone or buprenorphine treatments.

AB Circadian clocks regulate homeostasis and mediate responses to stressors. Lactation is one of the most energetically demanding periods of an adult female's life. Peripartum changes occur in almost every organ so the dam can support neonatal growth through milk production while homeostasis is maintained. How circadian clocks are involved in adaptation to lactation is currently unknown. The abundance and temporal pattern of core clock genes' expression were measured in suprachiasmatic nucleus, liver, and mammary from late pregnant and early lactation mice. Tissue-specific changes in molecular clocks occurred between physiological states. Amplitude and robustness of rhythms increased in suprachiasmatic nucleus and liver. Mammary rhythms of core molecular clock genes were suppressed. Attenuated rhythms appeared to be a physiological adaptation of mammary to lactation, because manipulation of timing of suckling resulting in significant differences in plasma prolactin and corticosterone had no effect on amplitude. Analysis of core clock proteins revealed that the stoichiometric relationship between positive (CLOCK) and negative (PER2) components remained 1: 1 in liver but was increased to 4: 1 in mammary during physiological transition. Induction of differentiation of mammary epithelial cell line HC11 with dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin resulted in similar stoichiometric changes among positive and negative clock regulators, and prolactin induced phase shifts in HC11 Arntl expression rhythm. Data support that distinct mechanisms drive periparturient changes in mammary clock. Stoichiometric change in clock regulators occurs with gland differentiation. Suppression of mammary clock gene expression rhythms represents a physiological adaptation to suckling cues. Adaptations in mammary clock are likely needed in part to support suckling demands of neonates.

AB Background: Drugs used in preterm labor (PTL) have side effects. Research into new tocolytic agents is recommended. The plant Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken (Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers) is used in Anthroposophic Medicine for PTL, insomnia, and emotional disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of B. pinnatum mother tincture (MT) on Wistar rats and their fetuses throughout pregnancy. Method: Sixty animals were divided into 6 equal groups: controls C1 and C2 received 1 and 25 x the maximum daily dose of a 30% ethanol / water solution, serving as vehicle of B. pinnatum MT; B1 and B2 received 1 and 25 x the maximum daily dose of B. pinnatum MT; and B3 and B4 received 50 and 100 x B. pinnatum concentrate. The following parameters were assessed: weight gain; maternal and fetal mortality; implantations and resorptions; number and weight of fetuses and placentas; major external fetal malformations. Results: Rat weight gain (excluding fetal and placental weight) was higher in group B4 and lower in group B2. There were no maternal or fetal deaths and no group differences in implantations and resorptions or number and weight of fetuses and placentas. No macroscopic fetal abnormalities were observed at the 4 dosage levels investigated. Conclusion: Daily administration of B. pinnatum MT at high doses to pregnant Wistar rats interfered with maternal weight gain and did not interfere with fetal compartment.

DT Article
DE Sacred Tree; Siirt Folk Culture; Folk Medicine; Tomb; Mythology; Ritual
AB This article aims to present prominent status of 'sacred trees' in rituals performed at tombs in Siirt folk culture. These trees become a mythical symbol and part of the essential component of Muslim Saints' culture. We can also see that these trees and their leaves have been used in rituals related to folk medicine. Sacred trees and their surrounding areas have become only hope for women who cannot get pregnant. Leaves of sacred trees near the tombs of "Sheikh Hazin" and "Seyid Sheikh Muhammed El Tomani" were used to give hope for infertile women. There has been a belief among local people that if an infertile woman throws three branches and can succeed in getting at least one branch stay hanged on a tree, she could get pregnant. "Sheikh Arab" tomb features the mystic story of the fruitless mulberry tree while "Sheikh Tayyar" tomb features the "dismembered head" figure and sacred trees in the same place. "Mir Yusuf' and "Sheikh Girdi" tombs feature the ritual of "sleeping under the tree". People hang limbs in front of their houses and workplaces from trees at the tomb of "Bapira Sufi" in the hope that these limbs would protect them from snakes, scorpions, insects, etc. People who want to purify themselves set up swing sets between trees near the "Sheikh Veli" tomb. All these manifestations of rituals through "sacred trees" to reach Saint first and ultimately through Saint to Allah are common practices of Shirt's folk culture.

AB Objective: The majority of women develop sleep impairments during pregnancy, but alterations in dream experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed dreaming in late pregnancy.
   Methods: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester pregnant women (mean age +/- SD, 28.7 +/- 4.06 years) and 59 non-pregnant controls (mean age +/- SD, 26.8 +/- 4.21 years) completed demographics and psychological questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective dream and disturbed dream recall.
   Results: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar prospective dream recall (P = 0.47), pregnant women reported prospectively more bad dreams (P = 0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately severe pathology (>1/week) (P = 0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower sleep quality (P = 0.007) and more night awakenings (P = 0.003). Higher prospective recall of bad dreams (r = -0.40, P = 0.002) and nightmares (r = -0.32, P = 0.001) both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women.
   Conclusions: Late pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep and disturbed dream production in this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The first urine in the morning (total 15 samples) and whole day urine (total 4 days, 17 samples) were collected from a young healthy woman during the pregnancy and lactation period, to examine the possible interactions of urine components (methanol extracts) with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). The interaction was evaluated by measuring the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine123, a P-gp substrate, in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, or calcein, an MAP substrate, in Caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of urine components. Four first urine samples out of 12 collected before childbirth and one sample out of three collected after childbirth suppressed P-gp function significantly. The effect of pregnancy and lactation on P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components was not observed. The whole day urine samples showed a clear circadian rhythm, in which three first urine samples in the morning out of four showed greater P-gp inhibitory potencies than other daytime samples. Interaction of urine components with MRPs was not detected. In conclusion, the concentration of endogenous P-gp inhibitor(s) was higher in the first urine in the morning, showing a clear circadian rhythm. Normal pregnancy and lactation appeared not to significantly affect the P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components.

AB Objective: To investigate the risk factors for early miscarriage among Chinese women.
   Design: Hospital-based matched case-control study.
   Setting: Academic medical center and maternal health hospital.
   Patient(s): 620 women with early miscarriage (less than 13 weeks of gestation) and 1,240 normal pregnant women.
   Intervention(s): Face-to-face questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Multivariable conditional odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to measure risk factors. Result(s): After adjustment for confounding factors, the following were independently associated with increased risk: history of miscarriage, repeated induced abortion, working night shifts, and frequent staying up late. Vitamin supplementation and regular physical activity reduced the risk of miscarriage. We did not find paternal age, alcohol consumption, or smoking status to be linked with early miscarriage.
   Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and planned pregnancy may be advantageous for women in pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy. Induced abortion, working night shifts, and frequent staying up late were associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. Further work in larger populations is warranted. .(C) 2014 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

AB CASE: Thomas is a 5-year 6-month-old boy whose parents requested an urgent care appointment because he has recently been suspended from kindergarten stating "and his doctor must see him before he can come back." His suspension from kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds.
   The practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool, interacting with peers, and was described as "hyperactive" by his teachers. His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom.
   His parents have always described him as a "difficult child." He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited.
   Thomas is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed. They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed "partying" with friends on the weekends, but Thomas's mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she was pregnant.
   All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology. It is unsure what the next step might be and if there is value added in pursuing this diagnosis. What do you do next?

AB Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13 patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11 cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

   METAANALYSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a high-risk cohort.
   STUDY DESIGN: This was a planned analysis of a prospective cohort designed to estimate the prevalence and trends of SDB in high-risk pregnant women. We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or greater, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (>= 30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians blinded to the SDB results.
   RESULTS: Of the 188 women with a valid early pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-forgestational-age (<5%), or large-for-gestational-age (>95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in early pregnancywas associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P.03). The adjusted odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6 (0.6, 21.8).
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.

AB OBJECTIVE: This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies.
   STUDY DESIGN: Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen-positive subjects were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations.
   RESULT: One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (adjusted relative risk =1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.37).
   CONCLUSION: In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggests that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others. However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.

AB Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position.
   Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies.
   Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3 +/- 6.9 weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%).
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position.
   Practice implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.

AB Pregnant women, both before and after childbirth, frequently experience memory deficits and disrupted sleep. In the present study we assessed the relationship between false memory generation and fragmented sleep during pregnancy and motherhood. We tested 178 pregnant women and 58 female non-pregnant childless controls, during pregnancy (15-35th week of gestation) and again after childbirth (8-13th month). False memories were defined as memories of gist words that were semantically related to studied word lists but were not presented during learning of these lists in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy in the home environment for seven consecutive nights. Compared to the controls, the group of pregnant women produced more false memories and displayed more fragmented sleep both during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, false memory generation was not correlated to measures of sleep fragmentation. These results show that pregnant women suffer from sleep fragmentation and a higher susceptibility to false memories, but leave open the question as to whether both phenomena are related.

AB Aims and objectives
   To explore sleep quality in infertile women and examine the factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during intrauterine insemination treatment.
   Background
   Sleep disturbance is an important factor of human health and well-being. Sleep disturbances tend to occur among infertile women during intrauterine insemination treatment. Although many studies have focused on the high percentage of somatic symptoms and psychological distress in infertile women associated with their treatment, few studies have investigated factors linked to their sleep disturbances.
   Design
   A cross-sectional study.
   Methods
   The study was conducted during the period of September 2010-January 2011 in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Infertile women (n=117) who received assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination treatment completed a questionnaire. Demographic data, somatic symptoms, psychological distress and perceived sleep quality were collected.
   Results
   More than one-third (35%) of the infertile women reported having sleep disturbances. Their nausea symptoms and psychological distress were risk factors that contributed to sleep disturbance.
   Conclusions
   The variables of nausea and psychological distress significantly explained 30% of the sleep disturbances in the infertile women. The evaluation of nausea symptoms and/or psychological distress among infertile women is an important area of future research; such research should aim to identify the best compromise between infertility treatment and sleep quality.
   Relevance to clinical practice
   Clinical obstetrics and gynaecology nurses should develop strategies to help infertile women reduce their nausea symptoms and psychological distress during intrauterine insemination treatment to promote healthy sleep.

AB Aims and objectives
   To determine the incidence of pregnancy-related physical symptoms in healthy pregnant women and their management strategies.
   Background
   In normal progression of pregnancy, many symptoms were experienced. Pregnancy-related physical symptoms may have a negative effect on pregnant women's quality of life. However, pregnant women avoid taking medications from the fear that the medication they use may have a harmful effect on the foetus. Therefore, they practise nonpharmacological methods to help them manage their pregnancy-related physical symptoms.
   Design
   This study used a comparative and descriptive design.
   Methods
   The study population comprised of pregnant women who were visiting for routine check-up and/or examination in the obstetrics gynaecology outpatient clinics of three hospitals in Erzurum, Turkey. The data were collected via a questionnaire including socio-demographic items and questions to identify the pregnancy-related physical symptoms that they experienced and their management strategies.
   Results
   The top three most reported complaints were nausea-vomiting (87 center dot 8%), fatigue (77 center dot 9%) and breast pain-tenderness (76 center dot 2%) during the first trimester, whereas polyuria (79 center dot 9%, 88 center dot 4%), fatigue (75 center dot 6%, 88 center dot 4%) and heart burn (71 center dot 3%, 81 center dot 8%) during the second and third trimesters. Depending on the symptoms, the pregnant women either did nothing or took correct, incorrect or empirical actions to manage their problems. Data revealed that the major source of knowledge was based on their previous experience and that of close relatives. As their education level increased, the percentage of women taking scientifically proven action to correct the problem increased.
   Conclusions
   Various physical symptoms were experienced by women in each trimester of pregnancy. The majority of the women did not do anything to alleviate their physical symptoms.
   Relevance to clinical practice
   Midwives and nurses should question the strategies used by pregnant women. In this way, the inappropriate and incorrect practices can be determined, and education on the appropriate practices can be provided.

   Plasmodium vivax malaria in Western Yunnan Province, China
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

ID MOSQUITO COILS
AB Background: Mosquito coils are the most commonly used household insecticidal product in the world with sales exceeding 50 billion coils, used by two billion people worldwide annually. Despite strong evidence that coils prevent mosquito bites a systematic review concluded that there is no evidence that burning mosquito coils prevents malaria acquisition. Therefore, the current trial was designed to measure and compare prevention of malaria infection by mosquito coils or long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) or a combination of the two in Yunnan, China in the Greater Mekong sub-region.
   Methods: A four-arm single blind household-randomized design was chosen as coils emanate insecticide throughout the household. Households enrolled at baseline were randomly allocated by the lottery method to one of the four intervention arms: (i) nothing, (ii) 0.03% transfluthrin coils alone, (iii) deltamethrin long-lasting insecticide treated nets, (LLINs) alone or (iv) a combination of transfluthrin coils and deltamethrin LLINs. All household members were recruited to the study, with only those households excluded with pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, members with chest complaints or allergies or members that regularly slept away from home. The main outcome of interest was Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence detected by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) during six repeated monthly cross-sectional surveys. The secondary outcome of interest was the effect on Plasmodium vivax prevalence detected in the same way.
   Results: A total of 2,052 households were recruited into the study, comprising 7,341 individuals The odds ratios of testing positive by RDT with P. falciparum or P. vivax were >75% lower for all intervention arms compared with the control arm. Coils alone provided 77% protection (95% CI: 50%-89%), LLINs provided 91% protection (95% CI: 72%-97%) and the combination of coils and LLINs provided 94% protection (95% CI: 77%-99%) against P. falciparum compared with the control arm. There was no statistically significant difference between the protective efficacies of the different interventions.
   Conclusions: This is the first robust clinical evaluation of transfluthrin mosquito coils as a means to reduce malaria and the high degree of infection prevented would indicate they represent a potentially highly effective tool, which could be integrated into larger vector control programmes.

   ASSOCIATION; WOMEN; DETERMINANTS
AB Background: The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of stillbirth in Europe, resulting in approximately 4,000 stillbirths every year. Potentially modifiable risk factors for late stillbirths are maternal age, obesity and smoking, but the population attributable risk associated with these risk factors is small. Recently the Auckland Stillbirth Study reported that maternal sleep position was associated with late stillbirth. Women who did not sleep on their left side on the night before the death of the baby had double the risk compared with sleeping on other positions. The population attributable risk was 37%. This novel observation needs to be replicated or refuted.
   Methods/Design: Case control study of late singleton stillbirths without congenital abnormality. Controls are women with an ongoing singleton pregnancy, who are randomly selected from participating maternity units booking list of pregnant women, they are allocated a gestation for interview based on the distribution of gestations of stillbirths from the previous 4 years for the unit. The number of controls selected is proportional to the number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital over the previous 4 years. Data collection: Interviewer administered questionnaire and data extracted from medical records. Sample size: 415 cases and 830 controls. This takes into account a 30% non-participation rate, and will detect an OR of 1.5 with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% for variables with a prevalence of 57%, such as non-left sleeping position. Statistical analysis: Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.
   Discussion: The hypotheses to be tested here are important, biologically plausible and amenable to a public health intervention. Although this case-control study cannot prove causation, there is a striking parallel with research relating to sudden infant death syndrome, where case-control studies identified prone sleeping position as a major modifiable risk factor. Subsequently mothers were advised to sleep babies prone ("Back to Sleep" campaign), which resulted in a dramatic drop in SIDS. This study will provide robust evidence to help determine whether such a public health intervention should be considered.

AB Background: Access to insecticide-treated bed nets has increased substantially in recent years, but ownership and use remain well below 100% in many malaria endemic areas. Understanding decision-making around net allocation in households with too few nets is essential to ensuring protection of the most vulnerable. This study explores household net allocation preferences and practices across four districts in Uganda.
   Methods: Data collection consisted of eight focus group discussions, twelve in-depth interviews, and a structured questionnaire to inventory 107 sleeping spaces in 28 households.
   Results: In focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, participants almost unanimously stated that pregnant women, infants, and young children should be prioritized when allocating nets. However, sleeping space surveys reveal that heads of household sometimes receive priority over children less than five years of age when households have too few nets to cover all members.
   Conclusions: When asked directly, most net owners highlight the importance of allocating nets to the most biologically vulnerable household members. This is consistent with malaria behaviour change and health education messages. In actual allocation, however, factors other than biological vulnerability may influence who does and does not receive a net.

AB Human cells migrate between mother and fetus during pregnancy and persist in the respective host for long-term after birth. Fetal microchimerism occurs also in twins sharing a common placenta or chorion. Whether microchimerism occurs in multiparous mammals such as the domestic pig, where fetuses have separate placentas and chorions, is not well understood. Here, we assessed cell chimerism in litters of wild-type sows inseminated with semen of transposon transgenic boars. Segregation of three independent monomeric transposons ensured an excess of transgenic over non-transgenic offspring in every litter. Transgenic siblings (n = 35) showed robust ubiquitous expression of the reporter transposon encoding a fluorescent protein, and provided an unique resource to assess a potential cell trafficking to non-transgenic littermates (n = 7) or mothers (n = 4). Sensitive flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and real-time PCR provided no evidence for microchimerism in porcine littermates, or piglets and their mothers in both blood and solid organs. These data indicate that the epitheliochorial structure of the porcine placenta effectively prevents cellular exchange during gestation.

AB Background: Buprenorphine has been available in Australia since 2000 as an alternative pharmacotherapy to methadone for the treatment of opioid dependence. However, there is little information in the literature regarding the effect of buprenorphine on the wellbeing of infants exposed to buprenorphine via breast milk, following discharge from hospital.
   Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine the wellbeing of infants exposed to buprenorphine via breast milk up to 4 weeks postnatally.
   Methods: Approximately 4 weeks after birth, information on the feeding and sleeping patterns, skin color, infant elimination patterns and hydration, and Neonatal Abstinence Scores of infants (n = 7) exposed to buprenorphine via breast milk was collected via both observation and documentation.
   Results: Infants were progressing well, with normal sleep patterns and skin color, and 2 mothers had minor concerns regarding infant elimination patterns. Four infants were exclusively breastfed and 3 were receiving a supplement, with a range of 260 to 700 mL of formula over 24 hours. The sleep patterns following feeding ranged from 1.55 to 3.33 hours, with a median of 2.12 hours.
   Conclusion: No adverse effects were detected in infants exposed to buprenorphine via breast milk up to 4 weeks postnatally. Further research using larger samples to assess possible developmental effects over longer periods of time is required.

AB Identifying the educational and resource needs of new mothers is of paramount importance in developing programs to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the educational needs of new mothers and identify opportunities to enhance healthcare providers' current educational efforts. A two-part methodology was utilized to qualitatively explore the topic of parenting information needs for new mothers in Georgia. Data collection included information from 11 focus groups with 92 first-time, new mothers and 20 interviews with healthcare providers who serve new mothers. Discussions with both new mothers and providers clearly indicated that new mothers face a significant informational deficit, especially regarding very basic, daily infant care information and health literacy challenges. Educational materials already exist; however, mothers report difficulty accessing and understanding this information. For this reason, both the mothers and the providers stressed a focus on developing programs or interventions that allow in-person education and/or alternative modalities to access information, as opposed to development of new written materials solely. Information from the focus group and interviews provided important insight regarding what improvements need to be made to help new mothers and their families during the early stages of parenthood. By improving the education of new mothers and their families, it is proposed that maternal and infant health status could be improved.

AB Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious public health issue which threatens maternal and foetal health outcomes. The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of depression and sense of coherence.
   Methods: This study has a cross-sectional design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria were women >= 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by 39.5% (n = 761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart, unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18); history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment, age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3).
   Conclusions: The reported prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health.

AB This study aimed to examine the transition to parenthood and mental health in first-time parents in detail and explore any differences in this transition in the context of parental gender and postpartum mental health. Semistructured clinical interviews (Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health) were carried out with 46 women and 40 men, 5 months after birth. Parents were assessed on pre- and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables. One fourth of the men and women reported anxiety in pregnancy, reducing to 21% of women and 8% of men after birth. Pregnancy and postpartum depression rates were roughly equal, with 11% of women and 8% of men reporting depression. Postpartum PTSD was experienced by 5% of parents. Postpartum mental health problems were significantly associated with postpartum sleep deprivation (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5), complications in labor (OR = 5.1), lack of postpartum partner support (OR = 8.0), feelings of parental unworthiness (OR = 8.3), and anger toward the infant (OR = 4.4). Few gender differences were found for these variables. This study thus highlights the importance of focusing interventions on strengthening the couple's relationship and avoiding postnatal sleep deprivation, and to address parents' feelings of parental unworthiness and feelings of anger toward their baby.

AB ObjectiveTo determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound.
   DesignRepeated-measures randomized controlled trial.
   SettingSpecial care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center.
   ParticipantsClinically stable preterm infants (22) born at>28weeks gestation and enrolled at>32weeks gestation and their mothers.
   MethodsInfants were exposed to lullaby music (6minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall.
   ResultsThere was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers' presence (first 12minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p=.024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant.
   ConclusionInfants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants' physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers.

AB Study Objectives: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality.
   Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis.
   Setting: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009.
   Patients or Participants: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges.
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity.
   Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group.

   Preeclampsia; Sleep-disordered breathing
ID GESTATIONAL HYPERTENSION; PREECLAMPSIA; OUTCOMES; APNEA
AB Background and aim: Pregnancy physiology may predispose women to the development of airflow limitations during sleep. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether pregnant women suspected of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are more likely to have airflow limitations compared to non-pregnant controls.
   Methods: We recruited pregnant women referred for polysomnography for a diagnosis of SDB. Nonpregnant female controls matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) were identified from a database. We examined airflow tracings for changes in amplitude and shape. We classified airflow limitation by (a) amplitude criteria defined as decreased airflow of >= 10 s without desaturation or arousal (FL 10), or decreased airflow of any duration combined with either 1-2% desaturation or arousal, (FL 1-2%); and (b) shape criteria defined as the presence of flattening or oscillations of the inspiratory flow curve.
   Results: We identified 25 case-control pairs. Mean BMI was 44.0 +/- 6.9 in cases and 44.1 +/- 7.3 in controls. Using shape criteria, pregnant women had significantly more flow-limited breaths throughout total sleep time (32.4 +/- 35.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 17.9, p < 0.0001) and in each stage of sleep (p < 0.0001) than non-pregnant controls. In a subgroup analysis, pregnant women without a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) who had an AHI < 5 had similar findings (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in airflow limitation by amplitude criteria between pregnant women and controls (p = 0.22).
   Conclusions: Pregnant women suspected of OSA have more frequent shape-defined airflow limitations than non-pregnant controls, even when they do not meet polysomnographic OSA criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To determine the effectiveness of helmet therapy for positional skull deformation compared with the natural course of the condition in infants aged 5-6 months.
   Design Pragmatic, single blinded, randomised controlled trial (HEADS, HElmet therapy Assessment in Deformed Skulls) nested in a prospective cohort study.
   Setting 29 paediatric physiotherapy practices; helmet therapy was administered at four specialised centres.
   Participants 84 infants aged 5 to 6 months with moderate to severe skull deformation, who were born after 36 weeks of gestation and had no muscular torticollis, craniosynostosis, or dysmorphic features. Participants were randomly assigned to helmet therapy (n=42) or to natural course of the condition (n=42) according to a randomisation plan with blocks of eight.
   Interventions Six months of helmet therapy compared with the natural course of skull deformation. In both trial arms parents were asked to avoid any (additional) treatment for the skull deformation.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome was change in skull shape from baseline to 24 months of age assessed using plagiocephalometry (anthropometric measurement instrument). Change scores for plagiocephaly (oblique diameter difference index) and brachycephaly (cranioproportional index) were each included in an analysis of covariance, using baseline values as the covariate. Secondary outcomes were ear deviation, facial asymmetry, occipital lift, and motor development in the infant, quality of life (infant and parent measures), and parental satisfaction and anxiety. Baseline measurements were performed in infants aged between 5 and 6 months, with follow-up measurements at 8, 12, and 24 months. Primary outcome assessment at 24 months was blinded.
   Results The change score for both plagiocephaly and brachycephaly was equal between the helmet therapy and natural course groups, with a mean difference of -0.2 (95% confidence interval -1.6 to 1.2, P=0.80) and 0.2 (-1.7 to 2.2, P=0.81), respectively. Full recovery was achieved in 10 of 39 (26%) participants in the helmet therapy group and 9 of 40 (23%) participants in the natural course group (odds ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 3.3, P=0.74). All parents reported one or more side effects.
   Conclusions Based on the equal effectiveness of helmet therapy and skull deformation following its natural course, high prevalence of side effects, and high costs associated with helmet therapy, we discourage the use of a helmet as a standard treatment for healthy infants with moderate to severe skull deformation.

AB Of the problems that complicate child-bearing, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), or severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is likely one of the most painful with unrelenting retching and vomiting that can lead to measurable injuries such as Mallory-Weiss Syndrome and esophageal rupture, and/or subtle maternal cognitive impairments related to starvation and dehydration. Recognized hallmarks of HG include dehydration, ketonuria, weight loss over 5%, and electrolyte abnormalities not attributable to other causes.
   Historically providers regarded the hyperemetic as a difficult to treat patient with potentially underlying psychological problems. Sick patients who experience pain and suffering present challenges to care, not excepting NVP. Ill patients can be demanding and agitated. Agitation can be one of the early signs of delirium or altered mental status (AMS). AMS can include previously diagnosed psychiatric conditions as well as new onset of Wernicke's encephalopathy, deliria, insomnia, hallucinations and autoscopy, resulting from various etiologies including and not limited to medications, pain including pain from hunger, vomiting and retching, constipation, dehydration, altered electrolytes, hypoglycemia, malnutrition and sleep deprivation.
   AMS may have a subtle waxing and waning trajectory, making the condition difficult to diagnosis in early stages. What have not been well elucidated in AMS are subjective images and/or experiences. Whether all AMS experiences are similar is unknown. We believe there may be a transient alteration of cognitive status or "altered sensorium gestosis" (ASG), attributed to the direct insults of hyperemesis gravidarum which will be discussed herein. How prevalent ASG might be is unknown and needs further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate cognitive functioning among elementary school children in Jordan. Methods: A total of 468 children aged 6-12 years were recruited to participate in this study. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the LOTCA battery (Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment; Itzkovich et al., 2000). Information obtained from the parents included demographics, work and income data and child's daily behavior and school achievement. Results: The results of this study showed that the cognitive functioning increased by 3.8 points for each increase in the child's GPA and increased by 2.35 points when the child ate breakfast regularly. By contrast, living in rural areas and smoking by a parent decreased cognitive functioning. Conclusions: Understanding of the child's cognitive abilities is critical to establishing intervention goals and to planning therapeutic activities. Screening of cognitive abilities and associated factors is essential for a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the child's abilities and limitations. Further research is recommended to investigate other factors in different populations.

AB While the use of creatine in human pregnancy is yet to be fully evaluated, its long-term use in healthy adults appears to be safe, and its well documented neuroprotective properties have recently been extended by demonstrations that creatine improves cognitive function in normal and elderly people, and motor skills in sleep-deprived subjects. Creatine has many actions likely to benefit the fetus and newborn, because pregnancy is a state of heightened metabolic activity, and the placenta is a key source of free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen. The multiple benefits of supplementary creatine arise from the fact that the creatine-phosphocreatine [PCr] system has physiologically important roles that include maintenance of intracellular ATP and acid-base balance, post-ischaemic recovery of protein synthesis, cerebral vasodilation, antioxidant actions, and stabilisation of lipid membranes. In the brain, creatine not only reduces lipid peroxidation and improves cerebral perfusion, its interaction with the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor is likely to counteract the effects of glutamate excitotoxicity -actions that may protect the preterm and term fetal brain from the effects of birth hypoxia. In this review we discuss the development of creatine synthesis during fetal life, the transfer of creatine from mother to fetus, and propose that creatine supplementation during pregnancy may have benefits for the fetus and neonate whenever oxidative stress or feto-placental hypoxia arise, as in cases of fetal growth restriction, premature birth, or when parturition is delayed or complicated by oxygen deprivation of the newborn.

ID AQUEOUS EXTRACT; LEAF; CONTRACTILITY; CRASSULACEAE; SCALE
AB Introduction: Poor sleep quality in pregnancy is frequent. A treatment with sedatives is problematic due to possible adverse effects for mother and embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians revealed sleep disorders as one of the most frequent diagnoses for which these preparations are prescribed.
   Materials and methods: In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350 mg tablets, 50% leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded.
   Results: The number of wake-ups, as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was, however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B. pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected.
   Conclusion: B. pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy. The data of this study encourage further clinical investigations on the use of B. pinnatum in sleep disorders. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Insomnia and depression are strongly interrelated. This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression.
   Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms.
   Results: After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia.
   Limitations: Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study.
   Conclusions: Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression.

AB Background: The triple risk model for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been useful in understanding its pathogenesis. Risk factors for late stillbirth are well established, especially relating to maternal and fetal wellbeing.
   Discussion: We propose a similar triple risk model for unexplained late stillbirth. The model proposed by us results from the interplay of three groups of factors: (1) maternal factors (such as maternal age, obesity, smoking), (2) fetal and placental factors (such as intrauterine growth retardation, placental insufficiency), and (3) a stressor (such as venocaval compression from maternal supine sleep position, sleep disordered breathing). We argue that the risk factors within each group in themselves may be insufficient to cause the death, but when they interrelate may produce a lethal combination.
   Summary: Unexplained late stillbirth occurs when a fetus who is somehow vulnerable dies as a result of encountering a stressor and/or maternal condition in a combination which is lethal for them.

AB According to the heat dissipation limit theory, maximum metabolic turnover is limited by the capacity of the body to dissipate excess heat. Small mammals, including common voles (Microtus arvalis), face a heat dissipation limitation during lactation. Pup growth and milk production are reduced under higher ambient temperatures. Heat dissipation problems might in part be alleviated by modifying behavior, such as reducing nest attendance and being active at energetically optimal times of day. According to the circadian thermo-energetics hypothesis, animals can make use of daily ambient temperature fluctuations to alter their energetic expenditure. In this study we test whether heat challenged (housing at 30 degrees C compared to 21 degrees C) lactating common voles allocate their time differently among behaviors and whether their ultradian and circadian behavioral rhythmicity are altered. Behavior was scored every 13 min from automated picture recordings, while general locomotor activity was measured by passive infrared detectors to assess ultradian and circadian organization. The effects of ambient temperature on the ultradian organization of behavior were assessed by determining the ultradian period length and the distribution of activity within the ultradian bout. Changes in circadian organization were assessed by the distribution of activity over the light and dark phase. As a complementary measure nest temperature recordings were used to quantify nest attendance distribution between day and night.
   Lactating dams at 30 degrees C reduced the fraction of time spent on the nest while increasing the fraction of time resting without pups away from the nest. The ultradian period of locomotor activity was longer in voles housed at 30 degrees C during pregnancy and lactation, but not after weaning when the pups were removed. No differences in the distribution of activity within the ultradian bout could be detected. The circadian organization was also modulated by ambient temperature. lactating voles housed at 30 degrees C became more day active and a loss of day-night differences in nest temperature suggests a shift of nest attendance towards the night.
   Reducing the time attending the nest can reduce the risk of hyperthermia, and may be the behavioral component resulting in lower milk production and hence reproductive output. Becoming more day active allows feeding and nursing of the pups during the rest phase to occur during the night at which lower ambient temperatures are expected in the field. In natural situations this strategy will increase heat dissipation and lactation capacity. Whether there are similar benefits associated with a longer ultradian period is currently unknown, but these are likely to result from decreased energy turnover at 30 degrees C. In conclusion, our study shows that lactating common voles facing heat dissipation problems re-organize their behavior in a way that can maximize heat dissipation capabilities and thereby optimize lactation capacity.

AB Author Summary
   Glossina sp. are responsible for transmission of African trypanosomes, the causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle. Blood feeding and nutrient provisioning through lactation during intrauterine progeny development are periods when considerable water movement occurs within tsetse flies. With the completion of the tsetse fly genome, we sought to characterize the role of aquaporins in relation water homeostasis during blood feeding, stress tolerance and the lactation cycle. We provide evidence that specific AQPs are 1. critical during diuresis following a bloodmeal, 2. important in the regulation of dehydration resistance and heat tolerance and 3. crucial in the allocation of water within tsetse milk that is necessary for progeny hydration. Specifically, we discovered a novel tsetse AQP that is imperative to lactation and may represent a potential target for population control of this disease vector.
   Tsetse flies undergo drastic fluctuations in their water content throughout their adult life history due to events such as blood feeding, dehydration and lactation, an essential feature of the viviparous reproductive biology of tsetse. Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane proteins that allow water and other solutes to permeate through cellular membranes. Here we identify tsetse aquaporin (AQP) genes, examine their expression patterns under different physiological conditions (blood feeding, lactation and stress response) and perform functional analysis of three specific genes utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing. Ten putative aquaporins were identified in the Glossina morsitans morsitans (Gmm) genome, two more than has been previously documented in any other insect. All organs, tissues, and body parts examined had distinct AQP expression patterns. Two AQP genes, gmmdripa and gmmdripb ( = gmmaqp1a and gmmaqp1b) are highly expressed in the milk gland/fat body tissues. The whole-body transcript levels of these two genes vary over the course of pregnancy. A set of three AQPs (gmmaqp5, gmmaqp2a, and gmmaqp4b) are expressed highly in the Malpighian tubules. Knockdown of gmmdripa and gmmdripb reduced the efficiency of water loss following a blood meal, increased dehydration tolerance and reduced heat tolerance of adult females. Knockdown of gmmdripa extended pregnancy length, and gmmdripb knockdown resulted in extended pregnancy duration and reduced progeny production. We found that knockdown of AQPs increased tsetse milk osmolality and reduced the water content in developing larva. Combined knockdown of gmmdripa, gmmdripb and gmmaqp5 extended pregnancy by 4-6 d, reduced pupal production by nearly 50%, increased milk osmolality by 20-25% and led to dehydration of feeding larvae. Based on these results, we conclude that gmmDripA and gmmDripB are critical for diuresis, stress tolerance and intrauterine lactation through the regulation of water and/or other uncharged solutes.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder that has numerous medical consequences including cardiovascular morbidity. The clinical presentation in women is frequently vague, leading to its under-recognition in this population. Sleep is known to influence several female hormonal cycles including estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); consequently, sleep disruption may have adverse effects on female health including pregnancy. Miscarriage, defined as the loss of a pregnancy in the first trimester, occurs in one in four pregnancies; in up to half of cases, the cause may be unknown. Risk factors for miscarriage include increased age, increased weight, and a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, all of which are also risk factors for SDB. Since SDB is frequently accompanied by sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia, we speculate that these factors may contribute to miscarriage risk. If this is the case, then treatment of SDB may be a possible intervention for subsequent pregnancies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Although many studies have shown the evolution of sleep parameters across the lifespan, not many have included a representative sample of the general population. The objective of this study was to describe age-related changes in sleep structure, sleep respiratory parameters and periodic limb movements of the adult population of Sao Paulo.
   Methods: We selected a representative sample of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil that included both genders and an age range of 20-80 years. Pregnant and lactating women, people with physical or mental impairments that prevent self-care and people who work every night were not included. This sample included 1024 individuals who were submitted to polysomnography and structured interviews. We subdivided our sample into five-year age groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare age groups. Pearson product-moment was used to evaluate correlation between age and sleep parameters.
   Results: Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep showed a significant age-related decrease (P < 0.05). WASO (night-time spent awake after sleep onset), arousal index, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and the percentage of stages 1 and 2 showed a significant increase (P < 0.05). Furthermore, apnea-hypopnea index increased and oxygen saturation decreased with age. The reduction in the percentage of REM sleep significantly correlated with age in women, whereas the reduction in the percentage of slow wave sleep correlated with age in men. The periodic limb movement (PLM) index increased with age in men and women.
   Conclusions: Sleep structure and duration underwent significant alterations throughout the aging process in the general population. There was an important correlation between age, sleep respiratory parameters and PLM index. In addition, men and women showed similar trends but with different effect sizes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

AB Background: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors.
   Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N = 161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks) and T3 (18-20 weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs.
   Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL >= 20 min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOLP20 min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO >= 30 min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates.
   Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB AimTo compare blood pressure reactions (BPR) of infants to mild stress for evidence of adverse cardiovascular effects of passive exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and early infancy.
   MethodsAn observational field study conducted in Crete. We compared 4- to 6-month olds of lifelong nonsmokers minimally (controls, n=9) or frequently exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers; n=10) with those born to habitual smokers (n=6). Smoke exposure was verified biochemically (urine cotinine each trimester and at study). We recorded beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) during brief repositioning manoeuvres performed during a daytime nap and analysed BPR (% change in BP during head-up tilt) for associations with maternal and infant cotinine.
   ResultsWe observed a 20-fold difference between BPR of infants of controls versus passive smokers - exceptional given number of infants ( error/confidence level <10% i.e. power >90%). The BPR declined linearly as the infant's (but not mother's) cotinine level rose (p=0.04), indicating abnormal BPR was caused mainly by postnatal smoke exposure. Infants of active smokers differed from those of passive smokers.
   ConclusionCardiovascular effects of passive smoking by a newborn infant manifest early on and are exceptionally strong. They can be largely avoided by keeping the home smoke rigorously free.

AB Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the wake-sleep cycle and narcolepsy-cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin-releasing neurons (transgenic) and their wild-type controls. Pregnancy was associated with unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild-type pregnant dams (P<0.007 versus hypocretin-deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy.

AB Objective: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26-34 weeks gestation).
   Methods: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at similar to 35 and similar to 40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands between 1 and 48 Hz in each of 125 electrodes.
   Results: Near to term age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48 Hz (20% to 36% with p-values < 0.0004). Effects were significant in both quiet and active sleep, regardless of gender, singleton-twin status, gestational age (26-30 or 30-35 weeks) or birth weight (< 1500 or > 1500 g).
   Conclusion: FNI leads to increased frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better neurobehavioral outcomes.
   Significance: FNI may be a practicable means of improving outcomes in preterm infants. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Epidemiological and experimental evidence correlates adverse intrauterine conditions with the onset of disease later in life. For a fetus to achieve a successful transition to extrauterine life, a myriad of temporally integrated humoral/biophysical signals must be accurately provided by the mother. We and others have shown the existence of daily rhythms in the fetus, with peripheral clocks being entrained by maternal cues, such as transplacental melatonin signaling. Among developing tissues, the fetal hippocampus is a key structure for learning and memory processing that may be anticipated as a sensitive target of gestational chronodisruption. Here, we used pregnant rats exposed to constant light treated with or without melatonin as a model of gestational chronodisruption, to investigate effects on the putative fetal hippocampus clock, as well as on adult offspring's rhythms, endocrine and spatial memory outcomes. The hippocampus of fetuses gestated under light: dark photoperiod (12: 12 LD) displayed daily oscillatory expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Per2, clock-controlled genes Mtnr1b, Slc2a4, Nr3c1 and NMDA receptor subunits 1B-3A-3B. In contrast, in the hippocampus of fetuses gestated under constant light (LL), these oscillations were suppressed. In the adult LL offspring (reared in LD during postpartum), we observed complete lack of day/night differences in plasma melatonin and decreased day/night differences in plasma corticosterone. In the adult LL offspring, overall hippocampal day/night difference of gene expression was decreased, which was accompanied by a significant deficit of spatial memory. Notably, maternal melatonin replacement to dams subjected to gestational chronodisruption prevented the effects observed in both, LL fetuses and adult LL offspring. Collectively, the present data point to adverse effects of gestational chronodisruption on long-term cognitive function; raising challenging questions about the consequences of shift work during pregnancy. The present study also supports that developmental plasticity in response to photoperiodic cues may be modulated by maternal melatonin.

AB Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests that maternal obesity (MO) predisposes offspring to obesity and the recently described non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) but involved mechanisms remain unclear. Using a pathophysiologically relevant murine model, we here investigated a role for the biological clock -molecular core circadian genes (CCG) in the generation of NAFPD.
   Design: Female C57BL6 mice were fed an obesogenic diet (OD) or standard chow (SC) for 6 weeks, prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation: resulting offspring were subsequently weaned onto either OD (Ob_Ob and Con_Ob) or standard chow (Ob_Con and Con_Con) for 6 months. Biochemical, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic markers associated with NAFPD were then evaluated and CCG mRNA expression in the pancreas determined.
   Results: Offspring of obese dams weaned on to OD (Ob_Ob) had significantly increased (p<0.05): bodyweight, pancreatic triglycerides, macrovesicular pancreatic fatty-infiltration, and pancreatic mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, alpha-SMA, TGF-beta and increased collagen compared to offspring of control dams weaned on to control chow (Con_Con). Analyses of CCG expression demonstrated a phase shift in CLOCK (-4.818, p<0.01), REV-ERB-alpha (-1.4, p<0.05) and Per2 (3.27, p<0.05) in association with decreased amplitude in BMAL-1 (-0.914, p<0.05) and PER2 (1.18, p<0.005) in Ob_Ob compared to Con_Con. 2-way ANOVA revealed significant interaction between MO and post-weaning OD in expression of CLOCK (p<0.005), PER1 (p<0.005) and PER2 (p<0.05) whilst MO alone influenced the observed rhythmic variance in expression of all 5 measured CCG.
   Conclusions: Fetal and neonatal exposure to a maternal obesogenic environment interacts with a post-natal hyper-calorific environment to induce offspring NAFPD through mechanisms involving perturbations in CCG expression.

AB Adequate bowel preparation is important for successful colonoscopic examination. Several effective colonic cleansing agents are available and routinely prescribed, but each carries its own limitations and benefits from particular dosing regimens. The most frequently prescribed colonic cleansing agent, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) cathartic solution, suffers from low patient compliance in general, due to its unpalatable taste and smell coupled with the large ingested volumes required. However, PEG is preferred over other cathartics for use in individuals of advanced age, sufferers of chronic kidney disease, heart failure and inflammatory bowel disease, and women who are pregnant or lactating. The laxative agents sodium phosphate (NaP) and sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate have been applied and have improved patient compliance and tolerance. NaP, however, should be avoided in individuals with impaired renal function or plasma clearance, such as those with chronic kidney disease, who are taking drugs that affect renal function, or who suffer from heart failure. Other special conditions that may affect an individual's tolerance of the cathartic agent or ability to complete the administration routine include stroke, severe constipation, hematochezia, suspicious lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and mental disorders such as dementia. All ingestible bowel preparation solutions can be instilled into the stomach and duodenum through nasogastric tube or esophagogastroduodenoscope with the aid of a water irrigation pump for patients with difficulties swallowing or ingesting the large volumes of fluid required. In addition, dietary regimens based on clear liquids and low-residue foods for 1-4 d prior to the colonoscopy may be supplemental bowel preparation strategies. Achieving an effective and safe cleansing of the bowel is important for successful colonoscopy in all patients, so full knowledge of the individual's condition and capabilities is necessary to select the most appropriate colonic cleansing agent and delivery regimen.

AB Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.
   Methods/Design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the link between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and sleep-disordered breathing using complete polysomnography and questionnaires in a case-control study of pregnant women.
   METHODS: Pregnant women (body mass index [BMI] less than 35, no prior diabetes or hypertension) were eligible as cases (n=26) if diagnosed with GDM by routine 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Women in the control group without GDM (n=26) were matched for gestational age at polysomnography, BMI, and age. Polysomnography were conducted at home at 24-32 weeks of gestation. Sleepiness score (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), risk for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and restless legs syndrome were assessed by questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Primary outcome apnea-hypopnea index (4.2 +/- 3.9 events per hour in women in the case group compared with 3.8 +/- 2.3 events per hour in women in the control group) as well as other objective and subjective sleep measures, including oxygen desaturation index, snoring, and flow limitation, were not significantly different between groups. Sleepiness was greater in women in the case group than in women in the control group (9.8 +/- 3.6 compared with 7.2 +/- 3.6, P=.05). Additionally, 23% of women in the case group compared with 0% of women in the control group (P<. 01) reported an Edinburgh Scale score of at least 10 (suggesting significant depression) and 46% of women with GDM reported restless legs syndrome compared to 19% of women in the control group (P=.07).
   CONCLUSION: There was no association between GDM and sleep-disordered breathing in pregnant women with prepregnancy BMIs under 35 and no medical comorbidities.

AB Human Psychopharmacology recently published my review into the increase in empirical knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA over the past 25years (Parrott, 2013a). Deficits have been demonstrated in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status. Neuroimaging studies have shown serotonergic deficits, which are associated with lifetime Ecstasy/MDMA usage, and degree of neurocognitive impairment. Basic psychological skills remain intact. Ecstasy/MDMA use by pregnant mothers leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Hence, the damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA were far more widespread than was realized a few years ago. In their critique of my review, Doblin et al. (2014) argued that my review contained misstatements, omitted contrary findings, and recited dated misconceptions. In this reply, I have answered all the points they raised. I have been able to refute each of their criticisms by citing the relevant empirical data, since many of their points were based on inaccurate summaries of the actual research findings. Doblin and colleagues are proponents of the use of MDMA for drug-assisted psychotherapy, and their strongest criticisms were focused on my concerns about this proposal. However, again all the issues I raised were based on sound empirical evidence or theoretical understanding. Indeed I would recommend potentially far safer co-drugs such as D-cycloserine or oxytocin. In summary, MDMA can induce a wide range of neuropsychobiological changes, many of which are damaging to humans. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. Design Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10-20weeks gestation. Methods Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality (M=5.4, SD=2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M=33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (beta=-.18, p<0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (beta=-.18, p<0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.

AB Importance Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common condition in postreproductive females. Key risk factors for later-life CVD include gestational hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia (PE). Although several risk factors of hypertension in pregnancy are well recognized, a novel risk factor that has emerged recently is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a condition characterized by repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep with disrupted ventilation and sleep fragmentation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is now known to play a causal role in future CVD.
   Objective The aim of this study was to propose the hypothesis that occult SDB during pregnancy may play a role in long-term CVD in women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
   Evidence Acquisition This study is a review and synthesis of empirical evidence that links SDB to GHTN/PE and GHTN/PE to future CVD.
   Results An increasing body of evidence supports the relationship between SDB and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy via mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with long-term risk for CVD via similar mechanisms. However, no studies have addressed the potential role of SDB in long-term outcomes of women with GHTN/PE during pregnancy.
   Conclusions Given the suggested mechanisms that explain these associations, it is plausible that SDB during pregnancy may increase long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
   Relevance Pregnancy may offer a window of opportunity for identification and treatment of SDB, which could provide substantial health benefit for many years to come.
   Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians
   Learning Objectives After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to evaluate the current evidence regarding the frequency of SDB in pregnancy, its risk factors, subsequent outcomes, and treatment.

AB Background There are few studies investigating the relationship between respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and asthma in the offspring, and none among mothers with asthma. Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non-asthmatic mothers. Methods A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma was followed up at 6 and 12months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent-completed questionnaire. Results Twelve-month-old infants whose mothers had confirmed viral infections in pregnancy (n=26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had 4-12 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%), prolonged colds (2wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and parent-perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had common colds without laboratory-confirmed viral infection (n=16). Conclusions This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma. Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, and infants of asthmatic mothers are at increased risk of asthma themselves. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.

AB Background Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) has been shown to be associated with negative clinical sequelae such as systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It has been reported in the literature that approximately 53-56 % of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have positional OSA, known as POSA.
   Potential treatment for SDB in pregnancy These findings have led to a resurgence of positional therapy as an effective treatment for select patients with SDB. Pregnant patients can also be diagnosed with SDB, the negative consequences of which not only pertain to the patient but to the unborn fetus as well. Despite this, however, SDB is under-diagnosed in pregnant patients and research looking at SDB in pregnant patients and potential therapies are scarce.
   Conclusions This article reviews the literature regarding the physiologic respiratory changes that occur during pregnancy, SDB in pregnancy, supine hypotensive syndrome (SHS), complications and current treatments for these events and potential roles for positional therapy in pregnant women whose problems may be specifically position dependent.

AB IntroductionThe aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health, specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause.
   MethodsA systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words shift-work and female/women. Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause.
   ResultsTwenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure.
   DiscussionEvidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work.

AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterised by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause predominantly seen in obese women of childbearing age and associated with a history of recent weight gain. The aetiology is poorly understood and there are no evidence-based guidelines on the management of the disease. We aim to provide a review of the recent literature outlining the latest advances in this field over the past few years. Areas of emerging interest related to the pathophysiology of IIH will be discussed, such as the role of obesity, adipose tissue and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. We consider the latest research on the role of venous sinus stenosis in IIH and ex vivo advances into cerebrospinal fluid drainage via the arachnoid granulation tissue. The latest techniques for optic nerve head evaluation and the role of optical coherence tomography will be summarised. Finally, we will discuss recent advances in the management of IIH, including weight loss, and medical and surgical treatment strategies.

AB Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs. Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health. The relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review.
   Databases were searched for the related published English literature up to 15 May 2013. The search terms used in various combinations included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals. The results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein.
   Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction, especially during pregnancy. Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities. Melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative stress. The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction. This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy. Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non-human mammals. Likewise, the maintenance of a regular maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus. Experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn. To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy. Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus. Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions.
   A number of conclusions naturally evolve from the data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity, this indoleamine may have utility in the treatment of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc. (iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin.

AB Background: Street vending, a dominant occupation in urban areas of developing countries exposes the vendors to several environmental pollutants. We investigated whether work as street vendor impairs foetal growth and shortens gestational duration, and evaluated to what extent exposure to traffic-related air pollution is responsible for these adverse effects.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers and their newborns accessing postnatal services at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana in 2010, focusing on 105 street vendors and a reference group of 281 mothers. We categorized exposure to traffic-related air pollution on the basis of street vending activity patterns and traffic density in the working area.
   Results: Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for age, social class, marital status and gravidity of mothers, sex of neonate, and indoor air pollution, indicated a 177 g (95% CI: 324, 31) reduction in birth weight among street vendors. Sensitivity analysis performed by restricting the analysis to term births showed further reductions in birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting for confounders indicated a 35% (risk ratio (RR) = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.87, 2.12) increased risk of LBW, albeit statistically not significant. LBW risk increased in the sensitivity analysis but was also not statistically significant. The risk of PTB was not associated with street vending (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.58). The exposure-response relations observed were not consistent. Moderate activity patterns and high traffic density jointly was associated with a statistically significant 84% (RR= 1.84; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.24) increased risk of LBW.
   Conclusion: Street vending during pregnancy is a determinant of average foetal growth and risk of LBW. More research is required to further quantify their effects on pregnancy outcomes and safeguard maternal and perinatal health in developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundOur goal is to study the triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery using a case-crossover design.
   MethodsIn a pilot study, we enrolled 50 women with spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 2011 and 2012. To assess non-transient risk factors, we also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls). Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of interest during the 72h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24h before index time with that from 48 to 72h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   ResultsPreviously hypothesised chronic risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3], sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the subsequent 24h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors evaluated, the OR was close to the null.
   ConclusionSkipping meals and disturbed sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management.

AB Objective:To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates.Methods:Newborn infants (35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated.Results:Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p = 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores.Conclusions:Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleepincluding analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentationshowed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

AB Alteration in the HPA axis is a robust biomarker of anxiety and depression in adults, but questions remain about this association in pregnancy. We examined the longitudinal links between diurnal cortisol and mood symptoms from self-report questionnaire and diagnostic interview in an ethnically diverse, psychosocially at-risk sample of 101 women at mid-pregnancy and early third trimester. There were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline; the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview. These effects were independent of socio-demographic factors and sleep disturbance. Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant. These findings extend prior work by showing that significant mood symptoms in pregnancy are associated with altered diurnal cortisol in pregnancy, which may have implications for maternal and child health.

ID MUSCLE CRAMPS; REST CRAMPS; PREGNANCY; SUBSTITUTION; QUININE; PEOPLE
AB Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are common in primary care and may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of magnesium in treating NLC and the side-effect profile of magnesium compared to placebo.
   We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, , the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registries until August 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing magnesium therapy for NLC in adults with any other comparator were eligible. Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies. To compensate for the heterogeneity in outcome measures, simulations were used to summarize the data.
   Seven RCTs were included in the review (n 361), all comparing magnesium to placebo. Three of these trials included only pregnant women. The difference in the median number of leg cramps per week between the placebo and the intervention groups was 0.345 (quantile 2.5%: 0.133, quantile 97.5%: 0.875). This difference was 0.807 (quantile 2.5%: 0.015, quantile 97.5%: 1.207) in the three studies involving only pregnant women and 0.362 (quantile 2.5%: 0.386, quantile 97.5%: 1.148) in the others. Overall gastrointestinal side effects were slightly more common with magnesium therapy than with placebo. The strength of this evidence was weak, mainly due to small study sizes and short follow-up.
   Magnesium therapy does not appear to be effective in the treatment of NLC in the general population, but may have a small effect in pregnant women. Further research using better designed RCTs is necessary.

AB Background: Frequency of pertussis is highly variable from country to country and it depends on multiple factors including case definitions and type of surveillance systems used. Many countries recently reported an increase of pertussis cases especially in infants and adolescents.
   Methods: From April 2006 to March 2011, 15-year-old patients hospitalized with suspected or proven pertussis were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Patients with 14 days of cough plus paroxysms, whooping or post-tussive vomiting fulfilled the clinical case definition of pertussis. For laboratory confirmation, Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain reaction was offered free of charge.
   Results: Data were available from 159 of 173 reported cases and 130 (90% of them <12 months old) were eligible including 125 laboratory-confirmed B. pertussis infections. Rates per 100,000 population were 2.6 (<16 years) and 38.8 (<12 months), respectively. Most frequent complications were cyanosis (63%) and sleep disturbance (60%); 35 (27%) patients received intensive care and 1 patient died. Source of infection was known in 79 (61%) patients and was mainly a sibling, parent or both. Most patients were unimmunized (65%) or incompletely immunized (30%).
   Conclusions: The high rate of pertussis hospitalization in young infants established in this surveillance project and the incomplete pertussis immunization status in almost all hospitalized patients require further efforts for improvement. In addition, introduction of pertussis immunizations for all adolescents (in 2013), young adults (in 2012) and pregnant women (in 2013) in Switzerland should increase indirect protection of vulnerable newborns and infants too young to be fully immunized.

AB BackgroundIn contrast to postpartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder, little is known about the risk of recurrence in men with bipolar disorder who have just become fathers.
   Case reportWe present the case of a man with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode immediately after becoming a father. His spouse had a normal pregnancy, and delivery started during daytime and lasted until the early morning hours. The patient subsequently developed a manic episode, which had a major impact on the family.
   ConclusionsThere is a well-known relationship between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode. The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the perinatal and postpartum period may also negatively impact the course of bipolar disorder in the father. In cases of pregnancy of a male bipolar disorder patient's spouse, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be planned in advance.

AB This paper reviews recent work investigating the influence of sleep disturbances on maternal hyperglycemia, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is cause for concern because GDMand even mild hyperglycemia are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing, and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are, however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore, interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep parameters can prevent/ decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia. Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being.

AB ObjectiveWe sought to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in deliveries occurring overnight with those in daylight hours.
   DesignProspective observational study.
   SettingLarge national tertiary referral center.
   PopulationAll singleton laboring nulliparous parturients delivering infants >500g over a 2-year period, 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009.
   MethodsDetails of intrapartum characteristics and neonatal outcomes of deliveries occurring between midnight and 08.00h were compared with deliveries occurring outside of these hours.
   Main outcome measuresMaternal and neonatal morbidity.
   ResultsDuring the study period there were 8450 nulliparous deliveries. 2668 (31.6%) delivered between midnight and 08.00h, and 5782 (68.4%) outside of these hours. There was a significant difference between the time periods in the number of babies born with a cord pH <7.1: 10.8% (44/406) of babies were born between midnight and 08.00h, and 6.3% (63/1007) of babies were born outside these hours (p=0.003). There was no significant difference in terms of Apgar score <7 at 5min (p=0.17). There was a trend toward a larger number of anal sphincter injuries occurring between midnight and 08.00h (3% vs. 2.3%; p=0.05).
   ConclusionOur findings suggest that infants are more likely to be born with a pH <7.1 and there was a trend toward an increased rate of anal sphincter injury during time periods when staffing levels are low and clinician fatigue may play a role in decision-making and patient management. This may play a role in service provision planning and staff recruitment.

Interburst interval and different wavelength amplitudes were digitally measured during the most discontinuous and most continuous (periods with longest and shortest interburst intervals, respectively) parts of the tracings. Linear regression was used to assess conceptional age prediction of interburst interval and wavelength amplitudes. Significant regression results were compared to the group of babies recorded close to delivery (newborn group).
   Results: 144 EEG tracings from 59 infants were analyzed. Interburst intervals were significantly predicted by conceptional age in the newborn group only (p <= 0.002). Delta and theta amplitudes were significantly predicted by conceptional age in the newborn group and most of the other conceptional age groups (p < 0.004). No significant differences were detected between the different groups.
   Conclusions: Our data reiterates the normal maturation of cerebral activity in the premature infant and support the concept of similar in and ex-utero maturation of cerebral activity in stable premature infants.
   Significance: The effect of ex-utero maturation on the brain of stable premature infant is not readily discernible when using specific neonatal EEG indices. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MULTIPLE-BIRTH; RISK-FACTORS; INFANTS; TORTICOLLIS; DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: Following the "back to sleep" recommendations, a striking rise in deformational plagiocephaly (DP) occurred. However, additional maternal, pregnancy and infant conditions may play a role.
   Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for DP at birth. Additionally, given the association between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) use and unfavorable pregnancy events, we explored the association between ART and DP.
   Patients and Methods: A total of 413 neonates >33 weeks born at L. Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) from May 2011 through to January 2012 were enrolled. Data regarding parental, conceivement, pregnancy and delivery characteristics were recorded. Infants' skull measurements, including the oblique cranial length ratio (OCLR) were taken within 72 h after birth. Plagiocephaly was defined for OCLR > 105.9.
   Results: The prevalence of DP was 20.3%. It was associated with twinning (OR 5.0; 95% CI 2.22-11.1), pregnancy complications (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.49-5.26), prematurity (OR 2.13; 95% CI 0.98-4.54), ART use (OR 2.00; 95% CI 0.90-4.35) and male gender (OR 1.79; 95% CI 0.94-2.50). Adjusting for multiple pregnancies however, the association between ART and DP disappeared.
   Conclusion: Results show that offspring of pregnancies conceived through ART do not have increased risk of DP. However, our numbers are small thus larger studies are needed for definitive conclusions.

AB Rabbits mated at postpartum estrus become concurrently pregnant and lactating. They wean the first litter shortly before delivering the second one. Lactating-only rabbits do not spontaneously wean their young. These differences suggest that: a) suckling contributes to the long-term maintenance of maternal responsiveness and b) pregnancy-associated factors are essential to promote weaning. To explore if suckling stimulation interacts with the pregnancy condition we compared the behavior of intact and thelectomized (thelx; nipple-removed) rabbits, mated or not at postpartum estrus (Experiment 1). All lactating-only rabbits still showed nursing behavior by postpartum day 44; only 71% of thelx not pregnant does displayed maternal responsiveness for 31 days and none by postpartum day 44. If mated at postpartum estrus maternal responsiveness was observed only in 25% of pregnant-lactating does on postpartum day 29 and in 8% of thelx-pregnant rabbits on postpartum day 26. As in pregnant-lactating does progesterone (P) is present across ca. 3 weeks and then declines, but it is absent in lactating-only rabbits, in Experiment 2 we explored the effect of injecting P to lactating-only animals on their maternal responsiveness and milk output P injections (20 mg/day) were given across lactation days 1-30 or 1-23. Neither treatment modified maternal behavior: nearly all females entered the nest box, crouched over the litter and suckled it for ca. 3 min, as did oil-injected nursing rabbits. In contrast, both P treatments accentuated the decline in milk output, with respect to oil-treated does. Results suggest that suckling promotes the long-term maintenance of maternal behavior while pregnancy-associated factors (not P) are essential to trigger weaning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with a high risk of abnormal neuro-development. Underlying neuroanatomical substrates are partially documented. We hypothesized that at 12 months preterm infants would evidence specific white-matter microstructure alterations and gray-matter differences induced by severe IUGR. Twenty preterm infants with IUGR (26-34 weeks of gestation) were compared with 20 term-born infants and 20 appropriate for gestational age preterm infants of similar gestational age. Preterm groups showed no evidence of brain abnormalities. At 12 months, infants were scanned sleeping naturally. Gray-matter volumes were studied with voxel-based morphometry. White-matter microstructure was examined using tract-based spatial statistics. The relationship between diffusivity indices in white matter, gray matter volumes, and perinatal data was also investigated. Gray-matter decrements attributable to IUGR comprised amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus and insula bilaterally, left occipital and parietal lobes, and right perirolandic area. Gray-matter volumes positively correlated with birth weight exclusively. Preterm infants had reduced FA in the corpus callosum, and increased FA in the anterior corona radiata. Additionally, IUGR infants had increased FA in the forceps minor, internal and external capsules, uncinate and fronto-occipital white matter tracts. Increased axial diffusivity was observed in several white matter tracts. Fractional anisotropy positively correlated with birth weight and gestational age at birth. These data suggest that IUGR differentially affects gray and white matter development preferentially affecting gray matter. At 12 months IUGR is associated with a specific set of structural gray-matter decrements. White matter follows an unusual developmental pattern, and is apparently affected by IUGR and prematurity combined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study explored community perceptions of cultural beliefs and practices that may increase sexual risk behaviour of adolescents, to understand more about meaning they hold within the culture and how they expose adolescent orphans and non-orphans to higher risks in a high HIV and teenage pregnancy prevalence context.
   Methods: Using a qualitative descriptive cross-sectional design 14 focus group discussions were conducted with 78 adolescents and 68 parents/guardians purposively selected to represent their communities. Thirteen key informant interviews were also conducted with community leaders, health care and child welfare workers, and adolescents who were also selected purposively. The two methods were used to explore how cultural beliefs and practices predispose adolescent orphans and non-orphans to risky sexual behaviours. Data were analysed through line-by-line coding, grouped into families and retrieved as themes and sub-themes.
   Results: Identified cultural practices that predisposed adolescents orphans and non-orphans to risky sexual behaviours included: adolescent sleeping arrangements, funeral ceremonies, replacing a deceased married daughter with her younger sister in marriage, widow inheritance among boys, early marriage among girls, and preference for boys/sons. Cultural risks perceived to equally affect both orphans and non-orphans were sleeping arrangements, funeral ceremonies, and sister replacement. Factors associated more with orphans than non-orphans were widow inheritance among boys and a preference for boy over girl children.
   Conclusions: Adolescent sexual risk reduction programs should be developed considering the specific cultural context, using strategies that empower communities to challenge the widely accepted cultural norms that may predispose young people in general to sexual risks while targeting those that unequally influence orphans.

AB Background: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses.
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum.
   Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p < 0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1 similar to 6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4 similar to 7.3) in the third trimester.
   Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS.

AB Background: The incidence of snoring and sleepiness is known to increase during pregnancy, and this might impact maternal health and obstetric outcome. However, the association between snoring and sleepiness during pregnancy is not fully understood. This study was aimed at investigating the development of snoring during pregnancy and prospectively assessing if there is an association between snoring and sleepiness or adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, mode of delivery, and fetal complications.
   Methods: Consecutively recruited pregnant women (n = 500) received a questionnaire concerning snoring and sleep at the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who had rated their frequency of snoring at both occasions (n = 340) were divided into subgroups according to the development of snoring they reported and included in the subsequent analyses. Additional medical data were collected from the medical records.
   Results: The frequency of snoring was 7.9% in the 1st trimester and increased to 21.2% in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who snored already in early pregnancy had significantly higher baseline BMI (p = 0.001) than the women who never snored, but snoring was not associated with the magnitude of weight gain during pregnancy. Snoring women were more likely to experience edema in late pregnancy than the non-snorers. Women who started to snore during pregnancy had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scores than the non snorers in both early and late pregnancy. No significant association between obstetric outcome and snoring was found.
   Conclusion: Snoring does increase during pregnancy, and this increase is associated with sleepiness, higher BMI at the start of pregnancy and higher prevalence of edema, but not with weight gain.

AB The effects of rapid eye movement sleep restriction (REMSR) in rats during late pregnancy were studied on the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) made by the pups. USVs are distress calls inaudible to human ears. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was restricted in one group of pregnant rats for 22 hours, starting from gestational day 14 to 20, using standard single platform method. The USVs of male pups were recorded after a brief isolation from their mother for two minutes on alternate post-natal days, from day one till weaning. The USVs were recorded using microphones and were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using SASPro software. Control pups produced maximum vocalization on post-natal days 9 to 11. In comparison, the pups born to REMSR mothers showed not only a reduction in vocalization but also a delay in peak call making days. The experimental group showed variations in the types and characteristics of call types, and alteration in temporal profile. The blunting of distress call making response in these pups indicates that maternal sleep plays a role in regulating the neural development involved in vocalizations and possibly in shaping the emotional behaviour in neonates. It is suggested that the reduced ultrasonic vocalizations can be utilized as a reliable early marker for affective state in rat pups. Such impaired vocalization responses could provide an important lead in understanding mother-child bonding for an optimal cognitive development during post-partum life. This is the first report showing a potential link between maternal REM sleep deprivation and the vocalization in neonates and infants.

TI High Fat Diet and In Utero Exposure to Maternal Obesity Disrupts

AB The risk of obesity in adulthood is subject to programming beginning at conception. In animal models, exposure to maternal obesity and high fat diets influences the risk of obesity in the offspring. Among other long-term changes, offspring from obese rats develop hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and lipogenic gene expression in the liver at weaning. However, the precise underlying mechanisms leading to metabolic dysregulation in the offspring remains unclear. Using a rat model of overfeeding-induced obesity, we previously demonstrated that exposure to maternal obesity from preconception to birth, is sufficient to program increased obesity risk in the offspring. Offspring of obese rat dams gain greater body weight and fat mass when fed high fat diet (HFD) as compared to lean dam. Since, disruptions of diurnal circadian rhythm are known to detrimentally impact metabolically active tissues such as liver, we examined the hypothesis that maternal obesity leads to perturbations of core clock components and thus energy metabolism in offspring liver. Offspring from lean and obese dams were examined at post-natal day 35, following a short (2 wk) HFD challenge. Hepatic mRNA expression of circadian (CLOCK, BMAL1, REV-ERB alpha, CRY, PER) and metabolic (PPAR alpha, SIRT1) genes were strongly suppressed in offspring exposed to both maternal obesity and HFD. Using a mathematical model, we identified two distinct biological mechanisms that modulate PPAR alpha mRNA expression: i) decreased mRNA synthesis rates; and ii) increased non-specific mRNA degradation rate. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that changes in PPAR alpha transcription were associated with epigenomic alterations in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks near the PPAR alpha transcription start site. Our findings indicated that offspring from obese rat dams have detrimental alternations to circadian machinery that may contribute to impaired liver metabolism in response to HFD, specifically via reduced PPAR alpha expression prior to obesity development.

AB Background: Transient exposures may influence fertility and early embryonic development. To assess the time of conception in vivo and conduct concurrent biomonitoring, ovulation must be identified prospectively. We report on the development and validation of a simple, prospective method, the Peak Day method, to determine likely day of ovulation based upon daily observations of cervical fluid.
   Methods: We recruited 98 women to learn the Peak Day method from a brochure, 26 of whom concurrently used the method with blinded daily urine hormone monitoring (estrone glucuronide and luteinizing hormone). All women were instructed to complete an exposure questionnaire immediately upon identifying ovulation. Briefly, the exposure questionnaire captured time-varying and transient exposures such as medication use, water consumption, and amount of sleep. We assessed timely completion of the exposure questionnaire, agreement of women's estimated day of ovulation (EDO) and the EDO by expert review, and agreement between the EDO by expert review and by blinded urine monitoring.
   Results: Of 147 cycles evaluated, women selected an EDO in 130 (88%) and subsequently completed the periovulatory exposure questionnaire in 122 (94%) cycles. Of the 26 cycles evaluated with blinded hormonal monitoring, the Peak Day "best quality" algorithm, based upon cervical fluid, identified ovulation +/- 3 days of the urine monitor in 24 cycles (92%).
   Conclusions: With simple written instructions, women can identify an estimated day of ovulation and perform periovulatory exposure assessment. The Peak Day method is highly cost-effective and could be applied by researchers to target periconceptional or very early developmental stage exposure assessment.

AB The notion that 'older' mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother's health, and her newborn's health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age.

AB Background: Sleep disturbance has become an important health problem for pregnant women. In fact, pregnancy-associated sleep disorder has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity. We aimed to study the relationship between sleep disturbance and preterm birth during pregnancy in a sample of Iranian women.
   Methods: In this analytical cohort study, 231 pregnant women in their 28th-32nd gestational week were recruited, using the multistage sampling method, from four healthcare centres in Ardabil, Iran, during 2010. The women were followed-up until 37-week gestation. One hundred and twelve women did not have sleep disturbances while 119 women had sleep disturbances. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and a demographic data questionnaire were used for data collection. Data were analysed using SPSS software. Descriptive statistics, t, Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used as appropriate.
   Results: The prevalence of preterm labour was 11.8% in women with sleep disorder compared with 11.6% in women without sleep disorder (p = 0.9). Sleep duration less than eight hours, daytime dysfunction and impaired quality of life as a component of ISI showed a significant relationship with preterm birth (p = 0.02, p = 0.044, and p = 0.047, respectively).
   Conclusion: Although daily dysfunction and lower quality of life because of sleep problems, and total sleep duration were variables associated with preterm birth, we found no significant relationship between sleep disorder and preterm birth.

AB Clinical and experimental studies suggest that prenatal exposure to stress can impact the growth and development of offspring. The effect of prenatal exposure to constant light, applied as a chronic stressor, on endochondral ossification of the tibiae of 3-day-old and 15-day-old pups was histomor-phometrically evaluated. Pregnant rats were divided into 2 groups: mothers chronically exposed to a 12: 12-hour light/light cycle (LL) and control mothers maintained on a 12: 12-hour light/dark cycle on days 10-20 of pregnancy. On postnatal days 3 and 15, the pups were weighed and euthanized. The tibiae were resected and histologically processed to obtain sections for hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) histochemistry, in order to perform histomorphometric determinations. The data were statistically analyzed. A significant decrease in hypertrophic cartilage thickness was observed in the tibiae of the 3-day-old (LL: 0.134 +/- 0.02 vs. controls: 0.209 +/- 0.023 mm; p < 0.01) and 15-day-old (LL: 23.32 +/- 3.98 vs. controls: 22.96 +/- 1.93 mm; p < 0.05) prenatally stressed pups. The subchondral bone volume was significantly lower in the tibiae of the 3-day-old LL pups (38.83 +/- 6.14%) than in the controls (62.83 +/- 10.67%; p < 0.01). The decrease in subchondral bone volume and hypertrophic cartilage thickness shows that the normal growth process of the tibia is impaired in prenatally stressed pups. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB A mother's emotional state is a well-known environmental factor that relates to the development of infant temperament. However, some relevant issues have not yet been fully explored. The current study examines the influence of determined maternal, contextual and perinatal variables on infant temperament and the mother's confidence in caregiving during the first weeks of life. A prospective study was carried out in three-hundred and seventeen newborns and their mothers. Perinatal and socio-demographic variables were recorded. The mother's anxiety and mood were measured in the first days after childbirth and again at 8 weeks. Infant temperament and the mother's confidence in caregiving were measured at 8 weeks. A mother's postpartum anxiety following delivery was the best predictor for most of the variables of infant temperament, including infant irritability (p = .001), and other child variables like infant sleep (p = .0003) and nursing difficulty (p = .001). Contextual-family variables, such as the number of people at home (p = .0024) and whether they were primiparous (p = .001), were the best predictors for a mother's confidence in caregiving. Support was found for an early effect of maternal anxiety on infant temperament. The results have clinical implications for postnatal psychological interventions.

AB The fetus, which develops within a fluid-filled amniotic sac, relies on the placenta for respiratory gas exchange rather than the lungs. While not involved in fetal oxygenation, fetal breathing movements (FBM) nevertheless have an important role in lung growth and in development of respiratory muscles and neural regulation. FBM are regulated differently in many respects than postnatal respiration, which results from the unique intrauterine environment. Prominent distinctions of FBM include its episodic nature and apnea-sensitivity to hypoxia. The latter characteristic is the basis for using FBM in the assessment of fetuses at risk for hypoxic injury. At birth, the transition to continuous postnatal respiration involves a fall in temperature, gaseous distention of the lungs, activation of the Hering-Breuer reflexes, and functional connectivity of afferent O-2 chemoreceptor activity with respiratory motoneurons and arousal centers. Importantly, exposure to drugs or adverse conditions in utero not only can change patterns of FBM but also can lead to epigenetic dysregulation in postnatal respiration. Such changes, can blunt respiratory and arousal defenses against hypoxic challenges in sleep. Thus, fetal hypoxia and/or drug exposure may in later life dispose sleeping infants, children, and adults to hypertension, diabetes mellitus, brain injury, and sudden death.

AB Aims:This study examined whether the association between sleep duration, as well as sleep continuity, and cognitive function differs between normally developing preterm children compared to full-term children during middle childhood. Methods: A total of 58 early preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) and 55 full-term children, aged 6-10 years and enrolled in elementary school, were assessed on sleep duration, sleep continuity and cognitive function. We used in-home polysomnographic recordings of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and nocturnal awakenings. Cognitive tests included intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial memory. Results: Preterm children showed poorer performance in intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, and visuospatial memory (d = 0.38-0.79, p<0.05) and more objectively assessed nocturnal awakenings (d = 0.40, p = 0.03) than full-term children. Associations of sleep efficiency and cognitive functions (intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, visuospatial memory) were positive and stronger for preterm children (beta = 0.17-0.31, p < 0.05), while they were nonsignificant for full-term children. Conclusion: Results confirm lower cognitive test scores and more nocturnal awakenings in normally developing early preterm children compared to full-term children. Furthermore, poor sleep efficiency may aggravate cognitive deficits, particularly in children who are more vulnerable due to premature birth. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background
   Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is commonly diagnosed in the neonatal population (DiPietro 1994), and generally causes few or no symptoms (Vandenplas 2009). Conversely, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) refers to GOR that causes troublesome symptoms with or without complications such as damage to the oesophagus (Vandenplas 2009). Currently there is no evidence to support the range of measures recommended to help alleviate acid reflux experienced by infants. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) has been used as an intervention to modulate neonatal state behaviours through its pacifying effects such as decrease infant fussiness and crying during feeds (Boiron 2007; Pickler 2004).
   Objectives
   To determine if NNS reduces GORD in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) and low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, three months of age and less, with signs or symptoms suggestive of GORD, or infants with a diagnosis of GORD.
   Search methods
   We performed computerised searches of the electronic databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 9, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2013), CINAHL (1982 to September 2013), and EMBASE (1988 to September 2013). We applied no language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   Controlled trials using random or quasi-random allocation of preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) and low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants three months of age and less with signs or symptoms suggestive of GORD, or infants with a diagnosis of GORD. We included studies reported only by abstracts, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data. We identified two studies from the initial search. After further review, we excluded both studies.
   Main results
   We identified no studies examining the effects of NNS for GORD in preterm and low birth weight infants
   Authors' conclusions
   There was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of NNS for GORD. Adequately powered RCTs on the effect of NNS in preterm and low birth weight infants diagnosed with GORD are required.

AB Background
   Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for Plasmodium vivax.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.
   Main results
   Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment.
   For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials, 3662 participants, high quality evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality evidence).
   For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46%(RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.
   In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence) but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.
   In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes.
   In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar.
   A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants).
   Authors' conclusions
   Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants.

AB Self-monitoring of blood glucose has been used for many years to control glucose levels in diabetic patients. This method is a quick and easy way for taking pre/postprandial and pre-sleep glucose measurements and it is very simple for most of the patients. However, it does not allow collecting detailed information about excursions of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia since most of the samples are widely spaced in time, which leads to lose important information for the treatment of diabetes. Nowadays, Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) is used to solve such problem. CGMS devices take blood glucose samples continuously (normally every 5 minutes) from patients having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This paper presents a literature review exploring the current CGMS applications and the role of this signal in the identification of risk factor for diabetic patients.

AB Objective. Chemokines exert different inflammatory responses which can potentially be related to certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of selected chemokines in plasma and amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. Method. Out of 171 amniocentesis, we had 7 patients with confirmed fetal Down syndrome (15th-18th weeks of gestation). For the purpose of our control, we chose 14 women without confirmed chromosomal aberration. To assess the concentration of chemokines in the blood plasma and amniotic fluid, we used a protein macroarray, which allows the simultaneous determination of 40 chemokines per sample. Results. We showed significant decrease in the concentration of 4 chemokines, HCC-4, IL-28A, IL-31, and MCP-2, and increase in the concentration of CXCL7 (NAP-2) in plasma of women with fetal Down syndrome. Furthermore, we showed decrease in concentration of 3 chemokines, ITAC, MCP-3, MIF, and increase in concentration of 4 chemokines, IP-10, MPIF-1, CXCL7, and 6Ckine, in amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. Conclusion. On the basis of our findings, our hypothesis is that the chemokines may play role in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. Defining their potential as biochemical markers of Down syndrome requires further investigation on larger group of patients.

AB Objective: Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes and less mental well-being. In pregnant women with a mental disorder, who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients and healthy controls during pregnancy.
   Methods: This observational study was embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status.
   Results: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted beta = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.53, p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

AB Disturbances in circadian rhythms have been proposed to play an important role in perinatal depression as is indicated by the disturbance of sleep patterns. Melatonin is considered to be a credible biomarker of circadian disturbances. In depressive patients, melatonin levels are relatively lower than in healthy subjects; this may also be true in the case of antenatal depression. During pregnancy increased night concentrations of melatonin follow closely the increases in estrogen and progesterone. If the circadian rhythm deregulation in some forms of depression reflects a decreased induction of melatonin production, it is possible that depressive symptoms may be reduced by influencing the pattern of melatonin excretion. Bright light therapy seems to be a biological method that influences melatonin circuits with promising therapeutic results for perinatal depression.

AB We report a patient with pregnancy related obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA]; apnea hypopnea index [AHI] 18/h) early after delivery, with improvement of AHI by 87% following 45-degree elevation in body position compared with the non-elevated position. Improvement associated with this position may be explained, at least in part, by an increased upper airway diameter (as measured during wakefulness). Sleep apnea in this patient resolved at 9 months postpartum. This observation suggests that 45-degree elevated body position may be an effective treatment of pregnancy related OSA during the postpartum period.

AB Study Objectives: The study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the extremely obese manifest sleep disordered breathing with a preponderance of hypopneas and relative paucity of obstructive apneas.
   Methods: Retrospective review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) < 35, Group B: BMI >= 45. Exclusion criteria: age < 18 years, pregnancy, >= 5 central apneas/hour, BMI >= 35 < 45.
   Primary Outcome Measure: Hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO(2)), and presence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Statistical methods: t-test for independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis chi(2). Descriptive statistics were expressed as interquartile range, median and mean +/- standard deviation, p < 0.05 considered significant.
   Results: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 +/- 11.5 years, BMI = 28.9 +/- 4 kg/m(2); Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 +/- 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 +/- 8 kg/m(2). HAR was significantly higher in Group B (38.8 +/- 50.7) than Group A (10.6 +/- 16.5), p = 0.0006, as was HI (28.7 +/- 28.6 in B vs 12.6 +/- 8.4 in A, p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 +/- 33.8 vs 22 +/- 23, p = 0.03), but not apnea index. HAR was significantly higher in Group B regardless of race, gender, or presence of OHS. The BMI was the only significant predictor of HAR (adjusted r(2) = 0.138; p = 0.002) in a linear regression model with natural log transformation of the HAR performed for age, gender, race, BMI, and PetCO(2).
   Conclusion: Extremely obese patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas.

AB Study Objective: To assess the validity of using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) Unicorder for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women.
   Methods: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9) kg/m(2) with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007 criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs calculated with the ARES propriety software.
   Results: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI >= 5 events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI >= 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in our sample.
   Conclusions: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency with PSG for diagnosing OSA in this small, heterogeneous sample of obese pregnant women.

AB Objectives: Both restless legs syndrome ([RLS], also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease [WED]) and depression are common during pregnancy. However, no prior studies have assessed if pregnant women with RLS have an elevated risk of depression during and/or after pregnancy.
   Methods: 1,428 women who were pregnant in gestational week 16-17 were asked to participate in a longitudinal survey. They were followed by web-based questionnaires in gestational week 17 and 32, and 6 weeks after delivery. Data were also retrieved from prenatal and birth records. Two different sets of criteria were used to examine the prevalence of RLS in the cohort (International Restless Legs Syndrome Society Group standard criteria and the later developed CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire). The latter questionnaire attempts to exclude those with common "mimics" of RLS.
   Results: Adjusted odds ratio for depression in gestational week 17, 32, and postpartum week 6 in relation to pre-pregnancy RLS onset and moderate to severe symptom severity were 4.74 (2.30 - 9.76), 3.67 (1.85 - 7.28), and 2.58 (1.28 - 5.21), respectively. No significant associations were seen in pregnant women with de novo RLS during pregnancy. When using the standard diagnostic RLS criteria and frequency of symptoms more than 2-3 days per week, the prevalence of RLS was 12.3%. With the CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire and the same threshold for frequency of symptoms the prevalence was 6.5%.
   Conclusion: Women with RLS onset before pregnancy with moderate or severe symptoms had an increased risk of both antenatal and postnatal depression. The self-reported prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is lower when a questionnaire dealing with "mimics" is used.

AB Sleep disturbances, including sleep insufficiency and sleep fragmentation, have been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism and increased diabetes risk. Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism. Experimental, prospective, and interventional studies are discussed.

AB This study examined the association between measures of objective sleep (OS) and subjective sleep (SS) to postpartum mood in healthy women from the third trimester of pregnancy to 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Twenty-nine pregnant women completed self-report measures of mood and SS, and wore actigraphs for 7 continuous days during the third trimester (Time 1), within 15 days (Time 2), and 10 to 12 weeks postpartum (Time 3). The subjective perception of marked daytime dysfunction was associated with low mood during Time 1 and Time 3. Poor nighttime SS was related to low mood only at Time 2, whereas poor nighttime OS influenced stress during the same assessment time. These data indicate a stronger association between postpartum mood and the subjective perception of sleep than with OS quality and duration in healthy, non-depressed women, and highlight the awareness of poor daytime functioning as a significant contributor to new mothers' emotional wellbeing.

AB Circadian variation in biological rhythms has been identified as affecting both labour pain and the pharmacological properties of analgesics. In the context of pain, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of adult attachment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether labour pain, analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect are significantly affected by the time of day and to analyse whether this circadian variation is influenced by women's attachment style. This prospective observational study included a sample of 81 pregnant women receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale -Revised. The perceived intensity of labour pain in the early stage of labour (3 cm of cervical dilatation and before the administration of PCEA) was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain was also indirectly assessed by measuring the consumption of anaesthetics. The latency period and the duration of effect were recorded for a chronopharmacology characterisation. Pain, as assessed with the VAS, was significantly higher in the night-time group than in the daytime group. An insecure attachment style was significantly associated with greater labour pain at 3 cm of cervical dilatation (p < 0.001) and before the beginning of analgesia (p < 0.001) as well as with higher analgesic consumption and lower pharmacological efficacy (p < 0.05). The time of day was significantly associated with the pharmacological effect: the latency period was longer at night, and the duration of the pharmacological effect was longer during the daytime. The interaction between time of day and attachment style was not significant for any of the study variables. Our results provide evidence of the importance of circadian variation in studying labour pain and the pharmacological effect of labour analgesia involving epidural blockage with a PCEA regimen. Moreover, although there was no evidence that attachment style influenced the circadian variation, these data emphasise that insecure attachment patterns are a risk factor for greater labour pain and analgesic consumption, which should be considered in pain management approaches.

AB Study Objective: To describe sleep duration and quality in the first month postpartum and compare the sleep of women who exclusively breastfed at night to those who used formula.
   Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in a predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 first-time mothers. Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy, diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior.
   Results: Mothers who used at least some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. Total nighttime sleep was 386 +/- 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding group and 356 +/- 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum.
   Conclusion: Women who breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and fragmentation.

AB The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of US women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

AB Objective: The objective of this review was to summarize evidence for the effectiveness of music therapy (MT) and to assess the quality of systematic reviews (SRs) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
   Study design: An SR of SRs based on RCTs.
   Methods: Studies were eligible if they were RCTs. Studies included were those with at least one treatment group in which MT was applied. We searched the following databases from 1995 to October 1, 2012: MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health-Literature), Web of Science, Global Health Library, and Ichushi-Web. We also searched all Cochrane Database and Campbell Systematic Reviews up to October 1, 2012. Based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, we identified a disease targeted for each article.
   Results: Twenty-one studies met all inclusion criteria. This study included 16 Cochrane reviews. As a whole, the quality of the articles was very good. Eight studies were about "Mental and behavioural disorders (F00-99)"; there were two studies on " Diseases of the nervous system (G00-99)" and " Diseases of the respiratory system (J00-99)"; and there was one study each for " Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-90)", " Diseases of the circulatory system (I00-99)", and " Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O60)". MT treatment improved the following: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality.
   Conclusion: This comprehensive summary of SRs demonstrated that MT treatment improved the following: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. MT may have the potential for improving other diseases, but there is not enough evidence at-present. Most importantly, no specific adverse effect or harmful phenomenon occurred in any of the studies, and MT was well tolerated by almost all patients.

AB Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder. The classical presentation includes the four symptoms excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. As a model disease with all the transitions from awake to sleeping conditions, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM), it plays an important role in neurology and sleep medicine. Patients with narcolepsy possess a reduced number of hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus and accordingly the hypocretin level in the cerebrospinal fluid is low. The neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) has functions, such as the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, the autonomous nerve system, motor system and metabolic processes. The delay in diagnosing narcolepsy is difficult to comprehend in modern medicine. The frequent association with other sleep-wake disorders may be responsible for the delay. Genomewide association studies have subsequently been able to prove that autoimmune mechanisms are responsible for the manifestation of narcolepsy with the HLA association being the most important for susceptibility and protection. Imaging studies have revealed neurodegenerative changes, making a multifactorial etiopathogenesis probable. The frequent occurrence of metabolic disorders has not yet been clarified. Early diagnosis of narcolepsy has the possibility to offer affected persons an adequate medication to lead an almost normal life and the future possibility to cure narcolepsy through immunomodulation therapy.

AB The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and its associated factors among pregnant women in Japan. Of the 940 randomly selected survey locations identified by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 344 obstetric institutions participated in the survey. The study was conducted on women with confirmed pregnancies who had had a second or subsequent consultation at one of these institutions. The survey items included age, highest educational achievement, trimester of pregnancy, number of pregnancies, employment status, smoking, alcohol consumption, restless sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, sleep duration, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and restless leg syndrome. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess the level of excessive daytime sleepiness. We calculated the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and then examined its associated factors using (2) test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness among pregnant women was 6.2%. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly higher among younger women and those in an earlier trimester of pregnancy. The odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was also significantly higher for women in their first pregnancy, full-time workers, and current alcohol consumers. Women indicating the presence of sleep-related issues, including restless sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome, reported significantly higher levels of excessive daytime sleepiness.

AB ObjectiveNo clinical characteristic picture and impact of symptoms on quality of life (QOL) of interstitial cystitis (IC) patients in Taiwan had been reported. This paper is intended to provide preliminary descriptive results of IC research in Taiwan.
   MethodsA total of 319 patients, based on National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, were enrolled in the study from February 2004 through March 2006. Evaluation data included baseline demographic information, patient and family medical history, dietary effects, pregnancy data, sexual relationships with symptoms, and impact of symptoms on quality of life. The main responsibility of the hospitals discussed was patient care and data collection. Taichung Hospital presents the results.
   ResultsThe Interstitial Cystitis Database (ICDB) patients were predominantly female, that is, 86% of the total, with an average enrollment age of 46. The analysis of various symptoms indicates the following distribution: (i) 94% frequency; (ii) 80% pain; (iii) 53% nocturia; (iv) 43% urgency; and (v) 10% associated incontinence. Approximately 83% reported pain over the bladder while in full stage, and 74% reported pain relief after voiding. The predominant characteristic of pain was full sensation (54%) with the predominant position on low abdominal area (52%). Moreover, 80% reported sleeping disturbance due to disease, and 66% reported difficulty in performing daily work.
   ConclusionsInterstitial cystitis patients in Taiwan have lower economic status but lower impact on QOL than Western patients. However, the sexual-related pain and sleeping disorder were higher than previously thought and deserve our attention. Accordingly, this research provides a foundation for further investigations of baseline associations and longitudinal trends.

AB In this multi-centre, prospective, non-interventional study, the effectiveness and tolerance of ferric carboxymaltose (ferinject r; FCM) was tested through use in standard gynaecological practice. In total, data from 273 patients was evaluated. 193 of these patients displayed iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), and 68 had iron deficiency without anaemia (ID). The reasons for the ID/IDA were hypermenorrhoea (HyM) (n = 170), postpartum condition (PP) (n = 53) or another indication (n = 53). The average age of the patients was 40 years old, with 8% of them being vegetarians. Half of the patients had already been treated for anaemia, primarily with oral iron products (94%). The primary, serious accompanying symptoms of anaemia were fatigue (72%), lack of concentration (42%), pale mucous membranes (42%), headache (26%) and sleep disorders (21%). Only one patient did not show serious symptoms at the start of the study. The most frequent indications for parenteral therapy were the need for rapid iron substitution to reduce symptoms (> 70%), followed by the lower effectiveness or intolerance of oral products (42% each) as well as patients not completing the course of treatment with oral products (12%). Patient information was collected at both the beginning and the end of the observation period, which lasted 15 weeks on average. FCM was most frequently administered via infusion (92%; average infusion duration 21 minutes). Seven percent of patients received bolus injections. The average total iron dosage per patient was 788.7mg (median 550mg; range: 50-3000 mg); the median individual dosage was 500 mg (range: 50-1000 mg). The total dosage was, in most cases, administered through a single application (range: 1-10). Symptoms, blood values (Hb), iron stores (serum-ferritin [S-ferritin]) and transport iron (transferrin saturation [TSAT]) normalised to a large extent. In all subgroups, 92% of women displayed a marked improvement in all of their symptoms. The average increase in Hb-value in the group as a whole was statistically significant, increasing from 10.5 to 13.0 g/dl. In the group with anaemia, the value increased from 9.9 to 13.3 g/dl, with 80% of women reaching normal Hb-values. The average S-ferritin value increased by a statistically significant > 70 g/L from 17.2 to 88.8 g/l and the value for the TSAT increased from 16.3% to 22.8%. Seven patients reported experiencing side effects. None of the resultswere severe. Overall, as part of this non-interventional study for everyday routine in a gynaecological practice, a rapid improvement in symptoms accompanied by the rectification of iron deficiency and anaemia was shown with low occurrences of mild undesirable events, and therefore the data obtained from controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness and tolerance of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose could be confirmed.

Women are particularly at risk for sleep disorders, and complaints of sleep disturbance are more prevalent among women than men across the life span. During the perinatal period, many common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs may be exacerbated, or in the case of insomnia or narcolepsy, treatment options may change. In addition, the role of circadian rhythms in fertility and perinatal health is just beginning to be appreciated. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the unique aspects of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders during the perinatal period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
