N2  - Background: The prevalence of pregnancy-associated insomnia is high. Although insomnia may flow from normal physiologic features of pregnancy, it may also be an early warning sign of a relapse, or a trigger for a relapse, of a psychiatric illness. Those at risk for psychiatric illnesses may require medications as well as behavioral and psychotherapeutic interventions, to prevent relapse in the perinatal period. Unfortunately, few reviews of psychotropics used to treat pregnancy-related sleep disorders exist. Objective: We discuss issues related to sleep and sleep disorders in pregnancy in the context of co-morbid psychiatric illness, and review the literature on the commonly-used medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, trazodone, and melatonin) for insomnia during pregnancy.

N2  - This study sought to investigate the effects of subjectively-determined poor prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depression (PND), after adjusting for prenatal psychological distress and perceived stress. From March 2016 to December 2017, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study using a convenience sample of 228 perinatal women. The participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the third trimester (Time 1 or T1), and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 1 months postpartum (Time 2 or T2). Logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depression. The results showed that prenatal psychological distress (OR = 2.551, 95% CI = 1.221 ~ 5.329, P = 0.013) and perceived stress (OR = 2.881, 95% CI = 1.398 ~ 5.938, P= 0.007) were the strongest predictors of PND. Independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality (OR = 2.391, 95% CI = 1.072 ~ 5.556, P = 0.044) during pregnancy also predicted postnatal depressive symptoms. Treatment of psychological distress and perceived stress appears important for reducing the incidence of PND. Nonetheless, future studies might explore treatments to improve prenatal sleep quality.

N2  - Depressive symptoms, stress, fatigue, and lack of sleep are often experienced by women in the perinatal period and are potential contributors to adverse maternal and child health outcomes. To explore the evolution of symptoms and identify groups of women of similar severity and patterns, we utilized clustering of multidimensional symptom trajectories. In an observational study data were collected from pregnant women in the 3rd trimester (36 weeks prenatal) and in the postnatal period at weeks 1 and 2 as well as at 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 6‐months postpartum. Depressive symptoms and maternal stress were measured using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), respectively. Self‐reported duration of sleep and levels of fatigue also were collected. A model‐based clustering approach was used to classify women by their symptom severity. The sample included 151 pregnant women with a 6‐month follow‐up. Two clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 43) comprised women with fewer depressive symptoms, less perceived stress, lower likelihood of being fatigued, increased sleep duration and a negative trend in EPDS (β = −0.05, CI [−0.09, −0.001]), and PSS (β = −0.09, CI [−0.17, −0.01]). Cluster 2 (n = 108) comprised women with higher EPDS and PSS scores, increased likelihood of fatigue and lower sleep duration with a positive trend in sleep hours (β = −0.02, CI [0.01, 0.03]). Pro‐inflammatory markers interleukin‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐α were associated with longer sleep duration and fewer depressive symptoms, respectively. Using this methodology in maternal and child health research can potentially predict women's risk of developing severe symptoms and help clinicians provide timely interventions.

N2  - Background and Aims In‐utero exposure to opioids including buprenorphine (BUP) has been shown to affect fetal activity, specifically heart‐rate variability (FHRV) and fetal movement (FM). Our objective was to extract simultaneous recordings of fetal cardiac and brain‐related activity in BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non‐invasive biomagnetic technique. Design A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women. Signals were acquired with the non‐invasive 151‐channel SARA (SQUID‐Array for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal‐processing techniques were applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. Setting University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). Participants Eight BUP‐maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program between gestational ages (GA) of 29–37 weeks who were treated with 8–24 mg of BUP daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range were also included. Measurements Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR–FM coupling, FHRV, fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. Findings Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified successfully from 18 non‐opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and 5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35–37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (~9 s) was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5‐4 Hz bandwidth. Transitions in FBS from quiet to active sleep were > 50% of sessions. Conclusions This pilot study showed that a novel biomagnetic technique allows simultaneous quantification of cardiac and brain activities of a group of buprenorphine‐exposed and non‐exposed fetuses in the third trimester.

N2  - Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., ‘couvade syndrome’) on men’s body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

N2  - This study leverages psychiatric intake data from treatment-seeking perinatal women aiming to explore the understudied associations between childhood adversity, sleep quality, and severity of perinatal mental illness in this population. The sample is 578 perinatal women presenting for initial evaluation to a university-based perinatal psychiatry clinic. At intake, we collected demographics, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), sleep quality, and diagnosis and symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Clinician-rated diagnoses showed that 65% of women met criteria for major depression, 23% for generalized anxiety disorder and 4% for PTSD; almost 30% of women had childhood adversity and 98.2% reported poor perinatal sleep quality. Regression analyses revealed differential associations between ACEs and sleep quality and perinatal mood symptoms; ACEs were significantly associated with pregnancy and postpartum PTSD, whereas sleep quality was associated with perinatal depression and generalized anxiety. Screening for ACEs and sleep quality during perinatal intake has high clinical utility, as these two factors significantly contribute to symptom severity across peripartum.

N2  - Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Originally thought to be primarily responsible for disposing of cellular debris and responding to neural insults, emerging research now shows that microglia are highly dynamic cells involved in a variety of neurodevelopmental processes. The hypothalamus is a brain region critical for maintaining homeostatic processes such as energy balance, thirst, food intake, reproduction, and circadian rhythms. Given that microglia colonize the embryonic brain alongside key steps of hypothalamic development, here we tested whether microglia are required for the proper establishment of this brain region. The Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (Csf1r) is expressed by microglia, macrophages and osteoclasts, and is required for their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therefore, to eliminate microglia from the fetal brain, we treated pregnant dams with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. We showed that approximately 99% of microglia were eliminated by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) after pregnant dams were placed on a PLX5622 diet starting at E3.5. Following microglia depletion, we observed elevated numbers of apoptotic cells accumulating throughout the developing hypothalamus. Once the PLX5622 diet was removed, microglia repopulated the postnatal brain within 7 days and did not appear to repopulate from Nestin+ precursors. Embryonic microglia depletion also resulted in a decreased litter size, as well as an increase in the number of pups that died within the first two postnatal days of life. In pups that survived, the elimination of microglia in the fetal brain resulted in a decrease in the number of Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and a concomitant accelerated weight gain starting at postnatal day 5 (P5), suggesting that microglia could be important for the development of cell types key to hypothalamic satiety centers. Moreover, surviving PLX5622 exposed animals displayed craniofacial and dental abnormalities, perhaps due to non-CNS effects of PLX5622 on macrophages and/or osteoclasts. Finally, depletion of microglia during embryogenesis had long-term sex-specific effects on behaviour, including the development of hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour in juvenile and adult female mice, respectively. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for microglia during the development of the embryonic hypothalamus, and perhaps the CNS more broadly.

N2  - Decline in cognitive functioning in the workplace is a major concern for health care systems. Understanding factors associated with nighttime functioning is imperative for instituting organizational risk management policies and developing personalized countermeasures. The present study aims to identify individual factors associated with cognitive functioning during the night shift of hospital nurses working on irregular rotating-shift schedules. Ninety-two female nurses were recruited from 17 wards in two general hospitals, using convenience sampling by clusters. Inclusion criteria were working at least 28 h a week (75% of full time) and one night shift per week. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, diagnosed sleep disorders or medical conditions that may affect sleep and/or function. Cognitive performance was measured during the middle (03:00 h) and at the end (07:00 h) of the night shift using the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and the Letter Cancellation Task (LCT) over two night shifts. Subjective sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at the same time points. All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for Shift-Workers (MCTQShift) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep duration 24 h before the night shift and time awake since last sleep opportunity were monitored by actigraphy. Univariate repeated measures ANOVA found main effects for clock time (p p p p p p p p < 0.01) for LCT omission errors. All factors remained significant in a mixed-model analysis for DSST. Cognitive performance among hospital nurses is low during the middle of the night shift and increases at the end of the shift; decreased functioning is associated with increased subjective sleepiness, older age and prolonged time awake. Identifying factors contributing to performance during the night shift may provide a basis for the development of risk management policies and preventative interventions.

N2  - Women who have experienced significant adversities during childhood and adulthood are at risk for excessive inflammation during pregnancy, but the mechanisms are unclear. Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress in 214 women assessed at mid-pregnancy (5–31 weeks gestation). Self-reported data on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation. These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.

N2  - AbstractBackgroundThe prevalence of sleep problems among pregnant women is over 50%, and daytime sleepiness is among the most common sleep problems. Previous studies have associated antenatal sleep problems with adverse maternal health and neonatal outcomes, but the consequences of antenatal sleep problems and particularly daytime sleepiness on child psychological development have not been assessed prospectively.MethodsIn this prospective cohort study including 111 mother-child dyads, we examined the associations of maternal daytime sleepiness during pregnancy, assessed at 17 and 28 weeks of gestation using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with child neuropsychiatric problems and neuropsychological development, assessed with mother-rated questionnaires and individually administered neuropsychological tests, at child age 2.6–5.7 years (mean = 4.3 years).ResultsIndependently of sociodemographic and perinatal covariates and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during and/or after pregnancy, maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness was associated with increased total [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) = 0.25 standard deviation (s.d.) units; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01–0.48] and internalizing (B = 0.25 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.01–0.49) psychiatric problems and ADHD symptoms (B = 0.27 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.04–0.50) in children, and with poorer executive function, particularly in the areas of attention, working memory and inhibitory control (B = −0.39 s.d.s: 95% CI −0.69 to −0.10).ConclusionsMaternal antenatal daytime sleepiness carries adverse consequences for offspring psychological development. The assessment of sleep problems may be an important addition to standard antenatal care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A preference for eveningness (being a “night owl”) and preterm birth (n = 346). We also compared very low birth weight (VLBW, n = 138/221/329) ESTER participants. The MEQ consists of 19 questions, which estimates the respondent to be of a “morning”, “evening,” or “intermediate” chronotype, based on the Morningness–Eveningness Score (MES). We analyzed the data from the actigraphs and the MES with three linear regression models, and analyzed distribution of the chronotype class with Pearson χ2. There were no consistent differences across the study groups in sleep midpoint. As compared with those born at term, the mean differences in minutes:seconds and 95% confidence intervals for the sleep midpoint were: early preterm weekdays 11:47 (−8:34 to 32:08), early preterm weekend 4:14 (−19:45 to 28:13), late preterm weekdays −10:28 (−26:16 to 5:21), and late preterm weekend −1:29 (−20:36 to 17:37). There was no difference in sleep timing between VLBW-participants and controls either. The distribution of chronotype in the MEQ among all participants was 12.4% morningness, 65.4% intermediate, and 22.2% eveningness. The distribution of the subjective chronotype class did not differ between the three gestational age groups (p = 0.98). The linear regression models did not show any influence of gestational age group or VLBW status on the MES (all p > 0.5).We found no consistent differences between adults born early or late preterm and those born at term in circadian preference. The earlier circadian preference previously observed in those born smallest is unlikely to extend across the whole range of preterm birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Prokineticins are involved in many physiological processes including circadian rhythms, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer. Recently, they have been found to play a role in regulating food intake. Historically, proteins that increase feeding behavior in mammals decrease reproductive behavior to prevent pregnancy and lactation when food is scarce. In the current study, prokineticin-2 (PK2) had pronounced effects on reproductive and ingestive behaviors when given to female Syrian hamsters. Administration of PK2 prevented ingestive behaviors induced by food restriction, such as the amount of time spent with food and eating. Hamsters given PK2 preferred to engage in reproductive behaviors, including spending time with a male and lordosis. Furthermore, analysis of blood plasma revealed that changes to behavior persisted despite similar levels of des-acyl ghrelin (DAG) and reduced glucose concentrations in the blood. Additionally, administering 10 mg/kg of acyl ghrelin (AG) to a different cohort of animals significantly decreased the amount of time females spent with a potential mating partner, increased the amount of time females spent with food, decreased the duration of lordosis, and increased the duration of eating. Results from the current study support the need for further research investigating the reproductive and ingestive roles of PK2 and ghrelin.

N2  - Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24) that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) ≥ 5 were included, with a total of 11,002 participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality. Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M = 5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of PSQI scores ≥5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective/Background: Poor sleep during pregnancy is common and is associated with pregnancy complications. Physical activity (PA) is associated with better sleep in nonpregnant populations. However, studies among pregnant women are sparse, conflicting, and none have been conducted among Hispanic women, who face a disproportionate burden of poor sleep and pregnancy complications. Therefore, our objective was to examine the relationship between intensity- and domain-specific PA, respectively, on sleep quality and duration among Hispanic pregnant women. Participants: We evaluated these associations among participants (n = 251) in Estudio PARTO, an ongoing randomized controlled trial aimed at reducing type 2 diabetes among women at high risk. Methods: We assessed the cross-sectional relationship between PA (via Pregnancy PA Questionnaire) and sleep quality and duration (via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) using baseline data (26.5 ± 6.9 weeks gestation). Results: In multivariable logistic models, household and caregiving activities were associated with higher odds of very poor sleep quality (OR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.04 to 7.04) and with short (vs. medium) sleep duration (OR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.07 to 7.56). In contrast, occupational PA was associated with lower odds of very poor sleep quality (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.89). Light-intensity PA was associated with lower odds of long (vs. medium) sleep duration (OR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.52). There were no statistically significant relationships between PA in any other domain and sleep. Conclusions: Prospective studies will be critical in evaluating the potential adverse impact of household and caregiving activities on poor sleep quality.

N2  - This was a retrospective case–control study in 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy and 75 women in the control group. Patients completed the questionnaire by Maurovich‐Horvat et al. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496–512). We personally interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59 pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control group (P P P P P P P < 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is the first case–control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Caesarean sections, complications during delivery and normal perinatal period for infants were similar in both groups. Breastfeeding was longer in patients.

N2  - Pregnant women have more sleep problems compared to non-pregnant women. Our objective was to investigate the differences in sleep patterns by age among Japanese women enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study during preconception and pregnancy. Questionnaires on sleep status were administered to pregnant women twice in the first, second and/or third trimesters. Wake-up time, bedtime, sleep duration and quality of sleep were analyzed in 103,099 respondents. Women younger than 20 years of age awoke and slept the latest in comparison to all other age groups during preconception and pregnancy. Sleep time of women younger than 20 years of age was the longest in comparison to other age groups. The wake-up time and bedtime of teenage mothers were delayed from preconception to second or third trimester, but they did not display any statistically significant changes in other age groups. Moreover, the younger the pregnant women were the more sleep trouble they had despite reportedly being tired, and felt more sleep-deprived despite having had enough sleep time in both second and third trimesters. The sleep state of pregnant women differed by age, with younger women experiencing more sleep trouble and feeling less rested compared to other groups. In future studies, the influences of sleep during pregnancy on the health and development of the children of these pregnant women will be clarified.

N2  - The aim of this study was to analyze relationships among general health, coping style, and perceived stress in healthy primigravida pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city, Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH model fit well; general health (β = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep disorders (β = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, and only planning–preparation was related to perceived stress through general health (β = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping styles. Further studies on the effect of coping style interventions on stress are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Compared to women who have given birth before (i.e., multiparas), those giving birth for the first time (i.e., primiparas) show higher cortisol levels. Psychological factors may play a role; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation is a well-described stress response. Primiparity also predicts greater risk for postpartum depression, which may be related to greater correspondence between cortisol and mood following prenatal cortisol elevations. The current study examined associations among parity, perinatal cortisol adaptation, pregnancy-specific distress, and postpartum mood. Methods: This longitudinal study assayed serum cortisol levels among 137 women at early, mid-, and late pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy-specific distress and depressive symptoms were assessed. Maternal age, race, body mass index, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and sampling time of day were statistically controlled. Results: Primiparous women showed higher cortisol levels than multiparous women during mid- (χ² = 11.8, p p p ab = 1.0, 95%CI [0.05, 2.9]). Prenatal cortisol (per AUC) did not predict postpartum depressive symptoms (b* = 0.03, p = 0.81), with no difference by parity (b* = 0.03, p = 0.91). At postpartum, a significant interaction between parity and cortisol (b* = 0.40, p = 0.03) revealed no significant association between cortisol and mood among multiparas (b* = −0.11, p = 0.28) but a trend toward a positive association among primiparas (b* = 0.24, p = 0.06). Discussion: Cortisol levels and pregnancy-specific distress are higher in primiparas versus multiparas, with pregnancy-specific distress partially mediating the association between parity and cortisol levels. Cortisol levels and mood display correspondence at postpartum in primiparous but not multiparous women. While observational studies must be interpreted with caution due to potential unmeasured confounders, these findings suggest that future studies examining mechanisms underlying perinatal and postpartum hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal perturbations and designing interventions aimed at preventing related complications should carefully consider potential differences by parity.

N2  - Pregnancy and lactation are metabolically challenging states, where the mother must supply all the energy requirements for the developing fetus and growing pups respectively. The aim of the current study was to characterize many aspects of energy homeostasis before and during pregnancy in the mouse, and to examine the role of voluntary activity on changes in energy expenditure during pregnancy. In a secondary aim, we evaluate measures of energy homeostasis during pregnancy in mice that successfully reared their litter or in mice that went on to abandon their litter, to determine if an impairment in pregnancy-induced adaptation of energy homeostasis might underlie the abandonment of pups soon after birth. During pregnancy, food intake was increased, characterized by increased meal size and duration but not number of meals per day. The duration of time spent inactive, predicted to indicate sleep behaviour, was increased both early and late in pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Increased x + y beam breaks, as a measure of activity increased during pregnancy and this reflected an increase in ambulatory behaviour in mid pregnancy and an increase in non-ambulatory movement in late pregnancy. Energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry, increased across pregnancy, likely due to the growth and development of fetal tissue. There was also a dramatic reduction in voluntary wheel running as soon as the mice became pregnant. Compared with successful pregnancies and lactations, pregnancies where pups were abandoned soon after birth were associated with reduced body weight gain and an increase in running wheel activity at the end of pregnancy, but no difference in food intake or energy expenditure. Overall, during pregnancy there are multiple adaptations to change energy homeostasis, resulting in partitioning of provisions of energy to the developing fetus and storing energy for future metabolic demands.

N2  - Background Late stillbirth, which occurs ≥28 weeks’ gestation, affects 1.3‐8.8 per 1000 births in high‐income countries. Of concern, most occur in women without established risk factors. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors that relate to maternal behaviors remains a priority in stillbirth prevention research. This study aimed to investigate, in an international cohort, whether maternal sleep practices are related to late stillbirth. Methods An Internet‐based case‐control study of women who had a stillbirth ≥28 weeks’ gestation within 30 days before completing the survey (n = 153) and women with an ongoing third‐trimester pregnancy or who had delivered a live born child within 30 days (n = 480). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR and aOR, respectively) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for stillbirth. Results Sleeping >9 hours per night in the previous month was associated with stillbirth (aOR 1.75 [95% CI 1.10‐2.79]), as was waking on the right side (2.27 [1.31‐3.92]). Nonrestless sleep in the last month was also found to be associated with stillbirth (1.73 [1.03‐2.99]), with good sleep quality in the last month approaching significance (1.64 [0.98‐2.75]). On the last night of pregnancy, not waking more than one time was associated with stillbirth (2.03 [1.24‐3.34]). No relationship was found with going to sleep position during pregnancy, although very few women reported settling in the supine position (2.4%). Conclusions Long periods of undisturbed sleep are associated with late stillbirth. Physiological studies of how the neuroendocrine and autonomic system pathways are regulated during sleep in the context of late pregnancy are warranted.

N2  - Animal studies strongly suggest that timed feeding can have beneficial physiological effects, including protection against the obesogenic and metabolic consequences of a high-fat diet. However, the relationship between variables related to the timing of eating and diet quality in pregnancy women, which is considered as a period of nutritional vulnerability, is still poorly described in the literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 100 pregnant women in the first gestational trimester (≤12 weeks of gestation). The information regarding food intake was obtained by three 24-Hour Dietary Recall (24HR). Time-related eating patterns, i.e., the interval between the first and the last meal (eating duration), nightly fasting, time of the first and last meals, and number of meals eating on a day were determined. Chronotype was derived using the mid-sleep time on free days on weekends, with a further correction for calculated sleep debt. Diet quality was evaluated using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R), validated for the Brazilian population. Linear regression modeling analyses adjusted for confounders were used to investigate the association between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality. The BHEI-R total score was negatively associated with time of the first meal (β = −0.355; p = 0.002; r2 adjusted = 0.141), and positively associated with eating duration (β = 0.262; p = 0.024; r2 adjusted = 0.086) and number of meals (β = 0.273; p = 0.019; r2 adjusted = 0.091). In addition, the score of total fruit component was negatively associated with chronotype (β = −0.236; p = 0.033; r2 adjusted = 0.078), time of the first meal (β = −0.393; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.171), and positively associated with eating duration (β = 0.259; p = 0.022; r2 adjusted = 0.087) and number of meals (β = 0.376; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.159). The score for whole fruit component was negatively associated with time of the first meal (β = −0.388; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.152), and positively associated with number of meals (β = 0.403; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.164). A longer eating duration, earlier time of the first meal, higher number of meals and morningness tendency are associated with a better diet quality in the first gestational trimester – higher scores of the total BHEI-R and/or fruit components. We suggest that nutritional guidelines should consider time-related eating patterns and chronotype to ensure good diet quality of pregnant women since the beginning of gestation, contributing on prevention of metabolic-nutritional complications.

N2  - Aims: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time. Methods: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age. Results: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later. Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome has been associated with serum iron deficiency in clinical studies. However, studies investigating this relationship have had inconsistent results and there are no studies in young adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum measures of iron stores and restless legs syndrome in young adults in the community. Participants in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study answered questions on restless legs syndrome (n = 1,100, 54% female) at age 22 years, and provided serum measures of iron stores (ferritin and transferrin saturation) at ages 17 and 22 years. Restless legs syndrome was diagnosed when four International RLS Study Group criteria were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening during evening/night) and these symptoms occurred ≥5 times per month. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between serum iron stores and restless legs syndrome, adjusting for potential confounders. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome at age 22 years was 3.0% (n = 33, 70% female). Among those who provided restless legs syndrome and iron data at age 22 years (n = 865), the median (interquartile range) ferritin was not different between the restless legs syndrome (55 [29.5–103.5] µg L−1) and the non‐restless legs syndrome group (65.0 [35.0–103.3] µg L−1, p = 0.2), nor were there differences in iron deficiency prevalence (p = 0.36). There was no association between restless legs syndrome (22 years) and iron stores (17, 22 years) before or after adjustment for potential confounders. There was no association between restless legs syndrome at 22 years and iron stores at 17 or 22 years in this cohort. Serum iron stores may not be a useful indicator of restless legs syndrome risk in young adults in the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine whether seasonal light exposure, categorized by type of day length, is associated with or predictive of depressive symptoms in late pregnancy and the first 3 months postpartum. Women (n = 279) expecting their first child were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth education classes. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Day lengths were categorized into short, lengthening, long and shortening. Data analysis included linear mixed models and multiple linear regression. When days were shortening (August to first 4 days of November) in late third trimester, depressive symptom scores were highest (35%) and continued to be higher at each postpartum assessment compared to other day length categories. Implications for clinical practice include increased vigilance for depressive symptoms, particularly if late pregnancy and birth occurs during the 3 months around the Autumn equinox when day length is shortening. Strategies that increase light exposure in late pregnancy and postpartum should also be considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Unwanted, intrusive thoughts of infant-related harm are a normal, albeit distressing experience for most new mothers. The occurrence of these thoughts can represent a risk factor for the development of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). As the early postpartum period represents a time of increased risk for OCD development, the transition to parenthood provides a unique opportunity to better understand OCD development. Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess components of cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD in relation to new mothers’ thoughts of infant-related harm. Method: English-speaking pregnant women (n = 100) participated. Questionnaires were completed at approximately 36 weeks of gestation, and at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. An interview to assess postpartum harm thoughts was administered at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires assessed OC symptoms, OC-related beliefs, fatigue, sleep difficulties and negative mood. Results: Prenatal OC-related beliefs predicted postpartum OC symptoms, as well as harm thought characteristics and behavioural responses to harm thoughts. The severity of behavioural responses to early postpartum harm thoughts did not predict later postpartum OC symptoms, but did predict frequency and time occupation of accidental harm thoughts, and interference in parenting by intentional harm thoughts. Strong relationships between OC symptoms and harm thought characteristics, and concurrent sleep difficulties, negative mood and fatigue were also found. Conclusions: Findings provide support for cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD and emphasize the importance of maternal sleep, fatigue and negative mood in the relationship between OC-related beliefs and maternal cognitive and behavioural responses to postpartum harm thoughts.

N2  - Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development.Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers’ capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing.Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria.Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers’ aversive response to infant crying.Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

N2  - Sleep problems in young children are among the most common concerns reported to paediatricians. Sleep is thought to have important regulatory functions, and sleep difficulties in early childhood are linked to several psychosocial and physiological problems. Moreover, several prenatal factors have been found to influence infants’ sleep. Among them, most of the studies have been focused on maternal prenatal depression and/or anxiety as potential risk factors for sleep problems in childhood, whereas other relevant psychological factors during pregnancy have not received as much attention. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of several psychiatric maternal risk factors during pregnancy (i.e. symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, alcohol use, seasonality, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and/or stressful life events) on the onset of some sleep problems related to sleep quality and sleep practices in 3‐month‐old infants. We examined 1,221 cases from a population‐based birth cohort, with subjective measures during pregnancy in mothers, and at 3 months after birth in the infants. The findings showed that all the maternal risk factors during pregnancy, except for symptoms of alcoholism and sleepiness, were related to sleep difficulties in infants. Interestingly, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptomatology in mothers during pregnancy was the only variable that predicted more than two sleeping difficulties (i.e. long sleep‐onset latency, co‐sleeping with parents and irregular sleeping routines) at 3 months old. Our results highlight the relevance of maternal risk factors during pregnancy, and not only prenatal depression and/or anxiety, as variables to be considered when examining sleep difficulties in infants.

N2  - Introduction: Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of certified nurse‐midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse‐midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment. Methods: Participants in this cross‐sectional survey study were certified nurse‐midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse‐midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333). Results: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two‐thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients. Discussion: Certified nurse‐midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence‐based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.

N2  - Whether or not childhood sleep problems and anxiety occur simultaneously, or one precedes the other, and any effect of autistic traits on this relationship remains unclear. We investigated longitudinal associations between sleep and anxiety at 2 years and sleep and anxiety at 8 years controlling for demographic variables. We also examined the additional influence of autistic traits at 2 years on sleep problems and anxiety at 8 years. Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, where 2900 pregnant women were recruited between 1989 and 1991 and their children assessed every 2–3 years thereafter. Demographic information was provided at 16–18 weeks gestation. Children’s sleep and anxiety at 2 and 8 years and autistic traits at 2 years were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical multiple regression models tested the prediction of both anxiety and sleep problems at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and 8 years, anxiety at 2 years, and autistic traits at 2 years were significantly associated with anxiety at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and anxiety at 8 years were significantly related to sleep problems at 8 years. Each of these models explained about 20% of variance. Childhood sleep problems, anxiety and autistic traits are interrelated and can occur concurrently in young children, but the best predictor of poor sleep in middle childhood is concurrent anxiety and vice versa. Anxiety and sleep problems may be an early indicator of autism in young children and early autistic traits may also contribute to anxiety problems later in childhood.

N2  - Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15–20% of obese pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance and fatigue are frequent complaints during pregnancy and postpartum. We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum.Methods: In this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25–28 weeks gestation were recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January 2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath, Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used.Results: Compared with the placebo group, the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups.Conclusion: Lavender cream with or without footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum.

N2  - Objective: This paper will describe the development of a programme of SMS messages including parenting information and support to be sent to the mobile phones of mothers with severe mental illness (SMI) and their partners from early pregnancy to 24 weeks post birth. Method: Text messages (total 176) designed and tested for fathers (SMS4Dads) addressing father-infant attachment, co-parenting and self-care (including Mood Tracker texts asking fathers to rate their mood) were adapted by an expert advisory group of clinicians with experience across perinatal mental health services. Messages were rated on importance, clarity, acceptability (separately for mothers and fathers) and being consistent with current evidence. Additional messages were developed specifically for this population and all messages were tested for literacy level. The SMS4dads ‘Mood Tracker’ was redesigned to address common stress-inducing parenting issues such as infant crying, lack of sleep, and self-doubt about capacity to parent with an escalation process in cases of significant distress. Results: Separate protocol tested text-message banks for mothers (141 messages), and fathers (141 messages) were developed. Fourteen Mood Tracker topics were developed with two levels of distress escalation linked to local mental health services. Discussion: The need for accurate descriptions of health interventions processes is widely recognised, particularly in the case of digital mental health. This study provides a detailed description of the adaptive design by clinicians and researchers of brief text messages suitable for mothers with severe mental illness and their partners.

N2  - Background: The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Methods: This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors. Results: : Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (β = 0.10 and β = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (β = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (β = 0.12, all p < .01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks. Limitations: Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health. Conclusions: Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems and long-term child development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied in pregnancy and postpartum. Scores on standardized measures of sleep (PSQI) at 6 months postpartum, and symptoms of anxiety and depression (OASIS, the PHQ9, and EPDS) were assessed by structured interviews in 116 women in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who had significantly higher OASIS (anxiety) scores (β = .530, p p p < .001) also had elevated total PSQI scores after adjustment for covariates, including prenatal depression and anxiety scores. Though inferences about causality are not feasible, these results support emerging research showing sleep quality is a risk factor for negative maternal affect in the postpartum period. Assessment of maternal sleep hygiene is worth consideration as a component of identifying women at risk for postpartum depression and anxiety.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal, obstetric and post-partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum, and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9 months. Methods: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children. Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form 12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications, obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers and fathers Results: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than fathers (p < 0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health status. Discussion: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Circadian rhythmicity is fundamental to human physiology, and is present even during fetal life in normal pregnancies. The impact of maternal endocrine disease on the fetal circadian rhythm is not well understood. The present study aimed to determine the fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM), compare it with a low-risk reference population, and identify the effects of maternal glycemic control and morning cortisol concentrations. Long-term fetal electrocardiogram recordings were made in 40 women with PGDM at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Two recordings were made in 18 of the women (45.0%) and one recording was made in 22 (55.0%). The mean fetal heart rate (fHR) and the fHR variation (root mean square of squared differences) were extracted in 1-min epochs, and circadian rhythmicity was detected by cosinor analysis. The study cohort was divided based on HbA1c levels and morning cortisol concentrations. Statistically, significant circadian rhythms in the fHR and the fHR variation were found in 45 (100%) and 44 (95.7%) of the 45 acceptable PGDM recordings, respectively. The rhythms were similar to those of the reference population. However, there was no statistically significant population-mean rhythm in the fHR among PGDM pregnancies at 36 weeks, indicating an increased interindividual variation. The group with higher HbA1c levels (>6.0%) had no significant population-mean fHR rhythm at 28 or 36 weeks, and no significant fHR-variation rhythm at 36 weeks. Similarly, the group with a lower morning cortisol concentration (≤8.8 µg/dl) had no significant population-mean fHR-variation rhythm at 28 and 36 weeks. These findings indicate that individual fetal rhythmicity is present in pregnancies complicated by PGDM. However, suboptimal maternal glycemic control and a lower maternal morning cortisol concentration are associated with a less-well-synchronized circadian system of the fetus.

N2  - Background: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep. Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep. Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum. Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures. Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

N2  - Background: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Results: 11,759 citations were identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening. Limitations: Studies not explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors. Conclusions: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence of RLS in pregnancy is higher when compared with the general population however it remains unknown among indigenous black Africans. Available data indicate that RLS is uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. We embarked on this study to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in an antenatal clinic sample of Nigerian pregnant women compared with a primary care sample of non-pregnant women. Methods: A total of 310 pregnant women and non-pregnant women filled out a questionnaire which incorporated the 2014 minimal criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Demographic and clinical data, including sleep duration and samples for blood hemoglobin concentration and urinalysis were obtained. Results: The mean ages of the pregnant and non-pregnant women were 24.9 ± 5.6 years and 23.6 + 5.4 years, respectively (p = 0.003). There was no case of RLS found among pregnant women while five (1.6%) of the non-pregnant women fulfilled the criteria for RLS. Overall, the prevalence report of RLS symptoms was associated with lower mean habitual nocturnal sleep duration (p < 0.05) coffee (p = 0.013) and kola nut (0.023) consumption, report of leg cramps (p < 0.001) and proteinuria (p = 0.047), Report of leg cramps and proteinuria were independently associated with RLS. Conclusion: The prevalence of restless legs syndrome is low among women of child-bearing age in the Nigerian population and may be lower in pregnancy. Report of leg cramps and proteinuria are independently associated with RLS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In the general population, sleeping problems can precede an episode of depression. We hypothesized that sleeping problems during pregnancy, including insomnia symptoms, shortened sleep, and daytime tiredness, are related to maternal postnatal depressiveness. We conducted a prospective study evaluating sleep and depressive symptoms, both prenatally (around gestational week 32) and postnatally (around 3 months after delivery) in the longitudinal CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort in Finland. Prenatally, 1667 women returned the questionnaire, of which 1398 women participated also at the postnatal follow-up. Sleep was measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ) and depressive symptoms with a 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Altogether, 10.3% of the women had postnatal depressiveness (CES-D ≥ 10 points). After adjusting for main background characteristics and prenatal depressiveness (CES-D ≥ 10), poor general sleep quality (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.21–2.88), tiredness during the day (AOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41–3.38), short sleep ≤ 6 and ≤ 7 h, sleep latency > 20 min, and sleep loss ≥ 2 h were associated with postnatal depressiveness (all p < .050). Postnatally, after the adjustment for background characteristics, virtually all sleeping problems (i.e., difficulty falling asleep (AOR 7.93, 95% CI 4.76–13.20)), except frequent night awakenings per week or severe sleepiness during the day, were related to concurrent postnatal depressiveness. Thus, several prenatal and postnatal sleeping problems are associated with increased depressive symptoms 3 months postnatally. Screening of maternal prenatal sleeping problems, even without depressive symptoms during pregnancy or lifetime, would help to identify women at an increased risk for postnatal depressiveness.

N2  - Maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) has been suggested to be associated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in both humans and animal models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is still unclear. We have recently reported that MSD at different stages of pregnancy impairs the emotional and cognitive functions, and suppresses hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring rats. Here, we report that the MSD induced LTP impairment at the CA1 hippocampus of the offspring rats is associated with increased long-term depression (LTD) and reduced expression of postsynaptic GluA2-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Importantly, we found that inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis by a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA23Y (3 μmol/kg, i.p.) not only increased level of AMPARs and reduced LTD, but also restored LTP. Moreover, treatment with Tat-GluA23Y peptide markedly alleviated the MSD-induced impairments of spatial learning and memory; and decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Together, our findings suggest that the MSD-induced postsynaptic AMPAR endocytosis causally contributes to the impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, thereby disrupting the emotional and cognitive functions in the offspring.

N2  - Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is an emerging concern, as it can adversely affect the development of the offspring brain. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of deprivation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the third term of pregnancy on the sleep–wake profiles of neonates in the Wistar rat model. Sleep–wake patterns were assessed through electrophysiological measures and behavioural observations during postnatal days 1–21 on pups born to REM sleep‐deprived dams and control rats. Pups of REM sleep‐deprived dams had active sleep that was not only markedly higher in percentage during all the days studied, but also had reduced latency during later postnatal days 15–21. Quiet sleep and wake periods were lower. These factors, along with less frequent but longer sleep–wake cycles, indicated maturational delay in the sleep–wake neural networks. The disruption of time‐bound growth of sleep–wake neural networks was substantiated further by the decreased slope of survival plots in the sleep bouts. Examination of altered sleep–wake patterns during early development may provide crucial information concerning deranged neural development in the offspring. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that maternal sleep deprivation during pregnancy can delay and impair the development of sleep–wake profile in the offspring.

The original article has been corrected.] Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p < .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

N2  - Study Objectives: In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy. However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension. Methods: Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood–brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (olmesartan)- administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined. Results: C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time. Conclusions: This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia.

N2  - Chronotype, or morningness/eveningness, has been associated with adjustment in both children and adolescents. Specifically, eveningness has been linked to adjustment difficulties; however, the mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to test whether the associations between eveningness and adjustment difficulties could be explained by an unfavorable impact of eveningness on sleep. Links from chronotype to internalizing problems and problem behaviors via sleep quantity and sleep problems were tested in a sample from the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (N = 3485; 48.8% female), both when the participants were children (7 years at T1, 11 at T2) and when they were adolescents (15 years at T1, 18 at T2). The findings provided evidence that eveningness predicted greater sleep problems and lower sleep quantity; however, only sleep problems predicted internalizing problems and problem behaviors. Sleep quantity did not mediate the eveningness-adjustment link, and sleep problems did so only in children. The findings show that sleep problems appear to be more important in explaining the eveningness-adjustment link rather than altered sleep quantity, commonly associated with eveningness.

N2  - Obesity during pregnancy causes adverse maternal and fetal health outcomes and programs offspring for adult-onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Obesity also disrupts core body temperature (Tc) regulation in nonpregnant rodents; however, it is unknown whether obesity alters normal maternal Tc adaptations to pregnancy. Since Tc is influenced by the circadian system, and both obesity and pregnancy alter circadian biology, it was hypothesized that obesity disrupts the normal rhythmic patterns of Tc before and during gestation. Obesity was induced by cafeteria (CAF) feeding in female Wistar rats for 8 weeks prior to and during gestation, whereas control (CON) animals had free access to chow. Intraperitoneal temperature loggers measured daily Tc profiles throughout the study, while maternal body composition and leptin levels were assessed near term. Daily temperature profiles were examined for rhythmic features (mesor, amplitude and acrophase) by cosine regression analysis. CAF animals exhibited increased fat mass (93%) and associated hyperleptinemia (3.2-fold increase) compared to CON animals. CAF consumption reduced the average Tc (by up to 0.29°C) across the estrous cycle and most of pregnancy; however, Tc for CAF and CON animals converged toward the end of gestation. Obesity reduced the amplitude of Tc rhythms at estrus and proestrus and on day 8 of pregnancy, but increased the amplitude at day 20 of pregnancy. Photoperiod analysis revealed that obesity reduced Tc exclusively in the light period during pre-pregnancy but only during the dark period in late gestation. In conclusion, obesity alters rhythmic Tc profiles and reduces the magnitude of the Tc decline late in rat gestation, which may have implications for maternal health and fetal development.

N2  - Sleep‐disordered breathing is more common in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy; however, most studies have not adequately accounted for the potential confounding impact of obesity. This study evaluated the frequency of sleep‐disordered breathing in women with gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia compared with body mass index‐ and gestation‐matched normotensive pregnant women. Women diagnosed with gestational hypertension or pre‐eclampsia underwent polysomnography shortly after diagnosis. Normotensive controls body mass index‐matched within ± 4 kg m−2 underwent polysomnography within ±4 weeks of gestational age of their matched case. The mean body mass index and gestational age at polysomnography were successfully matched for 40 women with gestational hypertension/pre‐eclampsia and 40 controls. The frequency of sleep‐disordered breathing in the cases was 52.5% compared with 37.5% in the control group (P = 0.18), and the respiratory disturbance index overall did not differ (P = 0.20). However, more severe sleep‐disordered breathing was more than twice as common in women with gestational hypertension or pre‐eclampsia (35% versus 15%, P = 0.039). While more than half of women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy meet the clinical criteria for sleep‐disordered breathing, it is also very common in normotensive women of similar body mass index. This underscores the importance of adjusting for obesity when exploring the relationship between sleep‐disordered breathing and hypertension in pregnancy. More severe degrees of sleep‐disordered breathing are significantly associated with gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia, and sleep‐disordered breathing may plausibly play a role in the pathophysiology of pregnancy hypertension in these women. This suggests that more severe sleep‐disordered breathing is a potential therapeutic target for reducing the prevalence or severity of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

N2  - In the literature, increasing evidence is showing the importance of sleep difficulties in the development or maintenance of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms as well as the association between childbirth-related PTS symptoms and early maternal emotions and perceptions of their children. However, little is known regarding the effects of maternal sleep difficulties on parenting or about the mediational role of childbirth-related PTS symptoms in this association. The present study (pregnancy: T0; 1 month postpartum: T1; 3 months postpartum: T2) had two aims. The first one was to explore whether maternal sleep difficulties could contribute to the maintenance of PTS symptoms and whether PTS symptoms could contribute to the maintenance of maternal sleep difficulties. The second purpose was to explore, at 3 months (T2), the associations among childbirth-related PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and the three dimensions of parenting stress [parental distress (PD), parent–child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child] by examining the mediational role of both maternal sleep difficulties and childbirth-related PTS symptoms. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 95 women at different times (T0, T1, and T2). Mediational results confirmed the bidirectional effects between maternal sleep difficulties and PTS symptoms and their reciprocal role of maintenance of symptoms. Moreover, at 3 months postpartum (T2), sleep difficulties mediated the association between PTS symptoms and the three dimensions of maternal parenting stress, while PTS symptoms mediated the associations among maternal sleep difficulties, PD, and difficult child dimensions of parenting stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the maintenance factors of childbirth-related PTS symptoms and of the relationships among PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and parenting stress.

N2  - Sleeping in the lateral position during pregnancy can potentially reduce the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). However, this hypothesis has not been formally investigated in pregnant women. Unlike previous studies that have relied largely on self-reported measures of sleeping position, we investigated the relationship between SDB and sleeping position during late pregnancy using objective measurements. Thirty pregnant women at the 37th gestational week and 30 non-pregnant women (n-Pr) participated in the present study. The pregnant women were divided into 2 groups: those with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m² (with obesity, p-Ob), and those with BMI P P P = 0.04). Moreover, there was a significant difference in RDI between p-Ob and p-nOb for the supine position (P = 0.001), but there was no between-group difference for the lateral position. Sleeping in the lateral position is likely to mitigate existing SDB in pregnant women with obesity in late pregnancy and may be an effective precaution against undiagnosed SDB and associated complications.

Findings are presented from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women entered the study during pregnancy (< 26 weeks gestation) and were followed through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (MEI = 94; MIHOW = 94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI = 87; MIHOW = 91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effects of MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
