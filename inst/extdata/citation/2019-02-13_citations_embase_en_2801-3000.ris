N2  - Considering that changes at maternal environment have been associated to important abnormalities at the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. Female 3 month-old Wistar rats were divided in three experimental groups: C (control), SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy) and SRT (sleep restriction during all the pregnancy). SR and SRT females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 hours daily. After birth, the offspring was reduced to 6 male litters per mother. The groups were designated OC (Control's offspring), OSR (SR's offspring) and OSRT (SRT's offspring). Blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail pletismography, at 2 and 3 months of age. Renal function parameters [renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), sodium and potassium excretion and proteinuria] were studied at 3 months of age. Increased values of BP were observed in OSR and OSRT in comparison to OC [OSR:145±1.4 (43); OSRT:144±0.9 (68); OC:120±1.0 (45) mmHg, values measured at 3 months]. These groups also showed significant changes in RPF and GFR. Proteinuria was also increased in ORST in comparison to OC. Our present data suggest that changes at the maternal environment due to sleep restriction can result in hypertension and renal dysfunction in young offspring.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that depressed women's (DW) moodduring pregnancy or postpartum would improve more with late waketherapy (LWT) vs. early wake therapy (EWT) and correlate withendocrine measures.Method: 21 DW (7 pregnant, 14 postpartum) and 37 healthy women(HW)(24 pregnant, 13 postpartum), mean age 28 years, wererandomized in a cross-over design to EWT (sleep 03:00-07:00 h)vs. LWT (sleep 21:00-01:00 h) followed by a night of recovery sleep(RS-22:30-06:30 h). Mood ratings (Hamilton Depression RatingScale-HDRS) were administered pre- and post-treatment (after RS).Plasma melatonin and serum cortisol, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were drawn every 30 minutes from 18:00-10:00 hin dim light (<50 lux) and serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4)at 18:00 and 06:00 h.Results: HDRS scores were reduced by LWT in pregnant (p=.045)and postpartum (.016) DW, and by EWT in pregnant (.007) andpostpartum (.022) DW. LWT improved HDRS scores by 56.2%; EWTby 29.8% in pregnant and postpartum DW, but the difference was notsignificant (ns). After LWT, change in HDRS correlated positivelywith change in melatonin peak and area under the curve in bothpregnant and postpartum DW. After EWT, change in HDRS correlatednegatively with change in melatonin offset time in pregnant DW; inpostpartum DW, change in HDRS correlated negatively withmelatonin peak concentration. After LWT, TSH mesor increased inpostpartum HW; after EWT, cortisol amplitude and prolactin mesordecreased in postpartum HW. Mean E2 and P4 levels were notdifferent between groups, but in postpartum DW, increased levels ofE2 after LWT correlated with improved mood on the HDRS.Conclusion: Both EWT and LWT reduced depressive symptoms asmeasured by the HDRS in pregnant and postpartum women. Thedifference between the treatments was ns. Some correction tomelatonin, cortisol, prolactin and TSH rhythms was observed, butthere were insufficient data to indicate that these changesconsistently correlated with mood measures other than theincreased estradiol levels associated with improved mood afterLWT in postpartum DW.

N2  - Objectives: It has been suggested that children with a high birth weight or a prepregnant obese mother are at a particularly high risk of developing overweight. Research suggests that too much food and too little exercise is an insufficient explanation for the increased prevalence of obesity seen in most countries, and more recent studies have suggested that lack of sleep may be another determinant. Previous studies found an association between sleep duration and overweight, but few studies have examined if there is an association between sleep quality and weight status. Materials and methods: A total of 129 children aged 2-5 years with either high birth weight (>4000 g.) or a mother with a pre-pregnancy BMI >28 kg/m2 participated. Information on broken sleep was obtained from a questionnaire filled out by their parents. Height and weight was measured, and Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated. Linear regression analyses were performed. Results: Children who had a broken sleep and woke up several times during the night had a 1.4 kg/m2 higher BMI than children who slept through the entire night (P=0.05). Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status and the frequency of dreams scaring the child. Conclusion: Having a broken sleep is directly associated with BMI among 2-5 year old children, who are at high-risk of developing overweight.

N2  - Studies have linked stress with increased risk of CVD. A possible explanation is that abnormal secretion patterns of the stress hormone cortisol trigger high blood pressure and insulin resistance. A healthy diurnal pattern for cortisol starts with high levels at awakening, followed by a sharp increase 30 minutes later, then declining levels toward bedtime. Irregular bedtime or sleep duration may disrupt this pattern. We examined whether sleep patterns were related to salivary cortisol in 1,648 non-pregnant young adults (20-22 yrs; 56% males) from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Study (Philippines). Saliva samples were collected upon waking, 30 mins. later, and at bedtime. Sleep patterns were based on reported wakeup and bed times on the saliva collection day. Multivariable OLS regression models that controlled for possible confounders showed that <6 hrs sleep is associated with lower cortisol upon waking (β= -0.99, 95% CI [-1.68, -0.29]) and 30 mins. later (β= -1.04, 95% CI [-1.90, -0.18]). On the other hand, short sleep duration was associated with higher cortisol values at bedtime. Similar effects on cortisol values were observed for wakeup times before 4 am or after 10 am. The potential CVD risk associated with irregular sleep patterns merits concern in a globalizing country where lifestyles are changing and the demand for shift work is growing given the rise in business process outsourcing.

N2  - Background: The etiology of excessive infant crying is largely unknown. We hypothesize that excessive infant crying may have an early nutritional origin during fetal development. Aims: This study is the first to explore whether (1) maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological well-being during pregnancy affects these associations. Study design: Women were approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n = 8266) and to donate a blood sample (n = 4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a postpartum questionnaire (± 3 months; n = 5218). Subjects: Pregnant women living in Amsterdam and their newborn child. Outcome measures: Excessive infant crying, defined as crying ≥3 h/day on average in the past week. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622 (folate) women.Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age, parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems (OR[95%CI]: Q1 = 3.31[1.48-7.41]; Q2 = 2.50[1.08-5.77]; Q3 = 2.59[1.12-6.00]; Q4 = 2.77[1.20-6.40]; Q5 = reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger association among women with high levels of psychological problems during pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying. Conclusions: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms: the methionine-homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep-wake rhythm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: Pre-and Post-natal maternal stress and/or psychopathologycan have negative effects on infant temperament and later toddlerbehavior (Gutteling et al., 2005; Whitaker, Orzol, &Kahn, 2006).Infant temperamental difficulties have been associated with laterbehaviors problems as children develop (Olson, Bates, Sandy, & Lanthier, 2000; Olson, Bates, Sandy, &Schilling, 2002). Theobjective of this study was to investigate potential precursors(throughout peripartum) of infant temperament and other childoutcomes. Method: The present study utilizes data from a high-risk communitysample and explores the links between maternal PTSD and depressionduring pregnancy and postpartum predicting to their infants' emotionregulation problems at 7 months of age. The effects of infant sleep,infant gender, family SES risk and the use of psychotropic drugsduring pregnancy are also assessed. On a smaller subset we furtherexplore the associations between early emotion regulation problemsand subsequent development of pre-school behavior problems.Results: We found that both maternal postpartum depression, andinfant sleep problems predict problematic infant temperament at7-months, and that in turn, infant temperament, infant sleep problemsand maternal depression were predictive of toddler behavior problems12 months later. Psychotropic drugs and family SES risk had nosignificant effects of infant temperament or later child outcomes.Conclusion: Our data suggests that infant emotionality and infantsleep problems (in the context of maternal psychopathology) may beearly precursors to the development of later toddler behaviorproblems.

N2  - Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the perinatal period. Changes in sleep and sleep quality are typical throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. However, little is known about relationships between insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in perinatal women. The objective of the present study is to characterize the burden of insomnia symptoms in perinatal women seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment and to examine relationships between insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Data from 257 pregnant or postpartum women who sought outpatient psychiatric treatment at a university hospital-affiliated clinic were extracted from an existing clinical management database. Data included validated self-report measures assessing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and generalized anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]). Results: Fifty-two percent of women reported symptoms of insomnia, 75% reported symptoms of depression, and 61% reported symptoms of generalized anxiety. After controlling for PSWQ, the partial correlation between EPDS and ISI was 0.15 and 0.37 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. After controlling for EPDS, the partial correlation between PSWQ and ISI was 0.20 and 0.12 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. Women with clinically significant ISI scores had significantly higher odds for reporting symptoms consistent with depression (odds ratio [OR] 7.7) and generalized anxiety (OR 2.55) compared to women with lower ISI scores. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affected a significant proportion of the perinatal women in this sample. These symptoms are linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety in treatment-seeking pregnant and postpartum women. Perinatal women seen in psychiatric treatment settings should be routinely screened for sleep problems. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - To assess some risk factors and their involvement in female breast tumours etiology. The study was performed on a sample of 67 patients registered with breast tumours, at family phisicians' offices from Iasi, Romania. Some risk factors were defined such as: nuliparity (20.8%) and first pregnancy after age 30 (34.3%); fibrous mastopathy in personal history (73.1% of cases with breast cancer) and breast cancer in siblings of first (8.9%) and second grade (11.9%). Relative to lifestyle, sedentary life was remarked in 59.2% of patients; modification of circadian rhythm in 28.3%, and excesive caffeine consumption in 80.9% of cases. Further prevention and educational programs on breast tumoural risk factors are needed in Romania, even at female teenage, performed by family physician.

N2  - The aging of an organism results from a series or sequence of processes that produce morphological and physiological changes consistent with the gradual loss of homeostasis and increased susceptibility to certain specific diseases. The effects of aging could be a combination of programmed processes and genetic alterations induced by exogenous and endogenous factors. Ageing is therefore an ongoing process, widespread and irreversible that affects all systems in varying degrees, which produces structural and / or functional DNA alterations via oxidative processes (free radical) and / or environmental contaminants. One of the most important effects is the changes in the neuroendocrine and metabolic regulation (thermoregulation, biological rhythms, hormonal feed-backs), with the consequent decrease in homeostatic capacity and its profound effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Reproductive senescence, is a general phenomenon related to aging of the organism and is somewhat related to this chronology, ie the gradual deterioration of cellular processes extends equally to different organs and systems. Although in general the concepts of chronological age and biological age are managed (and often manifest themselves) independently. In females, the decline in age-related fertility has at least two components measured: 1) the decrease in rates of conception / pregnancy and 2) the increase in the rate of early losses and / or late pregnancy. In fact, one of the first signs of reproductive senescence is a decrease in fertility rates in each individual predictor. Currently, there is a large consensus that reproductive aging is associated with age in female mammals is also related, among many other factors to a loss of viability of oocytes and embryos and possible alterations in gene expression. Among the most obvious signs of this loss of reproductive potential are increasing the number of oocytes / embryos for numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, cytoplasmic fragmentation associated with apoptosis, polyspermy, abnormal development of embryos and consequent increase in embryonic or fetal mortality.

N2  - Introduction: There are few descriptions of clonidine use during lactation. We decided to develop an original approach to predict the exposure of neonates to clonidine taken by the mother during breastfeeding. We propose an in silico approach, based on a physiological model of drug kinetics (PBPK model), relying on a few basic properties of the drug. Materials & Methods: We used a PBPK model with 17 compartments, including mammary gland with specific equations to describe kinetics into milk and neonate. The model was implemented into ADAPT II software. Specific parameters, extracted from the literature were: clonidine partition coefficient (Km), milk fat fraction (fm), sucked milk flow (Qm), body fat fraction (fat) and clonidine renal and hepatic clearance (CLr and CLh respectively). PKsim® software was used to calculate the partition coefficients of clonidine into organs, based on its physicochemical properties. Clonidine clearance in newborns was calculated from literature data. With this program, we can estimate clonidine concentration in plasma (lg/l), free concentration in mammary gland fluid (lg/l), cumulative amount excreted in milk (lg/kg/12h), concentration in milk (lg/l), milk to plasma concentration ratio and steady-state concentration in neonate plasma (lg/l). Population simulations of 300 women were carried out, with a dose of 150 μg orally twice a day, assuming an interindividual coefficient of variation of 25% on each parameter (body weight, Qm, Km, CLh, CLr and fat). Results: The simulated concentration profiles in the mother are consistent with the available kinetic data. The median (10th and 90th percentiles) absorbed dose and clonidine Css simulated in neonates were 0.14 μg/kg/12h (0.09-0.25 μg/kg/12h) and 0.10 μg/l (0.05-0.2 μg/l) respectively. The median milk to plasma concentration ratio was 6.1% compared to 6.8-7% in the literature. These results are similar to experimental results found in literature. Discussion & Conclusion: We found in the literature only two studies that described adverse effects of clonidine during the pregnancy and breastfeeding: hypertension during the first three days of life, hyperactivity and sleep disturbances in six-year-old children, apathy syndrome, symptomatic hypoglycemia and feeding difficulties during the first 2 weeks of life. In adult population, for a dose of 275 μg (therapeutic dosage) once a day, clonidine concentration profile was in the range 0.4 to 4 μg/l. If the concentration-effect relation is similar in neonate, the exposure of neonate by breast-feeding would merely produce any effect . This model could be applicable to a large panel of drugs (antihypertensive, antiepileptic...) for which passive diffusion is the main mechanism of penetration into milk. Only a few physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule need to be incorporated in the model.

N2  - Case Presentation: A former 27-week-gestation Hispanic male aged 2 years and 9 months with a history of grade 2 intraventricular hemorrhage in the neonatal period presented with subacute onset of ataxia, difficulty with hand coordination, speech deterioration, and sleep disturbance. His symptoms had begun 3 weeks prior to admission and initially manifested as right toe walking and limping. His presenting physical exam was significant for truncal ataxia and an ataxic gait. His initial diagnostic laboratory testing was unremarkable, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts, protein, and infection studies. Oligoclonal bands were detected in the CSF. Brain MRI/MRA was normal. A video electroencephalogram showed no seizure activity. Over the next 9 days, he developed progressive choreoathetoid movements of his hands and left leg, tardive dyskinesia, complete mutism, insomnia with night terrors, and aspiration. Given the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF and a possible autoimmune/inflammatory etiology, he was given 3 days of intravenous immunoglobulin with no improvement. This was followed by 5 days of high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy with mildly improved symptoms. A SPECT study was normal. A PET metabolic scan of the brain was also unremarkable. Over the next few days, CSF analysis for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies returned positive. He was started on a course of rituximab and discharged home. Over the following 2 weeks, his symptoms improved. Two months after rituximab therapy, he was back to his premorbid baseline with no neurologic sequelae. Discussion: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is becoming an increasingly recognizable disorder with defined clinical criteria. The mechanism is thought to involve formation of antibodies to the NR1/NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptors, ultimately causing inhibition of these receptors in the presynaptic GABAergic interneurons. The pathogenesis of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies is still poorly understood. The clinical picture usually involves neuropsychiatric manifestations such as mood, behavior, and personality changes as well as oromotor and limb dyskinesias, progressive speech and cognitive regression, and autonomic instability. Diagnosis is established through immunocytochemical analysis and ELISA assays for the detection of antibodies in the serum and CSF. However, this testing is only available at certain academic centers. Individuals are managed with immunotherapy (corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and possibly rituximab). This disorder is highly treatment responsive with good outcomes. Conclusions: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an immune-mediated neurologic disorder with distinct treatment and prognostic implications. Early recognition and effective treatment are crucial for the care of these patients. Pediatric hospitalists are critical in suspecting, identifying, and managing this potentially devastating disorder.

N2  - There are sex biases in the occurrence of respiratory disorders including Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In neonatal rats, there are changes in respiratory control during the early neonatal period. Postnatal day 12-13 (P12-13) appears to be a “sensitive period” in breathing development in rats. However, little is known about the sex differences at this age and the effects of testosterone in breathing development. The purpose of our study was to eliminate the pre and perinatal testosterone surges and measure eupneic ventilation and the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in awake neonatal rats from P10-15, at puberty (∼P30) and in young adult (P90) male and female rats. Pregnant dams were given daily subcutaneous injections of the androgen antagonist flutamide (20mg/kg) from G14 until delivery. At P10-P15, P30 and P90 rats were studied in a whole-body flow-through plethysmograph and breathing and blood O2 saturation were continuously monitored in room-air and in hypoxia (12% O2). Following plethysmography, each rat was anesthetized and arterial blood collected for hormone measurement. Animals were perfused and the carotid bodies and brainstems harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. Flutamide treatment significantly changed O2 saturation in P30 and P90 female but not male rats.

N2  - Background: Women have consistently rated postnatal care less favourably that antenatal and intrapartum care. In 2008, an Australian regional hospital introduced two major changes to maternity care provision. These included 1) the introduction of individualised, evidence-based postnatal care early in 2008 (including removing routine observations on 'normal' women; promoting self care; and minimising disturbances before 0900 hrs); and 2) a caseload model of care (MGP) was introduced six months later to provide women with a known carer throughout pregnancy, birth and postnatally. Method: Cross-sectional postal surveys were administered six months postpartum to women birthing prior to the changes, then to a second group of women following the changes to postnatal care, and to a third group following the introduction of caseload midwifery. Results: Response fractions were 49% (251/511) at baseline (TP1), 43% (230/536) four months after the postnatal changes (TP2); and 42% (289/680) ten months after the introduction of MGP (TP3). Following the changes, there were no differences in specific or global measures of various aspects of postnatal care. However, women reported improved opportunities for sleep and rest (P = 0.002) and also feeling better prepared for parenting (P = 0.05). There were no differences in women's rating of domiciliary care across the surveys. Further analysis of these data by parity and model of care will be undertaken and presented at the conference. Conclusions: Improvements in women's satisfaction with postnatal care were not found in this study despite the implementation of major changes to postnatal care provision. The complexity and challenges in improving women's experiences of postnatal care remain.

N2  - Introduction: Treatment of ischemic damage to organs and tissues by mechanical ventilation with a high content of oxygen in the inspired mixture (FiO2) can lead to oxidative stress and reperfusion of tissue alteration, which is particularly characteristic of infants with their characteristic low levels of antioxidant protection. From this perspective, there is optimal mode selection in mechanical ventilation and FiO2 of vital organs and tissue, namely in brain tissue, which was made possible through the use of transcranial cerebral oximetry (TCO). Methods: At stage 1 of the study, with the consent of the ethics committee and informed parental consent, we examined 24 infants born in the physiological department of the maternity hospital RNIIAP of gestation 38 to 40 weeks, with Apgar 7 to 10, and birth weight 2,500 to 3,900 in the state of physiological sleep after feeding. In all children, we measured the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctL, SctR) using the cerebral oximeter Fore-sight (USA) at 1, 3 and 5 days after birth. Later, in a controlled, randomized study were included two groups of neonates on mechanical ventilation. In patients of group 1 (n = 35), modes and ventilator FiO2 were determined under the control of TCO in a way that is as close as possible to indicators of cerebral oxygenation for the age norm. In patients of group 2 (n = 33), mode selection and FiO2 ventilation was carried out under the supervision of pulse oximetry and partial oxygen tension (pO2), according to acid-base balance, excluding indicators for TCO. Results: At stage 1 the study defined age-norm TCO indicators for healthy infants amounting in the left hemisphere of the brain to 79.2 ± 4.06% (0.01 <P <0.05) and in the right hemisphere to 84.89 ± 5.1% (0.01 <P <0.05). At phase 2 of the study group infants, the selection of modes and ventilator FiO2 on the basis of indicators for TCO statistically significantly (in all cases 0.01 <P <0.05) decreased length of stay on the ventilator (from 9.4 to 5.6 bed-days), mortality (from 2.7% to 0%), and number of complications (cases of radiologically confirmed pneumonia from 4.2% to 0.2%) compared with the control group. Conclusions: The use of TCO for the optimization of mechanical ventilation and oxygen saturation monitoring in brain tissue in newborn infants in critical condition is a promising method for reducing mortality, reducing the term of ventilation and reducing complications of oxygen therapy in this group of patients.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that appears to affect at least 5% of the population. Women appear to be affected twice as commonly as men. The prevalence increases with age, as does disease severity. For many individuals with RLS there is significant sleep disruption and a general decrease in quality of life. RLS appears to be increased in subjects with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, and among those on hemodialysis. Cerebrospinal fluid, magnetic resonance imaging, and autopsy studies support the concept that RLS is associated with low brain iron levels, even in those who have no clear peripheral iron storage problems. Treatment studies, on the other hand, support a role for the dopaminergic system, as levodopa and dopamine agonists are considered the most effective agents for relieving RLS symptoms. Other treatments of value in RLS include opiates, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and some anticonvulsants such as gabapentin. Because low brain iron appears to be a causal factor in RLS, treatment studies with oral or intravenous iron have been tried, with varying success. Finally, recent family studies and gene-wide association studies have identified several candidate genes; this may help to focus future research endeavors into the pathophysiology of RLS. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Human hearing develops progressively during the last trimester of gestation. Near-term fetuses can discriminate acoustic features, such as frequencies and spectra, and process complex auditory streams. Fetal and neonatal studies show that they can remember frequently recurring sounds. However, existing data can only show retention intervals up to several days after birth. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that auditory memories can last at least six weeks. Experimental fetuses were given precisely controlled exposure to a descending piano melody twice daily during the 35th, 36th, and 37th weeks of gestation. Six weeks later we assessed the cardiac responses of 25 exposed infants and 25 naive control infants, while in quiet sleep, to the descending melody and to an ascending control piano melody. The melodies had precisely inverse contours, but similar spectra, identical duration, tempo and rhythm, thus, almost identical amplitude envelopes. All infants displayed a significant heart rate change. In exposed infants, the descending melody evoked a cardiac deceleration that was twice larger than the decelerations elicited by the ascending melody and by both melodies in control infants. Conclusions/Significance: Thus, 3-weeks of prenatal exposure to a specific melodic contour affects infants 'auditory processing' or perception, i.e., impacts the autonomic nervous system at least six weeks later, when infants are 1-month old. Our results extend the retention interval over which a prenatally acquired memory of a specific sound stream can be observed from 3-4 days to six weeks. The long-term memory for the descending melody is interpreted in terms of enduring neurophysiological tuning and its significance for the developmental psychobiology of attention and perception, including early speech perception, is discussed. © 2011 Granier-Deferre et al.

N2  - Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are more common in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. It is likely that physiology of pregnancy predisposes to the development or worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, but some physiologic changes may also be protective against the development of this disease. Clinical presentation may be less predictive of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy than in the non-pregnant population; nonetheless, snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment strategies are similar to the nonpregnant population, however, pregnancy-specific scenarios may arise and these subtleties are addressed in this review. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Emotional and moody behaviour is often normalized in childbearing women. However, increased mood variability is associated with psychiatric problems (anxiety, depression, personality disorder), which are potentially deleterious to the health of the developing fetus and mother. Purpose: To increase understanding about mood variability in childbearing women. Method: Depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Mood variability was calculated from twice-daily diary ratings of “depressed”, “fear”, and “irritable” mood for one week each in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and postpartum. Findings: We recruited 47 women. Depression, as measured by the EPDS, and fear mood variability decreased from early pregnancy to postpartum. Depressed and irritable mood variability also declined during pregnancy, but increased in post-partum. Increases in mood variability (depressed, irritable) from late pregnancy to postpartum predicted higher postpartum EPDS. Mood diaries were available from 30 non-parturient women for comparison. Pregnant and postpartum women had higher irritable but not depressed or fear mood variability. Conclusion: Mood, particularly anxiety, is variable over the course of pregnancy into early postpartum. This may be related to diminishing concerns about the pregnancy and baby's health after birth, sleep disruptions, or hormonal changes. Depressed mood variability is correlated with, but is distinct from depression as measured by the EPDS. We present results counter to the notion that all mood is amplified in childbearing women.

N2  - People's childbearing intentions change over the course of their reproductive lives. these changes have been conceptualized as occurring in response to the realization that an individual is unlikely to achieve his or her intended fertility, because of constraints such as the "biological clock" or lack of a partner. in this article we fnd that changes to child-bearing plans are infuenced by a much wider range of factors than this. People change their plans in response to the wishes of their partners, in response to social norms, as the result of repartnering, and as the result of learning about the costs and benefts of parenthood; there are also differences between the factors that infuence men's and women's decisionmaking. in a departure from existing studies in this area, we use a fexible analytical framework that enables us to analyze increases in planned fertility separately from decreases. this allows us to uncover several complexities of the decisionmaking process that would otherwise be hidden, and leads us to conclude that the determinants of increases in planned fertility are not simply equal and opposite to the determinants of decreases. © 2011 The Population Council, Inc.

N2  - Objective: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition marked by transient episodes of maternal hypoxia that in turn elicits compensatory maternal mechanisms believed to cause endothelial injury. The existing literature has reported an association between maternal OSA and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth restriction and the development of preeclampsia. We sought to evaluate the histopathology of placentas in OSA patients to determine if there is a correlation between OSA and hypoxic lesions in the placenta. Methods: This is a retrospective case control study at a single urban tertiary care center. Women with polysomnogram confi rmed sleep apnea with available placenta slides were included as cases. Women delivering during the same time period were randomly selected as controls in a 1:1 fashion using a perinatal database. All medical charts were reviewed for maternal and neonatal clinical data. The histological slides were graded by a single pathologist (JS) who was blinded to clinical and demographic data. Lesions were corrected for gestational age. The hypoxic lesions of interest included placental infarcts, villous crowding with prominent syncytial knots, and advanced villous maturation. Data analysis was performed using chi square, Mann Whitney U and student t test. P<0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results: This cohort consisted of 40 women with OSA and 42 controls. The OSA group had a similar mean delivery gestational age (37 vs. 37. 5 weeks, p=0.34) and birthweight (2966±1044 vs. 2748±792 grams, p=0.32) when compared to the control group. The placental birthweight ratio was similar between the two groups (0.19±0.06 vs. 0.19±0.08, p=0.47). Placentas of pregnancies affected by OSA had similar rates of hypoxic lesions: (25.6 vs. 32.5%, p=0.6), intraplacental infarction (2.6 vs. 7.5%, p=0.6), villous edema (51.3 vs. 45.0%, p=0.66) and vasculitis of unknown etiology (VUE) (7.7 vs. 5.0%, p=0.67). The OSA group had lower rates of villous fi brosis (38.5 vs. 67.5%, p=0.013) and predecidual fi brin (2.6 vs. 22.5%, p=0.014). Conclusion: Sleep apnea in pregnancy was not associated with an increase in hypoxic lesions in the placenta.

N2  - Introduction: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a cholestatic disorder mainly occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy characterized by pruritus, elevated serum aminotransferases and serum fasted bile salts levels. In contrast to other pruritic disorders of pregnancy, solely ICP is associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. However, diagnosis of ICP may be difficult when considering other pregnancy associated disorders and liver diseases such as HELLP-syndrome and (pre-)eclampsia. We have recently identified increased autotaxin activity in women with ICP (Gastroenterology 2010; 139(3): 1008). Here, we studied whether serum autotaxin could distinguish ICP from other diagnoses. Methods: ICP was diagnosed in pregnant women with pruritus and increased serum transaminases and/or bile salt levels in the absence of a dermatosis. Women with pruritus and normal serum transaminases and bile salt levels were summarized as pruritic disorders of pregnancy. Autotaxin activity was measured enzymatically in diluted serum samples of pregnant women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP; n = 43), other pruritic disorders of pregnancy (n = 15), HELLP-syndrome and (pre-)eclampsia (n = 17), pregnant (PC; n = 44) and healthy controls (HC; n = 219). Serum bile salts and transaminases were quantified by enzymatic assays. Autotaxin protein was quantified by Western Blotting. Results: ATX activity was increased in women with ICP (mean: 52.2 nmol/mL.min ±21.6 nmol/mL.min, p < 0.0001) compared to other pruritic disorders of pregnancy (21.7 nmol/mL.min ±6.5 nmol/ mL.min), HELLP-syndrome and pre-eclampsia (19.8 nmol/mL.min ±8.7 nmol/mL.min), and pregnant controls (20.5 nmol/mL.min ±6.4 nmol/mL.min). Autotaxin protein content correlated with autotaxin activity (r = 0.62, p < 0.01). With a cut-off value of 30.0 nmol/mL.min, autotaxin had a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 93% in diagnosing ICP from other pruritic disorders and a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 85% from HELLP-syndrome and pre-eclampsia. In a subset of ICP women longitudinal studies during pregnancy revealed that autotaxin activity strongly rises in the third trimester of pregnancy. Sequential blood sampling in healthy controls showed that autotaxin displayed no circadian rhythm and was not influenced by oral food intake. Conclusion: Autotaxin activity represents a highly sensitive, specific and robust diagnostic tool in distinguishing ICP from other disorders of pregnancy and pregnancy-related liver diseases such as HELLPsyndrome, and (pre-)eclampsia.

N2  - Obesity is a worldwide health problem and its prevalence is reaching epidemic proportions. As obesity does not spare women of childbearing age, obstetric anesthesiologists will increasingly be exposed to the challenges of anesthesia in this population. The purpose of this article is to give the reader a thorough understanding of the anesthetic implications of obesity relating to cesarean deliveries. Obesity is associated with hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea and other comorbidities. It increases the risk of cesarean delivery, postpartum wound infections and deep venous thromboembolism. Obese parturients are prone to anesthetic complications such as aspiration of gastric contents, difficult monitoring, positioning, airway management and challenging neuraxial techniques. A thorough precesarean delivery preparation should include an evaluation by an anesthesiologist for women with a BMI over 40 kg/m2 and institution of an antacid prophylaxis protocol, thromboprophylaxis and antibiotic prophylaxis. Regional anesthesia should ideally be used in all obese parturients unless contraindicated. The goals of postpartum care include efficacious analgesia, physiotherapy and early mobilization. Monitoring and vigilance in an intensive care unit or step-down units should be considered for morbidly obese women. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous. The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential source(s) of pregnant women's problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of Cortisol, depressed mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory. Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures to detect objective deficits in pregnant women's memory. © 2011 Canadian Psychological Association.

N2  - Objective: To examine if obesity modifies the risk of asthma, sleep apnea, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a pregnancy and whether the risk varies by maternal race/ethnicity. Methods: We studied all singleton births at ≥20 weeks of gestation (n= 65,770) at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals (2006-2009). Prepregnancy BMI (kg/m2) was categorized as normal weight (18.5-24.9) and obese (BMI ≥ 30). Asthma (493x), sleep apnea (780x), and ARDS (518x) were the outcome of interest. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confi dence intervals (CI) were used to estimate associations. Results: Compared with normal weight women, obese women were more likely to be older, from Hispanic or African-American ethnic groups, to have ≤12 years of education, and smoked during pregnancy. Obesity was associated with 15.0-fold (95%CI 6.5-34.4) increased risk of sleep apnea, 1.9-fold (95% CI 1.7-2.1) increased risk of ARDS, and 1.9-fold (95%CI 1.8-2.1) increased risk of asthma. A stratified analysis by maternal race/ethnicity revealed that obesity was associated with increased risk of sleep apnea, ARDS, and asthma among Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Among whites, obesity was associated with ARDS and asthma. Among blacks, obesity was associated with asthma. (Table presented) Conclusion: The results suggest that there is considerable racial/ethnic heterogeneity in risk for adverse respiratory conditions among obese pregnant women. The identification of women at-risk may help obstetricians closely monitor and provide advice to their patients.

N2  - Introduction: After in utero exposure to tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) neonatal withdrawal symptoms have been reported. The incidence has been estimated to be 20-50%. In many guidelines the use of TCA are preferred over SSRI during pregnancy. Relative few data are available for clomipramine, the only serotonergic TCA. Pharmacokinetic parameters of neonatal clomipramine elimination are hardly available, while they might add to the decision to a safe discharge of the infant from the hospital. Patients and Methods: Pregnant women exposed to clomipramine and their babies were included in an observational study, approved by the local ethics committee, after given informed consent. Pharmaco-kinetic parameters of clomipramine elimination were measured both in pregnant women and their newborn babies. Clomipramine concentrations were determined using an in house developed LC-MSMS method, (LOQ of 5 μg/L, all variations < 5%) in umbilical cord blood and at 12, 24 and 48 hours after birth. Withdrawal symptoms were scored at 12, 24 and 48 hours after birth using the Finnegan score. Results: During the observation period (2004-2009), 3 out of 11 pregnancies were complicated with pre-eclampsia. 10 neonates were observed for clomipramine withdrawal symptoms.The most frequent observed withdrawal symptoms were, a too short period of sleep after feeding (6), poor feeding (3), mild to severe tremors when disturbed (6), hyperactive Moro-reflex (3) and respiratory rate >60 ml/min with or without retractions (3). Serious withdrawal reactions were seen in 2 neonates: one with tachycardia and another with cyanosis. No significant difference was found in frequency of withdrawal symptoms or half-life values between neonates who are breastfed and those who were bottle-fed. We calculated a half-life value of 42 +/- 16 hours of clomipramine in neonates, see figure 1. We did not find a relationship between the withdrawal reactions and clomipramine plasma concentration or desmethylclomipramine plasma concentration respectively. Conclusion: In neonates clomipra-mine disappears with a half-life value of 42 hours, compared to 20 hours in adults. In 2 out of 10 neonates tachycardia and cyanosis were seen as serious withdrawal symptoms after maternal use of clomipramine. (Graph presented) .

N2  - The study aimed to identify risk factors of sleep disturbances in 2-month-old infants. It comprised 198 infants (86 boys, 112 girls) who were singletons born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2007. The mothers were asked to complete questionnaires addressing major infant, maternal, and demographic characteristics. Preexisting medical records were scrutinized. The mothers were requested to describe infant sleep troubles. The baby was defined as having sleep disturbances, if he or she had five or more episodes per week characterized by settling difficulties at bedtime (could not fall asleep within 20 minutes after being put to bed) or frequent night awakenings (woke up more than twice during the night). Of 198 infants, 96 (48.5%) reportedly had sleep disturbances. In the univariate analysis, the factors associated with increased risk of sleep disturbances were (odds ratio, OR; (95% CI)) first birth order 3.55 (1.90-6.69), previous abortions 2.08 (1.14-3.83), maternal vaginal bleedings during pregnancy 2.58 (1.07-6.29), maternal allergies 2.44 (1.17-5.14), and maternal smoking during pregnancy 2.45 (1.27-4.77). Stepwise backward logistic regression analysis identified combinations of the factors that best predicted the risk of infant sleep disturbances: first birth order, previous abortions, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. After inclusion into the multiple logistic regression equation, these factors provided moderate prediction (pseudo R2=0.15). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, and the area under the ROC curve was equal to 0.6636 (95% CI=0.5905-0.7406), p(area=0.5) <0.05. Findings from the maternal history may help to predict sleep disturbances in young infants. © 2011 Springer.

N2  - Objectives: Clock genes drive circadian rhythms in physiological processes both centrally and within peripheral tissues. Recent evidence in mice suggests that the placenta acts as a peripheral clock, although this has not been fully characterised. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the canonical clock genes are expressed within the functionally distinct zones of the rat placenta and whether this expression shows a circadian pattern. Additional aims were to assess whether pregnancy affects clock gene expression in maternal liver, and if patterns of clock gene expression are synchronous among maternal liver, fetal liver and the two placental zones. Methods: Pregnant rats (n=6/time point) were sampled over days 21-22 of gestation (term = day 23) and non-pregnant animals (n=6/time point) were sampled starting from diestrus I of the cycle. Samples of adult liver (all animals), junctional and labyrinth zones of the placenta and fetal liver (pregnant animals) were collected from both groups at 0800, 1400, 2000 and 0200 h. Expression of clock genes Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2 were measured in all tissues by quantitative PCR. Data were analysed by 1- or 2-way ANOVA, as appropriate. Results: Both zones of the rat placenta expressed all clock genes, with zonal differences clearly evident for each (P<0.01). While placental expression of Bmal1, Per1 and Per2 did vary with time of day (25-50% increases across the day; P<0.05), circadian variation was less robust than in adult liver (4-20-fold increases; P<0.01). Clock gene expression in maternal liver changed with pregnancy; expression of Per1, Cry1 and Cry2 were lower in pregnant mothers (by 40-50%, P<0.01) whereas Per3 expression increased (2-fold; P<0.01) and Clock expression no longer varied with time of day. In the fetal liver, all clock genes were expressed, but only Per2, Per3 and Cry1 varied with time of day (1.5-2.8-fold increases; P<0.05) suggestive of an immature clock. Moreover, placental and fetal liver clock profi les were less robust and not synchronous with those in maternal liver. Conclusion: The rat placenta expresses all clock genes in a highly zone-specific pattern with a less robust circadian variation than in adult liver. Moreover, pregnancy alters the circadian variation of hepatic clock gene expression, which may contribute to pregnancy-induced changes in maternal physiology.

N2  - Objective. To identify predictors as free-text markers for mental ill-health from an electronic perinatal record (EMR) system and the association with emergency cesarean section (CS) in nulliparous women. Material and methods. This was a population-based study using an EMR system, set in the catchment area of Malmö University Hospital in Sweden. Of 10 662 nulliparous women presenting with a singleton cephalic baby for vaginal delivery between 2001 and 2006, 6 467 women with complete EMRs were selected. A free-text search of markers for mental ill-health was carried out, and results were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Eleven markers for mental ill-health were tested with Cohen's kappa for agreement and used as exposure variables. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for emergency CS, and adjusted for maternal age, diabetes, epidural anesthesia and gestational weeks <37 and >41 by a multivariate logistic regression model with vaginal delivery as the reference. Results. Three markers identified from the EMR system reached statistically significant associations with an increased risk for emergency CS in nulliparous women: stress, adjusted OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.34-2.06); sleep, adjusted OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.14-2.16); and worry, adjusted OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.10-1.79). Conclusion. Free-text words in medical records that indicated stress, sleep disturbances or worry predicted increased adjusted OR for emergency CS in first-time mothers. Recognizing pregnant women's reporting of their mental health status could have a predictive bearing on delivery outcomes. © 2011 The Authorsa Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica© 2011 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - Objective: Animal studies have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables. Method: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2 and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, respectively. Results: Despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and regulation of states NBAS clusters (P = .03 and P = .026, respectively). At 1 year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on generalized anxiety (P = .002), particularly in males (P = .009); activity/impulsivity (P = .042); and sleep problems (P = .023) than controls. Conclusions: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to under standing the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders. © Copyright 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - Objectives: The Objective of this study was to examine the infl uence of sociodemographic, medical and psychosocial variables assessed during pregnancy on birthweight among full-term infants. Methods: Two hundred eighty-two pregnant women (n=282) (mean age = 32.3, SD = 4.4) in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaires measuring: depression, trait-anxiety, social support, life events, sleep, vitality and fear of childbirth. Demographic variables (i.e. age, parity, education, income), lifestyle (i.e. smoking and alcohol) and complications in the current pregnancy or in previous deliveries were also collected. T-tests and chi square statistics were used to test for associations between demographic, medical, and psychosocial variables with birtweight group. Results: Of the 282 Canadian pregnant women included in this study, 4.6% (n=13) were born low birthweight (<2500 grams), 82.27% (n=232) in the normal birthweight range (between 2500-4000 grams) and 12.8% (n=36) were high birthweight (>4000 grams). Women with babies with higher birthweight were signifi cantly more likely to have an episiotomy (p=0.018). Compared to women delivering normal weight infants, women who delivered low fullterm birthweight infants were signifi cantly younger (p=0.036 ), had a lower household income (0.042), lower vitality during pregnancy (p=0.042), higher prenatal depressed mood ( p=0.34), higher trait anxiety (p=0.018) and greater fear of childbirth post delivery (p=0.003). Conclusions: Demographic and specifi c psychosocial variables assessed during the third trimester of pregnancy were associated with birthweight. Modifi able variables including fatigue, depressed mood, and anxiety should be targeted during pregnancy in order to improve infant outcomes and decrease subsequent fear of childbirth.

N2  - Low back and buttock pain isa frequent complaint during pregnancy. In a small percentage of these patients, pain secondary to osteitis condensans ilii (OCI) persists during postpartum period, and rarely occurs suddenly in elderly. Here, two cases with low back and buttock pain diagnosed as OCI are presented. The first patient, a 45 year old woman was admitted to our outpatient clinic with low back and left buttock pain. Patient's complaints started a decade ago during pregnancy, continued after delivery, and then relieved spontaneously. Locomotor, neurological and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory tests were within normal ranges. In lumbosacral radiography, iliac side of left sacroiliac joint was sclerotic. Patient's symptoms are attributed to unilateral OCI.Another patient, presenting with right buttock pain, was a 56 years old retired woman, with a history of very active business life. She hadn't had such complaints both during and after her pregnancies. The patient indicated that she had been in pain for one month then and pain increased for the last 24 hours that she couldn't even sleep, she couldn't walk because of pain. There was no locomotor pathology on the examination but the positive right Faber test. Laboratory values were normal. In lumbosacral radiography and pelvic computed tomography, right ilium was captured by typical triangular sclerosis. Both of our patients started taking a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and myorelaxants to relieve symptoms. Subsequently patients' complaints where decreased. OCI is a rare benign pathology, should be suspected in patients presenting with low back or buttock pain. Although the exact etiology is unknown, the most accepted hypothesis is that changes may develop in the iliac bone depending on the mechanical stress on sacroiliac joint. It is important to recognize OCI as it can potentially be confused with metastatic diseases and causes of sacroiliitis such as seronegative spondyloarthropathies, primarily ankylosing spondylitis.

N2  - Objective: To describe the epidemiological profile, risk factors and best strategies for diagnosing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in a developing country. Methods: Population-based, case-control study with children born between January 1st, 2001, and December 31st, 2003, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, who were allocated into three groups: SIDS cases (33), explained death controls (192), and living controls (192). Children in the latter two groups were age- and sex-paired with SIDS cases. Families in which an infant had died at home within the first year of life were identified, and the information available on death certificates and autopsy reports was compared to confirm the diagnosis of SIDS. Explained death controls consisted of infants who had died at city hospitals, and living controls were selected in the same neighborhood as SIDS cases. All parents were interviewed to obtain information on children's health and sleep habits. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors in the study population. Results: The incidence of SIDS in the population assessed was 0.55/1,000 live births. The analysis revealed the following risk factors: ethnicity (characterized by self-reported black skin color), prematurity, low birth weight, adolescent mother, smoking during pregnancy, and family income of less than one minimum wage. Ninety-four percent of SIDS cases were misdiagnosed in the death certificate. Conclusions: Although SIDS was misdiagnosed in official death certificates, the epidemiological profile is similar to the literature, as well as risk factors, which could be reduced with preventive campaigns. Investigating SIDS in developing countries requires special strategies to avoid misdiagnosis. Copyright © 2011 by Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

N2  - Introduction: Selenoprotein N1 (SEPN1)-related myopathies are caused by mutations in the SEPN1 gene and form a group of rare disorders, whose incidence and prevalence is unknown so far. The inheritance is autosomal recessive. The phenotype could be characterised by early muscular hypotonia, poor head control, axial muscle weakness, spinal rigidity with early scoliosis and respiratory distress with nocturnal hypoventilation. Most of the patients show dystrophy with body mass index (BMI) below the 3.rd percentile. Intelligence is mostly normal and weakness is often static or slowly progressive. Case report: We report on a 2,7 year old boy, whose first presentation has been arranged due to weakness and dystrophy (BMI: 12,7kg/m2;<1. P.-3,06 SDS). Furthermore there could be found funnel chest, flat valgus feed, large ears, axial and proximal muscle weakness including lag of head control and positive Gowers sign and symptoms of respiratory hypoventilation during sleep. Pregnancy was uncomplicated, birth weight was normal, no feeding problems in the first months. Further motor development in the first year was normal (walking at 14 months). Speech development was in upper range, serum creatine kinase (CK) level and neurophysiologic investigations were normal. Because of the typical clinical appearance a genetic analysis in the SEPN1 gene was performed without a muscle biopsy before, which disclosed two missence mutations in the SEPN1 gene (c. 1 A>G or p. Met1Val in exon 1 and c. 973 G>A or p. Gly315 Ser in exon 7). Conclusion: SEPN1 related myopathies are rare disorders and muscle biopsy may show non-specific changes. In our case the combination of history and typical clinical symptoms prompted to a direct genetic analysis in the SEPN1 gene. In those cases muscle biopsy can be omitted.

N2  - Background: More than 20 years ago Dawes-Redman criteria were proposed for the defi nition of low and high variability of fetal heart rate (FHR). While periods of low variability are physiological during the sleep state of the fetus, extremely low FHR variability and for prolonged period are sign of hypoxemia and compromised fetus. A novel method of analysis has been proposed in adult cardiology, Phase Rectifi ed Signal Averaging - PRSA. The advantage of the method is the ability to extract periodic components out of non stationary, noise time series. Aim: To investigate the relationship between acceleration capacity of the FHR derived from PRSA analysis and periods of low and high FHR variability. Methods: Women with uncomplicated pregnancy at term were monitored with Monica AN24 device. Trans-abdominal fetal and maternal ECG were acquired and subsequently analysed by PRSA analysis. Mathematical algorithm by Matlab was implemented in order to discriminate automatically periods of low and high variability by Dawes-Redman criteria. Acceleration capacity was calculated separately for periods of low and high variability in all individuals. Results: 29 traces of fetal ECG with both low and high variability segments were analysed by PRSA method. Intra-individually acceleration capacity was signifi cantly larger (more negative) in high variability segments when compared to low variability periods (mean -2.26±0.72 ms vs -1.09±0.36 ms respectively; p<0.00001) (Figure 1). Fig 1. Intra-individual relationship between acceleration capacity and periods of low and high FHR variability. Conclusions: Our data suggest that acceleration capacity derived from PRSA analysis is able to identify low and high variability segments of FHR. Future studies should test whether acceleration capacity provides diagnostic information which is independent from that obtained by standard methods.

N2  - Adult neurogenesis occurs in two privileged microenvironments, the hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricle. This review focuses on accumulating evidence suggesting that the activity of specific brain regions or bodily states influences SVZ cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin have been shown to have long-range effects through neuronal projections into the SVZ. Local γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have demonstrated effects on SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, but an extra-niche source of these neurotransmitters remains to be explored and options will be discussed. There is also accumulating evidence that diseases and bodily states such as Alzheimer's disease, seizures, sleep and pregnancy influence SVZ cell proliferation. With such complex behavior and environmentally-driven factors that control subregion-specific activity, it will become necessary to account for overlapping roles of multiple neurotransmitter systems on neurogenesis when developing cell therapies or drug treatments. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is common amongst brain malformations. The underlying genetic defects of ACC are variable, reflecting the complexity of callosal development. ACC has been described in association with different microdeletions, often located at the chromosomal region 1q44. In two cases the microdeletion was located at 1q42 more than 10 Mb proximal of 1q44. We report on a 3-year-old boy from Iraq who is the first child of non-consanguineous parents. Family history and pregnancy were unremarkable. The postnatal period was characterized by sleep and feeding problems. At the age of 3 years a febrile seizure occurred. Speech development was delayed, behaviour was hyperactive and aggressive. He had mild facial dysmorphism with inverse epicanthic folds and two café-au-lait spots. Cranial MRI showed hypogenesis of the corpus callosum. Metabolic and ophthalmologic examinations did not detect any abnormality. SNP oligonucleotide array testing revealed a 3.6 Mb duplication in chromosomal region 1q25.1 and a 4.2 Mb deletion in chromosomal region 1q42.12q42.2. The duplication encompassed 30 RefSeq genes, none of them being an OMIM annotated disease gene. The deleted region harbors 40 RefSeq genes, five of them listed to be associated with diseases (PSEN2, CABCA1, GJC2, ACTA1, AGT). Our observation is in keeping with two previous reports on ACC patients with deletions of 1q42. This region is more than 10 Mb apart from 1q44 where deletions are known to cause ACC. Our finding supports the notion of an independent ACC-associated region at 1q42. Some of the genes located in this region, e.g.WNT3A (OMIM 603341) and RHOU (606366), have been discussed as candidates of ACC and neural tube defects. Behavioural abnormalities and speech delay in our patient may be explained as consequences of ACC. However a phenotypic effect of the duplication at 1q25.1 cannot be excluded. This report underpins the role of 1q42 microdeletion as a potential cause of agenesis/hypogenesis of the corpus callosum.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) variability (fHRV) complexity may improve the sensitivity and specifi city of FHR monitoring. Autonomic information fl ow characterizes fHRV in complexity domain on time scales. However, the physiological relationship of these time scales to the underlying sympathetic and vagal rhythms is not well studied. METHODS: We analyzed fHRV in complexity domain as Kullback-Leibler entropy (KLE normalized to 1) in fetal sheep at 0.87 gestation. We studied (1) infl uence of vagal (atropine blockade) and sympathetic (propranolol blockade) modulation of fHRV on time scale-dependent fHRV complexity (n=6) and (2) changes in sympathetic and vagal activity during high voltage/low frequency (HV/LF) and low voltage/high frequency (LV/HF) electrocortical activity (n=12). Signifi cance was assumed for P < 0.05. RESULTS (Fig. 1): Atropine blockade resulted in complexity decrease at 2.5 Hz compared to HV/LF and LV/HF and at 1.6 Hz compared to LV/HF. Propranolol blockade resulted in complexity increase in 0.08-0.1 Hz range compared to LV/HF and in no changes compared to HV/LF. During LV/HF activity, fHRV complexity was lower at 2.5 Hz and higher at 0.15-0.19 Hz than during HV/LF activity. Fig. 1. KLE for varying delay time L. Increasing complexity corresponds to decreasing KLE values. DISCUSSION: Reduction of complexity due to vagal blockade on short- and long-term time scales demonstrates the vagal contribution to fHRV complexity properties on a wide range of time scales. In contrast, the effect of sympathetic blockade is limited to an increase in complexity on a narrow segment of longterm time scale. Intriguingly, during LV/HF we found a lower complexity at short-term time scale where complexity is also decreased due to vagal blockade. This suggests that vagal modulations of fHRV in sheep show a complex organization with sleep-state- and time-scale-dependent complexity patterns. A change in these patterns can be captured at a time scale around 2.5 Hz.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are modulated in a variety of peripheral tissues, including in the uterus where endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) undergo proliferation and differentiation (decidualization) during gestation. Here the authors focused on circadian rhythms in UESCs during implantation and decidualization in rodents. As revealed by analyses of cultured UESCs from pregnant Per2 promoterdLuc transgenic rats, Per2 oscillation of ∼24h was observed in response to dexamethasone. Per2 oscillation was enhanced in UESCs during implantation, whereas they were attenuated during decidualization. In vivo studies showed that PER2 protein in the uteri displayed a peak at zeitberger time 4 (ZT 4) (day 4.50 of gestation) and a trough at ZT 12 (day 4.83), indicating its circadian rhythmicity. Conversely, no significant circadian rhythm of the PER2 protein was observed during decidualization. Fluorescent immunohistochemical studies also supported circadian rhythmicity of the PER2 protein in its intracellular distribution. In accordance with Per2 mRNA expression, a circadian rhythm of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) gene expression, having several E-box or E-boxlike sites at the upstream of the transcription start site, was observed during implantation, showing a peak at ZT 0 and a trough at ZT 12. In contrast, Vegf mRNA expression displayed no circadian rhythm during decidualization. Collectively, the present results prove that Per2 oscillation is down-regulated in UESCs during decidualization. It is strongly suggested that cellular differentiation in UESCs interferes with circadian clockwork. Copyright © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to profile sleep patterns during pregnancy according to body mass index (BMI) and to correlate labour outcomes with both BMI and hours sleep. Data were collected from 200 postpartum women detailing sleep characteristics before and during pregnancy. A validated sleep questionnaire was employed, which comprised of questions about sleep apnoea, snoring, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. Descriptive analyses were used. With advancing gestation, the mean (SD) number of hours sleep per night declined: pre-pregnancy 8.1 (SD 1.4); 1st trimester 8.3 (SD 1.8); 2nd trimester 7.7 (SD 1.7) and 3rd trimester 6.7 (SD 2.2). In the 18.5 24.9 BMI group, there was a marked difference in hours sleep per night from pre-pregnancy to 1st (8.6 h, p=0.007), 2nd (7.9 h, p=0.023) and 3rd (6.4 h, p=0.000) trimesters in primiparous women. In the 25 29.9 BMI group, there was a difference from pre-pregnancy to 3rd trimester (p=0.000). These changes were not reflected in a clinically significant difference in birth weight or mode of delivery. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Hormonal and physical changes during pregnancy are associated with some sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) such as snoring and sleep apnea, and SRBD are associated with recurrent episodes of oxyhemoglobin desaturation and increased sympathic activity. We aimed to search the incidence of self-reported snoring and witnessed apnea in the third trimester of pregnancy and to analyze their influence on fetal outcome and gestational hypertension (GH). Methods: Two hundred pregnant women (group 1) during their stay for labor and 200 age-matched control women (group 2) were included in the study. All patients were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire that covers demographic features. We measured neck circumference and performed Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) to determine excessive daytime sleepiness in all patients. Results: The mean age was 27.4 ± 6.7 and 26.3 ± 5.8 for group 1 and 2, respectively. Habitual snoring was detected only in group 1 in 5 patients; 36 pregnant women and 7 control patients reported occasional snoring. Both habitual and occasional snoring was significantly observed to be increased in pregnancy. Witnessed sleep apnea was been observed only in 1 patient in group 1. The mean neck circumference was 37.4 ± 3.2, 35.1 ± 2.1 cm and ESS was 6.7 ± 3.01, 5.1 ± 2.1 for group 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between snoring and GH. There was no significant relationship between all investigated parameters and fetal outcome. We found that excessive weight gain during pregnancy is significantly associated with snoring. Conclusion: We concluded that, although pregnant women, especially who gain excessive weight during their pregnancy, significantly snore more than nonpregnant women, this did not affect fetal outcome. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Background: Anecdotal reports of sleep disturbance during pregnancy are abundant; however, objective measurement of sleep changes has so far produced conflicting results. Aims: To objectively measure sleep architecture and investigate subjective sleep quality in the first and third trimester of pregnancy, when compared to the nonpregnant state. Methods: Twenty-seven women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 21 women in the first trimester of pregnancy and 24 nonpregnant control women underwent overnight polysomnography and completed questionnaires regarding sleep quality and mood. Results: Women in the third trimester of pregnancy had poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, less stage 4 sleep, more stage 1 sleep and fewer minutes in rapid eye movement sleep when compared to the control group. Cortical arousals were seen more often during pregnancy, particularly in response to respiratory events and limb movements. Sleep during the first trimester was affected to a lesser extent, with more wake time after sleep onset and less stage 4 sleep when compared to the controls. Conclusions: Sleep during pregnancy is compromised by higher amounts of wake and cortical arousals leading to sleep fragmentation, with greater amounts of light sleep and less deep sleep. Mood state did not have an effect on sleep. Given the impact of sleep on well-being, this study increases our understanding of the characteristics of sleep during pregnancy, to help recognise when severe sleep disruption may warrant referral to a specialist for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. © 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Background. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring and asthma are known comorbid conditions in men and non-pregnant women. This comorbidity has not been evaluated among pregnant women. We assessed the habitual snoring-asthma relationship among pregnant women. Methods. A cohort of women (N = 1335) were interviewed during pregnancy, and we ascertained participants' asthma status and collected information about habitual snoring, before and during pregnancy. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. Compared with non-asthmatics, the adjusted OR among asthmatics for snoring before pregnancy was 2.13 (95% CI 1.10-4.12). The odds of snoring during early pregnancy was 1.79-fold (OR = 1.79; 95% C; 1.07-3.01). Associations were more pronounced among overweight (≥25 kg/m2) asthmatics (OR = 5.39; 95% CI 2.27-12.75). Conclusions. We report a cross-sectional association of habitual snoring and asthma among pregnant women. If confirmed, pregnant asthmatics may benefit from more vigilant screening and management of OSA or habitual snoring during pregnancy. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n = 118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 34:7-19, 2011.

N2  - Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) has two main properties, the presence of co-ordinated bursts of activity, indicative of many nerve fibres firing at a similar time, and entrainment of the bursts to the cardiac cycle, due to inhibitory input from baroreceptors to a network of cell groups within the CNS. Although this patterning is used as a 'gold standard' for the identification of successful nerve recordings, the maturation of these basic features of SNA from fetal life to adulthood has not been investigated. Using a telemetry-based nerve amplifier, renal SNA (RSNA) was recorded in preterm (99 ± 1 days gestation; term 147 days) and near-term fetal sheep (119 ± 0 days gestation), without anaesthesia or paralysis, and contrasted with RSNA recorded in adult sheep. All three age groups showed a classic bursting pattern of RSNA and co-ordination of bursts with the cardiac cycle. However, the delay between diastole and the next peak in RSNA was longest in preterm fetuses (319 ± 1 ms), compared with near-term fetuses (250 ± 13 ms), and shortest in the adult sheep (174 ± 38 ms). This was independent of the maturational decrease in heart rate. The near-term fetuses showed a marked but sleep-state-dependent increase in resting RSNA compared with preterm fetuses. Although entrainment with the pressure pulse suggests that the intricate circuitry within the CNS is developed in the preterm fetus, the decrease in the length of the delay suggests continuing maturation of this key feature of RSNA in the last third of gestation and after birth. © 2010 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the course of pregnancy and on fetal development. There are few studies investigating the outcome of stress reduction interventions on maternal well-being and obstetric outcome. Aims: This study aims (1) to obtain fetal behavioral states (quiet/active sleep, quiet/active wakefulness), (2) to investigate the effects of maternal relaxation on fetal behavior as well as on uterine activity, and (3) to investigate maternal physiological and endocrine parameters as potential underlying mechanisms for maternal-fetal relaxation-transferral. Study design: The behavior of 33 fetuses was analyzed during laboratory relaxation/quiet rest (control group, CG) and controlled for baseline fetal behavior. Potential associations between relaxation/quiet rest and fetal behavior (fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR variation, FHR acceleration, and body movements) and uterine activity were studied, using a computerized cardiotocogram (CTG) system. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and norepinephrine were measured. Results: Intervention (progressive muscle relaxation, PMR, and guided imagery, GI) showed changes in fetal behavior. The intervention groups had higher long-term variation during and after relaxation compared to the CG (p=.039). CG fetuses had more FHR acceleration, especially during and after quiet rest (p=.027). Women in the PMR group had significantly more uterine activity than women in the GI group (p=.011) and than CG women. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones were not associated with fetal behavior. Conclusions: This study indicates that the fetus might participate in maternal relaxation and suggests that GI is superior to PMR. This could especially be true for women who tend to direct their attention to body sensations such as abdominal activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Case Report: A 47 years old Caucasian woman presented with 2 months history of headache associated with nausea and vomiting. Pain was confined to a well circumscribed circular area about the size of a dollar coin in the left posterior tempero-parietal region. It was a continuous burning pain with 7/10 intensity and often disturbing her sleep. Sound, light, hot weather and strong odours aggravated the headache, while rest and staying in cool environment decreased the intensity. She denied history of preceding trauma. Past medical history included well controlled hypertension. Neurological exam was completely normal. Local examination of the scalp did not reveal any abnormality except for focal tenderness in the affected area. Pregnancy was ruled out and MRI of the brain was normal. Nummular headache (NH) was diagnosed based on the criteria by International Headache Society, 2004 (please see table). Indomethacin and Gabapentin were started, which promptly relieved her headaches. NH is a benign chronic form of headache, first described by Pareja et al., in the year 2002. Though similar cases have been reported since then, the etio-pathogenesis is not precisely known. Many authors believe the pain is epicranial, which means the origin of pain is from internal and external layers of skull and scalp including its nerves and arteries. As the diagnosis of NH still remains a diagnosis of exclusion, a thorough neurological examination, pertaining laboratory work up and neuro imaging to rule out structural lesions are very important. A variety of treatment options such as NSAIDS, gabapentin, botoulinum toxin and local infiltration of lidocaine have been proposed and tried with inconsistent results. As more and more cases are being reported, the mysteries of this condition may be revealed in the future.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy is associated with alteration in sleep patterns and quality. We wished to investigate whether pregnant women have a higher likelihood of a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women ages 18-45 years (n = 4074) presenting for delivery, and non-pregnant women ages 18-45 years (n = 490) presenting for outpatient surgery provided demographic information and completed the Berlin Questionnaire evaluating self-reported snoring and daytime sleepiness. For the pregnant patients, the infant's birth weight and Apgar scores were also recorded. Results: Of the 1439 patients with a positive Berlin Questionnaire, 96 were in the non-pregnant control population versus 1343 in the pregnant population (20% vs. 33%, respectively, P < 0.001; odds ratio 2.0 [95% CI: 1.6-2.5]). There was a positive correlation between infant weight and a positive Berlin Questionnaire. The incidence of preeclampsia was greater (odds ratio 3.9) in the pregnant patients with a positive Berlin Questionnaire as compared with the parturients with a negative Berlin Questionnaire (odds ratio 1.1). Conclusion: Parturients are more likely to have a positive Berlin Questionnaire than non-pregnant women. This may indicate an increased likelihood of sleep disordered breathing. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Women are subject to depression during pregnancy in the childbearing age, which is associated with serious complications for the mother, infant and the family. Its cause is not known. Many studies have the effect of psychosocial factors in this regard but there is meager information on the biological grounds. Recently, sleep disorder has been on the focus as causing depression. This study was conducted to determine the relation between sleep disorder at early mid second trimester and depression at later stage in pregnancy. Materials and Methods: This prospective describe-analytical study was conducted on the population of women admitted to the Tamin Ejtemaee Health Center in Hamadden city,Iran in 2010. The study sample included161 normal ( non depressed confirmed by the beck test ) pregnant woman who were selected by convenient nonprobability methods. With a gestational age of 28-30 weeks, they were divided into two groups of sleep disorder and normal sleep by The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionare.They was homogenized as for the confounders. On 38-40 weeks, they completed the beck Questionare. The relationship between their depression and sleep disorder was assessed. Chisquare, t-test, Mann Whitney, vcramer and logistic regression were used in spss to analyze the obatained data. Results: 11.4 % of women with normal sleep and 56.2 % of women with sleep disorder were found depressed on 38-40 weeks and sleep disorder had increased the chances of depression by 9 times (p< 0.001). Conclusion: Findings revealed that sleep quality at early third trimester in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy. It suggests that screening for sleep problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Studies in the general population have suggested a link between sleep disorders and systemic inflammation. We sought to investigate the correlation between sleep duration, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and serum proinflammatory cytokines in a cohort of pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Participants in a prospective observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI>30 kg/m2) underwent overnight sleep studies testing for OSA using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA), recording nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movement. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod). Serum was collected between 10 and 19 weeks', stored at -70C, and analyzed in duplicate for levels of IL-6r, TNFár and sICAM. Short sleep duration was defined as <7 hours of total sleep per night. Data were analyzed using chi square, student T and Mann Whitney U tests; p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Ninety-nine of 101 women had complete data. The prevalence of confirmed short sleep duration, and OSA were 48.5, and 6.6%, respectively. Women with short sleep were similar to those without short sleep in age (29 vs. 34 years, p=0.7), BMI (40.7±8 vs. 38±5 kg/m2, p=0.2) and percent body fat, (42±5 vs. 43±5%, p=0.3). They had higher rates of hypertension (70 vs. 34%, p=0.006), but similar rates of diabetes (33 vs. 30%, p= 0.5) and metabolic syndrome (25 vs. 13%, p=0.2). The short sleep duration group had higher serum IL-6 (37,179±13,527 vs. 34,323±9,902 pg/mL, p=0.06), sICAM (284±97 vs. 239±58 ng/mL, p=0.02) and TNF r1 (1,605±349 pg/mL vs. 1,449±243, p=0.04) levels. This difference did not hold true for individuals with OSA when compared with those who did not have OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Among obese pregnant women, short sleep was prevalent and associated with an increase in serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These findings indicate that short sleep duration during pregnancy may be associated with immune dysregulation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The term sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) describes a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or quality of ventilation during sleep, resulting in hypoxia and nocturnal arousals. While it has been theorized that physiologic and hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may contribute to an increased risk for SDB, few studies have objectively evaluated trends in SDB during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to objectively assess SDB across pregnancy in a cohort of high-risk women. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia were invited to participate in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch- PAT100, a wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SDB. Participants were asked to wear the device in early pregnancy (0-20 weeks) and again in the third trimester (≥28 weeks). Breathing abnormalities during sleep were characterized by the respiratory disturbance (RDI), apnea hypoxia (AHI), and oxygen desaturation (ODI) indices obtained from the Watch-PAT100. The presence of SDB was defined as an apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) of≥5. Differences in sleep characteristics between the baseline and third trimester assessment were compared using the paired t-test and McNemar test as appropriate. RESULTS: 62 women completed both the baseline and third trimester sleep study. The mean gestational ages at the baseline and third trimester evaluations were 16.6 weeks±4.2 and 32.3 weeks±2.1 weeks, respectively. Mean RDI, AHI and ODI scores all increased significantly in the third trimester (Table). The incidence of SDB increased from 27.4% at baseline to 46.8% in the third trimester (p=.004). CONCLUSIONS: SDB occurs frequently among high-risk women and increases significantly as pregnancy progresses. Further research is needed to determine the association of SDB with maternal and neonatal health. (Table presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity (BMI≥ 30) is a major risk factor for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Overweight individuals who do not meet the criteria for obesity (BMI 25-29.9) may also be at increased risk, but may not screen positive on standard screening protocols, and theprevalence of SDB in this population is not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between prepregnancy BMI and SDB in pregnant women, and in particular those women who do not meet the criteria for obesity. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia were invited to participate in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch- PAT100, a wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SDB. Participants were asked to wear the device in early pregnancy (0-20 weeks). Breathing abnormalities during sleep were characterized by the respiratory disturbance (RDI), apnea hypoxia (AHI), and oxygen desaturation (ODI) indices obtained from the Watch- PAT100. The presence of SDB was defined as an AHI of ≥ 5. Mean values of the indices, as well as the frequency of SDB were compared among normal weight (NW, BMI < 25) overweight (OW, BMI 25- 29.9) and Obese (OB, BMI≥ 30) individuals using ANOVA and chisquare tests, respectively. RESULTS: 95 women completed the sleep study. The mean gestational age at the time of the sleep study was 16.8 weeks± 3.9 weeks, and the mean pre-pregnancy BMI was 32.2 ± 8.6. The frequency of SDB for the population was 26.3%. Mean RDI, AHI and ODI values by BMI category are shown in the Table. Index values were significantly different among the groups, with post-hoc testing demonstrating that OWand OB women had significantly higher values thanNWwomen. Similarly,OWand OB women had a significantly higher frequency of SDB than NW women. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to NW women, OW and OB pregnant womenhave higher RDI, AHI andODIvalues and are at increased risk of SDB. Using a cut-off BMI of ≥ 30 to screen for SDB in pregnancy may lead to under-diagnosis. Table: Watch-PAT results by BMI category.(Table presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea (SA). While these screening tests have a high sensitivity and specificity in nonpregnant individuals, these tools may not be as accurate during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the BQ and ESS in screening for SA during pregnancy, and to determine whether a simpler screening method would be more accurate. STUDY DESIGN: High-risk women (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) were recruited to complete a sleep survey, comprised of the BQ and ESS, and to participate in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SA. The presence of SA was defined as an apnea hypoxia index (AHI) of≥5. In addition to evaluating theBQand ESS, we assessed the performance of a 2 question approach in which patients were considered to be screen positive if their pre-pregnancy BMI was≥25 and they reported snoring. The performance of the BQ, ESS, and a two-question approach (BMI and snoring) were assessed through the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Complete sleep survey and WP100 data was available for 86 women. Area under the curve (AUC) data from the ROC for the BQ, BQ+ESS and the two-question approach are shown in the Table. The two-question approach performed better than the BQ, the BQ +ESS combined, and performed better than the null hypothesis (AUC=0.5). The sensitivity and specificity of the BQ were 35% (95% CI 17%, 57%) and 69% (95% CI 55%, 79%), respectively. The twoquestion approach had a much better sensitivity 74% (95% CI 51%, 89%) without sacrificing much specificity 59% (95% CI 46%, 71%). CONCLUSIONS: Standard screening tools for SA are not adequate in pregnancy. A simpler approach, using pre-pregnancy BMI and selfreported snoring, yields better results. Further studies are needed to design and test the most appropriate screening tool for SA in pregnant women. (Table presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In non-pregnant populations short sleep durations have been associated with an activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. In pregnancy, altered inflammatory responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia and preterm birth. There are few data regarding the relationship between poor sleep and inflammation in pregnancy. Our objective was to describe the relationship between short sleep duration and the lower genital tract (LGT) inflammatory milieu in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: At<16 weeks, healthy women with singleton pregnancies (n=235) underwent a standard pelvic examination and self-reported sleep duration. Women were categorized as having a short sleep duration (SSD) if they reported sleeping < 5 hours per night, normal sleep durations (NSD) if they reported sleeping between 5-9 hours per night and long sleep durations (LSD) if they reported sleeping ≥ 10 hours/night. Cervical cytokine concentrations (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IL4, IL10 and IL 13) were assayed. Factor analysis performed on the cytokines identified 2 primary cytokine patterns, PROinflammatory and ANTI-inflammatory. For the analysis women with SSD were compared to those with NSD. RESULTS: In the cohort, 12 women met criteria for SSD (6.5%). The table describes the relationship between SSD and PRO scores. SSD during pregnancy may be associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response in the LGT. Results were similar after adjustment for race, smoking status and BMI. Analysis of ANTI scores did not reveal any distinctive relationships with sleep. CONCLUSIONS: SSD during pregnancy may be associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response in the LGT. Further studies with greater power are needed to explore this possible mechanism connecting sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes (Table presented).

N2  - Background The role of men in the childbearing decision process and the factors that influence mens childbearing intentions have been relatively unexplored in the literature. This study aimed to describe the factors that strongly influence the childbearing intentions of men and to describe differences in these factors according to mens age group. Methods A telephone survey (response rate 84) was conducted with 495 men between the ages of 20 and 45 living in an urban setting who, at the time of contact, did not have biological children. Men were asked about what factors strongly influence their intention to have children. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to determine if these factors were significantly associated with age.Results:Of those sampled, 86 of men reported that at some point in the future they planned to become a parent. The factors that men considered to be most influential in their childbearing intentions were: the need to be financially secure, their partners interest/desire to have children, their partners suitability to be a parent and their personal interest/desire to have children. Men who were 3545 years old had lower odds of stating that financial security (crude OR: 0.32, 95 CI: 0.180.54) and partners interest in having children (crude OR: 0.57, 95 CI: 0.330.99) were very influential, but had higher odds of stating that their biological clock (crude OR: 4.37, 95 CI: 1.7810.76) was very influential in their childbearing intentions than men in the 2024 year age group.Conclusions:The factors that influence mens intentions about when to become a parent may change with age. Understanding what influences men to have children, and what they understand about reproductive health is important for education, program and policy development. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the cardiovascular phenotype of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women undergoing nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of pregnant women with PSG confirmed OSA at an urban academic center from years 2007-2009. Pregnant women were the study group and nonpregnant reproductive age women served as the comparative group. Subjects underwent standard PSG. The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and OSA severity was determined using American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria.Sustained (>30 seconds) cardiac arrhythmias were recorded. Data were analyzed with chi square, Mann Whitney U and student t test. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: This cohort consisted of 57 pregnant women and 1254 nonpregnant women. Pregnant women with OSA, compared to the nonpregnant women, were younger (38±8 vs. 29±6 years, p=0.004), more likely to be African American (50 vs. 69%, p=0.007) and less likely to have commercial insurance (28 v 13%, p=0.001) but they had similar BMI (46 vs. 47kg/m2, p=0.8), and rates of chronic hypertension (37 vs. 12%, p=0.9) and diabetes (16 vs. 15, p=0.85). Compared to the nonpregnant group, the pregnant women had a similar median (interquartile range) AHI:12 (7-22) vs. 16(8-35) events/hour, p=0.5) and lowest recorded oxygen saturation (SpO2): 87 (81-89) vs. 85 (75- 88)%p=0.078 but the overall SpO2 was slightly higher 96 (95-97) vs. 95(94-97) %, p=0.002. They were more likely to have severe sleep apnea (27 vs. 11%, p=0.001) but they had similar arrhythmia rates (25 vs. 22, p=0.8). The pregnant women were more likely to respond to hypoxemia with tachycardia (17 vs. 62%, p<0.001) but were less likely to have premature ventricular contractions than nonpregnant women (66 vs. 37%, p=0.04). There were no cases of maternal bradycardia in the pregnant group, compared to 7% in the nonpregnant group. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women had less frequent comorbid conditions than nonpregnant women but were more likely to have severe OSA. Occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias was similar between the two groups.

N2  - Background: Over the last decade, Northeastern Maine has suffered a serious prescription-opiate epidemic. The present study examined infant outcomes in low-SES, opiate-dependent, pregnant women from a hospital-based methadone clinic. Objective: The goal was to determine the impact of substance abuse on newborn development and the effects of management via traditional Narcotics Treatment Program (NTP) clinic. Methods: Sleep was assessed in hospital via actigraphy and videography. Infant neurocognition, using the auditory oddball paradigm event-related potential (ERP), was measured at 1 and 7 months of age. Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered at 9 months of age. Maternal biologic and clinical assessments of polysubstance use and psychopathology were determined during pregnancy. Results: Abnormal ERP and sleep fragmentation were associated with later admission to the narcotic treatment program (NTP) and prenatal physiologic anxiety. ERP and Bayley Scale deficits were associated with maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Our previous work has reported s a relationship between alcohol consumption during pregnancy, SF, and reduced REM sleep. Conclusion: Women who abuse opiates have rates of alcohol abuse similar to low-SES groups. Opiate abuse during pregnancy and maternal anxiety were associated with newborn sleep abnormalities and neurocognitive performance. ERP and Bayley Scales were similarly adversely affected by prenatal alcohol. Admission to NTP as early as possible is clearly beneficial, but polysubstance abuse cannot be ignored. Programs should address this problem. Both SF and abnormal ERPs suggest delayed development of the CNS and potential problems with learning.

N2  - All adult mammals examined thus far exhibit sleep bout durations that follow an exponential distribution and wake bout durations that follow a power-law distribution. In altricial rodents such as rats and mice, exponential distributions of sleep bouts are found soon after birth, but the power-law distribution of wake bouts does not emerge until the third postnatal week. Also, both sleep and bouts consolidate across the early postnatal period. It is not known whether similar developmental processes occur in precocial species during the prenatal period. Here we characterize sleep-wake development in a precocial species, the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), from 114 to 148 days gestational age (DGA). Sleep and wake bout durations exhibited exponential distributions throughout the fetal period with some evidence of an emerging exponential-to-power-law transition for wake bouts toward the end of gestation. Both sleep and wake bouts consolidated in an orderly fashion across development and there was little evidence of circadian variation, even in the oldest subjects. These results indicate that similar patterns of sleep-wake organization are found prenatally in a precocial species as are found postnatally in altricial species. Data from more species are needed to fully realize the benefits of a developmental comparative approach for understanding the forces that have shaped the ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian sleep. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The goals of this study were to assess: (a) the involvement of fathers and mothers in overall and nighttime infant caregiving; (b) the links between paternal involvement in infant care and infant sleep patterns during the first 6 months. Fifty-six couples recruited during their first pregnancy, participated in the study. After delivery (1 and 6 months), both parents completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Mothers were significantly more involved than fathers in daytime and nighttime caregiving. A higher involvement of fathers in overall infant care predicted and was associated with fewer infant night-wakings and with shorter total sleep time after controlling for breastfeeding. The findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental sleep research. Future studies should explore mechanisms underlying the relations between paternal involvement and infant sleep.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment in part through preventing alcohol-induced alterations in NMDA gene expressiON Given the role of cytokines and chemokines on NMDA receptors, we evaluated a panel in a model of FAS to evaluate their role and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8(E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines and chemokines were measured using a microspherebased multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis,P<.05 significant. RESULTS: After 6h the chemokine KC and IL-6 levels were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median 15.7,range 10.1- 45.9pg/ml) and KC (median 45.9,range 32.5-99.1pg/ml). Embryos exposed to alcohol+NAP+SAL,had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P<.003), similar to control. Alcohol exposure resulted in elevated levels of G-CSF, treatment with NAP+SAL prevented the alcoholinduced increase (all P<.003). IL-13 and IL-1b were decreased 6h after alcohol exposure, exposure to alcohol+NAP+SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18 (10d after exposure), these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (RANTES, TNF-a, IFN-g, IL4) were not detectable at either timepoint in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL6, G-CSF and the chemokine KC which are known to affect NMDA receptors. NAP+SAL treatment prevented alcoholinduced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP+SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with mental retardation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides (NAP+SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced damage in FAS including fetal death, growth abnormalities and learning impairment. Fractalkine, a chemokine constitutively expressed in neurons throughout the CNS, has a role in neuroprotection reducing neuronal death from activated microglia. Using a model of FAS we evaluated if fractalkine is altered in FAS and if the neuroprotective peptides NAP+SAL work through preventing alterations in fractalkine. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 (E8) with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo or alcohol+peptides. Embryos were harvested 24h later on gestational day 9 and 10 days later at E18. Fractalkine was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP, Millipore, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis with P P< .05 significant. RESULTS: Six hours after alcohol exposure, fractalkine levels were signficantly elevated(median 341pg/ml, range 263-424pg/ml) vs controls (median 228pg/ml, range 146-332pg/ml; P P< .001; Figure). Embryos treated with alcohol and the peptides NAP+SAL prevented the alcohol induced increase in fractalkine (median 137, range 97-255 pg/ml, P< .001). At E18 (10d after exposure), fractalkine levels were similar in all groups (medians 1821, 1852 and 2013 pg/ml respectively, P=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in elevation of the neuroprotective chemokine fractalkine, perhaps in an effort to counter the alcohol toxicity. Treatment with the peptides NAP+SAL along with the alcohol prevents the acute increase in fractalkine.(Figure presented).

N2  - CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care pediatrician with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, "I hate having to go to the nurse's office to take my albuterol!" His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is afraid to "poison his body with so many chemicals." She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new doctor is "cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician."Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo's condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy, she induced her son's asthma.Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a nonallergenic pillow and bed cover.Gerardo's mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother reported that he was soaked in water and stated, "He knows that he will get sick with asthma if he gets wet!" She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend's birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his "weak lungs." She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Data from prospectively recorded 10 twin sets, born prematurely (mean 36 gestational week; range 33 - 38 GW) in the Split University Hospital Center, were analysed. We compared sleep architecture parameters in the twins at 37th and 44th postmenstrual age (PMA) with parameters that were expected at that PMA. The same parameters were compared within each twin pair using the Man Whitne test. At first measurement indeterminate sleep (IS) proportion was greater in the first twin than in the second one. The IS sleep proportion was 1.6 fold greater in the first twin (p=0.028), and 1,8 fold less percentage of quite sleep (QS) than the second twin (p=0.054). The length of sleep stages among the twins was similar at the second measurement. Measures of sleep architecture were not significantly different within the twins in second recording. The results of this study obtained on a relatively small number of twins (longer IS and shorter QS in the first twin at the 38th week recordings), showed that the maturational differences among twins exist in utero and shortly after birth, and then disappear until the end of the first month of the postnatal life.

N2  - Background: Labor results in the release of sensitizing substances such as progesterone, prostaglandins, cytokines and cortisol, some of which have been observed to participate in sleep regulation. We hypothesized that these substances could affect sleep regulation and therefore the amount of volatile agent required to provide general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Methods: A total of 50 patients were enrolled, of whom 25 had uterine activity less than 30 Montevideo units (Prelabor group) and 25 had uterine activity greater than 80 Montevideo units (Labor group). Anesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in nitrous oxide with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to sustain a constant Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-55. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels were evaluated immediately before cesarean delivery. Results: End-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane in the Prelabor group were higher than in the Labor group with similar Bispectral Index values. No significant differences were found in prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels between the two groups. Conclusion: Anesthetic requirements for sevoflurane, as measured by Bispectral Index, decrease in laboring versus non-laboring parturients undergoing cesarean delivery. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol do not appear to be responsible for this observation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in neonatal period may cause neurological impairment, epilepsy, and lead to stroke. It is caused primarily by coagulopathy of numerous reasons, occasionally perinatal asphyxia, traumatic delivery and hyper homocysteinemia. Dandy-Walker malformation is characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. Dandy-Walker malformation, variant, and mega cisterna magna represent a spectrum of developmental anomalies. Insults to developing cerebellar hemispheres and the fourth ventricle are believed to be the cause of malformation. Our patient was born from non complicated pregnancy, non complicated non traumatic vaginal delivery at term, excellent Apgar scores, without peculiarities in clinical status. She was brest-fed by the 42nd hour of life when she had rightsided seizures during sleep that repeated for five times in next 24 hours. Brain Ultrasound (US) revealed clot in left lateral ventricle, slight dilatation of left ventricle, both sided periventricular echodensity, ischemia, slight enlargement of forth ventricle and a bit smaller cerebellum. There was no visible flow through left transverse, superior sagittal and straight sinus. Magnetic Resonance (MRI) confirmed the finding and showed thrombosis of left and right transverse venous sinuses and confluence of sinuses. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed left sided focal changes. The newborn was treated with phenobarbiton for 8 days and had no convulsions during that period. All coagulation parameters, homocistein, lipoproteins (a) and D-dimers were normal. There were no mutations on FV R506Q, PT 20210A, MTHFR 677C/T. No antiphospholipides were found. Heart US showed no structural anomalies. No other patology or risk factors were present at the time. Before discharge, US showed hydrocephalus. Flow in affected sinuses was visible with color Doppler. MRI showed recanalization of affected sinuses, also hydrocephalus and presentation of Dandy Walker. On EEG there was borderline finding. Due to progression of hydrocephalus ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed. In age of 1 year EEG was slower for age but without focus. Neurological development was normal for age. The question is whether this child had intrauterine insult and inception of Dandy Walker with further postnatal progress of thrombosis and evolution to full picture of Dandy Walker with hydrocephalus OR thrombosis that led to development of hydrocephalus and Dandy Walker malformation in this child were accidental coexistance.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the characteristics of respiratory events in preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea at or beyond 35 weeks postmenstrual age and to compare these findings with a group of preterm infants ready for discharge, without clinically concerning apnoea. Methods: Infants born at <32 weeks of gestation and who underwent nap polysomnography at or beyond 35 weeks corrected age prior to discharge were included. Cases were preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea, and control infants were preterm infants asymptomatic for apnoea. Infants with upper airway obstruction, congenital malformations or apnoea associated with sepsis were excluded. Studies were retrospectively reviewed for length, type and frequency of apnoea. The relationship between sleep state and changes in oxygen saturation was compared between groups. Peri-natal and demographic data were also compared. Results: Data were complete for 16 case and 18 control infants. Gestational age was similar at birth and at time of study, but cases had a lower birth weight (p = 0.04) and higher weight at study (p = 0.04). There were no group differences in the mean duration, type or numbers of apnoea. The duration of the longest apnoea was greater in case infants (17.4 s vs. 12.3 s, p = 0.02). Lowest oxygen saturation (p < 0.05) and average minimum oxygen saturation (p < 0.05) were lower in case infants. Conclusions: Preterm infants with clinically concerning apnoea have similar amounts and types of apnoea but lower oxygen saturation after apnoea compared with controls. The use of oxygen saturation monitoring is more useful than respiratory monitoring alone in recognising these events. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Migraine has been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant migraineurs. A cohort of 1,334 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of migraine. Approximately 19.4% of the cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26). Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight migraineurs. These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep disorders among migraineurs; and extends the literature to include pregnant women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent migraine-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

N2  - The modern living standard has imposed upon society a situation of chronic sleep deprivation. This chronic loss of sleep affects women more than it does men. As a result, the postponement of pregnancy has become a common choice due to the priority given to social and domestic activities. For women, pregnancy represents a condition of intense physical and physiological changes that subject the pregnant woman to a number of potentially stressful situations, ultimately interfering with their quality of sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation, along with the changes imposed on women through pregnancy, can lead to several harmful consequences for the pregnant woman and the child, and can potentially undermine the mother-infant relationship. This article discusses circumstances under which sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality during pregnancy could result in damage to the mother-infant relationship, specifically through maternal fatigue, postpartum depression and changes in pregnancy-related hormonal secretions and activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Circadian rhythms and clock gene expression are involved in successful reproductive cycles, mating, and pregnancy. Alterations or disruptions of biological rhythms, as commonly occurs in shift work, jet lag, sleep deprivation, or clock gene knock out models, are linked to significant disruptions in reproductive function. These impairments include altered hormonal secretion patterns, reduced conception rates, increased miscarriage rates and an increased risk of breast cancer. Female health may be particularly susceptible to the impact of desynchronizing work schedules as perturbed hormonal rhythms can further influence the expression patterns of clock genes. Estrogen modifies clock gene expression in the uterus, ovaries, and suprachiasmatic nucleus, the site of the primary circadian clock mechanism. Further work investigating clock genes, light exposure, ovarian hormones, and reproductive function will be critical for indentifying how these factors interact to impact health and susceptibility to disease. © 2010 Megan M.

N2  - Objective: This exploratory study examines the role of psychosocial-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) at 14-20 weeks of gestation. Method: One hundred and twenty women were enrolled into the study. Blood samples were collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Participants completed questionnaires that included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, the Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety (PAS) Scale, the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test, the Brief COPE scale, and questions regarding violence/abuse, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns. Results: Pregnant women with high CRH levels (15 pcg/ml and above) perceived their income to be inadequate, slept more hours at night, stood more hours during the day, and used the coping styles of disengagement or religion but not humor. Logistic regression identified three predictors for high CRH (accounting for 42.2% of the variance): perceived inadequacy of income and the use of "religion" and "disengagement" to cope with stress. Conclusions: These results are the first known to identify coping style and perceived income inadequacy as predictors of high CRH. Women with perceived inadequacy of income had almost three times the odds for high CRH. Women who used religion or disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7 times the odds for high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are associated with preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include maternal coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future investigations of CRH levels and PTB. © The Author(s) 2010.

N2  - Background: The ability to be entrained directly by the 24-hour light/dark cycle does not occur in humans until 12 months after conception; however, melatonin receptors are functional by at least the third trimester. A function of melatonin is for the mother to have a chronobiologic effect on the developing baby via placental transfer and breast milk (see 1 for further references). About 1-5% of people are low melatonin producers. It is therefore critical that low levels of melatonin, even in breast milk, are sufficient for entrainment. Totally blind people are a group of subjects ideally suited for testing the chronobiologic effects of low doses of melatonin. Methods: 1) Ten totally blind free-running adults were given melatonin (in the evening); the dose was stepped up or down, in order to detect the lowest entraining dose. Doses were between 0.02 and 0.3 mg, which were within the physiological range. In a follow-up study, a subject was given 0.01 mg, which produces levels of melatonin lower than made by most people at night. Data are reported here for the first time for all 11 subjects. 2) A Portland, Oregon patient, with recurrent summer depression (and winter hypomania) has been treated with 0.3 mg of melatonin (taken in the afternoon so as to prevent a phase-delay in circadian rhythms with respect to the sleep/wake cycle) since April 1, 2010, at least 2 months before he was expected to become depressed. When initiated after the patient had become depressed the prior summer, this treatment was not effective, nor were any of the numerous trials of medication combinations typically used to treat bipolar II (and unipolar) depression. Results: 1) All blind subjects entrained to a daily dose of melatonin. The resulting dose-response curve was log-linear and statistically significant [r(9)=0.67, p=0.02]. 2) As of Aug. 25, 2010, 2-3 months after the usual start of his seasonal depression, he remains euthymic. Discussion: 1) Since free-running blind people can be entrained to doses of melatonin as low as 0.01 mg, then endogenous levels of melatonin in the fetus - and even in the suckling infant - through maternal transfer in the blood and breast milk, respectively, could be important as a 24-hour timing signal for optimal embryonic, fetal and later development. Low melatonin production in the mother might therefore be a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of autism (1) or other disorders linked to early development (such as schizophrenia), as well as affect subsequent quality of life. Therefore, restoring maternal melatonin levels to normal should be a safe and effective treatment for entraining the fetus and the “fourth trimester” infant to the 24-hour day. The maternal ontogenic melatonin (MOM) hypothesis can be easily tested by first determining if mothers of afflicted individuals who are low melatonin producers [or carry mutations of the (ASMT) gene that determines the amount of melatonin production] are more prevalent than in the general population. If so, in a prospective study, melatonin can then be safely given to pregnant and nursing low melatonin-producing mothers who are also at risk for giving birth to afflicted children. 2) Although only a single case report, the fact that this patient did not become depressed this year (apparently in response to low-dose melatonin) has several implications. One, phase-delayed (and not phase-advanced) circadian misalignment seems to be the most common biological rhythm abnormality in winter, non-seasonal and now perhaps summer depression. Two, according to the biopsychosocial(environmental) model, clinical efficacy was achieved only when treatment was given to prevent occurrence of depression; once depression occurs, it is understandable that even if the biological precipitant is corrected, the other subsequent causes and manifestations of depression are not easily or quickly reversible. Three, agents that can cause corrective phase advances (or prevent phase delays, such as morning bright light and low-dose afternoon/evening melatonin, can potentially be used to treat many types of seasonal and non-seasonal depression, as well as other co-morbid disorders. Four, perhaps this patient delayed each summer because his intrinsic period might be <24 hours (and, therefore, he cues to the later dusk of longer days). Because low-dose melatonin in particular is safe, convenient and inexpensive and because the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) collected at home or in the sleep lab may become the first useful biological test in psychiatry, all of these factors bode well for low-dose melatonin and the phase shift and MOM hypotheses to have a major impact in clinical medicine.

N2  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change as female mammals transition from one reproductive state to another. The mechanisms responsible for this plasticity are poorly understood. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals, and a large portion of its efferent projections terminate in the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ), which also plays important roles in rhythm regulation. To determine whether these regions might mediate changes in overt rhythms during early pregnancy, we first compared rhythms in Fos and Per2 protein expression in the SCN and vSPZ of diestrous and early pregnant rats maintained in a 12:12-h light/dark (LD) cycle. No differences in the Fos rhythm were seen in the SCN core, but in the SCN shell, elevated Fos expression was maintained throughout the light phase in pregnant, but not diestrous, rats. In the vSPZ, the Fos rhythm was bimodal in diestrous rats, but this rhythm was lost in pregnant rats. Peak Per2 expression was phase-advanced by 4 h in the SCN of pregnant rats, and some differences in Per2 expression were found in the vSPZ as well. To determine whether differences in Fos expression were due to altered responsivity to light, we next characterized light-induced Fos expression in the SCN and vSPZ of pregnant and diestrous rats in the mid-subjective day and night. We found that the SCN core of the two groups responded in the same way at each time of day, whereas the rhythm of Fos responsivity in the SCN shell and vSPZ differed between diestrous and pregnant rats. These results indicate that the SCN and vSPZ are functionally re-organized during early pregnancy, particularly in how they respond to the photic environment. These changes may contribute to changes in overt behavioral and physiological rhythms that occur at this time. © 2010 IBRO.

N2  - Introduction: Relationship between major risk factors of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and of sleep disorders in the infants was examined in the series of own studies. Findings: SIDS babies had less developmental stimulation and a less well-organized environment, were less often put to sleep at the same time at night, were less ready for bedtime, and fell asleep more often in the parental bed (Kelmanson, 1993). Future SIDS victims more often woke up from sleep (Kelmanson & Adulas, 2004, 2006). Poorer micro-environmental characteristics were associated with less rhythmic infant behavior (Kelmanson et al., 2002). Other well-known SIDS risk factors are pre-term delivery and infant's low birth weight (LBW). Young LBW infants have longer average total sleep duration, principally due to longer night sleep. Parents of LBW infants more often rated them as sleeping too long and falling asleep while being transported. Although LBW infants were often ready to fall asleep at bedtime, they more frequently needed parents in the room and were more often put into parental bed beforehand (Kelmanson & Adulas, 2002). Maternal smoking during pregnancy is an important SIDS risk factor. The odds ratio on infant bedtime problems, including irregular sleep, associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, was equal to 2.75 [95% CI = 1.15-6.58] (Kelmanson, 2009). Changes in sleep integrity and altered arousal mechanisms observed in infants exposed to tobacco smoke have been repeatedly implicated in explanations for SIDS. Epidemiological data are indicative that high risk of SIDS is associated with the practice to put baby to sleep in parental bed. Infant-parent(s) bed sharing has been associated with more common maternal reports of disturbed night sleep. Compared with the solitary sleeping infants, mothers of the bed-sharing babies described them as more often struggling at bedtime, sleeping too little, waking more than twice during the night, and requiring parental help to fall asleep after waking. Mothers also reported bed-sharing infants as more frequently suddenly falling asleep in the middle of daytime activities. More common maternal reports on noisy breathing during sleep in the bed-sharing babies compared with the solitary sleeping ones were also found (Kelmanson, 2008). Conclusion: Risk factors of SIDS and infant sleep disturbances largely overlap. As an attempt to fix sleep problems, some inexperienced parents may try infant-rearing practices that may only aggravate sleep troubles and lead to further increased risk of SIDS, thus giving start to a vicious circle. Health care providers need to be aware of such situations as an opportunity to provide parents with guidance with respect for individual infant and family characteristics.

N2  - The field of sleep medicine has grown exponentially worldwide. Sleep apnea is linked to the obesity epidemic, which, in some regions of the United States, affects more than one-third of the population. Sleep alterations increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular pathology through a diversity of direct and indirect mechanisms. Recent investigations have found a clinical correlation between sleep disorders and diabetes. Obese pregnant women are at high risk for development of sleep apnea and preeclampsia. New studies have uncovered that restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements may increase the risk of hypertension and vascular disease. Sudden death in sleep may be preventable if conditions that lead to sudden death are investigated. New neuroimaging techniques during sleep in patients with insomnia have uncovered metabolic overactivity in areas of the brain related to maintenance of wakefulness. Sleep neuroimaging promises to have research and clinical diagnostic applications. © 2010 MedReviews®, LLC.

N2  - In many modern societies, the proportion of women who delay childbearing beyond the age of 35 years has increased greatly in recent decades. They are falsely reassured by popular beliefs that advances in new reproductive technologies can compensate for the age-realted decline in fertility, but science cannot beat the biological clock. Age is the single most important determinant of male and female fertility, either natural or treated. The consequences of advancing maternal age are not only for the risk of natural and assisted conception, but also for the outcome of pregnancy. Female fertility has a 'best-before date' of 35, and for men, it is probably before age 45-50. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child's sleep 4-7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ≥20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R).Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Sadness scale.Our findings support previous findings of significant links between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with perceived sadness of the infant. © 2010.

N2  - Purpose VEPs to both flash and to steady-state flicker stimulation can be recorded in the neonatal period and have the potential to provide useful measures of neural and visual function. However, a lack of normative data limits the utility of these investigations. We aimed to describe VEPs to luminance stimuli in a cohort of healthy term and preterm neonates. These data were used to define the normative ranges, determine optimal recording protocols and examine factors such as sleep state, sex and gestation. Methods VEPs were recorded from Oz within the first three days of life from 64 infants born between 33 and 42 weeks gestation (mean 38 wks). Stimuli included transient flash (standard 3.0 and strong 28 cd.s/m2) presented at 1 Hz and steady-state flicker at six rates (3.03, 4.64, 5.86 7.32, 12.7 and 18.6 Hz). Flicker was presented in two modes: as a train of flashes (pulse) and as sinusoidally modulated light (sine). For flash VEPs, we measured the amplitudes and implicit times of the reproducible components. Flicker VEPs were analysed in the frequency domain using the magnitudes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the stimulus frequency (f1) and at the harmonics f2 and f3. Significant VEPs were defined as those with a SNR greater than 2.8 (p<0.05) at f1, f2 or f3. Results Flash: A VEP to the strong flash was recorded in all infants but 10 of the 64 infants did not have a reproducible VEP to the standard flash; seven of these 10 were born preterm (<37 weeks gestation). The amplitude of the N3 component for both of the flash stimuli was larger in infants with open eyes (p<0.001) but was not significantly affected by sleep state or gestation. Infants with longer gestation at birth had more complex flash VEPs (more components) and their P2 components were earlier for both stimuli (r2>0.3, p<0.01) and larger for the strong flash (r2 = 0.41, p<0.001, multiple regressions with eye opening). Flicker: Slower flicker rates elicited steady-state VEPs with larger magnitudes, higher SNRs and a greater proportion of infants with significant VEPs. Sine flicker was more effective than pulse for stimulating VEPs at 3.03, 4.64, 5.86 Hz (both larger magnitudes & higher SNRs, p<0.001 paired t-tests). We found the highest proportions of significant VEPs at 3.03 and 4.64 Hz (96% & 95%, respectively) using sine flicker, suggesting that this mode and frequency range is optimal for neonatal testing. For 12.7-Hz flicker (which is optimal for adults), VEPs were significant in only 35% of the infants. All infants had their eyes closed during flicker stimulation. Sex, head circumference and age in hours at testing were not significantly associated with either flash or flicker VEPs. Conclusion VEPs are reliably detected in healthy newborn infants to strong flash and to sinusoidally modulated flicker at rates below 5 Hz. Prenatal maturation between 33 and 42 weeks gestation is reflected in development of the P2 component of the transient flash VEP.

N2  - Background: We compared the clinical efficacy and safety between a new injectable cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor, parecoxib, and an old nonselective, ketorolac combined with morphine in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for management of post-cesarean delivery pain. Methods: In this randomized, open-label study, 66 parturients undergoing cesarean section were divided into two groups: In Group P the patients received an initial intravenous bolus of 40 mg parecoxib as a loading dose post-operatively and then two bolus doses of 20 mg parecoxib were subsequently given at intervals of 24 h. Morphine was basically used in PCA manner during the 3-day study course; and in Group K patients received an intravenous loading bolus of 30 mg ketorolac post-operatively and then 90 mg ketorolac combined with morphine in PCA fashion throughout the study course. Efficacy was evaluated by Verbal ranking scale (0-10) for pain intensity, Ramsay sedation score (1-6), profile of mood state (0-3) and quality of sleep (0-3), and patient satisfaction (0-4) with the analgesia. Efficacy evaluations and adverse effects were recorded every 24 h and at 72 h after initial loading boluses. The duration of hospital stay and total dose of morphine used throughout the study were also recorded. Results: There were no significant differences of sedation scale, mood state, quality of sleep and satisfaction between two groups, except patients of Group P had a lower pain scores than those of the Group K at 24 h (3.1, range 0-5 vs. 4.3, range 0-8, p = 0.005) and 72 h (1.1, range 0-3 vs. 1.9, range 0-4, p = 0.005). Moreover, there were also no significant differences in the duration of hospital stay, but there was a lower total morphine requirement (22% reduction) in Group P in comparison with Group K (43.5 ± 19.2 vs. 55.5 ± 21.5, p = 0.02). Regarding adverse effects, there were no statistical differences between two groups. Conclusions: We noted that parecoxib with PCA morphine can be used for post-cesarean delivery analgesia with the same efficacy as ketorolac for an opioid-sparing effect.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of depression; investigate its association with risk factors including comorbidities and drug and health care use; and describe treatment patterns of depression in primary care using The Health Improvement Network database. Method: In this cohort study, subjects with a first recorded diagnosis of depression (Read code) between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004 (n=47,170) were identified from a source population of 1,287,829 subjects aged 10-79 years. A comparison group was sampled from the same population and frequency matched to the depression cohort by age, sex, and calendar year (n=50,000). Depression diagnoses were validated using physician-completed questionnaires. Odds ratios and 95% CIs for the relationship of depression with a range of factors were estimated using unconditional logistic regression in a nested case-control analysis. Results: The prevalence of depression was 11.23% (95% CI, 11.18-11.28). This prevalence decreased with increasing age and was higher in women than in men. The incidence was 13.89 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI, 13.82-14.08). Depression was associated with frequent use of health services, smoking, pregnancy in the previous year, anxiety, stress, sleep disorders, digestive and respiratory disorders, and pain. In the trimester following diagnosis, 82% of cases were treated-98% with antidepressants and 81.5% with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Conclusions: We found a high prevalence and incidence of depression diagnoses in primary care in the United Kingdom. Following diagnosis, the majority of individuals were prescribed SSRIs. A diagnosis of depression is associated with a number of prior comorbidities, which could mask the depression. This fact should be taken into account when screening individuals in primary care. © 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - The identification of modifiable risk factors for SIDS has led to a dramatic reduction in SIDS, although it continues to be the leading cause of death in the postneonatal age group in high-income countries. Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) comprises cases of SIDS (R95), unascertained (R99) and accidental suffocation in bed (W75) and would have been certified as SIDS in the past. Now, over 50% of SUDI cases occur while bed sharing and reach over 90% in infants less than a month of age. In some countries, there is a recommendation to avoid all bed sharing, although some disagree and advise avoiding bed sharing only if there are other risk factors present such as smoking or alcohol use. There is substantial evidence that infants of mothers who smoke are at increased risk of SUDI while bed sharing. Babies whose parents have recently used alcohol or drugs are also at increased risk of SUDI while bed sharing. The only group that has been identified as not having an increased risk of SUDI with bed sharing are those infants older than 3 months, whose mothers have not smoked in pregnancy, and have not drunk alcohol or taken drugs and are not co-sleeping on a sofa. These risks have to be balanced against the postulated benefits of bed sharing, such as improved breastfeeding and attachment. These benefits have been over emphasized and have led to some groups actively promoting bed sharing. Bed sharing is fine for cuddles and breastfeeding, but baby should be in own bed when parents go to sleep. We recommend placing the baby to sleep in its own cot next to the parents' bed for the first six months of life (room sharing).

N2  - Aim: Māori have high SIDS rates and relevant information is needed to craft appropriate prevention strategies. The aim of the study was to determine what Māori mothers know about SIDS prevention, and to determine their SIDS-related child care practices. Methods: Māori mothers who gave birth in the Counties Manukau District Health Board area were surveyed about their SIDS related knowledge, and infant care practices and their reasons for using and their concerns about these practices. Results were compared with a similar 2005 survey of a largely European sample. Results: Knowledge of Māori mothers about SIDS prevention was much lower than for European mothers. More Māori infants slept prone and Māori mothers stopped breastfeeding significantly earlier. Although co-sleeping rates were similar, bedsharing increased to 65% for some part of the night. In addition, more than half of the Māori mothers had smoked in pregnancy and 21% of them were sharing a bed with their infant. Potentially unsafe soft objects such as rolled blankets or pillows were used by a third of mothers to help maintain the sleep position. Conclusions: Māori mothers have a poorer knowledge of SIDS prevention practices. The high rate of maternal smoking, the early cessation of breastfeeding, and co-sleeping where there was smoking in pregnancy were also areas of concern. Appropriate health promotion measures need to be developed for the high-risk Māori community. ©NZMA.

N2  - Background: Nutrient deficiency during perinatal development is associated with an increased risk to develop obesity, diabetes and hypertension in the adulthood. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental programming of the metabolic syndrome remain largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Given the essential role of the hypothalamus in the integration of nutritional, endocrine and neuronal cues, here we have analyzed the profile of the hypothalamus transcriptome in 180 days-old rats born to dams fed either a control (200 g/kg) or a low-protein (80 g/kg) diet through pregnancy and lactation. From a total of 26 209 examined genes, 688 were up-regulated and 309 down-regulated (P<0.003) by early protein restriction. Further bioinformatic analysis of the data revealed that perinatal protein restriction permanently alters the expression of two gene clusters regulating common cellular processes. The first one includes several gate keeper genes regulating insulin signaling and nutrient sensing. The second cluster encompasses a functional network of nuclear receptors and co-regulators of transcription involved in the detection and use of lipid nutrients as fuel which, in addition, link temporal and nutritional cues to metabolism through their tight interaction with the circadian clock. Conclusions/Significance: Collectively, these results indicate that the programming of the hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis is a key step in the development of obesity associated with malnutrition in early life and provide a valuable resource for further investigating the role of the hypothalamus in the programming of the metabolic syndrome. © 2010 Orozco-Solís et al.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the relationships between postnatal passive respiratory compliance (Crs) and development of respiratory disorders during the first 6 month of life in preterm and full-term infants after respiratory insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether other relevant neonatal factors, like degree of prematurity, birth weigh, ventilatory conditions, sepsis, and respiratory disease severity affected this relationship. MAtERIAL AND METHODS: The passive respiratory compliance was measured by the single occlusion technique in 73 preterm infants after respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 19 full-term infants after congenital pneumonia and 33 healthy full-term infants. Respiratory function measurements were performed by single occlusion technique, during natural sleep, after acute phase of illness, before discharge from neonatal department. RESULTS: Crs was significantly lower in premature newborns < 36 weeks gestation after RDS (p = 0.0002) and in term newborns who have suffered from a congenital pneumonia (p = 0.0411), than in healthy full-term newborn infants. Premature infants who have undergone sepsis have significantly decreased Crs in relationship with those who did not have this complication (p = 0.0334). Preterm newborns who have suffered pneumonia during treatment of RDS have significantly frequent respiratory problems during the first 6 month of age (p = 0.043). Full-term infants after congenital pneumonia have more but not significantly frequent respiratory problems than healthy term newborns (p = 0.055) in this period. Decreased neonatal Crs wasn't significantly related to respiratory disorders in age of 6 month of life. CONCLUSION: Prematurity under 36 week of gestational age, low birth weight and suffering from sepsis in premature infants significantly decreased Crs in newborn. Decreased neonatal Crs in premature and full term infants after respiratory insufficiency wasn't significantly related to respiratory disorders during first 6 month of life. This study has showed significantly increase of respiratory problems in this period in preterm infants who have suffered from pneumonia during neonatal period.

N2  - The prevalence of epilepsy is about 05-1.0%, and slightly less than half of those affected are women. Epilepsy is more frequent neurologocical disorder during pregnancy. Women with epilepsy that plan to become pregnant can in general look forward to uneventful pregnancies and to giving birth to normal children. Women with epilepsy do have an increased risk of certain obstetrical complications. There is an increased risk of vaginal bleeding, anemia, hyperemesis gravidarum, vitamine D and K deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, preeclampsia, eclampsia,premature labor, and postpartum bleeding. The effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency is variable and unpredictable between patients. Approximately 25% of patients have an increase in their seizures. Pregnancy is associated with several physiologic and psychologic changes that can alter seizure frequency, including changes in sex hormone concentrations, changes in antiepileptic drug metabolism, sleep deprivation, and new stresses. The risk for congenital malformations is higher in women on antiepileptic drug regimens.These risks can be reduced with appropriate prepregnancy counseling. During pregnancy, important considerations include; therapeutic drug monitoring, surveillance for obstetric complications and vigilance for seizures during the intrapartum and postpartum period. The care of pregnant women with epilepsy requires attention and close cooperation between neurologist and gynecologist is recommended. In this article we answer the questions commonly asked by epileptic patients regarding pregnancy. Copyright © 2010 by Türkiye Klinikleri.

N2  - Background: A link between early mismatched nutritional environment and development of components of the metabolic syndrome later in life has been shown in epidemiological and animal data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an early mismatched nutrition produced by catch-up growth after fetal protein restriction could induce the appearance of hypertension and/or atherosclerosis in adult male mice. Methodology/Principal Findings: Wild-type C57BL6/J or LDLr-/- dams were fed a low protein (LP) or a control (C) diet during gestation. Catch-up growth was induced in LP offspring by feeding dams with a control diet and by culling the litter to 4 pups against 8 in controls. At weaning, male mice were fed either standard chow or an obesogenic diet (OB), leading to 4 experimental groups. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed in conscious unrestrained wild-type mice by telemetry. Atherosclerosis plaque area was measured in aortic root sections of LDLr-/- mice. We found that: (1) postnatal OB diet increased significantly BP (P,0.0001) and HR (P,0.008) in 3-month old OB-C and OB-LP offspring, respectively; (2) that maternal LP diet induced a significant higher BP (P,0.009) and HR (P,0.004) and (3) an altered circadian rhythm in addition to higher plasma corticosterone concentration in 9 months-old LP offspring; (4) that, although LP offspring showed higher plasma total cholesterol than control offspring, atherosclerosis assessed in aortic roots of 6-mo old mice featured increased plaque area due to OB feeding but not due to early mismatched nutrition. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate a long-term effect of early mismatched nutrition on the appearance of hypertension independently of obesity, while no effect on atherosclerosis was noticed at this age. © 2010 Bol et al.

N2  - Background: Modifable behaviors, including diet quality, activity, and sleep, are associated with higher pregnancy weight gains. Little is known about the prevalence of these factors among urban, low-income mothers. Methods: We developed Project MOMMIES in late 2009 to identify obesity risk behaviors among pregnant and postpartum women in North Philadelphia; 52 mothers in mid-pregnancy have been enrolled to date. Mothers were surveyed about socio-demographics, weight, diet quality, sleep, food security, activity, and provider advice. We compared responses between mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI >=25 kg/m2. Results: The majority of respondents were Black (81%), single (92%), low-income (100% Medicaid), multigravida (69%), and < 25 years old (77%). Mean pre-gravid BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 18.5-42.1); 46% were overweight/obese. 28% were food insecure. At least 2 to 4 times/week, many mothers reported consumption of deep fried or fast foods (61%), chips (61%), pastries (62%), and sugar-sweetened beverages (52%). Less than one-third of respondents walked for at least 10 minutes/day; however, mean daily television time was 4.4 hours (SD 2.7). Excessive sleepiness in pregnancy (38%) and restless sleep (37%) were common. Only 10% of mothers received provider advice about guideline recommended weight gains. No differences in obesity risk behaviors or provider advice were found between BMI groups. Conclusions: Poor diet and sleep quality, limited activity, and lack of provider advice are exceedingly common among our sample of low-income, urban pregnant women. These factors may prove to be critical targets to prevent excessive gestational weight gain in this high-risk group.

N2  - Purpose of Review: This article reviews current data on pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy may cause harm, and explores biological pathways for associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, especially pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Recent Findings: Accumulating data indicate that snoring and sleep apnea during pregnancy are likely to increase the risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Several new studies have observed that sleep-disordered breathing and short sleep duration also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, similar to observations in the general population. There are varying levels of emerging evidence for potential mechanisms, including oxidative stress, increased sympathetic activity and inflammation, adipokine levels and insulin resistance, linking sleep-disordered breathing events during pregnancy to adverse outcomes. Summary: Sleep-disordered breathing and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes share a number of mechanistic pathways, and growing data in pregnant women indicate that snoring and sleep apnea increase the risk of these and other complications for both the mother and the fetus. Nevertheless, direct evidence of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy exerts negative effects remains sparse. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Introduction Stress causes infertility and ovarian dysfunction. Stress response is controlled by hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and sympathoadrenal system (SAS). We analyzed relation of HPA axis and SAS with various types of ovarian dysfunction and IVF outcomes. Methods In study 1, a total of 157 women with ovarian dysfunction based on the basal body temperature and 7 normal volunteers were studied. The patients were classified to 8 groups: PCOS, 49 women; PCOS with habitual abortion, 7; low body weight, 10; elevated FSH, 24; elevated PRL, 6; endometriosis, 10; high age, 4; and idiopathic, 47. HPA axis was analyzed by the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test (DST) on cycle days 3- 7. The circadian rhythm was classified into normal (N) type and 4 abnormal types: lowmorning (LM), plateau (P), V-shaped (V), and flat (F) types. SAS was analyzed by measuring plasma catecholamines. In study 2, the rates of pregnancy and abortion were compared between patients with normal and abnormal HPA axis in 178 IVF cycles. Results Study 1: The incidence of abnormal circadian rhythm in salivary cortisol was significantly higher in women with ovarian dysfunction than in normal volunteers (48% vs. 0%) The incidence was high in PCOS with habitual abortion (86%), low body weight (60%) and PCOS (53%), and moderate in elevated PRL (50%), idiopathic (47%) and elevated FSH (42%), and low in endometriosis (30%) and high age (0%). DST was worsened in types N, LM, P, V and F in this order. The incidence of elevated catecholamines was prominently high in PCOS with habitual abortion (86%), compared with other groups of ovarian dysfunction (0-27%) and normal volunteers (0%). Study 2: IVF pregnancy rates were similar in N, LM, P, V and F types, but abortion rate was significantly higher in V and F types than in N, LM and P types (50% vs 19%). Abortion rate was significantly higher with abnormal DST than with normal DST (50% vs 21.4%). Conclusions Abnormal HPA axis was identified by the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in half of women with ovarian dysfunction, especially more frequently in PCOS and low body weight. Abnormal HPA axis and SAS were prominently frequent in PCOS with habitual abortion, and also were associated with abortion in IVF. Stress-response- mechanism is closely related to ovarian function and maintenance of pregnancy, and its normalization may work as a novel treatment of infertility and pregnancy loss.

N2  - Our long term goal is to test whether leptin depletion is responsiblefor some of the effects of maternal nutrient restriction duringearly pregnancy on the placenta and embryo. To test this hypothesis,it is first necessary to establish whether plasma leptin concentrationsdecrease in response to food restriction in pregnant femalemice. Leptin, a peptide hormone produced by adipose tissue,has been found to correlate to body mass index or other measuresof adiposity in multiple species. Leptin release is also knownto be regulated by circadian rhythm, food intake, insulin, andcorticosteroids. Accordingly, leptin levels fall even more rapidlyfollowing food restriction than would be explained by fat lossalone. However, there is reason to doubt that this is the casein female mice, particularly during pregnancy. During laterpregnancy, leptin concentrations increase independently of adiposity,a process that begins around day 11 in mice. A previous studyfound that leptin actually increases in response to food restrictionduring the latter half of pregnancy in rats. Another found thatrestriction to 60% of ad libitum consumption led to significantlydecreased plasma leptin concentrations in male, but not femalemice. The goal of this study was to determine whether 50% foodrestriction affects plasma leptin concentrations in pregnantand non-pregnant female mice. Thirty-six female mice were fedad libitum (ad lib) or fed 50% of the food consumed by ad lib-fedmice (restricted) at 1600h each day for 10 days. On the tenthday, terminal blood samples were taken from three animals oneach diet every four hours. Leptin concentrations differed mostbetween diet groups in the afternoon and evening, but were notdifferent in the morning. We then compared plasma leptin concentrationsin samples taken at 1600h after 10 days in each treatment group:non-pregnant, ad lib fed (n=8), non-pregnant, restricted (n=8),pregnant (d11.5) ad lib (n=7) and pregnant restricted (n=4).Two additional plug-positive mice on the restricted diet didnot maintain pregnancy, and were excluded from analysis. Initialmouse weights were the same across treatment groups. Final weightswere significantly higher in pregnant vs non-pregnant animalsfed ad lib, but similar in pregnant and non-pregnant animalson the restricted diet. Mouse weights on the restricted dietwere significantly lower than those of ad lib fed mice. Leptinconcentrations were similar in pregnant and non-pregnant micefed ad lib. Leptin was significantly lower in both pregnantand non-pregnant mice following food restriction (p<0.0001),but fell more dramatically in the pregnant animals. Preliminaryresults indicated that when both groups of pregnant mice werefed in the morning, and blood samples were collected in themorning, leptin concentrations were higher in the restrictedgroup, perhaps due to observed differences in the timing offood consumption. We conclude that plasma leptin concentrationdoes fall in response to food restriction in pregnant and non-pregnantfemale mice, but the timing of sampling and feeding are critical.

N2  - Aims: To perform a large and detailed epidemiologic study on restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in a European country. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was distributed by the medical staff in different outpatient waiting rooms (obstetrics and gynecology department of the university hospital, obstetrics and gynecology department of a private clinic, private midwives, private obstetrician-gynecologists, radiological centers before fetal ultrasound examination and general practitioners) in a French town and its surrounding area (200,000 inhabitants): A woman was considered affected if she met the International RLS Study Group criteria for RLS diagnosis. Results: 1,022 pregnant women living in a French town were included. 24% of women were affected by RLS during their pregnancy. The disease was strongly related to the third trimester of pregnancy and had a significant impact on sleep leading to severe nocturnal and diurnal consequences with a high consumption of sleep medication. Conclusions: RLS affects one quarter of pregnant women, essentially during the third trimester and represents an important public health issue with sleep medication intake. © 2010 Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - The current study compared the performances of pregnant women with education- and age-matched controls on a variety of measures that assessed perceptual speed, short-term and working memory capacity, subjective memory complaints, sleep quality, level of fatigue, executive functioning, episodic and prospective memory, and crystallized and fluid intelligence. A primary purpose was to test the hypothesis of Henry and Rendell (2007) that pregnancy-related declines in cognitive functioning would be especially evident in tasks that place a high demand on executive processes. We also investigated a parallel hypothesis: that the pregnant women would experience a broad-based reduction in cognitive capability. Very limited support was found for the executive functioning hypothesis. Pregnant women scored lower only on the measure of verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) but not on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task or on any working memory measures. Furthermore, group differences in COWAT performance disappeared after controlling for verbal IQ (Shipley vocabulary). In addition, there was no support for the general decline hypothesis. We conclude that pregnancy-associated differences in performance observed in the current study were relatively mild and rarely reached either clinical or practical significance. © 2010 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.

N2  - Background: Short sleep duration has been associated with increased obesity risk for children and adults. Objective: We tested whether sleep and weight status are inversely associated in infancy and investigated whether sleep precedes weight status. Methods: Participants were 110 mother-infant dyads who completed a one-year study. Most mothers were White (91%) and were college graduates (73%). Mothers completed 4-day diary cards at infant ages 3, 4, 8, and 16 weeks, indicating every 15 minutes whether the infant was sleeping, feeding, fussing/crying, or awake/calm. We calculated average daily sleep during a 24-hour period at each week. Weight-for-length percentiles were calculated from infant weight and length, measured by nurses at birth, 3 weeks, and 1 year. Results: There was moderate stability in sleep patterns throughout early infancy, such that the inter-correlations between total sleep at adjacent time points were all greater than.40 (p<.0001). Shorter sleep time at 4 weeks predicted greater weight-for-length percentiles at one year, β=-.21, p<.05. This relation remained significant when adjusting for maternal education and pre-pregnancy BMI, infant fussing/crying at 4 weeks, and feeding mode (breast-vs. formula-feeding). Sleep at 4 weeks also remained a significant predictor of weight status at 1 year when adjusting for birth-weight-for-gestational-age and weight-for-length percentiles at 3 weeks. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that shorter sleep precedes increased weight status in infancy. Sleep patterns in early infancy were stable, suggesting that early sleep could set the stage for both sleep patterns and weight trajectories later in development.

N2  - The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD=4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD=1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD=33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman's sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period. © 2010 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

N2  - The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood obesity and diabetes are unknown. Previous studies performed in our lab have demonstrated an altered circadian phenotype in 8 wk old male C57Bl/6J mice subjected to protein malnutrition in uterocoupled with altered glucose homeostasis. By 20 wks of age, undernourished offspring (UO) from pregnant C57BL/6J dams fed a protein defcient diet (6 % protein) developed obesity and signs of Type II Diabetes compared to control offspring (CO) born to dams fed a control (20% protein) diet. Gene expression of Rev-erbα a component of the circadian clock mechanism in liver was dramatically reduced in UO at 8 wk of age. Rev-erbα repressed genes involved in circadian regulation (Bmal1 and Per2) were increased in UO mice. Surprisingly, protein expression of Rev-erbα in UO liver did not oscillate and was expressed at similar levels at circadian time points (CT) 1200 and 2400 (noon and midnight) suggesting gene expression and protein translation are misaligned compared to CO. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 and protein kinase B, two second messenger signaling molecules that play a role both directly and indirectly in Rev-erbα regulation through cell surface signals where also misaligned in UO liver, suggesting potentially cell surface alterations may play a role in impaired clock controlled processes in these mice. We conclude that UO mice exhibit a metabolic disorder involving abnormal circadian patterns of gene and protein expression. Altered Rev-erbα expression and function may be a key factor in metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR.

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence of obesity is increasing among children worldwide. Research suggests that too much food and too little exercise is an insufficient explanation for the increased prevalence, and more recent studies have suggested that lack of sleep may be a determinant for overweight. Methods: A total of 117 children aged 2-5 years, and at high risk of developing overweight, were selected from population registries based on information on their birth weight (>4000 grams) and maternal pre-pregnant Body Mass Index (BMI) (BMI > 28). Information on regular difficulties in waking up in the morning or falling asleep in the evening was obtained from a questionnaire filled out by parents. Height and weight was measured, and BMI was calculated. Linear regression analyses were performed. Results: BMI was 1.1 kg/m2 higher among those children who had regular difficulties waking up in the morning (p = 0.001), even after adjusting for age and gender. Further adjustment for regular difficulties falling asleep showed essentially similar results (β = 1.0, p = 0.003). There was no association between regular difficulties falling asleep in the evening and BMI. Conclusion: Regular difficulties waking up in the morning seems positively associated with BMI among 2-5 year old children, who are at high-risk of developing overweight. The association may be due to poor sleep quality or short sleep duration.

N2  - Objective: Bed sharing has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and may contribute to the racial disparity seen in infant mortality. It is unclear how bed sharing interacts with other factors to impact SIDS risk. We aimed to measure the effects of bed sharing on risk of SIDS in blacks and to determine whether the risk is modified by other characteristics of the sleep environment. Methods: Characteristics of 195 black infants who died of SIDS were compared with matched controls. The moderating influence of known SIDS risk factors on the effect of bed sharing on risk of SIDS was examined using logistic regression. Results: Almost half (47.4%) of the study population bed shared during the last/reference sleep (58% cases and 37% controls). Bed sharing was associated with 2 times greater risk of SIDS compared with not bed sharing. The deleterious effect of bed sharing was more pronounced with a soft sleep surface, pillow use, maternal smoking, and younger infant age. However, bed sharing was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS, even when the infant was not using a pillow or sleeping on a firm surface. The strongest predictors of SIDS among bed-sharing infants were soft sleep surface, nonuse of a pacifier, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Conclusions: Bed sharing is a common practice among black infants. It is associated with a clear and strong increased risk of SIDS, which is even greater when combined with other known risk factors for SIDS. This practice likely contributes to the excess incidence of SIDS among blacks, and culturally competent education methods must be developed to target this high-risk group. © 2010 by Academic Pediatric Association.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurologic disorder present to a clinically significant degree in 3-5% of the adult population. The four diagnostic criteria require 1) an urge to move the legs which is usually accompanied by leg dysesthesia, 2) the onset or worsening of such symptoms with immobility, 3) relief of the symptoms, at least temporarily, with movement, and 4) these symptoms must be most pronounced at night as compared to earlier in the day. The most salient consequence of RLS is difficulty, often substantial, with initiating and/or maintaining sleep. RLS is associated with impairment in quality of life, increased rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Risk factors for RLS are increased age, female gender, family history of RLS, antidepressant use, iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal disease. Studies of RLS pathophysiology have identified three important guides to understanding the disorder: genetics, iron deficiency, and dopamine abnormalities. Recent genome wide association scans identified 3 important gene variants associated with RLS, with odds ratios >2. Multiple methods of assessing brain iron (MRI, transcranial Doppler, CSF, autopsy) consistently demonstrate reductions in patients with RLS, although serum iron indices are often normal, suggesting abnormal transport or metabolism of iron into or within the brain. Neurohnaging studies of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway suggest minor abnormalities may be present, particularly in the dopamine transporter. The importance of iron for normal dopamine function in the CNS makes these areas of investigation more relevant. Multiple effective treatments for clinically significant RLS exist. PO iron supplementation may improve symptoms if iron deficiency is present to the extent that serum ferritin is < 45. Alternatively, FDA-approved treatments include the dopamine agonists ropinirole and pramipexole. These agents demonstrate exquisite acute efficacy for core RLS symptoms, though tolerance and augmentation (worsening of symptoms with earlier daytime onset) may complicate the treatment of some patients. Both gabapentin and pregabalin are effective in some patients, with low doses both improving RLS as well as sleep. Finally, opiates are an important treatment option, with excellent reduction in symptoms with either short-acting (oxycodone, codeine) or long- acting (methadone) agents, without evidence of tolerance.

N2  - Aim: Background: A rare inherited metabolic disorder where an enzyme deficiency, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, prevents the normal metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid. SSADH deficiency causes neurological disorders attributable to the accumulation of λ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in the brain. To date, there is no effective treatment for SSADH deficiency. The aim of the study was to evaluate the children idiopathic mental retardation and their mothers. Materials and methods Increased urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid gamma-hydroxybutyric acid levels were determined in newborns. Other GABA metabolites were also identified in urine such as glycine. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in high risk family pregnancies with SSADH enzyme assay in chorionic villus and amniocytes, 4-hydroxybutyric acid accumulation, reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic DNA amplification. Results: Signs and symptoms of SSADH deficiency may vary on an individual basis for each patient. Hypotonia was the initial finding of our two cases with hyporreflexia, seizures and sleep problems. Conclusions Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. SSADH deficiency is caused by an enzyme deficiency in GABA degradation. The symptoms and clinical findings of SSADH deficiencies in the neonatal period are hypotonia, hyporreflexia and seizures.

N2  - Maternal circadian information has been reported to play an important role in fetal physiology and development. Hormones and nutrition have been mainly investigated as circadian cues from mother to fetus. However, the influences of circadian properties of the pregnant reproductive organs on fetuses have not been fully investigated. To gain an insight on the circadian functions of the reproductive organs, we examined molecular clocks in the pregnant rat uterus and placenta. By using a Period1-luciferase (Per1-luc) rat, whose tissues express luciferase corresponding to activation of Period1, a "key clock gene", we examined the uterus clock during non-pregnancy, on embryonic day 12 (E12), and on E22 (the end of pregnancy) in a light-dark (LD) cycle and constant darkness (DD). By in situ hybridization we further explored Per1 mRNA rhythms in the placenta on E12 and E22. The uterus in vitro showed clear circadian Per1-luc rhythms both in and out of pregnancy, having peaks at around the time corresponding to dusk in LD. Likewise, in DD, the uterus in vitro had the same Per1-luc rhythms. The decidua in LD showed circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms, peaking during night 6 h after dusk, while the decidua in DD showed the same Per1 mRNA rhythms only on E22. In contrast, the labyrinth showed no circadian Per1 mRNA rhythms in LD or DD during pregnancy. These results suggest that the uterus and decidua, a maternally-originated tissue of the placenta, but not the labyrinth, a fetus-originated tissue of the placenta, can provide the fetus with circadian information.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The study of potential factors associated with sleep bruxism (SB) may help in determining the etiology of such parafunction. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of children with SB by means of a generic scale, in addition to the association of sociodemographic characteristics and other parafunctional habits. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included healthy children of both genders, aged 7.18 +/- 0.59 years, with (n = 25) and without (n = 69) signs and symptoms of SB. Data were collected in caries-free children from public schools by applying a translated and validated version of the Autoquestionnaire Qualite de Vie Enfant Image (AUQUEI), clinical examination and interview with the parents. The psychometric properties evaluated for the scale referred to internal consistency (ceiling and floor effects, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, Items Correlation Matrix, and corrected Item-Total Correlation) and the discriminant validity (t-test). By means of logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination, associations were evaluated between SB and age, gender, body mass index, maternal use of alcohol/tobacco/medicine during pregnancy, maternal age at birth, parent's schooling, presence of sucking habit, nail biting, enuresis, number of children, child's order (first born), occurrence of divorce/parent's death, and AUQUEI scores. RESULTS: The results of the AUQUEI psychometric analysis showed homogeneity of items and a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.65; no negative correlations between the items were found. The mean AUQUEI scores for children with SB did not differ significantly from those of children without the parafunction. Only the independent variable "maternal age at birth" showed a significant negative association with SB. CONCLUSIONS: In the studied sample, children with SB presented scores of QoL that were similar to those without the parafunction, and children from the youngest mothers were more likely to present SB.

N2  - Background: Habitual snoring, a prominent symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is an important indicator for a number of health problems in children. Compared to adults, large epidemiological studies on childhood habitual snoring and associated predisposing factors are extremely scarce. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of habitual snoring among Chinese school-aged children.Methods: A random sample of 20,152 children aged 5.08 to 11.99 years old participated in a cross-sectional survey, which was conducted in eight cities of China. Parent-administrated questionnaires were used to collect information on children's snoring frequency and the possible correlates.Results: The prevalence of habitual snoring was 12.0% (14.5% for boys vs. 9.5% for girls) in our sampled children. Following factors were associated with an increased risk for habitual snoring: lower family income (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.46), lower father's education (OR = 1.38 and 1.14 for middle school or under and high school of educational level, respectively), breastfeeding duration < 6 months (OR = 1.17), pregnancy maternal smoking (OR = 1.51), obesity (OR = 1.50), overweight (OR = 1.35), several respiratory problems associated with atopy and infection, such as chronic/allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.94), asthma (OR = 1.43), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (OR = 2.17), and chronic otitis media (OR = 1.31), and family history of habitual snoring (OR = 1.70).Conclusion: The prevalence of habitual snoring in Chinese children was similar to that observed in other countries. The potential predisposing factors covered socioeconomic characteristics, environmental exposures, chronic health problems, and family susceptibility. Compared to socioeconomic status and family susceptibility, environmental exposures and chronic health problems had greater impact, indicating childhood habitual snoring could be partly prevented by health promotion and environmental intervention. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to develop sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or protect against it. Studies evaluating outcomes of SDB symptoms in pregnancy are scarce. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SDB symptoms in pregnancy and their relationship with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. A cross-sectional survey of randomly selected immediate postpartum females was performed using the multivariable apnoea prediction index. Record review, including demographics and medical history, was performed. Main outcome measures included pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. 1,000 subjects were recruited. Mean±SD age was 29.1±6.1 yrs. Factors used in the regression analysis included age, body mass index, diabetes, chronic hypertension, multifetal gestations, smoking and renal disease. Snoring was present in 35.1% of subjects. Symptoms of SDB were associated with a higher likelihood of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-4.0), gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4) and unplanned Caesarean deliveries (adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) after multivariable regression analysis. Gasping may have been associated with a higher likelihood of preterm delivery, after adjusting for age and multifetal pregnancies (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) but this association appeared to be mediated by pre-eclampsia. Symptoms of SDB are common in pregnancy and associated with a higher likelihood of gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and unplanned Caesarean deliveries. Copyright©ERS 2010.

N2  - Introduction: Although it is accepted that sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy, there is a lack of objective sleep data due to the difficulty in persuading these women to spend a night in a sleep laboratory. It is likely that in this group, as found in the general population, self-report sleep quality is unreliable. This study compares self-reported sleep quality with objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Methods: Twenty-one women in the third trimester (T3) and 17 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy and 10 non-pregnant controls underwent overnight PSG and reported their perceived sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST) and sleep quality. Results: (Table presented) On average, all groups overestimated their SOL. The T3 group tended to overestimate TST, which differed significantly from the T1 and control groups who underestimated TST on average. Absolute values however show that all groups incorrectly reported TST by 40-50 minutes with substantial variability. The accuracy of sleep perception did not differ between those who reported their sleep quality as the same as usual or worse than usual. Discussion: Sleep perception during pregnancy tends to be unreliable, but not significantly more so than in healthy controls. Negative perceptions of sleep quality regardless of objective measures have been shown to result in impaired daytime functioning. Misperception of sleep also has important implications for the vast number of studies based on self-report in the pregnant population.

N2  - Snoring is common during late pregnancy and is a symptom of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Maternal hypoxia is a known factor in intrauterine growth restriction and hypertension in pregnancy. A 37 year old, 32 week pregnant woman, complaining of loud snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness and falling asleep while driving, completed a questionnaire about the presence of snoring and daytime sleepiness. Domiciliary overnight sleep study and concurrent half hourly blood pressure measurements were performed. Results revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OS-AHS) with repetitive apneas and oxyhemoglobin desaturations to 66%. The apnea/hypopnea index was 98/hour. Overnight blood pressure demonstrated mean systolic 154mmHg (maximum 169mmHg) and diastolic 88mmHg (maximum 98mmHg). Daytime blood pressure was normal. Hospitalisation followed with commencement of methyldopa 125mgs at 18:00 and 24:00 hours. On night four of admission, positive airway pressure via nasal mask was commenced using an auto-adjusting machine (ResMed Autoset® and on night five, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was used at a pressure of 12cms H2O. Overnight half hourly blood pressure measurement was performed on both nights. Blood pressure results night four: mean systolic 141mmHg (maximum 160mmHg) and diastolic 87mmHg (maximum 97mmHg) and on night five: mean systolic 133mmHg (maximum 151mmHg) and diastolic 81mmHg (maximum 88mmHg). There were significant decreases in systolic and diastolic BP when CPAP was used compared to the night without positive pressure (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003) and when compared to Autoset (p = 0.03 and 0.002). Overnight blood pressure monitoring and sleep study revealed previously undiagnosed nocturnal hypertension and severe obstructive sleep apnea. CPAP therapy resulted in effective treatment for OSAHS and, together with antihypertensive medication, a significant reduction in sleeping blood pressure. Maternal and fetal outcomes were good and there was no progression to preeclampsia.

N2  - The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat, this period lasts from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th day of postnatal development. The circadian system of fetuses and newborn pups is entrained mostly by nonphotic maternal cues during prenatal and early postnatal development. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a restricted feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an entraining cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were entrained to an external light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under conditions when the external timing signal was lacking, i.e., under constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad libitum and the experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during their resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of 1-day-old pups. The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept under LD cycle did not notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of pups. The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression did not exhibit circadian rhythms in pups born to mothers maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due to desynchrony among the pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats kept under LL restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock is dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN. However, under conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking, such as LL, regular food intake of the mothers may also play an important role in synchronization of the fetal SCN clock during prenatal ontogenesis. © 2010 Sage Publications.

N2  - Study Objectives: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Clinic-based study. Participants: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. Measurements and Results: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (≤ 6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting ≤ 6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (≥ 10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (< 5 h) and long (≥ 10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

N2  - Recruiting participants into and managing large scale, longitudinal survey studies require carefully managed processes to ensure the study sample is representative of the intended population. Methods trialled in a feasibility study, and refined for current use in a large scale study involving pregnant and postpartum women are discussed. The E Moe Ma¯ma¯, Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand project is currently recruiting 1,000 women (500 Ma¯ori and 500 non-Ma¯ori) to participate in research investigating aspects of sleep changes in pregnancy and early postpartum. Questionnaires are completed at 35-37 weeks gestation and 12-weeks postpartum. A telephone interview is conducted at 4-6 weeks postpartum. No single channel exists for making contact with a diverse sample of pregnant women. A multi-method approach utilising community posters, and face-to-face contact with a member of the research team, a midwife or childbirth educator has been developed to promote awareness in a wide community sample of women. Following focus group feedback from participants in a feasibility study the use of a website, mainstream media and presence at a parenting exhibition have also been employed. Women interested in participation are supplied with a study information pack (including consent form) which can be obtained directly from their midwife or childbirth educator or by contacting the research team via free telephone or text services; a website link and email. A $20 gift voucher is offered each time a written questionnaire is returned. Reminders and participant contact at 4-6 weeks and 12 weeks postpartum are managed through a database developed for the project in Microsoft Access. To date, over eight months we have succeeded in recruiting 360 women. The retention rate in the feasibility study was high (94%). Focus group participants also commented that clear instructions, accurate estimates of time involved and personal contact with the research team enhanced commitment to complete the study. Use of a wide range of contact management methods can be achieved at modest cost with the effect of enhancing participant retention on longitudinal studies. The commitment required by the research team to build and maintain relationships with study participants and recruitment sites is also rewarded by connecting with a broad community sample.

N2  - Snoring is common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester. Most investigations of snoring during pregnancy have utilised questionnaires to determine the presence and severity of snoring. This study administered questionnaires and recorded snoring during sleep in 63 women in order to validate the use of questionnaires against objective measurement of actual snoring. Methods: Berlin questionnaires were administered to 63 pregnant women. One question asked “Do you snore?” Snoring was then recorded in the woman's home using a SonoMat™ device, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement. The results from the questionnaire were compared to recorded snoring. Results: 37 women answered “Yes” to the question “Do you snore?”. 20 women answered “No” and 6 women answered “I don't know”. The average gestation of the three groups was 28 ± 4-8 weeks. In the group who answered “Yes” recorded snoring average was 19 ± 18% of the night; in the “No” group recorded snoring was 12 ± 9% and in the “I don't know” group snoring was recorded as 16 ± 21%. There were no significant differences between the percentages of snoring recorded in the three groups. Conclusion: Snoring is very common in pregnancy. Questionnaire results appear not to be a reliable method of determining the presence of snoring in pregnant women. (Table Presented).

N2  - Aim: This study was designed to study the dynamics of 24-hour profile parameters of blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive pregnant women during treatment with long acting form of nifedipine compared to groups of women during treatment with short acting form of nifedipine, methyldopa and atenolol. The target BP was set between 120-140 mmHg systolic and 70-90 mmHg diastolic. BP control, as well as fetal and maternal outcomes are described. Materials and methods: 127 women in the 20th or more weeks of pregnancy with CH have been included in research. They were divided into 4 groups due to targeted antihypertensive drug therapy: long acting form of nifedipine 40 mg/day (group 1), short acting form of nifedipine 40 mg/day (group 2), methyldopa 05,-0,75 mg/day (group 3), atenolol 25-50 mg/day (group 4). Pregnant women were comparable in age and parity. All pregnant women had clinical, laboratorial evaluation, ECG, the parameters of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV) before (in time 22-24 weeks of pregnancy) and during treatment (on 32-34th week). Blood pressure was assessed with 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Comparison between groups was made using the Student's t-test. A p value of <0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Level of fice BP on 22-24 weeks prior to the beginning of treatment in I, II, III and IV groups has made 154,5±2,2/89,9±1,0 mm Hg, 149,7±2,1/90,9±1,6 mmHg, 149,9±2,0/91,3±1,4 mmHg and 154,4±1,9/90,4±1,1 mmHg, respectively, and did not differ significant in groups. There was no significant difference in average ABPM on 2224 weeks in all groups: 120,5±2,2/70,4±1,2 mmHg, 124,7±4,6/69,9±2,6 mmHg, 119,3±3,6/67,1±1,6 mmHg, 121,6±2/75,3±2,1, respectively. Parameters of circadian rhythm and variability BP in groups were approximately same. The hypotensive effect of long acting form of nifedipine within the first 7-10 days was significant. The of fice BP in group I decreased 126,5±2,7/75,6±2,0 mmHg (p <0,001).The average ABPM on 32-34th weeks in all groups were not differ significant: 126,5±3,0/75,9±1,6 mmHg in group with long acting form of nifedipine, 133,0±3,6/77,4±2,8 mmHg in shot acting form of nifedipine, 132,0±2,1/79±2,5 mmHg - methyldopa, 130,8± 2,9/80,1 ± 4,0 mmHg in group of atenolol. The circadian rhythm BP was similar in all groups. The variability of BP during 24-hours decreased in group with the long acting form of nifedipine and there was less comparably with shot acting nifedipine: 13,0±1,0/10,8±0,9 mmHg against 15,1±0,7/13,5±1,0 mmHg (p<0,05). In group atenolol variability BP decreased from 14,8±0,8/12,3±0,8 mmHg to 11,1±0,4/10,5±0,6 mmHg (p <0,01). Parameters of EDV increased in group of long form nifedipine: 7,6±1,6% and 14,2±2,3%, before and during therapy, respectively (p <0,05). No changes of EVD were in other groups. The birth weight in investigated group has made 3300±107 grams, was comparable to results in group of nifedipine of short action and in group of methyldopa: 3264±80 grams and 3327±93 grams, respectively. In group with atenolol the birth weight was significantly less: 2936±195 grams (p <0,05). Conclusion: In all groups response of targeted antihypertensive drug therapy in hypertensive patients resulted in the same final BP. However the fact that in group with long acting nifedipine variability of BP decrease, the vascular dysfunctions improves and the birth weight is not less than in other drugs (except atenolol) suggests that long acting form nifedipine is useful for the control of maternal blood pressure in pregnancy with CH.

N2  - Aim: New evidence suggests that sleep disordered breathing (snoring and or upper airway obstructed breathing), commonly develops in the last trimester of pregnancy. However, most of the evidence comes from questionnaire data. The aim of the study was to make objective measures of snoring and obstructed breathing using a new technology that records vibrations transmitted through the body to a mat overlying the subject's bed. The mat contains sensors that detect body movements, breathing movements and vibration generated by breathing and snoring. Method: Home studies were conducted in 30 women attending a fertility clinic, and overnight measures in the first and third trimesters obtained. Results: In the first trimester, 27% of women snored for >5% of the night (mean 7 ± 11%), whereas in the third trimester, 73% snored for >5% of the night (mean 25 ± 23%). Clinically significant snoring i.e. snoring for >20% of sleep time, was present in only 10% of women in the first trimester, but increased to 47% in the third trimester. Severe snoring i.e. >50% of sleep time, was not present in any subject in the first trimester, but occurred in 20% in the third trimester and was associated with periods of obstructed breathing and hypopneas, although obstructive apnea was uncommon. Twelve women with twin pregnancies did not significantly differ in snoring from the 18 women with singleton pregnancies. Conclusion: This work confirms that snoring increases throughout pregnancy, with as many as 20% of these having a pattern of snoring that is suggestive of significant obstructed breathing in sleep.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The duration of analgesia from epidural administration of local anesthetics to parturients has been shown to follow a rhythmic pattern according to the time of drug administration. We studied whether there was a similar pattern after intrathecal administration of bupivacaine in parturients. In the course of the analysis, we came to believe that some data points coincident with provider shift changes were influenced by nonbiological, health care system factors, thus incorrectly suggesting a periodic signal in duration of labor analgesia. We developed graphical and analytical tools to help assess the influence of individual points on the chronobiological analysis. METHODS: Women with singleton term pregnancies in vertex presentation, cervical dilation 3 to 5 cm, pain score >50 mm (of 100 mm), and requesting labor analgesia were enrolled in this study. Patients received 2.5 mg of intrathecal bupivacaine in 2 mL using a combined spinal-epidural technique. Analgesia duration was the time from intrathecal injection until the first request for additional analgesia. The duration of analgesia was analyzed by visual inspection of the data, application of smoothing functions (Supersmoother; LOWESS and LOESS [locally weighted scatterplot smoothing functions]), analysis of variance, Cosinor (Chronos-Fit), Excel, and NONMEM (nonlinear mixed effect modeling). Confidence intervals (CIs) were determined by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications with replacement) using PLT Tools. RESULTS: Eighty-two women were included in the study. Examination of the raw data using 3 smoothing functions revealed a bimodal pattern, with a peak at approximately 0630 and a subsequent peak in the afternoon or evening, depending on the smoother. Analysis of variance did not identify any statistically significant difference between the duration of analgesia when intrathecal injection was given from midnight to 0600 compared with the duration of analgesia after intrathecal injection at other times. Chronos-Fit, Excel, and NONMEM produced identical results, with a mean duration of analgesia of 38.4 minutes (95% CI: 35.4-41.6 minutes), an 8-hour periodic waveform with an amplitude of 5.8 minutes (95% CI: 2.1-10.7 minutes), and a phase offset of 6.5 hours (95% CI: 5.4-8.0 hours) relative to midnight. The 8-hour periodic model did not reach statistical significance in 40% of bootstrap analyses, implying that statistical significance of the 8-hour periodic model was dependent on a subset of the data. Two data points before the change of shift at 0700 contributed most strongly to the statistical significance of the periodic waveform. Without these data points, there was no evidence of an 8-hour periodic waveform for intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia. CONCLUSION: Chronobiology includes the influence of external daily rhythms in the environment (e.g., nursing shifts) as well as human biological rhythms. We were able to distinguish the influence of an external rhythm by combining several novel analyses: (1) graphical presentation superimposing the raw data, external rhythms (e.g., nursing and anesthesia provider shifts), and smoothing functions; (2) graphical display of the contribution of each data point to the statistical significance; and (3) bootstrap analysis to identify whether the statistical significance was highly dependent on a data subset. These approaches suggested that 2 data points were likely artifacts of the change in nursing and anesthesia shifts. When these points were removed, there was no suggestion of biological rhythm in the duration of intrathecal bupivacaine analgesia. Copyright © 2010 International Anesthesia Research Society.

N2  - Study Objectives: Because the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. Design: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm3 were evaluated. Measurements and Results: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm3 of renal tissue. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

N2  - Introduction: There are limited data concerning the sleep of infants across Australasia. Factors associated with problematic sleep need further investigation. Method: This study describes survey data on the sleep of infants at 3 and 15 months of age (N = 372) from a prospective asthma cohort covering rural and urban New Zealand. Aim: To identify factors associated with problem sleep across infancy. Results: At 3 months, 17.5% of parents considered their baby's sleep to be a problem (small-serious problem), while at 15 months 16.9% reported a problem. Factors with a significant univariate relationship to parental report of problem sleep at 15 months were: having a problem at 3 months (p < 0.05), still breastfeeding (p < 0.01), a lower gestational period (p < 0.05), sharing a bedroom with others (p <.01), a sleep latency of 20 minutes or more (p < 0.01), shorter sleep duration over 24 hrs (p < 0.000), more awakenings (p < 0.000) and spending 20 minutes or more awake at night (p < 0.001). (Table Presented) Multiple logistic regression showed that, after controlling for other risk factors, breastfeeding at 15 months, a reduced total sleep duration and shorter gestation remained significant predictors of parents reporting problem sleep at 15 months. Gestation was inversely associated with the number of awakenings at night (p < 0.05) but was unrelated to weight. Discussion: The results from this survey support previous studies - parental reports of problem sleep are related to continued breastfeeding and (parentally reported) sleep duration. Some relevant parental behaviours, including how often infants are put to bed each day, were not examined. Further research is required to clarify the relationships between duration of gestation and problem sleep including awakenings. These relationships were not present at 3 months. There is a need for further research using objective monitoring to better understand the mechanisms contributing to problematic sleep during infancy.

N2  - Women have better sleep quality compared to men, with longer sleep periods, shorter sleep-onset latency, and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women present with more sleep-related complaints than men. Specific risk factors for insomnia may be gender-related, including a higher prevalence rate of depression and anxiety among women, environmental and social factors, as well as reproductive-related factors: puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, which are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Insomnia is one of the most common complaints in the perimenopausal period, with 40% of women reporting sleep difficulties. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy. These issues will be discussed in the presentation.

N2  - Purpose: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), is a pregnancy-specific liver condition that typically occurs with generalized pruritus in the absence of skin rash in late second trimester or third trimester. The diagnosis is by exclusion made by a suggestive history, serology and abdominal ultrasound. All symptoms and signs should disappear within 4 weeks post-partum. Methods: Case Report: We present the case of a 27-year-old G4P2 at 26 weeks of gestation seen for complaints of generalized itching all over her body. The itching started at approximately 19 weeks of gestation with initial involvement of the extremities. Therapy with emollients, H1 blockers, Zolpidem, and hydrocortisone failed. Therapy with cholestyramine in conjunction with vitamin k failed, and she continued to have progression of symptoms. Subsequently she was initiated on Ursodiol without relief. Her symptoms continued to worsen while being on medical therapy. At 29 weeks, she was admitted to the hospital due to intractable itching resulting in her inability to sleep for 4 days, restlessness and suicidal ideation. Admission labs were peak bile acid levels of 34 mmol/L, Chenodeoxycholic acid 14 mmol/L, Cholic acid 17 mmol/L, AST 33, ALT 25, total bilirubin 0.8, direct bilirubin 0.4. During this admission the patient was initiated on Plasmapheresis. Each pheresis was 1.2 plasma volume exchanges, using 5% albumin and fresh frozen plasma as replacement fluid. Two exchanges were performed on the current admission, then weekly for four successive weeks. The patient reported significant relief of symptoms after each round of plasmapheresis. She reported complete resolution of her symptoms. The pregnancy progressed normally till 36 weeks at which point she required caesarean section for the birth of a normal child. The post partum period was uneventful. Conclusion: Discussion: Plasmapheresis is an extracorporeal exchange technique used to remove large molecular weight substance from the plasma. Therapeutic plasmapheresis has been quite successful in treatment of pruritus associated with hepatic cholestasis. To the best of our knowledge this is the second case of treatment of ICP by plasmapheresis reported in literature. The relief is dramatic. Our patient had a severe refractory case. The treatment though expensive is widely available, effective and associated with rare complications. Plasmapheresis should be considered as a backup plan for management of this debilitating condition.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep problems of varying nature and intensity are reported in over one-third of infants. Factors associated with problem sleep need to be understood to enable parents and clinicians to effectively identify and address sleep problems. Methods: Questionnaire, diary and actigraphy data describing sleep and environmental factors were collected from healthy infants. Aims included piloting study methods and the assessment of factors associated with infant sleep. Results: Subjects were 52 (33 male) one-year-olds (11-13.9 months), born between 35 and 42 weeks of gestation. Over one-third of the infants were still breastfeeding (38.5%). Most of the infants were sleeping in a room alone and soothing themselves to sleep at night (85%). (Table Presented) Thirty-five percent of parents considered their infant's sleep to be a small problem (none reported a serious problem). Parentally defined problem sleepers were 2.5 times more likely to still be breastfeeding (p <.05), and 5.4 times more likely to spend 20 minutes or more awake during the night (p <.001, as reported by parents). Time spent in bed did not differ between groups, however problem sleepers were having approximately 40 minutes less sleep at night, and 1 hour less sleep per 24 hours (as recorded actigraphically, p <.05). Problem sleepers were put to bed more often per 24 hours (p <.05) and were 2.6 times more likely to be defined as in a moderate-bad mood at bedtime rather than a good mood (p <.05). Conclusion: The detection of problematic sleep at an early age is important as this is a leading predictor of continued problems into childhood. Infant's considered to be problem sleepers by their parents were confirmed as spending less time asleep. Further research using larger samples is required to address these predictors as well as other mediating factors, to fully understand the mechanisms contributing to problematic sleep during infancy.

N2  - Prenatal attachment can be defined as the range of behaviours, interactions and affective involvement that the mother feels and expresses towards her baby during pregnancy. The process begins even before conception, when the “child of dreams” is fantasized and loved. Pre-conception disruptors of attachment include: unwanted pregnancy, substance abuse, young age (adolescent mothers have the highest vulnerability), being single mother, depression, conflicting couple relationships, poor economic conditions, poor family support. Prenatal diagnosis has a still underevaluated role among the post-conception disruptors. Women undergoing prenatal diagnosis are more vulnerable to emotional withdrawal from the child until results are reassuring; their attachment is significantly lower in comparison to women who did not do the prenatal testing; they have lower relation with the child and lower capacity of attributing desired characteristics to the child himself. Other disruptors include sleep disorders in the first trimester (significantly associated with depression in pregnancy and puerperium), and medical and obstetric disorders that may impair the child' outcome. Disruptors may impair the postnatal attachment and be associated with an increase of postnatal depression and child' psychosomatic problems. After delivery, maternal depression and/or child's admission and prolonged stay in intensive care unit may further affect the quality of bonding.

N2  - Objective: Fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) is a marker for fetal well being and neurovegetative development. Nijhuis classified fetal behavior (quiet/active, asleep/awake) after 32 weeks of gestational age based on fHRV and movement by CTG and ultrasound. Starting at 23 weeks rest and activity states can be distinguished. However CTG has limited temporal accuracy for fHRV analysis. Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) detects fHRV with high temporal resolution and fetal movement. Both can be plotted as actocardiogram. fMCG allows fHRV analysis with statistical measures indicating the neurovegetative influence. Actocardiogram inspection was used to define fetal behavior states added by statistical fHRV parameters to assess neurovegetative development. An automatic state detection algorithm was introduced and compared to the visual analysis. Materials and methods: 55 fMCGs were collected in healthy fetuses between 24 to 41 weeks (recordings up to 45 min). Actocardiograms were plotted and visual analysed according to Nijhuis. Automatic classification algorithm was based on fHRV-criterias of heart rate, oscillation and acceleration. Standard deviation of the beat-to-beat intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and mean permutation entropy (PE-mean) were calculated. Results: Visual and automatic state detection classified similarly (quiet sleep: 26% vs. 32%, active sleep: 54% vs. 59%, active awake 4: 10% vs. 10%) with no difference between the two schemes. SDNN increased (p<0.01) and PE-mean decreased (p<0.05) with increasing GA. RMSSD increased in late gestation (p<0.05). Conclusions: fMCG allows automatic state classification and differentiation of active and quiet cycles in early gestation (<32 weeks). SDNN reflects increasing overall HRV, RMSSD indicates pronounced vagal influence during gestation. Decreasing PE-mean suggests higher heart rate complexity with increasing GA. This confirms earlier reports of fetal states development. Detection of fetal state and neurovegetative maturation could be valuable for fetal monitoring.

N2  - Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1-10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology. © 2010 The Obesity Society.

N2  - Prolactin is a pulsatile, not a static, hormone. Prolactin secretion occurs episodically in 14 secretory pulses over 24 hours. It has a circadian fluctuation, with the highest levels achieving between 4 and 6 am and the lowest occurring between 10 am and noon. The nocturnal elevation is sleep entrained, especially in non-rapid eye movement sleep (REM). It is essential for human species survival by milk production during pregnancy and lactation. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common hypothalamic-pituitary disorder encountered in clinical endocrinology, obstetrics and gynaecology. Hyperprolactinemia may be due to a prolactinoma, secondary to other causes and physiologic hypersecretion. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is prolactinoma. Secondary to other causes including drug effects, renal disease, liver disease, hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome should be ruled out before investigating prolactinoma. They present with clinical features of hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, gonadal hypofunction). Headache and visual field defects due to optic chiasm compression are common in patients who have macroprolactinomas. Indications for treatment would contain the presence of confusing symptoms, such as menstrual disturbance, bothersome galactorrhea, infertility, impotence, long-lasting hypogonadism, and prevention of bone loss. Medical therapy with dopamine agonists is well responsive in achieving normoprolactinemia in most patients, and other methods of treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy currently have many limited indications. The pregnant women with prolactinomas need careful planning and close monitoring.

N2  - Summary: The association of obesity with infertility and PCOS has been well established. A retrospective analysis of morbidly obese patients with PCOS shows a marked improvement in assessed parameters of fertility after bariatric surgery, suggesting a possible primary treatment modality for PCOS. Introduction: Morbid obesity is now achieving epidemic proportions throughout the world, and consequently a larger number of female patients in the reproductive age group are seeking bariatric surgery. While the role of bariatric surgery in controlling or even completely resolving obesity related co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, etc has been well established, the effect of weight loss through bariatric surgery on fertility and childbirth outcomes has not yet been fully demonstrated. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of data from 187 patients of morbid obesity operated by a single bariatric team from 2007 to 2010, revealed 33 female patients under the age of 45. Of these, 14 patients had documented PCOS as per Rotterdam Criteria, with 5 of them having previously taken infertility treatment. Results: All patients showed improvements in one or more of the assessed parameters for PCOS-oligo or anovulation, hirsutism, acne, free testosterone levels and fasting insulin levels. 3 patients in the PCOS group conceived after surgery. Discussion: Bariatric surgery is not so much a treatment aimed at achieving weight loss as it is a treatment for metabolic disturbance.There is clear evidence of improved outcomes in fertility and reduced risk of pregnancy related complications after bariatric surgery and weight loss. We suggest that there is a case for considering bariatric surgery for treatment of morbidly obese patients with PCOS.

N2  - Background: and methods In a cross-sectional epidemiological study of headache disorders in neurology clinic (August 22- November 20.2009), information on types of headaches, quality, severity, location, duration, frequency, precipitating factors, age of onset, influence of menstruation and pregnancy, positive familial history, use of oral contraceptive pills and other epidemiological factors including socioeconomic and age/sex composition was collected. Any types of headaches was ascertained by a clinical interview and examination using the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headaches Society. The prevalence of migraine and tension type headache was also analyzed in relation to variables of life style (physical activity and sleep pattern) and associated signs and symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia). Results: In this study migraine and tension headache were also compared in variable aspects with each other. (1) Headache was more prevalent in women than men (F/M = 3/1). (2) The most common types of headache included: tension type headache T.T.H (41.4%), migraine (31.2%) and unclassified headaches (17.2%). (3) Migraine and T.T.H were more prevalent in early adult life and middle ages. (4) In both migraine and tension type headache the time profiles (duration, frequency, age of onset), quality and location were like that noted in textbook and previous studies. (5) In both migraine and tension type headache the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental tension and frequent headaches were accompanied with psychiatric problems (e.g. depression and or anxiety). (6) Nausea, vomiting, phonophobia and photophobia were the most common associated symptoms in both of them. (7) Positive familial history and aggravation of headache in premenstrual period were more commonly seen in patients with migraine than tension type headache. In conclusion using the operational diagnostic criteria of International Headache Society in clinical practice, treating, teaching, clinical and epidemiological research is very useful and must also be applied for patients.

N2  - Introduction: The first months after delivery are a special time for mother and child. Changes of the mother's body, the family structure, the relationship and the social environment influence the psychological balance of the woman. Methods: In interdisciplinary cooperation 620 patients were asked about pain, pregnancy and delivery. The data of the 3 - 6 months postpartal interviews on the telephone were collected by a standardized questionnaire, 92 were evaluated. The pain was determined by the pain score of the visual analogue scale. Results: 23% of the mothers felt extremely exhausted after a 3 - 6 months postpartum. 38% could not think of any further delivery. These statements were influenced by the following factors: 23% of the mothers didn't see themselves anymore as attractive, 8% felt themselves at least less attractive than before pregnancy. 2% felt themselves left alone by their partner. 14% had pain which was related directly with pregnancy, delivery or breast feeding. For 15% the experience of their social environment had changed. 23% of these mothers don't go out anymore. Discussion: Having a child is for many women very fulfilling. But exhaustion and lack of sleep in combination with changes in the social network may lead to negative emotions. From that, serious postpartum depressions can emerge. If this is a case, tensions also in mother-child-bonding can be observed.

N2  - Psychopathology and gender are intimately connected. Women suffer more from depression anxiety syndromes and eating disorders whereas severe mental disorders appear later in life in women. There are several major differences affecting response to treatment. It is obvious that women differ from men in biological rhythms. It is also known that response to medications is strongly influenced by diurnal rhythms. Another variable is the fact that the site of action, ie, the brain, differs in men and women. There are special areas which are gender specific; these include fertility, pregnancy and lactation. It appears that women show a different pattern of response to psychiatric medication. Of special note is a different side effect profile. In spite of these, very often women are excluded from drug trials and are thus denied the gender-specific information needed. These issues will be further discussed in the presentation.

N2  - Objective: Spike and wave complex and slow waves are characteristics of ictal EEG patterns in myoclonic seizures. In this case, we show atypical EEG changes in myoclonic seizures and discuss its mechanism. Case report: This 26-year-old man was the product of a normal pregnancy and delivery. He presented with myoclonic seizures and fever at age ten months. At age seventeen months he started having myoclonic seizures without fever. He was diagnosed with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy at hospital A and he was prescribed valproic acid (VPA). At age three, his seizures became more severe and they persisted throughout the day. At age of five, he switched to the hospital B. His seizure frequency reduced from once a month to a few times a year with VPA, carbamazepine, and clonazepam. His seizures disappeared at age nineteen. At age twenty-six, his seizures recurred and persisted all day long. Most of his seizures were noted at the onset of sleep. Topiramate and diazepam were ineffective. He had myoclonic status and was admitted into hospital C. Infusion of midazolam stopped seizures and he was transferred to our hospital. Myoclonic status began again while in our hospital. We observed 15 Hz to 16 Hz generalized fast waves as his ictal EEG changes. He did not lose consciousness during seizures. Interictal EEG showed normal background and paroxysmal fast activities. There were no special findings in magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalogram, and single photon emission computed tomography. His IQ was 37 on the Tanaka-Binet intelligence test. Conclusions: Fast waves which were seen in myoclonic status are characteristic in this case. We will discuss this atypical EEG pattern and consider the diagnosis.

N2  - Background: Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake, circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level. Conclusions/Significance: ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans. © 2010 Kovanen et al.

N2  - Health is not only not being ill or handicapped but also being in a mood of goodness in physically, mentally and socially. Physical activity is important as much as nutrition and sleep. Physical activity ,which is a concern of public health and one of the objectives of improving health, is known to sustain a steady body mass; support endurance, strength and agility; and lower the risk of getting sick. Although the benefits of physical activity on health is clearly understood recently, it is admitted that the uttermost effect on the reduction of physical activity is environmental factors. A moderate activity, approxiamately 30 minutes per day and 4-5 times per week will also affect the health in a favorable way. Physical activity, especially in childhood period; is vital for growth and maturation, courage and good habits, success at school, preventing from addiction to smoke and drugs. On the other hand in adolesence period; participation to competetive sports have a benefical influence on character development and is helpful for lowering the risk of chronic ilnesses at adulthood by hindering from putting on excessive weight. In addition moderate level activities performed at adulthood is rewarding for the losses related with aging. Moreover; physical activity is gaining importance at pregnancy, menopause and post-menopause period. It is acknowledged that motionless lifestyle has a substantial effect on the accumlative rise of obesity and for this reason, physical activity takes place in the prevention of obesity, treatment and sustaining the body mass after weight loss. The influence of physical activity is reasonably significant in the control of blood pressure, blood lipids, blood sugar, vessel and musculoskeletal system. Besides; it has positive effects on cancer, immunity system and mental health. As a result; like drug treatment, exercise treatment takes an important role to struggle with diseases.

N2  - Results: The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in non-pregnant young women is about 5%. The extent to which SDB occurs and impacts GT in pregnancy has been understudied. We explored sleep quality and SDB, in relationship to GT and pregnancy outcomes in 157 women. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Berlin questionnaire were administered at the time of the screening 50g OGTT (mean gestational age 26.0 + 4.3 wks). Sleep quality was poor (mean PSQI 7.4+3.7; 65% of women had a value> 5.0, the upper limit of normal). Mean ESS was 7.9+4.7, reflective of a high degree of daytime sleepiness; 40% had a score above the normal limit of 8.0. 92% had interrupted sleep most often due to the urge to void (53.9%) or increased thirst (51.9%). 27% were at high risk for SDB. 126 women (80%) had normal GT (NGT) and 31(20%) had abnormal GT(20 GDM and 11 with one-abnormal value(OAV) on 100g OGTT). The abnormal GT group was older (30.8+5.6 vs. 27.7+5.4 yr, p<0.01), had a higher pre-pregnancy BMI (32.3+7.2 vs. 27.6+8.1 kg/m2, p<0.01), and a higher prevalence of diabetes in a first-degree relative (66.7% vs. 21.6%, p<0.01). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in ESS, % with ESS>8, PSQI score, % with PSQI>5, sleep duration, mood score, % with high SDB risk and offspring birth weight (BW). Nine GDM and one OAV had overnight polysomnography(PSG). Total sleep time was 406+73 min with a low sleep efficiency of 83.6+18.3%. The mean Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) was 11.1+10.7 events/h. Seven (70%) had an AHI>5, the cutoff for SDB. GDM women without SDB had offspring with BW of 4033+187 gm, while BW in offspring of those with SDB was 3555+208 gm (p=0.05). Summary: 1. Pregnancy is associated with decreased sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness. 2. Although questionnaires did not reveal differences in sleep quality between NGT and abnormal GT women, the latter had a strikingly high prevalence of SDB by PSG. 3. GDM women with SDB had smaller offspring than those without SDB. These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may contribute to the risk of GDM in pregnant women who are overweight or obese.

N2  - Objectives: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well known. However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance related to fetal movement have not been done. In 2008, we reported a long-term monitoring system for fetal movement during maternal sleep at home using a newly developed sensor (Early Human Dev 84:595-603). We confirmed that the new sensor was more sensitive than maternal subjective evaluation but less sensitive than ultrasound imaging. For the present study, we developed a new fetal movement recorder and a new system ofanalysis. At first, we examined weekly variation in fetal movement during pregnant women's sleep to check the success of the system of analysis for fetal movement. Methods: We developed a small capacitive acceleration sensor with high output power (700 mV.0.1 G)-1). The recorder (290 g, 77 mm 27 mm 140 mm) consists of two sensors (one for fetal movement; one for maternal movement), a biological amplifier, and an MMC card drive. Pregnant women can operate it by themselves. The analysis can display both fetal and maternal movements, automatically detect fetal movement, change the threshold of fetal movement, count detected movements based on time, automatically or manually exclude artifacts coming from the mother, and make a comparison based on gestation weeks. The subjects were eight normal pregnant women (29-39 yr) who gave written informed consent. They recorded fetal movement once every four weeks from 20 to 36 gestation weeks. They put the fetal sensor on their abdomens and the maternal sensor on their thighs, and recorded fetal movement using the recorder during nocturnal sleep. Results: Median counts for fetal movement detected per hour during maternal sleep were 70 at 20 weeks, 149 at 24 weeks, 114 at 28 weeks, 177 at 32 weeks, and 133 at 36 weeks. There were individual differences. There were a few problems excluding maternal respiration automatically. Conclusion: The pregnant women were able to easily record fetal movement using the new recorder at night by themselves. It will be necessary to collect more data on normal pregnant subjects and to improve the system of analysis to exclude maternal artifacts.

N2  - Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of short term sleep deprivation (SD) on the sleep pattern in pregnant and nonpregnant rats. Methods: Cortical EEG, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor activity were recorded 24 h in 18 female Wistar rats in the “diskover-water” paradigm. Before the experiments rats were adapted to experimental situation and were able to move across the rotating disk without falling in water. Then polysomnogramm was recorded for three sequential days in the control group 1 (n = 12) without disk rotation. On the next day non-pregnant rats of experimental group 1 (n = 6) underwent SD procedure with pre-set program of disk rotation from 11:00 to 14:00 during three sequential days. Other 6 rats (experimental group 2) were subjected to SD during 5-7th days of pregnancy. EEG, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor activity were also constantly recorded during three days of SD. In control group 2 (n = 6) polysomnogramm was recorded during 5- 7th days of pregnancy, but rats of this control group were not sleep deprived. Results: Data analysis revealed that sleep intensity in pregnant rats, comparing to non-pregnant rats, increased during the first hours after SD, and essential rebound of REM sleep took place. Sleep pattern during the following off-light 12 h was not changed. Conclusion: It is concluded that during the first week of pregnancy in rats homeostatic compensation of the SD works more effective in comparison with non-pregnant rats.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the mood of depressed women (DW) during pregnancy or postpartum would improve more with late wake therapy (LWT) versus early wake therapy (EWT) and correlate with sleep quality measures. Methods: Twenty one DW (7 pregnant, 14 postpartum), mean age 29 years, were randomized in a cross-over design to EWT (sleep 03:00- 07:00 hours) versus LWT (sleep 21:00-01:00 hours) followed by a night of recovery sleep (RS-22:30-06:30 hours). Mood ratings (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-HDRS plus atypical items; Beck Depression Inventory-BDI; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale- EPDS) and sleep quality measures (polysomnography-PSG; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PSQI; Sleep Quality Ratings-SQR) were administered pre-and post-treatment (after RS). Results: HDRS, but not BDI or EPDS, scores were reduced by LWT in pregnant (P= .045) and postpartum (.016) DW, and by EWT in pregnant (.007) and postpartum (.022) DW. LWT improved HDRS scores by 56.2%; EWT by 29.8% in pregnant and postpartum DW, but the difference was not significant (ns). After LWT, pregnant DW had shorter REM latency (.019), more stage 2% sleep (.026) and less WASO (.053); postpartum women had more REM% (.003). After EWT, pregnant DW had more REM density (.055) and postpartum women a shorter REM latency (.005). BDI, PSQI and SQR subjective ratings were ns. After LWT in postpartum DW, TST correlated with HDRS delta (.029) and % change (.016) scores; REM min with % change (.045) scores. After EWT, TST (.047), SE (.013) and WASO (.021) correlated with % change HDRS scores. Conclusions: Both EWT and LWT reduced depressive symptoms as measured by the HDRS with atypical items in pregnant and postpartum women. The difference between the treatments was not significant. PSG measures tended to show more REM sleep after EWT and LWT in both pregnant and postpartum DW, but there were no significant differences noted with subjective measures (PSQI, SQR). TST was the sleep measure that correlated positively with mood change most often. The findings parallel those reported with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder where both EWT and LWT equally improved mood and REM sleep changes correlated with clinical response (Parry et al. 1999).

N2  - Serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are of increasing use in pregnant women, but their long-term effects on the child are largely unknown. On the basis of our recent experimental data in newborn mice [1], we tested the hypothesis that in utero SSRI treatment will induce, through transient hyper-activation of 5-HT1A receptors [2] in the fetus, life-long alterations of sleep regulation and emotional behaviour. Method: Gestating females were treated from the first until the last day of gestation with fluoxetine (18 or 25 mg kg)0-1 day) -1 in drinking water). Control animals drank plain water. The progeny of these mice then underwent a number of tests at 8-16 weeks of age. These included: polygraphic sleep analysis, locomotor activity in a novel environment and the tail suspension test. Results: - Sleep studies showed abnormal sleep patterns in the adult mice exposed to prenatal fluoxetine, and notably an increase in REMsleep quantity. These alterations were larger in females than in male mice, with an increase of REM sleep time of +29.7% and +21.4% compared to control mice, respectively. We also observed a tendency towards a more fragmented sleep pattern. - The locomotor activity in a novel environment was assessed during one hour. Prenatal fluoxetine-treated animals exhibited decreased activity that was significant in females (P = 0.03, two way ANOVA repeated over time). This was observed during essentially the first 12 min. of the test session. - The tail suspension test (6 min. duration) was used to assess the helplessness after prenatal fluoxetine exposure. Fluoxetine treated mice exhibited more immobility in this test, suggesting that they might be more inclined to develop a depressive-like behaviour. Conclusion: Our data show that prenatal exposure to the SSRI fluoxetine in mice can induce significant changes in sleep and behaviour related to depression. They suggest that prenatal fluoxetine treatment can promote depressive-like states in adult mice. Further investigations should help to decipher the serotonergic mechanisms underlying these alterations, and could open the way to novel pharmacological issues for the treatment of depression during pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine associations of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), nap duration and steady night-shift work with GCT levels after controlling for risk factors. Methods: A group of 104 pregnant women who underwent a full polysomnography in the first trimester and a glucose challenge test (GCT), and completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and house questionnaires were studied. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine the clinical characteristics that were significantly associated with GCT results. Using GCT values as the dependent variable, sleep and demographic variables having a P < 0.2 in a bivariate analysis were reevaluated in full linear regression models as independent variables. Results: In unadjusted linear regression analysis, variables with a P < 0.2 were first-trimester BMI (kg m)-2) (b = 0.51,P = 0.12), firsttrimester neck circumference (b = 1.89, P = 0.02), parity (b = 8.14, P = 0.09), first-trimester RDI≥ 15 (b = 49.91, P = 0.004), habitual snoring (b = 19.27, P = 0.01), steady night-shift work (b = 13.09, P = 0.12), second-trimester nap duration (b = 0.07, P = 0.02) and PSQI-sleep duration subscale (b = 4.25, P = 0.08). In the final multivariable model, first-trimester RDI≥ 15 (b = 38.88, P = 0.02) and second-trimester nap duration (b = 0.06, P = 0.03) were significantly associated with increasing GCT values after adjustment for BMI, parity and nocturnal sleep duration. Conclusion: SDB and longer day-napping are associated with higher GCT values. Day-napping may occur due to sleep disturbances that increase sympathetic activation. This may in turn carry over in wakefulness to induce insulin resistance. Even minor degrees of increased glucose intolerance may be associated with increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Further research is needed to determine whether pregnant women with SDB and longer daynapping are at risk for GDM and other adverse perinatal outcomes.

N2  - We studied the effects of adverse conditions such as constant light (LL) on the circadian rhythm of malate (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37) and lactate (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) dehydrogenase activities of the testes of male Wistar rats on postnatal day 28 (PN28), anxietylike behavior (elevated plus-maze test) at PN60 and sexual behavior at PN120. The rats were assigned to mother groups on day 10 of pregnancy: control (12-h light/dark), LL (light from day 10 to 21 of pregnancy), and LL+Mel (LL and sc injection to the mothers of a daily dose of melatonin, 1 mg/kg body weight at circadian time 12, from day 17 to 21 of pregnancy). LL offspring did not show circadian rhythms of MDH (N = 62) and LDH (N = 63) activities (cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher). They presented a 44.7% decrease in open-arm entries and a 67.9% decrease in time (plus-maze test, N = 15, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test), an increase in mounting (94.4%), intromission (94.5%) and ejaculation (56.6%) latencies (N = 12, P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test) and lower numbers of these events (61, 59 and 73%, respectively; P < 0.01, N = 12) compared to controls. The offspring of the LL+Mel group presented MDH and LDH circadian rhythms (P < 0.05, N = 50, cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher), anxiety-like and sexual behaviors similar to control. These findings supported the importance of the melatonin signal and provide evidence for the protective effects of hormones on maternal programming during gestation. This protective action of melatonin is probably related to its entrainment capacity, favoring internal coupling of the fetal multioscillatory system.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Stress causes infertility and ovarian dysfunction. Stress response is controlled by hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) and sympathoadrenal system (SAS).We analyzed relations of HPA and SAS with ovarian dysfunction and IVF outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study 1 included 157 women with ovarian dysfunction and 7 normal volunteers. The patients were classified to 8 groups: PCOS, PCOS with habitual abortion, low body weight (BW), elevated FSH, elevated PRL, endometriosis, high age and idiopathic. HPA was analyzed by circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Circadian rhythm was classified into normal (N) and 4 abnormal types: low-morning (LM), plateau (P), V-shaped (V), and flat (F) types. SAS was evaluated by plasma catecholamines. Study 2 compared rates of pregnancy and abortion in 178 IVF cycles between normal and abnormal HPA. RESULTS: Study 1: Incidence of abnormal circadian rhythm in salivary cortisol was significantly higher with ovarian dysfunction than in normal volunteers (48% vs. 0%) The incidence was high in PCOS with habitual abortion (86%), low BW (60%) and PCOS (53%). DST was worsened in types N, LM, P, V and F in this order. The incidence of elevated catecholamines was prominently high in PCOS with habitual abortion (86%), compared with other ovarian dysfunction (0%-27%) and normal volunteers (0%). Study 2: IVF pregnancy rates were similar in any type, but abortion rate was significantly higher in V and F types than in N, LM and P types (50% vs. 19%). Abortion rate was significantly higher with abnormal DST than with normal DST (50% vs. 21.4%). CONCLUSION: Abnormal HPAwas identified by the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in half of ovarian dysfunction, especially frequently in PCOS and low BW. Abnormal HPA and SAS were frequent in PCOS with habitual abortion, and also were associated with abortion in IVF. Stress-response- mechanism is closely related to ovarian function and maintenance of pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: This study describes the actigraphically estimated sleep and circadian rhythm outcomes experienced by a single-case triad of two new parents and their 10-12 week old newborn son over a 2 week period. To the knowledge of the author data presented herein are from the youngest infant ever to be examined actigraphically. Methods: Two middle-aged healthy married adults and their newborn son were approached and asked to wear Cambridge Neurotechnology actiwatches each for a 2 week period. The father (37) was in full-time employment at the time of testing and had returned to work 1 month prior to testing after statutory paternity leave. The mother (34) was on full-time maternity leave at the time of testing. The infant (full-term, natural delivery, 7 lb 11 oz delivery weight, no complications during pregnancy or at birth for either mother or child, normal weight gain and growth patterns (consistently on the 50th centile for weight), and the infant being entirely breastfed up to the point of and during testing). Parents wore their actiwatches on their non-dominant wrist, the infant on his left ankle. Results: Findings indicate a strong association between the sleep and circadian rhythm outcomes of the triad, with both maternal and paternal sleep being disturbed by a large amount of nighttime activity in the infant. Maternal sleep tended to be disturbed more at the end of the night, with paternal sleep more disturbed earlier in the night. The infant's sleeping pattern was characteristically normal for such a young child. The findings also indicate increased disruption to the paternal sleep and circadian rhythm outcomes than that seen in the mother. Conclusion: Sleep in new parents is disturbed by caring for a newborn child. Parental sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are highly associated with the activity of the child. Paternal sleep and circadian rhythm outcomes were more disturbed than those of the mother. There is a suggestion that the demands of full-time employment during the day, coupled with caring responsibilities after work, are exacerbating sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in the father. These findings suggest that, although there is marked maternal sleep disruption, it is new fathers who experience worse sleep outcomes as a result of balancing personal and professional demands. Whereas new mothers with: extended periods of maternity leave; a primary focus on the child; and without the professional demands of working fathers, gain an opportunity to rest during the daytime when their child is resting, thus alleviating some sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances.

N2  - With an estimated frequency of 9%, restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common in pregnancy. Severe RLS and iron deficiency was more common in the 7th and 8th months of pregnancy and had profound effects on fatigue, sleepiness and sleep quality (Hü bner, not published). Anecdotal reports suggest the possibility of iron supplementation as therapeutic option of RLS in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of an infusion of ferric carboxymaltose on RLS in pregnant women with RLS and iron deficiency. Pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate to severe RLS with iron deficiency (Ferritin<35 ug/l) or anaemia (Hb<11 g/dl) are enrolled in this open-label non-controlled exploratory single centre study. Depending on Hb, iron substitution is performed with an infusion of 500-900 mg of ferric carboxymaltose. Assessment of the effect of treatment is be done by actigraphy for periodic limb movements in sleep (before and one week after therapy), questionnaires (International RLS Study Group questionnaire (IRLS), fatigue severity scale, Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index) and blood tests (iron, ferritin, CRP) at the screening visit, the therapy visit, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after therapy as well as 2 weeks (questionnaires only) and 6 weeks after delivery. So far seven seven patients have been enrolled and treated with ferric carboxymaltose. All three seven reported a marked decrease in RLS symptoms from the first night after infusion and showed a decrease of the IRLSSG score of 48%, 59% and 61%, 50%, 39%, 67% and 5%, respectively. Six patients have already had a post therapy actigraphy. Four out of six patients showed a decrease of PLMS index by 57%, 57%, 22% and 36%, respectively. In two cases PLMS index was unchanged. So far iron infusion seems to have a positive effect on RLS symptoms and gives substantial relief to the affected patients.

N2  - Objectives: Considering the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. Methods: Female 3 month-old Wistar rats were divided in two experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by a vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 hours daily. After birth, only male litters (six for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail pletismography, and at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area and nordm; of glomeruli by mm3 were evaluated. Results: Offspring from SR, had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group, we also observed a significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter and fewer glomeruli by mm3. Conclusion: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

N2  - Objectives: More studies are being carried out about maternal manipulation and its consequences in the offspring. It is known that sleep deprivation leads to many physiological alterations, which could result in other consequences if they happen during pregnancy. There are no studies regarding sleep deprivation during the preimplantation period and the consequences to the sleep-wake cycle of the offspring. Thus, our objective was to analyze developmental programming effect of maternal sleep deprivation on sleep-wake cycle in male mice offspring. Methods: Given day one of pregnancy in Swiss mice, one group of dams was continuously sleep deprived for 72 hours using the platform technique from gestational days 1 to 3 (PSD 72) and a further group could sleep normally (CT) during the same gestational period. After that the dams could continuous their pregnancy normally. After birth the pups grew without manipulations and, at the 3rd month of age, male offspring was implanted with electrodes to record electrocorticogram and electromyogram signals. Results: We found no differences in all the parameters currently analyzed in the adult offspring records (i.e.: sleep efficiency, sleep latency to slow wave and paradoxical sleep, % of time spent in each cycle stage and stage transitions). On the other hand, an increased number of lighter paradoxical sleep stage episodes in both light and dark periods were observed among PSD 72 group offspring. Conclusion: Considering these data we suggest that sleep deprivation during first stages of pregnancy lead to a lighter paradoxical sleep inthe male adult offspring, which could compromise the sleep quality.

N2  - Objectives: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is well known to be more frequent in women than in men. Women, during specific periods of life such as pregnancy or menopause, have a risk to suffer from RLS twice more than men; this is probably due to hormonal factors, but more studies are needed to better explain all possible mechanisms. We aimed at evaluating the gender effects in a sample of RLS patients referred to our sleep clinic. Methods: All patients referred to our sleep center and diagnosed for RLS, according the IRLS-SG criteria over the last 3 years, were included in this study. They all underwent clinical sleep interviews, sleep and life quality, mood/anxiety questionnaires and video-polysomnography with standard montage. IRLS rating scale (IRLS-RS) and Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS) were administered to all patients to evaluate the RLS severity and daytime somnolence, respectively. Moreover Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Pittsburg Quality Sleep Index (PSQI) and Short Form-36 2v Health Survey (SF-36) tests were administered to a smaller sample. Uni and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Results: 72 RLS patients were enrolled (46 women, mean age 52,9). No statistical differences were found as far as age, BMI, ESS, IRLSRS scores, mean age of onset and symptoms duration between men and women. 38.8% of patients suffered from hypertension, 26.3% from dyslipidemia, 25% from migraine, 11.1% from nocturnal eating disorder, 20.8% from tyropathy, 58.3% from mood/anxiety disorder. Patients with a positive RLS familial history were younger with an earlier mean age of onset compared to sporadic cases. 29 women were menopausal; mean parity index 1.8; in 17% of women symptoms started with the first pregnancy and in 17% with menopause. Video- PSG showed no statistical differences between SE%, WASO, SL, AI, PLMS I; PLMW I in males and females, but N3% was higher in women. Different Dopa-agonists were prescribed to all patients with IRLS-RS improving after 1 month, more in men than in women. BDI, HARS, PSQI, SF36 were administered to 38 patients (30 F). Significant statistical differences were found for PSQI, BDI and HARS as more attained in women. Moreover a menopausal symptom onset seems to be associated with a less serious form of the disorder, whereas RLS onset during pregnancy was more related to the presence of hypertension; also an older age of onset and longer duration of symptoms were risk factors for hypertension. Conclusion: In our sample the M/F ratio was 1:1.7. Both pregnancy and menopause favoured symptoms onset in about 34% of our sample. A major risk for hypertension was seen with RLS onset during pregnancy or at an older age. A positive familial history characterized earlier onset disorder.

N2  - Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated to cardiovascular consequences and to increased mortality. Effective CPAP may alter the evolution of clinical treatment in the long term. The factors associated to the non-compliance to CPAP treatment remain unclear. Thus, the objective here in was to evaluate the variables that lead OSA patients to refuse treatment, to quit treatment within the first month, and to adhere to CPAP after 12 months' treatment. Methods: Seventy two patients with Apnea-Hipopnea Index(AHI) > 20 and diagnosed by polysomnography(PSG)(N1). The subjects underwent clinical exams, anthropometric measures, and given support in adhesion to treatment, immediately after PAP titration PSG(N2) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Group1(G1) was composed of subjects who refused to try the CPAP right after the PSG (N2), Group2(G2) with subjects who quit CPAP treatment after 1 month, and Group3(G3) included patients who adhered to treatment for 12 months. Exclusion criteria were BMI > 40 kg m)-2, major medical or neurologic diseases, pregnancy, and previous contact with the CPAP. Subjects were chosen at random and distributed in 2 groups: CPAP or Sham CPAP. The Sham CPAP device consisted of a CPAP producing up to 1cmH2O of pressure, which maintained the feeling of ventilation within the mask. Statistical analysis: One-way ANOVA, Bonferroni test, Chi-Square. Results: There were no significant differences in BMI among the groups (G1: 30.0,b8.7; G2:28.1 ± 4.3; G3:29.4 ± 3.7;P = 0.7). In the PSG (N1) variables, significant differences were observed in sleep stage 1(G1:8.9 ± 8.7;G2:8.1 ± 2.9;G3:5.0 ± 3.6;P = 0.02) and REM sleep (G1:14.4 ± 5.9;G2: 21.3 ± 7.1;G3:17.1 ± 5.5;P = 0.01).There was no difference among the groups in the remaining sleep stages and respiratory parameters for N1. When CPAP titration night (N2) was concerned, there was no difference among the 3 groups. G1 patients (who refused CPAP treatment) were older when compared to the other 2 groups G1(60.8 ± 8.7), G2(51.1 ± 10.9), G3(54.2 ± 8.5),P = 0.01.There was no difference neither to gender nor type of CPAP used (CPAP and Sham) among the 3 groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Results suggest that older patients tended to refuse trying the CPAP and presented alteration in their sleep structure on the night of the diagnostic PSG when compared to those who used the CPAP for at least a month. Of note, the titration PSG data (N2) did not differ within the CPAP adhesion groups.

N2  - Prospective, crossover, randomised, single-blind study (NCT01062295) to perform and objective and subjective assesment of sleep in car passengers using a new device (Siesta-System-, under patent evaluation: WO 2009118432) that works as a seat head hammock. Forty volunteers (43.5 ± 0.1 years old) participated in this study. Exclusion critera were: acute or severe chronic disease or any related with sleep, pregnancy, Body Mass Index > 40, consumption of alcohol > 15 grams or any excitant drinks on the day of testing. All participants underwent a medical examination and were questioned on sleepiness, clinical history, drug use and sleep habits. They signed an informed consent approved by the Txagorritxu Hospital Scientific Committee. Volunteers went on two car journeys in the same night riding in the front passenger's seat: Control journey with normal headrest, and Treatment journey using the seat head hammock. Both journeys performed an identical itinerary lasting 105 min. separated by a 15min. break. They were carried out in a randomized order generated by computer software and kept blind to researchers. Conventional polysomnographic recordings with an ambulatory system were conducted during journeys. At the end of the session, volunteers answered questionnaires for each journey about subjective perception of rest, sleep and neck discomfort. Seat head hammock system compared to normal headrest increased sleep efficiency (P = 0,001) and percentage of N3 and REM sleep (P = 0,007), shortened sleep latency (P = 0,004) and improved participants' scores on all subjective perception questionnaires (P < 0,001). There was no period effect for any variable. Few studies have been conducted on sleep in positions other than lying down. Those that have beed done have shown that sleep is possible in up-right or sitting positions but it is shorter and poorer quality. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted about sleep in a sitting position while in motion, as it happens with vehicle passengers. According to our results, objective and subjective sleep are improved using Siesta-System- . Further studies will be performed to assess neck postural health using this new device in comparison to a normal headrest. To get a good rest in a vehicle while maintaining a healthy neck position is important for those who have to travel frequently or for professional second drivers.

N2  - Objectives: A number of studies are being carried out about maternal manipulation and its consequences in the offspring. It is known that sleep deprivation leads to many physiological alterations, which could result in other consequences if they happen during pregnancy. There is evidence that sleep deprivation triggers oxidative processes in various organs and tissues, including specific brain regions. Thus, our objective was to analyze developmental programming effect of maternal sleep deprivation on antioxidant enzymes expression in the hypothalamus of male mice. Methods: Given day one of pregnancy in Swiss mice, one group of dams was continuously sleep deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 1-3 (PSD 72). A further group was sleep deprived by gentle handling for six hours at 72 hours of pregnancy (GH 72). A last group could sleep normally (CT). At the 3rd month of age, male offspring was euthanized by decapitation, the hypothalamus was harvested and mRNA isolated by Trizol- method. Catalase (CAT) and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) mRNA expression were quantified by real time PCR using GAPDH as housekeeping gene. Results: Although the absence of sleep in mothers results in some biochemical and biometric changes in the offspring, gene expression of CAT showed no significant difference between control and sleep deprived groups (CT = 1.00 ± 0.10 a.u. versus GH 72 = 1.12 ± 0.16 a.u versus PSD 72 = 1.11 ± 0.18 a.u.; one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05). The same result could be observed in mnSOD gene expression in which sleep deprived groups did not present differences when compared to control group (CT = 1.0 ± 0.10 a.u. versus GH72 = 0.97 ± 0.11 versus PSD 72 = 0.89 ± 0.06 a.u.; one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Considering these data we suggest that sleep deprivation during first stages of pregnancy do not lead to significant hypothalamic alterations in the male offspring related to oxidative stress parameters, evidenced by no changes in CAT and mnSOD expression.

N2  - Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of many factors contributing to increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular risk may be related to microinflammation, vascular damage and high oxidative stress state. The aim of the study was to ascertain if there is any connection between OSA and its severity and oxidative stress related markers. As these markers we chose novel markers as matrix-metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), high sensitive CRP (hsCRP), pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). Further biochemical markers were also measured (fibrinogen, standard biochemical markers and blood count). Methods: Fifty one men suspected for OSA indicated for night polygraphy were included in the study. Patients were clinically examined and then they underwent night polygraphy. Ventilation parameters were measured: Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), mean blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) and time of blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation below 90% (SpO2 ≤ 90%). Morning venous blood samples were taken. Results: We found strong positive correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and levels of Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP, fibrinogen, and negative correlation BMI with sRAGE. From ventilation parameters we found positive correlation ODI and SpO2 ≤ 90% with markers MMP-9 and hsCRP. sRAGE level correlated with AHI and ODI negatively. Mean night saturation correlated negatively with Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fibrinogen. There was no correlation between ventilation parameters and markers MMP-2, PAPP-A and Zn. Compared to severity of OSA there was significant difference in levels of hsCRP and Cu between patients with AHI ≤ 5 and AHI ≥ 30 independently to BMI. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea can participate as one of many conditions for oxidative stress state in the body. MMP-9, hsCRP, sRAGE and Cu seem to be strong predictors of oxidative stress in OSA patients. Strong correlation between oxidative stress related markers and OSA is elucidated by connection of these to BMI. BMI is may be primary condition of oxidative stress.

N2  - Objectives: The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing among children worldwide. It has been suggested that children with a high birth weight or a pre-pregnant obese mother are in high risk of developing overweight. Previous studies found an association between sleep duration and overweight, but few studies have examined if there is an association between sleep quality and weight status. Methods: A total of 129 children aged 2-5 years and in high risk of developing overweight were selected. Information on a broken sleep pattern was obtained from a questionnaire filled out by their parents. Height and weight was measured, and Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated. Linear regression analyses were performed. Results: BMI was 1.55 kg m-2 higher in children with a broken sleep and awakenings several times during the night compared to children with an unbroken sleep and without awakenings during the night (P= 0.03) after adjusting for socioeconomic status and age. Conclusion: Having a broken sleep pattern seems positively associated with BMI in 2-5 year old children, who are in high-risk of developing overweight.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for OSA and its short-term use has been related to modest decrease in blood pressure (BP) levels. Objective: To compare the 24 hours behavior of BP and heart rate (HR) among OSA patients after 6 and 12 months of effective CPAP (C) or Sham (S) treatments. Methods: Twenty-one patients with moderate to severe OSA who agreed to use CPAP were included in the study (12 in “C” group and 9 in “S” group). Patients were recruited from the sleep clinic of Universidade Federal de São Paulo Brazil. Inclusion criteria were: patients aging 35-65 years age, with BMI < 40 Kg m)-2. Pregnancy, major pulmonary, cardiac or neurological diseases, and upper airway condition that could prevent the use of the CPAP were excluded. In addition, patients who had had contact with CPAP were also excluded. They were randomly allocated in the CPAP or Sham CPAP groups. Sham CPAP consisted of a CPAP device adapted to deliver up to 1 cmH2O pressure, but maintaining the sensation of ventilation into the mask. All patients underwent to clinical evaluation to assess anthropometric and PSG variables, and to 24-h BP and HR monitoring every 30 min. Statistical analysis: One way ANOVA, Repeated measures ANOVA; P ≤ 0.05. Results: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between CPAP and Sham groups. The mean age were 52.54 ± 7.92 year in “C” group and 54.11 ± P < 7.95 year in “S” group (P = 0.6). The groups did not differ in compliance parameter either (C: 4.72 ± 2.07 versus S: 4.02 ± 2.02 h of daily used; P = 0.4). After 6 months of therapy, there were no differences in systolic BP, average BP and HR between groups when considering baseline pressures. Diastolic BP showed a decreased after 6 months of effective CPAP when compared to Sham (78.19 ± 7.34 mmHg versus 80.86 ± 7.31 mmHg, consecutively; P = 0.01). Twelve months of effective CPAP therapy was associated with improvements in SBP (130.13 ± 10.34 mmHg to 121.46 ± 9.53 mmHg; P < 0.001), DPB (78.34 ± 9.67 mmHg to 72.74 ± 7.58 mmHg; P < 0.001) and average BP (99.72 ± 9.12 mmHg to 93.22 ± 8.34 mmHg; P < 0.001). There were no changes in HR. Conclusion: Six-months of CPAP treatment is associated with improvement in DBP, nevertheless, only after 12 months of effective CPAP therapy there were decreases in SBP and average BP. CPAP did not change HR parameters.

N2  - Aim: Investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD), following both a dimensional and a categorial approach. Methods: 581 women (mean age = 29.8; standard deviation = 4.53) in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers participated again in the study. Results: Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology (15.2% of the total variance explained) and women with higher NA were 4.6 times (CI 95% = 1.69-12.74) and 5.3 times (CI95% = 2.26-12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition; DSM-IV/International Classification of Diseases-10th edition; ICD- 10, respectively) than women with lower values of NA. Lifetime depression was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and of ICD-10/PPD diagnoses (OR = 2.6; CI95% = 1.16-4.38). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be an important protective factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR = ).94; CI95% = 1.20-2.33). Insomnia in pregnancy was not per se a risk factor for PPD caseness (PPD/DSM-IV or PPD/ICD-10) but it was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Controlling NA, PA and lifetime depression, insomnia lost its predictive role, suggesting that these variables may act as mediators. Conclusions: Associations between insomnia, NA, PA and lifetime depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology.

N2  - Introduction: The most common test used in third-trimester of pregnancy in order to check fetal wellbeing is the non-stress test (NST).One of the disadvantages of NST is its high rate of false-positive results. The most common cause of a nonreactive test is a period of fetal inactivity or quiet sleep. Many different methods have been tried to decrease the number of nonreactive NSTs. Probably the most common method of provoking fetal reaction is maternal ingestion of fruit juice as a source of glucose. The aim of this study is to determine whether maternal oral glucose .ingestion influences non-stress test indices Methods: A clinical trial study was performed at Amir-al-momenin hospital in Ahvaz on 35 primiparous non-laboring healthy women with normal singleton pregnancy at 37-40 weeks of gestation. All women had a normal oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. The women were evaluated in a fasting state (last meal more than 3 hours before non-stress test). The NSTs were performed 1 hour after oral ingestion of 50g of glucose in 240ml of water in first day and an equal volume of water during second day. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t-test and .chi-square test and p<0.05 was considered significant Results: There was no significant difference in fetal heart rate baseline, number and amplitude of fetal heart rate accelerations, beat to beat variability and number of variable decelerations .(among women whether receiving glucose or water (p>0.05).However, there was an increase in duration of fetal heart rate acceleration followed by oral ingestion of glucose (p<0.01 .Conclusion: Maternal oral glucose ingestion is not able to reduce the false-positive results of non-stress tests.

N2  - Objectives: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common movement - related sleep disorder affecting up to 10% of the general population. RLS exists in idiopathic (familial or sporadic) and secondary form. Iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy are well established secondary causes of RLS. Recently, multiple sclerosis (MS) was identified as another common cause for secondary RLS, the prevalence of RLS in MS patients range from 13.3 to 37.5%. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of RLS among the Czech patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: We enrolled consecutive Czech patients with multiple sclerosis coming to our MS center. Each patient underwent a semistructured interview conducted by a physician skilled in RLS diagnostics. A patient was considered to be affected by RLS if he/she met all four standard criteria at life long interval. Exclusion criteria for the study were dopaminergic and antidopaminergic drugs, or any other diseases known to be cause of secondary RLS. Results: A total of 765 subjects (553 females, 211 males, mean age 36.54, ± SD 9.5) with multiple sclerosis were included in the study. The mean MS duration on was 9.1 ± 7.36 years, the median EDSS score was 2.0 (quartiles 1.5 and 3.5). Out of all examined patients, 76% were affected by the relaps - remitting MS form, 14.4% had clinically isolated syndrome, 5.6% were in secondary progression and 0.9% had primary progressive form of MS. The diagnosis of RLS was confirmed in 245 subjects (32.1%, 95% CI 28.7-35.4%) with MS, mean age at onset of RLS symptoms was 29.1, SD 10.4 years, MS symptoms preceded RLS by 2.5, SD 8.7 years. Patients suffering from both MS and RLS were significantly older (38.6 versus 35.6 years), had longer durations of MS symptoms (11.0 versus 8.2 years) and had higher EDSS score (2.9 versus 2.3). Conclusion: We confirmed the findings of previous studies that life long RLS prevalence is high in patients with multiple sclerosis. RLS should be considered amongst the symptomatic RLS forms. The patients, who are affected by RLS symptoms, seem to be in more advanced stage of MS.

N2  - Objectives: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in the neonate, such as sleep structure alterations. Because of concerns of underreporting, investigators perform biochemical testing to confirm the level of exposure of neonates. Unlike cotinine assays, benzo[a]pyrene-DNA (B[a]P) adducts are an accurate, informative biomarker about chronic exposure but have never been used in neonates. We examined the sensitivity and specificity of smoking and non-smoking status by comparing maternal self-reports of smoking status and neonates' B[a]P-DNA adducts. Methods: Data were collected from 64 mother/newborn pairs recruited from the Amiens University Medical Center (France) between October 2007 and May 2008. B[a]P-DNA adducts were determined in neonates' saliva samples by a competitive immunoassay technique. 3 groups were constituted according to whether the mothers either did not smoke (n = 25; control group), or stated having smoked less (n = 18; S- group) or more (n = 21; S+ group) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy. Results: Cut-off values of 12 and 18 fmol/50 μg DNA had the best balance of true positive and true negative reports and were used to differentiate the control and S-groups, and the S-and S+ groups, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of self-reports of smoking status throughout pregnancy compared with B[a]P-DNA adducts between the control and S-groups was high with 88.9% and 96% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% and 100% respectively between the S-and S+ groups. Also, we found a positive linear relationship between the reported daily number of cigarettes smoked by the mother during pregnancy and the level of B[a]P-DNA adducts in the neonate (r2 = 68.8%; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that self-reported smoking exposure during pregnancy is highly accurate, when compared to B[a]PDNA adducts in neonates. This study highlights the possibility of using, by a non-invasive method, a biomarker of chronic in utero exposure to smoking to determine the level of exposure of neonates.

N2  - Unprovoked seizures are common, affecting approximately 4% of the population by age 80. Only approximately 30% to 40% of patients with a first seizure will have a second unprovoked seizure. The risk of a recurrence is highest during the period immediately after the initial seizure. The rate, at which first recurrences occur, drops off with increasing time since the first seizure (Hauser et al., 1990; Shinnar et al., 1996). Decisions regarding treatment of single unprovoked seizures must balance seizure recurrence risk, the potential impact of a recurrent seizure, the likelihood of adverse effects of treatment, and patient preference. Careful history-taking and appropriate investigation together with a clear explanation provided to patient and family are important. It is essential to assure that the event, in fact, represents the first seizure. It is worth asking about partial events, absence seizures and myoclonic jerks. These may have been occurring for many years without a diagnosis being made (Kwan & Brodie, 2000). For the first unprovoked seizures, immediate treatment reduces the risk of seizure recurrence in the short term, but does not change the long-term prognosis for epilepsy. In fact, immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment reduces the occurrence of seizures in the next 1-2 years, but does not affect longterm remission in individuals with single or infrequent seizures. (Marson et al.,2005). Risk factors for seizure recurrence include a history of remote neurologic insult, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalogram, focal structural lesion on neuroimaging, and family history of epilepsy. Adult patients with these risk factors have a recurrence risk of 60%to 70%and usually should be treated with an AED to prevent seizure recurrence. Without risk factors, the recurrence risk is 20% to 30%, and treatment depends on individual risk-to-benefit ratios and patient preference (Herman, 2004) The risks associated with prescribing AEDs in a person who had a single unprovoked seizure fall into three domains: (1) the risk that treatment will not be effective in preventing seizure relapse, and the consequences thereof; (2) the risks of a person's life being affected by the psychological, social, and legal aspects of receiving treatment for a seizure disorder; (3) the health risks associated with intake of antiepileptic medication (Perucca, 2008). AEDs may cause a variety of adverse reactions, from quite mild to serious. Importantly, there are patient groups who show an increased risk of serious adverse drug reactions (e.g. elderly) or special concerns (e.g. women with childbearing potential - the risk of major malformations in offspring exposed prenatally to AED monotherapy is increased about twofold over the background rate) (Perucca, 2005; Morrow et al., 2006). AED interactions can have serious adverse consequences, such as contraceptive failure in women taking oral contraceptives. The risk associated with AED interactions should be especially considered in patients with comorbidities. However, even in otherwise healthy individuals, including those not receiving any medication at the time an AED is prescribed, there is a chance of potential interaction in future, as AED treatment, as a rule, is initiated for years (Patsalos et al., 2002; Levy & Collins, 2007; Perucca, 2008). Patients with single seizure should be counseled about seizure first aid and general safety measures, including precautions regarding swimming alone, engaging in highrisk activities, driving, possible seizure precipitation by photic stimuli (in generalized epilepsy), sleep deprivation, and alcohol.

N2  - Background: Webb et al (2009) found higher Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) rates in Sweden for infants born to mothers with a hospitalization for psychosis (OR 3.1 95% CI 2.6 3.8). That disparity increased after the Swedish Reducing the Risks (RTR) campaign (RR 4.4 95% CI 3.3 5.8). Risk factors for SIDS include: prone sleep position, male gender; maternal poverty; low birth weight; preterm birth; Indigenous status and exposure to tobacco smoke. RTR campaigns target some risk factors via parental behaviours. A unique Western Australian (WA) population based e-cohort created by record linkage allowed us to measure maternal and infant risk factors for SIDS in women with psychosis before and after the WA RTR campaign. Methods: Cases are live born, singleton infants of mothers with psychosis born in WA 1980-2001. Comparisons are children of mothers with no history of severe mental illness. Results: Relative to before the RTR campaign, after the campaign women with psychosis were significantly more likely to deliver a singleton live born of low birth weight (OR 1.8 95% CI 1.6 1.9) than other women. They were also significantly more likely to deliver a preterm (OR 1.1 95% CI 1.1 1.2) live born baby. Women with psychosis were in poorer health, prior to and during pregnancy, than other women. Conclusions: More vulnerable small and/or preterm live-born babies are now at risk of SIDS. Programs aimed at improving maternal antenatal and post-natal care for women with psychosis may help to prevent SIDS through reduction in risk factors.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation, investigations and treatment of neonatal hypertonia. Methods: Retrospective case note and laboratory results analysis. Results: Following an uneventful pregnancy, five neonates, two boys and three girls, presented with severe hypertonia. Arthrogryposis (3), visual impairment (5), reduction of tone in sleep (4), abnormal jerky breathing pattern (1) and unexplained apnoeic episodes needing ventilation (1) were the presenting features. MRI brain, electromyography, nerve conduction studies, extensive neurometabolic tests, cytogenetic and molecular genetic tests (GLRA1 and tyrosine hydroxylase), anti GAD antibodies were normal in all children. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitters were normal (3), elevated CSF HIAA (1) and low CSF HVA (1). Levodopa showed no response (2), minimal initial response (1) or significant improvement (1). Baclofen showed no response (2), some improvement (2) or moderate improvement (1). Clonazepam (2) and dopamine agonist (1) treatment did not improve hypertonia.Multidisciplinary teams were involved in management of all patients. Mean follow up period was 9.5 months with a range of 6 weeks to 18 months. One baby died at 3 months due to respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis. Recurrent respiratory infections (2), feeding difficulties needing NGT feeds (2), gastroesophageal reflux disease (2), scoliosis (1), severe global developmental delay (4), West Syndrome (1),visual impairment (2), sensorineural hearing loss (1), and chronic lung disease (1) are associated co-morbidities. Conclusion: Neonatal hypertonia is a very rare heterogeneous group of disorders with common final expression. Management can be challenging. Better understanding of the underlying causes will lead to an approach to its diagnosis and management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder is unclear. There are several factors unique to the perioperative period that may increase a patient's risk of perioperative seizures, including medications administered, timing of medication administration, missed doses of antiepileptic medications, and sleep deprivation. We designed this retrospective chart review to evaluate the frequency of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with a documented history of a seizure disorder who received an anesthetic between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2007. Patients excluded from this study include those who had an outpatient procedure or intracranial procedure, ASA classification of V, pregnant women, and patients younger than 2 years of age. The first hospital admission of at least 24 hours during which an anesthetic was provided was identified for each patient. Patient demographics, character of the seizure disorder, details of the surgical procedure, and clinically apparent seizure activity in the perioperative period (within 3 days after the anesthetic) were recorded. RESULTS: During the 6-year study period, 641 patients with a documented seizure disordr were admitted for at least 24 hours after an anesthetic. Twenty-two patients experienced perioperative seizure activity for an overall frequency of 3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-5.2%). The frequency of preoperative seizures (P < 0.001) and the timing of the most recent seizure (P < 0.001) were both found to be significantly related to the likelihood of experiencing a perioperative seizure. As the number of antiepileptic medications increased, so did the frequency of perioperative seizures (P < 0.001). Neither the type of surgery nor the type of anesthetic (general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care) affected the frequency of perioperative seizures in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of perioperative seizures in patients with a preexisting seizure disorder are likely related to the patient's underlying condition. The frequency of seizures is not influenced by the type of anesthesia or procedure. Because patients with frequent seizures at baseline are likely to experience a seizure in the perioperative period, it is essential to be prepared to treat seizure activity regardless of the surgical procedure or anesthetic technique.

N2  - Bariatric surgery is intended for subjects with BMI≥40kg/m2 or ≥35kg/m2 with comorbidities. In any case, the indication can only be envisaged in patients who have had access to specialized medical care, and agree with a prolonged medical follow-up. After 60 years old, physiological age and comorbidities need to be highly considered. In genetic obesity and craniopharyngioma, surgery is exceptional. Main contraindications consist in severe disorders in feeding behaviour, non-stabilized psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug addiction, inability to participate in prolonged medical follow-up. Surgical process includes many important stages: preparation and information by a multidisciplinary team (identify contraindication, give optimal information, look for and treat comorbidities [as sleep apneoas syndrome, diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease], assess nutritional and psychological status and feeding behaviour); the decision of intervention during a concerted analysis by a multidisciplinary team; follow-up (for life) led to screen for nutritional deficiencies and surgical complications, to reinforce diet and physical activity counselling, to adapt to new situations (as pregnancy), and advise psychological care if necessary. © 2010.

N2  - Objective: We sought to evaluate the impact of short sleep duration (SSD) and frequent snoring (FS) on glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Study Design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of healthy nulliparas who participated in a sleep survey study. SSD was defined as <7 hours of sleep per night and FS, as snoring <3 nights per week. Outcomes included 1-hour oral glucose tolerance results and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: A total of 189 women participated; 48% reported an SSD and 18.5% reported FS. SSD and FS were associated with higher oral glucose tolerance values: SSD (116 ± 31 vs 105 ± 23; P = .008) and FS (118 ± 34 vs 108 ± 25; P = .04). Both SSD (10.2% vs 1.1%; P = .008) and FS (14.3% vs 3.3%; P = .009) were associated with a higher incidence of GDM. Even after controlling for potential confounders, SSD and FS remained associated with GDM. Conclusion: SSD and FS are associated with glucose intolerance in pregnancy. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Objective: To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). Study design: The data come from the 1692 participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4 years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058). The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these models. Results: PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and 3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power. Conclusions: Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for internalizing problems.

N2  - Background. Household ownership of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) is increasing, and coverage targets have been revised to address universal coverage with ITNs. However, many households do not have enough nets to cover everyone, and the nets available vary in physical condition and insecticide treatment status. Since 2004, the Government of Tanzania has been implementing the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS), which distributes vouchers for ITNs through antenatal clinics to target pregnant women and their infants. This analysis aimed to determine the following: (1) coverage patterns of bed nets within households according to physical condition and treatment status; (2) who might be at risk if mosquitoes were diverted from occupants of untreated nets to those not using nets? (3) the degree to which those at highest risk of malaria use the most protective nets. Methods. Data from the 2006 TNVS household survey were analysed to assess within-household distribution of net use. The associations between net characteristics and net user were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis was applied to the relationship between the number of holes per net and user characteristics while adjusting for confounders. Results. In households with a net:person ratio better than 1:4 (one net for every four household members), more than 80% of the people in such households reported using a net the previous night. ITNs were most likely to be used by infants, young children (1-4 y), and women of childbearing age; they were least likely to be used by older women (50 y), older children (5-14 y), and adult men. The nets used by infants and women of childbearing age were in better-than-average physical condition; the nets used by older women and older children were in worse-than-average condition; while young children and adult men used nets in intermediate (average) condition. When adjusted for confounders, the nets used by young and older children had more holes than nets used by infants. Conclusions. Infants and other vulnerable groups were most likely to sleep under the most protective nets. Nevertheless, more communication efforts are needed to increase use of intact ITNs within households for children. Further research is necessary to fully understand motivations influencing within-household net distribution. © 2010 Tsuang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disruption is a common complaint of pregnant women. Literature shows that several sleep disorders are more frequent during pregnancy and are associated with maternal and fetal morbidities. Multiple gestation pregnancies are high risk and increasingly common, yet the prevalence of sleep disturbances has not yet been characterized in this population. Methods: As part of a larger ongoing study women pregnant with multiples were surveyed during the last trimester about their sleep. Validated assessments included screens for sleep-disordered breathing, general sleep disturbance (including poor sleep quality, poor daytime functioning, and use of aides to induce sleep), restless leg syndrome, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Results: Thus far women with1346 singleton and 48 multiple gestation pregnancies have been recruited (12.5% triplets, 87.5% twins). There were no differences in demographic information between women carrying multiples verses singletons (age 30.3 ± 5.2 vs. 29.7 ± 5.7 years, pre-pregnancy BMI 26.5 ± 7.0 vs. 25.7 ± 8.4kg/m2, 3rd-trimester BMI 32.4 ± 6.8 vs. 30.6 ± 7.5kg/m2 respectively; P > 0.1 for all comparisons). However women carrying multiples gained more weight than those with singletons (35.1 ± 13.4 vs. 28.0 ± 16.6lbs; P = 0.02). Women with multiple gestations compared to those without were not found to be at a significantly increased risk for any sleep problem (habitual snoring 37% vs. 35%, pregnancy-onset habitual snoring 33% vs. 28%, poor sleep quality 72% vs. 71%, poor daytime functioning 70% vs. 71%, use of sleep aides 25.5% vs. 19%, restless legs 33% vs. 36%, excessive daytime sleepiness 42% vs. 41%; P > 0.3 for all comparisons. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that sleep problems are common in pregnancy but do not affect women carrying multiple gestation pregnancies any more than those with singleton pregnancies.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnant women complain of disturbed sleep. Yet, few studies have quantified sleep in pregnant women particularly during early gestation. Describing and exploring early gestational sleep and how it relates to pregnancy complications is pertinent given the link between disturbed sleep and adverse health outcomes, and especially since the pathophysiology often begins in early gestation. Methods: We present preliminary sleep data on 45 women enrolled in an observational study evaluating the relationship between sleep and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Beginning around 10 wks gestation, each woman completed a sleep diary and wore an actiwatch between 10 - 12 weeks, 14 -16 weeks, and 18 - 20 weeks gestation. On the 15th day of each data collection period, women completed several questionnaires. Results: Women (N = 45) were ∼29 yrs old, 70% were Caucasian and 73% were married. Over 70% were at least college graduates with > 50% making at least $50K/yr. This was the first pregnancy for 60% of the participants. Sleep quality characterized by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) varied in early gestation with 25% of participants indicating poor sleep (score > 6 at each time point). Approximately 10% met diagnostic criteria for insomnia based on the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). According to both sleep diary and actigraphy, sleep remained fairly consistent across 10-20 weeks gestation. On average, women reported a sleep onset latency (SOL) = 16 - 20 minutes, wake after sleep onset (WASO) = 20 - 25 minutes and total sleep time (TST) = 483 -487 minutes. However, the top quartile had an average SOL > 25 min and WASO > 30 minutes suggesting some women had difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. On average, sleep efficiency was good (91 - 92.5%), however one quarter had SE < 90%. Actigraphy data indicates slightly poorer sleep with a women spending 22 - 25% of the night awake, TST = 337 - 361 minutes and a sleep efficiency = 68-72%. About 25% of women spent > 35% of the night awake, with sleep efficiency among the bottom quartile ∼ 60%. Conclusion: This preliminary look at various sleep domains during early and mid-pregnancy suggest that while sleep remains consistent between 10-20 weeks gestation, there is a subset of women who have disturbed sleep and may be at increased risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances occur commonly during pregnancy. Many pregnant women report an increased desire to sleep, and complaints of snoring, restlessness, fatigue, and sleep disruption are often noted. Recent studies suggest that snoring and sleepiness during pregnancy can result in the development of serious adverse conditions, such as pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in the fetus. The objective of our study was to determine if snoring and/or excessive sleepiness during pregnancy were associated with unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Methods: The study group consisted of post-partum mothers within 24 hours of delivery of a healthy infant at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, NJ. Mothers were randomly chosen and they were asked to complete 2 standardized questionnaires, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Snoring Symptoms Inventory (SSI). These questionnaires are used to identify symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), specifically, snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. In addition, medical chart reviews were conducted, looking at pregnancy, labor, and delivery information and infant growth and well-being data. Results: We enrolled 107 mothers in our study. The mean maternal age was 34 years (SD +/- 5). The most common method of delivery was a scheduled Caesarian section (38.7%). The relationship of ESS and SSI scores to pregnancy outcomes (total weight gain, labor duration, maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressure, infant birth weight and gestational age) were analyzed. Higher scores on the ESS and SSI were associated with significantly lower infant birth weight (P = 0.026) and younger gestational age (P = 0.013). Mothers with pre-eclampsia were found to have higher ESS scores (P = 0.009). Conclusion: In our population, pregnant women who demonstrated excessive daytime sleepiness also had symptoms of snoring disturbances. Elevated scores on the ESS and SSI were associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. We conclude that OSA symptoms during pregnancy may have serious sequelae.

N2  - Introduction: During pregnancy, the majority of women experience day-napping and sleep disturbances including sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). SDB may be associated with gestational diabetes (GDM), and longer day-napping in older adults was found to be associated with a higher risk of diabetes. However the health consequences of SDB and napping during pregnancy are poorly understood. Methods: A group of 104 pregnant women who underwent a full polysomnography in the first trimester and a glucose challenge test (GCT), and completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and house questionnaires were studied. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine the clinical characteristics that were significantly associated with GCT results. Using GCT values as the dependent variable, sleep and demographic variables having a P < 0.2 in a bivariate analysis were reevaluated in full linear regression models as independent variables. Results: In unadjusted linear regression analysis, variables with a P < 0.2 were first-trimester BMI (kg/m2) (β = 0.51, P = 0.12), first-trimester neck circumference (β = 1.89, P = 0.02), parity (β = 8.14, P = 0.09), firsttrimester RDI ≥ 15 (β = 49.91, P = 0.004), habitual snoring (β = 19.27, P = 0.01), steady night-shift work (β = 13.09, P = 0.12), second-trimester nap duration (β = 0.07, P = 0.02), nocturnal sleep (β = -0.04, P = 0.10), PSQI-sleep duration subscale (β = 4.25, P = 0.08), PSQI-sleep efficiency (β = 2.74, P = 0.14) and PSQI total score (β = 0.88, P = 0.18). In the final multivariable model, first-trimester RDI ≥ 15 (β = 38.88, P = 0.02) and second-trimester nap duration (β = 0.06, P = 0.03) were significantly associated with increasing GCT values after adjustment for BMI, parity and nocturnal sleep duration. Conclusion: SDB and longer day-napping are associated with higher GCT values. Day-napping may occur due to sleep disturbances that increase sympathetic activation. This may in turn carry over in wakefulness to induce insulin resistance. Even minor degrees of increased glucose intolerance may be associated with increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: In the non-pregnant population obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with an increased prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Although sleep related complaints are common among pregnant women, very few studies have addressed maternal and fetal outcomes in women with sleep disturbances. Our objective was to evaluate pregnancy outcomes of reproductive aged women who have undergone sleep studies in order to examine the relationship between OSA and gestational diabetes (GDM). Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Using ICD-9 codes, we queried our medical records database to find women who had a delivery at our hospital between January of 2007 and June of 2009, and again using ICD-9 codes we determined how many of these women also had a sleep study done at our institution. Charts of identified patients were reviewed and data regarding patient demographics, sleep study results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted. We then compared the incidence of GDM in women who received a diagnosis of OSA at the time of their formal sleep evaluation to that of women without OSA. Between group comparisons were made using the Fisher exact test and chi square analysis, as appropriate. Results: Seventy-four women who had undergone a formal sleep study as well as a delivery were identified. 66% (49/74) were nulliparous at the time of their first documented delivery at our institution, and 23 subjects (31%) had more than one delivery during the study period. 66% of the subjects (49/74) underwent a sleep study prior to or within a year of their first documented delivery. The mean age at the time of the sleep study was 20 ± 4.7 and the mean BMI was 34.9 ± 12.2. Thirty-two women (43%) received a diagnosis of OSA at the time of their sleep study. After excluding women with incomplete medical records and women with pre-gestational diabetes we were left with 56 subjects, of whom 26 (46%) had OSA. The incidence of GDM was 15% (4/26) in women with OSA vs. 0% (0/30) in women without OSA (P = .04). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that OSA may increase a women's risk of GDM.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) describes a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns (pauses) or quality of ventilation during sleep. In the non-pregnant population studies have concluded that SDB is associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension. Few studies have evaluated the consequences of SDB during pregnancy, and there is very little data on the prevalence of SDB in patients at risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of SDB in a pregnant population at high-risk for preeclampsia. Methods: Pregnant women with chronic hypertension (CHTN), pregestational diabetes (DM), obesity (defined as pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30), and/or a prior history of preeclampsia were invited to participate in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100, a wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SDB. SDB was defined as an apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) of ≥ 5. Univariable and multivariable statistical techniques were used to compare the incidence of SDB among women with different risk factors for preeclampsia. Results: Sixty subjects were recruited. The mean maternal age was 33.2 ± 6.5. The mean gestational age at the time of the sleep study was 16.6 ± 4.1 weeks. Twenty-eight percent (17/60) of subjects had evidence of SDB (AHI of ≥ 5). Women with CHTN had the highest incidence of SDB (54.3% vs. 15.6% P = .001). Obese subjects also had a higher incidence of SDB (41.2% vs. 11.5% P = .02). DM and a history of preeclampsia were not associated with SDB. CHTN remained associated with SDB even after controlling for other coexisting preeclampsia risk factors; OR = 7.9, 95% CI 1.8, 35.6. Conclusion: SDB is highly prevalent among women at high risk for preeclampsia, with an incidence higher than that of the general premenopausal population. Obese women and women with chronic hypertension have the highest incidence of SDB.

N2  - Introduction: Some sleep disruption is often considered a normal part of pregnancy and few women seek treatment for sleep problems. There are a number of sleep aides available but most are contraindicated during pregnancy. To our knowledge there are no published data on the use of sleep aides by pregnant women. Methods: As part of a larger study of sleep during pregnancy, pregnant women in their last trimester were invited to complete validated questionnaires including the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. Sleep disturbance was considered present if the mean total score or any subscale score was ≥ 3. This scale includes questions regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, herbal products, pain medications, prescription and over the counter sleeping pills to induce sleep. Frequent use of sleep aids was defined as use of any of these aids ≥ 3 nights/week. Results: Surveys have been completed by 1396 women (mean age 29.7 ± 5.7 years, gestational age 34.2 ± 3.8 weeks, and 43% primiparous). In total, 71% of women reported poor sleep quality and 14% reported frequent use of ≥ 1 sleep aide. Frequent use of alcohol was reported in 0.4% of women, tobacco in 1.4%, herbal products in 0.6%, pain medications in 4.1%, prescription medications in 3.4%, and over-the-counter sleeping pills in 3.9%. A small proportion reported frequent use of multiple sleep aides (1.4%). Multiparous women were more likely to report frequent use of sleep aides (21% vs. 16%; P = 0.016). In a logistic regression model accounting for age, race, BMI, and parity, both poor sleep quality and poor daytime function independently predicted frequent sleep aide use (O.R. 2.3, 95%CI 1.5-3.5 and O.R.1.5, 95%CI 1.1-2.3; P < 0.001 respectively) Conclusion: Sleep disturbance is common in pregnant women and a large minority report frequent use of substances to induce sleep. Of concern, several of these sleep aides are contraindicated during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: No study has examined gender differences in the prevalence of sleep disturbance during reproductive transitions. Research suggests, for women, pregnancy may be a risk factor for developing a sleep disturbance. The prevalence of sleep disturbance in expectant fathers is not well understood. Reproductive transitions may impact sleep duration and quality because they are developmentally stressful events characterized by physiological, psychosocial, and environmental changes. Methods: The data source was the National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The NPHS collects health-related information from a representative sample of Canadians every two years (since 1994). During the last three cycles (2002-03, 2004-05, 2006-07) four questions were used to assess sleep duration, onset, maintenance, and daytime wakefulness. The prevalence of sleep disturbance is described in males and females traversing a reproductive transition during the period of observation. Results: In total, 635 women and 470 men experienced at least one reproductive transition. Preliminary results reveal that more pregnant women reported difficulties with sleep onset or sleep maintenance than expectant fathers (45% women, 33% men; P < .02) and difficulties with daytime wakefulness (28% women, 20% males; P < 0.05). Likewise, more women assessed during the postpartum period reported difficulties with low sleep duration (i.e., less than 6 hours) than men (24% women, 16% males; P < 0.05). Please note, final results will be available at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are more common among women than men during reproductive transitions. Gender differences are apparent in sleep duration, sleep quality, and daytime wakefulness. These findings may have relevance for maternal, paternal and family adjustment and reproductive care.

N2  - Introduction: Soluble placental-derived anti-angiogenic proteins, some of which may respond to hypoxemia, have been identified in preeclampsia. Given an association between preeclampsia and sleep disordered breathing (SDB), we evaluated whether these protein levels vary with levels of SDB in an obese pregnant population. Methods: Participants in an observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent overnight sleep studies for SDB using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA), recording nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movement, and measurement of body composition using air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod). Medical charts were reviewed for objective data documenting the presence of comorbid conditions. Serum collected at the gestational ages 13-20 weeks' was analyzed for levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1), soluble endoglin (sEng) and placental growth factor (PlGF). Data were analyzed utilizing chi square, t-test and Spearman correlation. Results: The sample of 45 women was age 30 ± 6.4years, had a BMI of 40 ± 7 kg/m2 with 44 ± 6% body fat, and was studied at 16.6 ± 2.5 weeks of gestation. Co-morbid conditions included chronic hypertension (28%), diabetes mellitus (30%) and metabolic syndrome (22%). Three have an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) > 5. The mean AHI was 1.5 ± 3 (range 0-15.8) and the mean percentage of time < 90% O2 saturation was 0.17 ± 0.5. Mean levels of the anti-angiogenic molecules were: sFlt1 (1672 ± 1179 pg/ml), sEng (4.05 ± 1.1 ng/ml) and PlGF (126.2 ± 113 pg/ml). Increasing AHI was correlated with an increase in sFlt1 (r = 0.38, P = 0.01), sEng (r = 0.30, P = 0.03) and sFlt-1: PlGF ratio (r = 0.29, P = 0.05). Increasing percentage of time < 90% O2 saturation was also associated with an increase in sFlt1 (r = .48, P = 0.001), sEng (r = .32, P = 0.03) but not an increase in the sFlt1: PlGF ratio (r = 0.11, P = 0.45). Conclusion: Among obese pregnant women, an increase in serum levels of antiangiogenic proteins was observed with modestly increased levels of AHI and overnight hypoxemia. These results suggest a mechanism that may explain the increased risk of preeclampsia in women with SDB.

N2  - Introduction: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic disorder characterized by unpleasant leg sensations. Symptoms tend to follow a circadian rhythm, intensifying during the evening or night. A major complaint cited by RLS sufferers is an inability to initiate and achieve restful sleep. Treatments are often successful at controlling symptoms and providing sleep improvements. Here we assess the relative impact of specific sleep outcomes and symptom severity on RLS treatment satisfaction. Methods: This IRB-approved, online survey is ongoing; preliminary data are reported Subjects were recruited by their PCP/neurologist. Inclusion criteria were: US residency; age > 17 years; RLS diagnosis for ≥ 1 year; currently taking levodopa or a dopamine agonist (DA) for ≥ 6 months; not diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, kidney failure or pregnant; symptoms occurring ≥ 2-3 days/week before treatment. Subjects rated treatment satisfaction on a 7-point scale (not satisfied to totally satisfied). Sleep status was determined using the Sleep Index II score from the MOS sleep scale. RLS symptom severity was determined using the IRLS global summary score. Specific aspects of sleep were assessed by MOS sleep domain scores. Results: To date, 200 subjects have completed this survey. Mean current treatment satisfaction is 4.7 (SD: 1.4), with ratings higher among subjects with better sleep scores. Multiple regression analysis controlling for subject demographics and sedative use revealed worsened sleep quality and increased symptom severity to be significant predictors of lower treatment satisfaction (P < 0.01, both) and in that order of significance. Also, an average-over-orderings analysis (using MOS sub-scales) showed sleep disturbance to be the strongest determinant of treatment satisfaction, followed by daytime somnolence. Conclusion: These data show sleep to be closely associated with treatment satisfaction even after controlling for demographics, sedative use and symptom severity. Specifically, treatment satisfaction is associated with better quality of sleep and lack of daytime somnolence.

N2  - Introduction: Emerging data suggest that pregnancy is associated with an increased frequency of habitual snoring (HS) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) which may promote maternal hypertension. In sleep clinics, Mallampati grade (MP) is used to screen for SDB risk, but this assessment has not been widely used in the context of pregnancy. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between HS, MP, and gestational hypertension. Methods: Within a larger study of sleep in pregnancy, we obtained prospective data on women surveyed in the third trimester using validated instruments. HS was defined as snoring ≥ 3 nights/week. MP was obtained from medical records and dichotomized into grade I/II (low) or III/IV (high). Development of gestational hypertension was ascertained from the medical records after delivery. Results: Data were obtained from 952 subjects (mean age 29.7 ± 5.7 years, mean BMI 30.7 ± 7.6kg/m2). HS was present in 36% of women and was more frequent in obese women (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2) than nonobese women (55% vs. 29%; P < 0.001). Women with high MP were more likely to have HS as compared to those with lower MP (51% vs. 34%; P = 0.001). In a logistic regression with maternal age, gestational age, race, BMI, parity, smoking status, and the presence of diabetes taken into account, a high MP showed independent association with gestational hypertension (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI[1.1-4.2]; P < 0.04). Addition of HS to the model made the relationship non-significant (O.R. 1.3, 95%CI[0.7-2.6]; P = 0.38). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of pregnant women have HS, and this key risk factor for SDB is associated with a simple measure of oropharyngeal crowding. The independent association of high MP with gestational hypertension is likely mediated by SDB, as addition of HS to the model removed the association. Use of this non-invasive, cost efditionally fective, oral assessment during routine physical examination may have clinical utility in pregnant women.

N2  - Aims: To determine risk factors for miscarriage. Methods: A case control study was carried out at the gynaecological wards and antenatal clinics of the De Soysa Maternity Hospital in Sri Lanka. A case was defined as that of mothers with a confirmed diagnosis of partial or full expulsion of the fetus during the first 28 weeks of gestation. Controls comprised ante-natal clinic attendees whose period of gestation was <28 weeks and carrying a viable fetus. Two hundred and thirty cases and 504 controls were selected. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire and modified life events inventory were used to gather data. Multivariate logistic regression was applied separately for first and second trimester miscarriages and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and as 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: Sleeping ≤8 hday (OR:3.80, 95%CI:1.01-14.3) was found to be a risk factor for first trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation. Sleeping ≤8 hday (OR:2.04, 95%CI:1.24-3.37), standing ≤3 hday (OR:1.83, 95%CI:1.08-3.10), exposure to cooking smoke (OR:3.83, 95%CI:1.50-9.90) and physical trauma during the pregnancy (OR:43.2, 95%CI:4.55-411.4) were found to be risk factors for second trimester miscarriage controlling for the effect of period of gestation. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation, a sedentary lifestyle, exposure to cooking smoke and physical trauma during pregnancy were risk factors for miscarriage. Most of the risk factors are therefore modifiable. © 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring is common among pregnant women and may bear a risk to the fetus. Increased umbilical cord levels of nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) and erythropoietin were found in woman who snored during pregnancy indicating increased fetal erythropoiesis. In addition to erythropoietin, IL-6 plays an important role in elevation of fetal nRBCs count. Since systemic inflammation is one of the underlying mechanisms mediating sleep-disordered breathing and associated morbidities, our objective was to investigate whether maternal snoring is associated with increased cord blood levels of IL-6. Methods: Women of singleton uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were recruited during labor. All participants together with their sleep partners completed a designated questionnaire that included information regarding BMI, age, smoking, medication use, pregnancy complications, snoring before and during the current pregnancy, sleep pauses and daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Subjects with frequent snoring (> 4 nights a week) were considered habitual snorers. Cord-blood was obtained immediately following delivery and IL-6 concentrations were measured using commercially available ELISA kit. Results: Hundred and twenty-two women were recruited. The mean age was 30.5 ± 4.6 years. The mean gestational age was 39.5 ± 1.2 weeks and the mean BMI at the beginning of pregnancy was 22.0 ± 3.6 kg/m2. 39% of women reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Of those, 35% were chronic snorers and 65% were new-onset snorers. Plasma IL-6 concentrations were significantly elevated in habitual snorers compared to non-snorers (5.6 ± 4.8 vs.3.4 ± 3.6 pg/ml; P = 0.01). Among the snorers study group, increased IL-6 concentrations were found in the new-onset snorers group compared with the non-snorers group (6.3 ± 4.4 vs. 3.4 ± 3.5; P = 0.005). Conclusion: Maternal new onset snoring during pregnancy is associated with increased cord levels of IL-6. We suggest that systemic inflammation plays a major role in mediating maternal snoring and fetal outcome.

N2  - Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17-weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence. Participants were pregnant women (N = 56), with past histories of PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. In analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p < .05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (Χ2 = 0.98, p = .32). Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects approximately 14% of females in the general population. Several studies have shown that RLS is increased during pregnancy but little is known about its true frequency or correlates. Methods: As part of a larger prospective study on sleep in pregnancy, women were surveyed about their sleep during their third trimester. Validated screening questionnaires included the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) and a 4-item Brief Restless Legs Scale. Sleep disturbance was considered present if the mean total score or any subscale score (poor sleep quality and poor daytime functioning) was ≥ 3. Positive responses to the first 3 question items on the brief RLS scale signified RLS. Item 4 provided information on RLS severity. Results: Thus far, 1387 women pregnant with single fetuses (mean age 29.7 ± 5.7 years and mean gestational age 34.2 ± 3.8 weeks) have participated in this study. Of these, 487 (35%) were found to have RLS. Caucasian women were most likely (37%) and African American women were the least likely (25%) to report RLS. Overall, 70% of women with RLS reported symptoms occurring ≥ 2 nights/week and 33% reported symptoms ≥ 4 nights/week. Compared to women without RLS, women with RLS had a significantly higher frequency of total sleep disturbance (55% vs. 38%), poor sleep quality (79% vs. 67%), and poor daytime functioning (80% vs. 66%; all P-values < 0.001). Using logistic regression and controlling for age, ethnicity, Epworth sleepiness score, BMI, and sleep disordered breathing, RLS independently predicted poor sleep quality (O.R. 1.57, 95%CI 1.2-2.1; P = 0.002) and poor daytime functioning (OR 1.70, 95%CI 1.3-2.3; P = 0.001). Conclusion: RLS is highly prevalent in pregnancy. While pregnancy is associated with sleep disturbances, the presence of RLS may further impair sleep quality and daytime functioning. These findings suggest potential opportunities to improve women's sleep during pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: To characterize the effect of sleep on the migraine attack and characterize how this changes with age Background: The relationship between migraines and sleep is still poorly understood. Sleep has been explored as a trigger for migraines and is anecdotally cited as beneficial in alleviating migraine attacks. Strangely, its actual success in treating migraine attacks has never been studied. Methods: 100 men and women, between 16 and 50 years of age, with episodic migraine headache for at least the last three months were recruited from the Jefferson Headache Center. Patients with known or suspected sleep apnea, 15 or more headache days per month, any primary headache disorder other than episodic migraine, and pregnant women were excluded. Patient charts were pre-screened for eligibility based on these criteria, and an equal of number of eligible patients were interviewed in each of five age groups: 16-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-40, 41-50. During their office visit or via phone, patients were interviewed from a structured questionnaire to obtain information regarding demographics, migraine history (age of onset, disease duration), average attack frequency and duration, headache characteristics (severity, location, pain character, and triggers) and associated symptoms. Information concerning sleep patterns and their role in treating headache attacks was also acquired. Results: 85 females and 15 males were interviewed. 40% of the patients had aura. The study consisted of 79 migraine patients, 20 probable migraine patients, and one patient with tension-type headache which evolved from migraine with aura. 65% of the patients reported headache could awaken them from sleep. Lack of sleep triggered headaches for 78%, too much sleep 38%, and change in sleep 66%. 65% reported migraines kept them from sleeping, 21% stated no effect on the ability to fall asleep and 14% found it easier to sleep. Age did not have an effect on these findings. Overall, 43% of patients never treated their headaches with sleep alone, 41% treated them occasionally with sleep alone, 11% used sleep some of the time, 4% used sleep most of the time, and 1% always treated their headaches with sleep alone. Age negatively correlated with the use of sleep alone as a treatment for migraine attacks (Spearman's r=0.308, p=.002). Overall 36% reported awakening headache free after falling asleep with a migraine, 10% felt much better, 24% felt somewhat better, 23% felt about the same, and 7% felt worse. Age did not correlate with benefit from sleep (Spearman's r=0.037, p=NS). Conclusions: While sleep is beneficial for the majority of patients, few patients treat migraine with sleep alone. Age did not correlate with this benefit, yet the use of sleep as the sole treatment for headache decreased with age.

N2  - Objectives: Psychotic disorders have a high rate of relapse in the postpartum period for reasons that are unclear, but may be related to changes in sleep patterns that occur during pregnancy and after birth. Understanding of the influence of sleep on postpartum psychosis presentation is limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in sleep/wake activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with a history of psychosis. Methods: Women with a history of bipolar disorder and/or postpartum psychosis (HxW) were recruited (n = 23) together with a control population (CtW) (n = 15). Data on demographic and psychosocial factors, mental health status, and sleep/wake activity were collected at seven timepoints-the last week of each trimester of pregnancy and four times during the postpartum (weeks 1, 4, and 8, and at month 6). Longitudinal data were analysed using an HLM version 6 repeated-measures multilevel model. Results: No significant differences were noted in sleep/wake activity between HxW and CtW. None of the HxW who were taking a mood stabilizer during their pregnancy, including at delivery, relapsed during the study. Of those taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or no medication, 3 relapsed within the first six months and 2 within the first two months. HxW were more likely to report a poor partner relationship than CtW. Conclusion: Results suggest that during the perinatal period, there is no difference in sleep/wake activity in women with a history of a psychotic disorder. Use of mood stabilizer during pregnancy and at delivery appears important in preventing psychotic relapse in the postpartum. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Introduction: Inadequate parenting has been linked with developmental risks in children of alcohol-abusers. The link, however, between marijuana use among parents and functioning in adolescents is unclear. This study investigates sleep patterns of adolescents with alcohol- and marijuana-using parents. Methods: In addition to yearly assessments tracking maternal substance use from pregnancy through postnatal year 12, 49 adolescents in the longitudinal Maternal Lifestyle Study (aged 13-14, 56 % female, 50% minority, 42% below the poverty line) completed a sleep habits survey and kept an 8-day sleep diary while wearing an actigraph. Parents also completed a survey regarding home, school, and sleep habits. Measures yielded actigraphic estimates of sleep efficiency (M percent of weeknight time in bed spent asleep) and sleep schedule variability (sum of SD of weeknight bedtimes and wake times). Results: Cumulative maternal/caretaker marijuana use from pre- to postnatal year 12 predicted worse sleep efficiency among adolescents (R2Δ = .221, P = .02) adjusting for the effect of number of caretaker changes. Furthermore, increased postnatal parental alcohol use predicted more variable sleep schedules among adolescents (R2Δ = .422, P < .001) adjusting for the effect of poverty level. Postnatal parental alcohol use was correlated with parental-report of change in the home (e.g., of bed, room, house; r = .569, P < .001), and this change accounted for most (92.4%) of the variance explained by parental alcohol use. Conclusion: Teens of marijuana-using parents spent longer in bed on average than their peers, resulting in more wake time during the night. This behavioral difference merits assessment of parenting of marijuanausers and of passive marijuana inhalation by these teens. Furthermore, consistent sleep and wake times are empirically supported protective factors for sufficient sleep. The link between increased parental alcohol use and increased adolescent sleep schedule variability further justifies including sleep education in parent training for this population.

N2  - Introduction: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs. RLS symptoms tend to follow a circadian pattern, intensifying during the evening or night, and often delay or disturb sleep. Sleep problems are a common comorbidity of RLS. Methods: This IRB-approved, on-line survey is ongoing; data are preliminary. Subjects were managed by their PCP or Neurologist. Inclusion criteria were: US residency, age > 17, RLS diagnosis for ≥ 1 year, currently taking levodopa or dopamine agonist for ≥ 6 months, not diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, kidney failure and not pregnant, and symptoms occurring ≥ 2-3 days per week before treatment. Subjects rated sleep disturbance on a 5-point scale from 'none' to 'very severe'. The question was administered twice, once in reference to current treatment and again referencing pre-treatment. Results: 200 subjects have completed this survey to date. Mean current treatment duration was 2.6 years (S.D.: 1.9). 40.0% of respondents switched from another dopamine agonist or levodopa to their current medication and 49.2% had dosage levels adjusted (47.2% increased/2.0% decreased). 34.5% percent of respondents rated sleep disturbance the same (28.9%) or more severe (5.6%) over the past week than before treatment. Profiling improvers/non-improvers revealed that those with higher symptom severity (IRLS total score) had more sleep disturbance. No significant differences in demographic or treatment characteristics emerged. Conclusion: Though 40% had changed their DA medication, continued dopamine or levodopa treatment did not improve sleep for a third of these subjects and ∼6% saw their sleep problems being more severe than before treatment. Patients reporting improved sleep also reported fewer symptoms but there was no relation between medication use and sleep improvement. Physicians should assess for potential poor sleep with DA treatments and consider alternative therapies to address the problem.

N2  - Introduction: Epidemiology and clinical studies demonstrate that untreated sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of SDB has been reported in epidemiology cohort studies, however, SDB symptom frequency has not been reported in a representative sample of U.S. adults. Methods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a U.S. population-based health surveillance tool administered by the Center for Disease Control. The 2005-06 and 2007-08 surveys contained questions related to SDB symptomatology. These questions were analyzed to determine the prevalence of self-reported snoring (> 3 nights/week); snorting, gasping, or stopping breathing (> 3 nights/week); and excessive daytime sleepiness (> 5 days/month). Exclusion criteria included age < 20 years, pregnancy, a diagnosis of OSA, and missing data. Results: Surveys from 7871 individuals (men = 4009, women = 3862) were analyzed. Snoring was reported by 49.6% (C.I. = 47.3 - 51.8) of the sample and was more prevalent in men (58.0%, C.I. = 55.8 - 60.22) than women (41.5%, C.I. = 38.6 - 44.4). Snorting, gasping or stopping asbreathing was reported by 10.6% of the sample. The prevalence was higher in men (13.3%, C.I. = 11.5 - 15.4) vs. women (7.9%, C.I. = 6.9 - 9.0). Daytime sleepiness was reported by 17.2% of adults with a higher prevalence in women (20.3, C.I. = 18.6 - 22.2) vs. men (13.9%, C.I. = 12.6 - 15.4). The percentage of individuals reporting snoring and gasping with daytime sleepiness (2.4%, C.I. 1.9 - 3.1) was lower than those reporting snoring and gasping without daytime sleepiness (7.7%, C.I. 7.0 - 8.6). Conclusion: These NHANES data constitute the first report of SDB symptom prevalence in a representative sample of U.S. adults. The findings indicate gender differences in SDB symptoms and show that daytime sleepiness frequently does not accompany reports of snoring and breathing cessation.

N2  - Introduction: Recent literature suggests that habitual snoring (HS) and any underlying obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. One other important morbidity is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Sleep apnea is believed to promote DM outside pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM is increasing, and the condition is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. However, the relationship between HS and GDM remains unexplored. Methods: Women were recruited from obstetric clinics during the last trimester of pregnancy and invited to complete questionnaires that included items about habitual snoring (HS, defined as ≥ 3 nights/week) and whether it began before or during pregnancy. Medical records were reviewed for results of 1-hour blood glucose screens, performed routinely between 24-28 weeks' gestation. GDM was considered present if glucose was ≥ 140mg/dl. Results: Of 872 women studied (mean age 29.7 ± 5.7 years), 24% had GDM. Overall, 7.5% of women reported chronic HS and 27% reported pregnancy-onset HS. The group with chronic HS had a higher pre-pregnancy BMI on average than either the non-HS or the pregnancy-onset HS group (31.5 ± 9.2 kg/m2 vs. 24.9 ± 6.3 kg/m2 and 28.4 ± 7.9 kg/m2; each P < 0.001 respectively). GDM was more frequent in women with pregnancy-onset HS compared to non-HS (33% vs. 21%; P = 0.0006). There was no difference in GDM between non-HS and chronic HS (21% vs. 25%; P = 0.5) or between chronic HS and pregnancy-onset HS (25% vs. 33%; P = 0.2). In a logistic regression model, GDM was associated with pregnancy-onset HS even after accounting for age, race, gestational age, parity, and pre-pregnancy BMI (odds ratio 1.6, 95%CI [1.1, 2.5], P = 0.026). In contrast, chronic HS was not associated with GDM. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the development of new HS during pregnancy confers an additional risk for GDM over and above BMI. Clinicians should ask during prenatal visits about snoring and its onset.

N2  - Introduction: Depression and anxiety are common in perinatal women. Sleep is often disrupted during pregnancy and can remain problematic postpartum. However, little is known about the sleep of perinatal women who present for outpatient mental health treatment. Methods: Two hundred fifty-seven women (114 pregnant, 143 within 6 months postpartum) who presented to the University of Michigan's Depression Center for outpatient mental health treatment completed measures assessing symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EPDS), anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire; PSWQ), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about sleep habits) at their initial evaluation. Regression analyses were used to examine relationships between psychiatric symptoms and sleep. Results: Most women (87%) had EPDS scores ≥ 10, indicating significant symptoms of depression; similarly, 85% had PSWQ scores > 40, indicating significant symptoms of anxiety. Half of the sample had ISI scores ≥ 15 (M = 14.3 ± 6). Seventy percent reported ≤ 6 hours of sleep per night, and 73% said they had too little sleep over the past two weeks. Mean ISI score was not significantly different between pregnant and postpartum women (t = -4.2, P = .68). After adjusting for maternal age, the ISI accounted for 25% of the variance in EPDS score (F(1, 248) = 42.67, P < .001) and 47% of the variance in PSWQ score (F(1, 255) = 112.38, P < .001). Conclusion: In this sample of perinatal women who presented to an outpatient psychiatric clinic for evaluation and treatment, 50% reported symptoms of clinically significant insomnia. Furthermore, many described not getting adequate sleep. Insomnia symptoms accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. These results suggest that sleep is dysregulated in women who present for mental health care, and this dysregulation is clearly linked to their psychiatric symptoms.

N2  - Introduction: We compared circadian rest-activity rhythm of mothers and infants prepartum and postpartum to see the influence of maternal rhythm on infants. We compared these results with the rest-activity rhythm of another mother with an infant with free-running rhythm. Methods: Subjects were ten primiparae (mean 31.0 yrs) and their infants. The mothers gave informed consent prior to the study. Actigraphic recordings made over 3-5 continuous days during the 33rd and 36th weeks of gestation and again during the second, sixth, and twelfth weeks after birth. We used autocorrelogram analysis for restactivity rhythm as in our previous study (Physiol. Behav. 77:91-98, 2002). One infant showed free-running rhythm, so we analyzed that infant-mother pair independently. For the nine circadian rhythm infant- mother pairs, mean correlation coefficients from the autocorrelograms were calculated. Results: The mean values of the autocorrelograms for the circadian rhythm infants and mothers were the lowest during the second week and increased until the twelfth week, as indicated by our previous study. The mean values of the mothers during the twelfth week did not reach the mean values during the prepartum period. One infant showed a free-running rhythm beginning around the sixth week after birth, and his mother began following his rhythm. During the second week after birth, small peaks on the infant's and his mother's autocorrelograms were observed at around 24-25 hours. During the infant's free-running rhythm, autocorrelogram peaks for the infant's rhythm were broadly distributed from 25 to 28 hours. The circadian peak prepartum for this mother was longer than the mean value for the other mothers. Conclusion: A mother's longer circadian rest-activity rhythm in late pregnancy may be related to her infant's free-running rhythm.

N2  - Case report:: A 16-year old girl presented after two generalized seizures for neurological assessment. At the age of 9 years fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was diagnosed based on microcephaly, characteristic facial anomalies including short palpebral fissures, thin vermilion border of the upper lip and smooth philtrum as well as postnatal growth retardation and global cognitive deficits. Neurological examination was otherwise normal. A waking state EEG showed focal slowing and focal sharp waves in the right temporal region, an EEG during sleep was normal. MRI of the brain revealed an abnormally thick cortex with bilateral polymicrogyria (PMG) in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. Discussion: A wide range of cerebral malformations is associated with FAS as demonstrated in both histological and neuroradiological studies. There is experimental evidence that alcohol interferes with many molecular, neurochemical and cellular events occurring during normal development of the brain. In the first month of human gestation maternal ethanol drinking is associated with a great incidence of craniofacial and neuronal tube anomalies. In the second trimester alcohol exposure reduces the number of neurons and glia cells in the neocortex and induces changes in radial glia as well as neuronal proliferation, generation, and migration. During the third trimester of gestation alcohol interferes with synaptogenesis as well as glial development, increases natural cell death and cell necrosis, and involves the impairment of neuronal cell migration. PMG in FAS has been described only in a single patient who was included in a neuropathology study in 1979. The autopsy of this patient revealed PMG in the orbital, temporal, and parieto-occipital surfaces. In our patient history, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in our patient rather than a mere coincidence. Conclusion: We present the 2nd patient of PMG in FAS and confirm the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with severe neurological impairment or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differenzial diagnosis for PMG.

N2  - Introduction: Central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) is defined as the presence of persistent alveolar hypoventilation and/or apnoea during sleep and impaired ventilatory responses to hypercapnia. This syndrome was initially described in association with traumatic, vascular, infectious or tumour events. Between 1970 and 2010, idiopathic CHS, either congenital (CCHS) or late-onset (LO-CHS), has been described in about 1000 patients worldwide. In addition, CHS has been increasingly reported in various other diseases involving autonomic dysfunction, such as Rapid Onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), Chiari malformation, Prader-Willi syndrome, familial dysautonomia, achondroplasia and Leigh's disease. A. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS): 1. The typical CCHS patient: Classically, CCHS is diagnosed in a newborn presenting with severe hypoventilation, which is more prominent during sleep than wakefulness and must be treated by mechanical ventilation. Hypoventilation cannot be explained by neuromuscular or cardiopulmonary disorders, anatomic anomalies of the brainstem or metabolic disorders. Polysomnography shows that hypoventilation culminates in NREM sleep along with the absence of ventilatory and arousal response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. Simultaneously, a complex autonomic nervous system dysregulation is present, including very low heart rate and respiratory rate variability, abrupt asystoles, abnormal pupillary reactivity, temperature dysregulation, profuse sweating, swallowing difficulties and/or oesophageal dysmotility. Hirschprung disease is present in 20% and neural tumours (e.g., neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma or ganglioneuroma) in 5-10% of CCHS patients. The finding of a PHOX2B gene mutation confirms diagnosis. Paired-like homeobox gene PHOX2B, the disease-defining gene: A heterozygous mutation in exon 3 of the paired-like homeobox gene PHOX2B is found in 100% of CCHS patients [1]. The PHOX2B gene encodes a key transcription factor in the development of the autonomic nervous system, including important medullary sites for integration/relay of chemosensory drive to respiratory centres. The normal protein encoded by the PHOX2B gene has a repeat of 20 alanines (20/20 genotype). In contrast, 92% of CCHS cases are heterozygous for a PHOX2B in-frame polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM) coding for 24 to 33 alanines in the mutated protein (20/24 to 20/33 genotype). The remaining CCHS patients have a heterozygous missense, nonsense or frameshift mutation in the PHOX2B gene. Phenotype-genotype relationships: Of key importance is the existence of an association between polyalanine expansion length and severity of autonomic dysfunction, such that patients with the 20/25 genotype rarely require 24-hour per day ventilatory support, in contrast to those with 20/27 to 20/33 genotypes. Moreover, an increased number of polyalanine repeats is associated with an increased number of symptoms of ANS dysregulation. CCHS patients with a non-PARM have a higher frequency of 24h-hour per day ventilatory support, Hirschprung disease (87-100% vs. 13-20% in PARM patients) and tumours from neural crest origin (50% vs. 1% in PARM patients). Inheritance of CCHS: While most PARMs occur de novo in CCHS, 5 to 10% are inherited from a mosaic unaffected parent. In contrast, CCHS patients have a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to each child according to an autosomal dominant pattern. Genetic counselling must take into consideration that penetrance of the milder PARMs (20/24 and 20/25 genotypes) and milder NPARMs is incomplete. Furthermore, as a mosaic germline PHOX2B mutation cannot be completely ruled out, prenatal testing is indicated for all subsequent pregnancies in parents of a CCHS child. 2. Late-onset CCHS: Late-onset CCHS (LO-CCHS) presents beyond the neonatal period and as late as during adulthood (3 months to 55 years). Respiratory infection or anaesthesia apparently triggers the need for permanent nocturnal ventilator support. Review of the medical chart however often shows prior chronic pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure, or respiratory infections leading to seizures or transient need for mechanical ventilation. Late-onset CCHS reflects the variable penetrance of the mildest PHOX2B PARMs (20/24 and 20/25 genotypes) or NPARMs, which may require an environmental cofactor to become symptomatic. 3. Diagnosis of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: Suspicion of CCHS must first lead to ruling out primary lung or cardiac disease, ventilatory muscle weakness, anatomic brain/brainstem lesions and inborn errors of metabolism. Diagnosis of CCHS is established by means of a blood sample using the PHOX2B Screening Test, which identifies the mutation in 95% of CCHS cases. In clinically-suggestive cases with a negative screening test, the PHOX2B Sequencing Test should be performed [2]. According to the recent ATS clinical policy statement [1], Hirschprung disease or neural tumours should be investigated in CCHS patients with susceptible genotype (see above). Furthermore, CCHS patients should be tested for autonomic dysregulation. In particular, 72-hour Holter monitoring must be performed annually to detect aberrant cardiac rhythms and/or sinus pauses, which may require bipolar cardiac pacemaker implantation. Likewise, echocardiogram, haematocrit and reticulocyte counts must be performed at least annually for detection of unrecognized recurrent hypoxemia. Biannual and then annual in-hospital comprehensive physiological studies during sleep and wakefulness should assess ventilatory needs during varying levels of activity and concentration. Hypoventilation and incidence: Typically, severe central hypoventilation due to decreased tidal volume (no apnoea) culminates in non-REM sleep, while a milder degree of hypoventilation is present in REM sleep and wakefulness, necessitating ventilatory support at sleep time only. However, central hypoventilation ranges in severity from significant hypoventilation during non-REM sleep with adequate ventilation during wakefulness to complete apnoea during sleep and severe hypoventilation during wakefulness (20/27 to 20/33 genotypes and most NPARMs). 4. Ventilatory management: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome does not improve with advancing age and does not respond to pharmacologic stimulants. Oxygen administration alone is inadequate to treat hypoventilation, and chronic home ventilatory support is necessary, at least during sleep. According to the recent ATS statement [1], intermittent positive pressure ventilation must be instituted via tracheostomy in the typical CCHS newborn. Noninvasive ventilation via a nasal mask using a bilevel positive airway pressure ventilator is not a consideration until 6 to 8 years of age at the earliest and has been successful in a limited number of stable patients with CCHS requiring ventilatory support only during sleep. In some selected CCHS children presenting with 24 h dependency on ventilatory support, bilateral diaphragm pacing can be used to assist ventilation during wakefulness, as a complement to mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy during sleep. With constant monitoring and maintenance of SpO2 above 95% and PCO2 between 35 and 40 mmHg, most children with CCHS can be expected to graduate from college, get married and maintain employment. B. Rapid onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD): First described in 1965 as late onset central hypoventilation with hypothalamic dysfunction, ROHHAD was recently renamed to account for the chronology of clinical presentation and to enable its distinction from CCHS [3]. A total of 75 cases have now been described worldwide. Typically, following apparent normality in the first 1.5 to 7 years of life, various evidences of hypothalamic dysfunction, including rapid-onset obesity, suddenly develop. Subsequently, signs of autonomic dysregulation, such as low body temperature, cold hands and feet, severe bradycardia and/or decreased pain perception, will become apparent.

N2  - Backgrond information: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS, Undine's curse) is a rare congenital disorder of the autonomic control of breathing with reduced central chemoreceptor sensitivity. Mutations in the PHOX2B-gene, which plays a crucial role in the development of respiratory autonomous-neuronal control systems, are considered to possess strong pathogenetic relevance. Children with Undine's curse are typically intubated after birth and ventilated. As a rule they require lifetime mechanical ventilatory assistance, particularly during sleep. We will report on the case of an unusually mild, rapidly remitting symptomatology of CCHS, with the picture of a centrally caused neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Case report: Female newborn. Birth via vacuum extraction in the 39th + 3 week of pregnancy after an uncomplicated pregnancy. APGAR 4/5/7. Umbilical cord pH 7.29. Directly after birth there was an onset of pronounced critical phases of apnoea that required intubation with subsequent IMV ventilation. Exclusion of traumatic, medicinal, infectious, metabolic, pulmonary, cardiac and, by MRI, dysontogenetic cerebral causes. Polygraphic evidence of a high-grade reduction of the respiratory action even with high arterial pCO2, particularly in NREM sleep. The tentative diagnosis of Undine's curse could be confirmed by detection of a known mutation in the PHOX2B gene (heterozygous insertion of 5-alanine in the polyalanine tract.) Within two weeks there was a spontaneous normalisation of breathing, extubation, and since then no renewed respiratory support has been required in the four months period of observation until now. Discussion: In a postnatal central respiratory disorder of the newborn, where no reason can be identified, Undine's curse ought to be taken into consideration, even if there is a complete remission of the symptomatology within the neonatal period. In contrast to previous reports, the PHOX2B-mutation evident in the case of our patient does not entail an irreversible severe respiratory disorder and suggests a higher geno-phenotypic variation than has been previously assumed. An examination of the mother, who also suffered from transient neonatal hypopnoea, will show, whether the mutation in our patient is not newly developed, as previous studies would suggest, but is rather an autosomal dominant inheritance.

N2  - Objective. The aim of this prospective study was to identify latent phase predictors of active labor duration. Design. Prospective clinical study. Setting. Two delivery units in Sweden. Sample. Healthy nulliparous women with a normal pregnancy, spontaneous onset of active labor at term, and a cervical dilatation of 4 cm or more on admission to the delivery ward (n=2,072). Methods. The women were asked to answer questions concerning their food and fluid intake, amount of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours and to assess their labor pain, sense of security and expectations of the childbirth on a visual analog scale (VAS). Duration and intervals of contractions, cervical dilatation, and position of the fetal head were noted by the midwife. A multiple regression analysis was performed with active labor duration as the outcome variable. Main outcome measure. Predictive factors of active labor duration. Results. Normal food intake during the preceding 24 hours was associated with short labor duration. A long latent phase, low levels of assessed labor pain and few hours of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours were significant independent predictors of extended active labor duration, when high birth weight, long contraction intervals, slight cervical dilatation, intact membranes within 2 hours of admission, high maternal age and malposition of the fetal head were controlled for. Conclusion. New findings are that latent phase duration as well as food intake and the amount of rest and sleep during the preceding 24 hours are independent predictors of labor duration. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: Phase I of the Chinese EPIC study, a cross-sectional population-based survey, showed the overall prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), overactive bladder (OAB) and urinary incontinence (UI) to be 73.1%, 10.0% and 15.8%, respectively; the prevalence of OAB wet was 6.3% and OAB dry, 9.5%. Phase II of the study was designed to evaluate the impact of these conditions on patient bother and quality of life. Materials and methods: The study participants constituted a Chinese population recruited from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Patients were recruited from June 2008 to August 2008 using a number of approaches, including street intercepts at hospital/clinic areas and patient referrals. Eligible patients were >18 years old and not currently pregnant or suffering from urinary tract infections. Six hundred patients with OAB or stress UI symptoms (case group) and 600 patients without these symptoms (control group) were selected for the study. The 2002 International Continence Society definitions were used to classify symptoms associated with LUTS, OAB and UI. Results: Among employed cases, urinary symptoms led to 15% loss of working hours. Males and those with UI experienced a greater loss in work hours compared with females and those without UI, respectively (males 17.3% versus females 11.7%; UI 15.9% versus no UI 6.6%). Fifty one percent of employed cases reported that they were always worried about interrupting meetings with frequent trips to the bathroom. One in four indicated that urinary symptoms have been a factor in decisions related to location and hours of work. About 12% had changed jobs, retired early or been fired due to their urinary symptoms. Compared with controls, patients in the case group felt significantly more pessimistic on 16 out of 20 emotional attributes (p<0.05), such as feeling fearful, thinking their life had been a failure, having trouble concentrating, feeling depressed, losing their appetite, feeling sad, feeling lonely and having restless sleep. Among patients in the case group, over 60% found their symptoms bothersome, with those having UI suffering the most from their disease. Approximately 40% of cases with UI felt their urinary symptoms cause problems for their family members compared with only 18.8% of cases who had no UI (p<0.05). Although the sufferers found their disease bothersome and affected their quality of life, over 70% of patients had never sought medical help from a healthcare professional. Conclusion: In this Chinese population, patients with urinary symptoms were negatively impacted on work-related productivity and several emotional attributes, and reported their symptoms as being bothersome to themselves and family members. These data support the need for active screening for lower urinary tract symptoms, overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, and appropriate, focused treatment of these conditions in affected individuals.

N2  - Bed sharing is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome. This risk is increased when the mother smokes or smoked in pregnancy, or when the parent has drunk alcohol or taken drugs. This risk is further increased in younger infants. The mechanism of sudden infant death with bed sharing is unknown, but airway obstruction, thermal stress and head covering have all been suggested. The benefit from bed sharing has only been established for breastfeeding, although other benefits are claimed. There is a small group of infants that has been shown to be at no increased risk of SIDS with bed sharing, namely infants of mothers who do not smoke, who are aged 3 months or more, and whose mothers have not taken alcohol or drugs and do not co-sleep on a sofa. Recommendations on how to bed share safely are not evidence based. Without this knowledge parents cannot make an informed choice on whether or not to bed share. Parents should be advised to place the baby to sleep in its own cot next to the parents' bed for the first six months. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Background: There is a paucity of literature describing poison exposures (exp) during pregnancy in Alabama (AL) and the entire U.S. This study is a retrospective review of poison exp in pregnant females (PF) reported to our Regional Poison Control Center (RPCC) from 2006-2008. The study objectives include: 1) comparing the reasons for poison exp calls - RPCC (AL, n = 158) vs. nationally (NPDS, n = 26,412); 2) identifying the five top substances involved in poison exp in AL PF; 3) evaluating the accuracy and internal validity of study data. Methods: Data was collected from Toxicall® reports - reason/term of pregnancy and substance category in PF exp and the National Poison Data System (NPDS) enterprise report reason/term of pregnancy. Epi Info™ was used to analyze rates by reason for AL vs. National data using a 95% CI to evaluate rate differences between the two groups. Case progress notes were reviewed to evaluate accuracy of data entry for reason, substance and trimester. A z-test for concordance evaluated the rate of accuracy of data entry vs. a standard of 95%. Results: Five categories and 19 subcategories for reasons of exposure in PF were compared between Alabama and nationally, and only four of the categories/subcategories were found to be significantly different. The top five substances for pregnancy exp were: analgesics, cleaning products, insecticides, food, and sleep aids. The data entered by SPIs for substance and trimester had a 100% and a 99.4% accuracy rate, respectively; both with a p < 0.001. The data entry by SPIs for the reason of exp had 84.8% accuracy rate and was significantly lower than the standard of 95%, p < 0.0001. Conclusion: Unintentional exp were under reported in PF from AL. This lower reporting may indicate that PF call their prenatal care provider with questions about unintentional poison exp (e.g. therapeutic errors) instead of the poison center. The higher reporting of intentional exp among PF in AL vs. the U.S. may be due to SPI miscoding nationally. RPCC SPIs' accuracy rates are high for substance and trimester, but could improve on data entry for reason of exposures.

N2  - Background: Epidemiological studies in adults and children have shown a strong association between short sleep duration and the risk of obesity. Experimental data have suggested several pathways that may predispose short-duration sleepers to obesity. Studies in infants are limited and conflicting. Methods: Questionnaires and anthropometric data from the Danish SKOT Cohort on complementary and young child feeding were used in this preliminary analysis. Data collected at 9 months (n = 292 [138 boys]; weight = 9.0 ± 1.0 kg) and 18 months (n = 223 [107 boys]; weight = 11.2 ± 1.1 kg) were analyzed. The WHO Growth Standard sex adjusted body-mass-index-for-age z-score (BMI z-score) was the main outcome measure. Night hours spent in bed (HB) was used as an indicator of sleep. The model was adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, partial breastfeeding, household income, and smoking during pregnancy. These covariates are all known to play a role in obesity and/or infant sleep. Results: HB was 10.7 ± 0.73 hours and 10.9 ± 0.66 hours for 9 and 18 months, respectively. BMI z-score was 0.34 ± 0.98 and 0.54 ± 0.97 for 9 and 18 months, respectively. The adjusted correlations between HB and BMI z-score for 9 and 18 months were 0.014 (P = 0.82) and )0.079 (P = 0.24), respectively. Hence, no significant association existed between sleep and BMI z-score for either 9 or 18 months in this cohort. Likewise, we did not find associations of sleep duration with other indices of adiposity such as waist circumference and skin fold thickness. Conclusion: Our results do not show any relation between sleep length and BMI z-score in infants. These results suggest that short sleep duration does not seem to be a major contributor to the adiposity phenotype at this age. Future studies using objectively measured sleep will be needed.

N2  - Objectives. - To provide a guide to the use and limitations of continuous opioid therapy (COT, or daily scheduled opioids) for refractory daily headache, based on the best available evidence and expert clinical experience. Background. - There has been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring. Methods. - A multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December 2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American Headache Society. Results. - The guide identifies factors that would qualify or disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy, neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric disorders. Conclusions. - Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%) of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety. © 2010 American Headache Society.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate RLS prevalence and clinical features by gender in a patient cohort diagnosed in a Sicilian sleep center. Background: RLS prevalence in women is estimated nearly double than in males, with a high distribution during specific life cycles such as pregnancy and/or menopause. Furthermore, life and sleep quality, general health and mood are likely to be more disrupted in females. Methods: All consecutive patients diagnosed with RLS in our sleep center from January 2007, according to the IRLS Diagnostic Interview (1995) were enrolled in this study. Data collection included: anthropometric data, physical/neurological examination, personal and familial history including comorbid disorders and treatment, iron status. Instrumental assessment: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), IRLS-RS (Allen et al., 2003), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Short Form-36 2v health survey. Most patients also underwent a standard video PSG to assess objective sleep alterations. Results: A total of 72 (46 F, 26 M), 8.3% of the total patients reporting to our center, were diagnosed with RLS. Among women, 17% had symptoms onset in pregnancy and 17% during menopause. No significant gender differences were found as far as age of onset, BMI, duration or severity of symptoms, ESS, objective PSP findings. However, a positive familial history with earlier onset was 7 fold higher in females versus males. All comorbid disorders were more represented in females with a significantly higher ratio of anxiety and mood disorders, migraines, diabetes, and sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). RLS secondary to iron deficiency (mean ferritin 7.9 μg/dl) was a specific F finding (32%). PSQI, BDI and HAM-A scores were significantly more affected in F. Response to dopaminergic treatment was stronger in M. Conclusions: Gender severely affected symptoms, familial versus sporadic occurrence, comorbid disorder distribution and treatment response in our sample.

N2  - Introduction: extremely premature infants show adrenal insufficiency in early post natal life. Cortisol plays a key role in normal gestation for maturation and adaptation of fetal organs in preparation for birth. Patients: the eligible infants were randomized and blinded to receive either placebo or hydrocortisone sodium succinate 1 mg/kg body weight/ day intravenously in two divided dose for 14 days. Blood sampling for cortisol levels were performed prior to the first dose for measuring baseline cortisol levels. Blood samples were also collected on day 3, 4, or 5 and day 12, 13, or 14 before the first dose of hydrocortisone/placebo on that day. The sampling was then repeated at 4 time points after dosing. The time points for blood sampling followed pre-assigned, randomly generated schedule. Cortisol concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using NONMEM. Results: population typical values, together with the interindividual variability (expressed as coefficient of variation) were as follows : clearance (Cl), 0.0627 L/h/kg (32%); volume of distribution (V), 0.201 L/kg (45%); baseline cortisol concentration (BAS), 204 nmol/ L (37%). The half-life alimination was 2.19 hours. An additive residual unexplained variability (RUV), expresses as the standard deviation (SD), was 128 nmol/L. Conclusion: there was no discernible biological rhythm over 24 hours with respect to cortisol concentrations in these infants. The results of this study have increased knowledge of the pharmacokinetic disposition of this drug and have potential for improving its use in premature infants.

N2  - Purpose: Mandibular retrognathia may cause upper airway obstruction in the pediatric patient due to tongue collapse and physical obstruction in the hypopharyngeal region. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. Patients and Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. Results: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. Conclusion: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth. © 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

N2  - Introduction: Women are the most consumers of medicinal natural products. They use them for typical women disorders (menopausal symptoms and menstrual disturbances) and eventually for pregnancy and lactation problems. We propose a survey on their use by sicilian women. Methods: Data on use of natural medicinal products (such as food supplements, herbal medicines, omeopathics) and synthetic drugs in either gender diseases or not are collected through interview by 1000 north east sicilian women aging 15-85 years. To get information about use of drugs and medicinal natural products a questionnaire is administered in ten different consulting health units for women. A second way of acting is through phone interviews. Obtained data are collected in a data-base, and successively statistically analyzed; data on undesired reactions are also collected. Preliminary results: About one third of the interviews (314) were collected and they show that principally synthetic drugs is used by 74.5%; principally natural medicinal products by 14.5%; we had no answer by the remaining group of women. Natural products use increases with the age with maximum use starting from 40 years of age women and beyond. The major part of women use them without knowledge of their side effects. The indications most cited are menopause, water retention, stipsis, sleep disturbances, venous insufficiency. Conclusions: Use of medicinal natural products by women of our region is increased but safety data (warnings, side effects and contraindications) are still poorly known by consumers.

N2  - Introduction: Circulatory failure causes significant mortality and morbidity in newborn infants. Improvements in clinical circulatory care are limited by the paucity of accurate biomarker outcome measures for clinical trials. Purpose: To develop and validate cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques to assess ventricular function and systemic perfusion in preterm and term newborns, and to compare techniques to existing echocardiographic methods. Methods: All scans were performed with a Philips 3-Tesla MR scanner. Infants were fed and allowed to fall into natural sleep without the use of sedation or anesthesia. Infants were laid in a custom made cradle, with ear protection and routine monitoring. A Flex-M surface receiver coil was placed on the chest wall. No respiratory compensation techniques were used. Acquisition parameters for phase contrast (PC) and balanced fast field echo (bFFE) imaging were optimised. PC assessments of flow were performed immediately distal to the aortic and pulmonary valves, as well as in the superior vena cava (SVC) and descending aorta (DAo). External validation of phase contrast measures was performed with a flow phantom. bFFE sequences were applied for 2 chamber, 4 chamber and short axis views. A short axis stack of 5-7 slices covered the left ventricle from base to apex. Left (LVO) and right (RVO) ventricular output were assessed using CMR Tools processing software. Echocardiographic measurements of LVO were performed within 24 hours of MR imaging. Results: 108 newborn infants with median birth weight 1627 (580-4140) grams, gestation 32 (25-42) weeks were studied. Mean (SD) flow volumes in 28 stable infants were LVO 222 (46), RVO 219 (47), SVC 95 (27) and DAo 126 (32) ml.kg-1.min-1, with flow being higher at lower gestational age. Limits of agreement (LOA) for repeated PC assessment of flow were LVO ± 50.2, RVO ± 55.5, SVC ± 20.9 and DAo ± 26.2 ml.kg-1. min-1. Phase contrast quantification of flow in an external phantom was highly correlated with actual measured flow (r2 = 0.995). Mean (SD) LVO in 75 stable infants by bFFE was 245 (47) ml.kg-1.min-1, LOA for cine assessment of LVO were ± 58.3 ml.kg-1.min-1. LOA for repeated echocardiographic assessment of LVO were ± 108.9 ml.kg-1.min-1. Conclusion: Detailed CMR assessments of cardiac function and systemic perfusion are feasible in newborn infants, and provide more complete data and with greater accuracy than existing echocardiographic methods.

N2  - The objectives were to describe the association between body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), body composition and risk factors to metabolic diseases; observe the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and list the characteristics of overweight and obese women. Voluntaries (n=50; BMI=31±6; age=36±11 years old), were evaluated regarding clinical examination, anthropometrics measurements, samples of blood and urine, resting energy expenditure and food register. Phases in which they become obese in descending order: adulthood, pregnancy, adolescence, over 40 years old and after marriage. The odds to have one or more obese family members were 316%. They were anxious (60%), depressives (12%), compulsives (34%) and had sleep disturbance (32%). The odds to dyslipidemia was 28%, to hypertension was 25% and to glucose over 100 mg/dL 35%. They were in caloric deficit, but, nitrogen balance was positive. The metabolic syndrome was present in 25% of these women and was positively correlated with body fat indicators and age. The obesity of these women seems to be multifactorial with a family influence that could be caused by genetics and environment contributions. The emotional/physical balance should be influenced on this process.

N2  - Study Objectives: Recent evidence has suggested that low socioeconomic status (SES), race, prematurity, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with childhood sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We investigated (1) the association of SDB with a wide range of risk factors, including prenatal and perinatal complications; (2) the association of these complications with SES and race; and (3) the association of SDB with developmental milestones. Methods: Six hundred thirteen school-aged children (105 clinically referred and 508 community control subjects) underwent overnight polysomnography and had a complete history and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB to population-based control children without SDB from The Penn State Children's Cohort. Results: Maternal smoking during pregnancy; maternal age and weight gain during pregnancy; prenatal complications, such as maternal high blood pressure and gestational diabetes; perinatal complications related to prematurity; delayed motor milestones; race and SES were significantly associated with the presence of childhood SDB. Most of the risk factors became nonsignificant when analyses controlled for race and SES. Delayed motor milestones remained significantly associated with SDB after controlling for race and SES. Conclusion: These data suggest that there is a significant association between children who experience prenatal or perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe childhood SDB. SES and race may be mediating the impact on SDB through increased prenatal and perinatal risks. The significant delay in motor milestones suggests that prenatal and perinatal distress may result in neurologic insult, which could influence the development of SDB in later childhood.
